5|$|By the 19th century, the Spanish Crown {{had lost}} most of its {{possessions}} in the Americas. Two of its remaining possessions were Puerto Rico and Cuba, {{both of which were}} demanding more autonomy and had pro-independence movements. The Spanish Crown issued the <b>Royal</b> <b>Decree</b> of Graces (Real Cédula de Gracias) which was originated August 10, 1815, with the intention of attracting European settlers who were not of Spanish origin to the islands.|$|E

25|$|<b>Royal</b> <b>decrees</b> are {{the other}} main source of law; but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the Sharia. <b>Royal</b> <b>decrees</b> supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant. Extra-Sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific <b>royal</b> <b>decrees.</b> Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.|$|R

The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector. The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E

5|$|According to a <b>royal</b> <b>decree</b> of 1428, Louis I {{had also}} ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in disaster for the Christian forces in 1396.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by <b>royal</b> <b>decree,</b> and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; thus {{a vast number of}} the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a <b>royal</b> <b>decree</b> in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E

5|$|On May 5, 1888, {{a second}} <b>royal</b> <b>decree</b> was issue, officializing the {{creation}} of the Banco Español de Puerto Rico, which received a charter validity of 25 years. This grant of authority was awarded to Enrique Vijande y Loredo, José Caldas y Caldas and Pablo Ubarri, the members composing this partnership. The bank wasn't established immediately, this was because the currency being used in Puerto Rico was Mexican silver, which created problems and delayed the establishment date until early 1890. Until this point, the Sociedad Anónima de Crédito Mercantil de Puerto Rico continued in service, before disappearing in April.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia is an {{absolute}} monarchy, and has no legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by <b>royal</b> <b>decree.</b> The Basic Law outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E

In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent <b>royal</b> <b>decree</b> by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a similar}} {{opposition}} during the 1799 election of {{delegates to the}} Buenos Aires Cabildo: Castelli was elected as third Regidor, but was rejected by merchants associated with the port of Cádiz. The conflict lasted a year, until the prominent local merchant Cornelio Saavedra wrote a memorandum recommending Castelli. Viceroy Avilés finally confirmed him in office by <b>royal</b> <b>decree,</b> in May 1800. Castelli, however, rejected the post because of his high workload in the Consulate. This {{was seen as an}} insult by peninsular merchants such as Martín de Álzaga, who was influential in the Cabildo.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also {{followers of the}} Cao Đài faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within {{the first few years}} of its founding, but a <b>royal</b> <b>decree</b> which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E
5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a <b>Royal</b> <b>decree,</b> approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E

5|$|The bishop {{served as}} the judge in a dispute in 1158 between a dean from the diocese of York and a citizen of Scarborough, in which the layman alleged that the dean had extorted {{large sums of money}} from him by {{repeatedly}} charging his wife with adultery and fining her. The dean's actions were contrary to a <b>royal</b> <b>decree,</b> but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{national}} arms (stora riksvapnet) {{originated in}} 1448 and has remained unchanged in Swedish law since 1943.

5|$|With a {{force of}} only 197 men, 168 of whom were inexperienced militia, it was highly {{probable}} that the opposing British and Indian combined force of 1,000 would overwhelm the Fort San Carlos.

Valle sent his two sons and 151 well-trained and equipped French militiamen and thus tipped the scale in favor of the defenders.
