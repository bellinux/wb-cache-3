5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to {{the bar at the}} Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> editors.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the Eisenhower {{administration}} became frustrated with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> loss of their cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development {{in an attempt to}} shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E

25|$|In late 1944 {{and early}} 1945, the Poles {{on the one}} hand tended to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and {{communism}} and feared Poland's becoming a Soviet dependency, while on the other the leftist viewpoints were increasingly popular among the population. There was little support for a continuation of the prewar policies.|$|E
25|$|Around 1454, when Richard {{began to}} <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (a first cousin of his wife), Cecily spoke with Queen consort Margaret of Anjou on his behalf.

25|$|However, the Swedes {{began to}} <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> {{monopoly}} trading {{position of the}} Hansa (mostly German citizens) and to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he {{was regarded as a}} hero to the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustave would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop and freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class. This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland were the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system.|$|E

25|$|However, {{efforts to}} develop {{commercial}} agriculture met with limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed as seasonal workers in the more-established sugar industries of Cuba and the Dominican Republic. An estimated 30,000-40,000 Haitian laborers, known in Cuba as braceros, went annually to the Oriente Province between 1913 and 1931. Many Haitians continued to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> loss of sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The {{new century}} brought some major {{changes to the}} village, {{starting}} with its name. In 1901 it formally changed its name from Sing Sing to Ossining to distance itself from the prison. Residents had come to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> prison industries' competitive advantages and the prison itself was now associated with the electric chair. Sparta, long bypassed by the region's major transportation arteries, was finally annexed by the village in 1906.|$|E

25|$|Pepper {{also learned}} from his days trying many cases for the Union Traction Company (Philadelphia's {{streetcar}} purveyor) that perjury is plentiful but Philadelphia's jurists, while disposed to favor plaintiffs, were nonetheless quick to detect fraud and prompt to condemn it. He also found jurors sympathetic {{to anyone who has}} acted under provocation, and apt to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the provocateur, and proudly recounted a cross-examination he had made before Judge Mayer Sulzberger.|$|E

25|$|Edward the Second is an English history {{play about}} the {{deposition}} of King Edward II by his barons and the Queen, who <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> undue influence the king's favourites have {{in court and}} state affairs. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death. The full title of the earliest extant edition, of 1594, is The troublesome reigne and lamentable death of Edward the second, King of England, with the tragicall fall of proud Mortimer.|$|E

25|$|The radical land reforms {{advocated}} by Kočić only came to fruition after World War I, following {{the collapse of}} Austria-Hungary {{and the creation of}} the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). According to the historian Marko Attila Hoare, this caused the Muslim landowning class to further <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian Serb peasantry {{and was one of the}} contributing factors behind the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Serbs by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, he {{was arrested}} in a case of theft of {{government}} property. AVEKS-Komi sent a train containing 55 cisterns (tankers) of diesel fuel, worth Р3.8million (Roubles), from the Ukhta Oil Refinery (Case No. 79067 for the large-scale theft of state property); Abramovich met the train in Moscow and <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> shipment to the Kaliningrad military base under a fake agreement, but the fuel arrived in Riga. Abramovich cooperated with the investigation, and the charges were dropped after the oil production factory was compensated by the diesel's buyer, the Latvian-U.S. concern Chikora International.|$|E
25|$|As Nilsen progressed into adolescence, {{he found}} life in Strichen {{increasingly}} stifling, with limited entertainment amenities or career opportunities. Although he respected his parents' {{efforts to provide}} and care for their children, he began to <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> fact that his family was poorer than most of his peers, {{with his mother and}} stepfather making no effort to better their lifestyles; thus, Nilsen seldom invited his few friends to the family home. At the age of 14, he joined the Army Cadet Force, and later recalled his viewing the British Army as a potential avenue for escaping his rural origins.|$|E

25|$|Pedicabs are {{a common}} form of {{transport}} for weekend revellers, with the number operating in Edinburgh growing from only 2 in 2000 to 60 by 2008. This {{has led to a}} growing number of complaints from taxi cab drivers, who <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> competition. In one dispute, a pedicab cyclist was reported to have been attacked by a group of three taxi drivers, who kicked and headbutted him. In other cases, taxi drivers have thrown cigarette butts at pedicab cyclists, and in one case, threatened a cyclist with a Taser stun gun (possession of such a device is illegal in Scotland).|$|E
25|$|Pubs {{within a}} chain will usually have items in common, such as fittings, promotions, {{ambience}} {{and range of}} food and drink on offer. A pub chain will position itself in the marketplace for a target audience. One company may run several pub chains aimed at different segments of the market. Pubs {{for use in a}} chain are bought and sold in large units, often from regional breweries which are then closed down. Newly acquired pubs are often renamed by the new owners, and many people <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> loss of traditional names, especially if their favourite regional beer disappears at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, the reborn Polish state {{began the}} process of {{economic}} recovery and some Poles tried to return. Since all the ills of life in Poland could be blamed on foreign occupation, the migrants did not <b>resent</b> <b>the</b> Polish upper classes. Their relation with the mother country was generally more positive than among migrants of other European countries. It is estimated that 30% of the Polish emigrants from lands occupied by the Russian Empire returned home. The return rate for non-Jews was closer to 50–60%. More than two-thirds of emigrants from Polish Galicia (freed from under the Austrian occupation) also returned.|$|E
