5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry <b>retro-reflective</b> designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of <b>retro-reflective</b> device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to <b>retro-reflective</b> markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} wildly {{speculative}} paranormal explanations {{have been proposed}} to explain the origin of Spring-heeled Jack, including {{that he was an}} extraterrestrial entity with a non-human appearance and features (e.g., <b>retro-reflective</b> red eyes, or phosphorus breath) and a superhuman agility deriving from life on a high-gravity world, with his jumping ability and strange behaviour, and that he was a demon, accidentally or purposefully summoned into this world by practitioners of the occult, or who made himself manifest simply to create spiritual turmoil.|$|E
25|$|This {{pioneering}} setup {{gave way}} in 1958 {{to a system}} called 'GuideMatic' in reference to GM's Guide lighting division. The GuideMatic had a more compact dashtop housing and a control knob that allowed the driver to adjust the system's sensitivity threshold to determine when the headlamps would be dipped from high to low beam {{in response to an}} oncoming vehicle. By the early 1970s, this option was withdrawn from all GM models except Cadillac, on which GuideMatic was available through 1988. The photosensor for this system used an amber lens, and the adoption of <b>retro-reflective</b> yellow road signs, such as for oncoming curves, caused them to dim prematurely - possibly leading to their discontinuation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Retro-{{reflective}}</b> materials, in {{the form}} of fixed reflectors, reflective tape, and reflective clothing, are useful in making a cyclist visible to other road users. [...] Reflective materials can be applied to bike, rider, or luggage; also, tires are available with reflective sidewalls. Reflectives are visible only when in the beam of a headlight, and even then only within a narrow locus. [...] Importantly, they do nothing to light up the road. Reflectors are not a substitute for lights, but are an important supplement to portable lighting.|$|E
2500|$|Many jurisdictions require {{bicycles}} to {{be fitted}} with reflectors at point of sale. In the United States this is {{regulated by the}} Consumer Product Safety Commission. [...] CPSC compliant reflectors (also commonly fitted in other markets) have three <b>retro-reflective</b> panels positioned at 30° angles. [...] The standard requires a forward-facing white reflector {{on the front of}} the bicycle, sideways-facing white reflectors on each wheel, a red reflector mounted on the rear, and yellow reflectors mounted on the front and back of each pedal. Some interpret this as an endorsement of reflector-only night cycling.|$|E
2500|$|Vehicles {{running on}} autogas or {{compressed}} natural gas must have a metal diamond with a white lettering LPG on a <b>retro-reflective</b> red background or metal disc with white lettering CNG on red background. The tag must be mechanically fixed (and is usually riveted) onto both of the registration plates. If multiple gas tanks are fitted to vehicle, multiple tags are required – one tag for each tank installed. Subsequently, vehicle manufacturers who manufacture cars with LPG as standard fitting, provide LPG stickers already stuck to the vehicle's registration plate areas, and some state and territory registration authorities also are producing plastic [...] "flat" [...] printed registration plates, and therefore need to provide LPG stickers to avoid damage to the plates if drilled for pop rivets.|$|E

50|$|A {{photoelectric}} sensor, or photo eye, is {{an equipment}} used {{to discover the}} distance, absence, or presence of an object by using a light transmitter, often infrared, and a photoelectric receiver.
