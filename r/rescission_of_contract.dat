40|$|This Chapter has the {{objective}} {{to consider the}} legal implications of negative economic trends under English contract law {{in the aftermath of}} the global Financial Crisis of 2007 ? 2008. Unlike other jurisdictions, most notably in civil law countries, the English position in the law governing a fundamental change in circumstances has remained narrow, that is, no relief will be granted unless it is an exceptional situation. The English courts deal with the issue either by the doctrine of frustration or through construing contractual force majeure provisions. Following the crisis, indeed there have been an increasing number of cases going down these avenues. Apart from relying on frustration or force majeure clause, another emerging phenomenon is that there has been a growth in allegations of misrepresentation and therefore requesting a <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> In either case, the aim of claimants is apparently trying to bring the contractual obligations to an end...|$|E
40|$|Contractual {{liability}} is {{an important}} topic of the ongoing reform of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations (2007 - 2009), which aims to harmonize the national legislation in this field with {{the laws of the}} European Union. In this paper the author analyzes the evolution of the traditional European civil codes (the German BGB, French Code civil, the Austrian ABGB the Swiss OR and the Hungarian Civil Code), with due attention to the doctrine and jurisprudence, taking into account the proposed reforms of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations concerning issues of contractual liability, such as the legal consequences of nonperformance, misperformance, default, etc. The author is of the opinion that the notion of the breach of contract doesn't cover all the cases in which contractual liability arises, although it embraces nonperformance, misperformance and default. The notion of contractual liability, namely, covers not only the cases of breach of contract, but the infringement of public policy, good morals and mandatory rules, which all lead to the nullity of the contract. In cases of voidable contracts (that is in case of defects of contractual will, such as mistake, deceit and duress) it is questionable whether the scope of contractual liability should be extended to mistake, which is a case of nonconscious discrepancy between contractual will and its expression. It is undisputable that contractual liability arises in case of deceit and duress, to the burden of the party acting in bad faith. The <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> entails a separate complex of legal issues, since it may be justified by the other party's breach of the contract. It can also be onesided, two-sided or by a mutual agreement. Furthermore, specific rules apply to <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> due to changed circumstances. In case of termination of a contract by mutual agreement, the parties usually agree on the extent of liability, that is on the extent of indemnification. Contractual liability is also specific that, according to the principle of parties' autonomy, the parties always may in advance agree on the extent of damages for the case of breach of contract, in a form of a clause on liquidated damages, forfeit money, suretyship for indemnification, the limitation of the sum insured in insurance contracts, clauses in the general conditions of business, etc. The author calls {{attention to the fact that}} these clauses in certain extent limit the scope of the indemnification for breach of a contract, according to which this liability differs from the liability for torts, where the principle of full indemnification applies as a rule...|$|E

Although the Malaysian government has enacted laws and formulated policies to govern the housing industry since it achieved Independence in 1957, abandoned housing projects still remains a recurrent problem until today.

Among the problems and grievances faced by the purchasers in abandoned housing projects in Malaysia, are [...] {{they are unable to}} obtain the duly completed houses as promised by the housing developers, they have to pay monthly installment payments on loan obtained from their lenders, they have to pay house rents {{and some of them are}} made bankrupt by their lender banks for failure to service the monthly installment payments. The purchasers also may face other non-pecuniary losses and sufferings, to their chagrin, such as dismissal from employment, divorces, troubles, anxiety, mental pressure, distress, personal problems leading to chaotic and miserable health and lives. There are certain legal and equitable remedies provided by the housing law particularly the I lousing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 and its regulations (Act 1 IS), the terms and conditions in the statutory sale and purchase agreements signed by the developers and the purchasers and the law emanated through case law in court. These legal and equitable remedies include specific performance, declaratory order, <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and damages. Nonetheless these remedies may not obtainable if the housing developers have no monetary at all or that they run away out of jurisdiction or that the abandoned housing projects are too complicated and troublesome. Further there are other grievances that cannot be compensated or dealt with by the Malaysian current laws such as pain, anxiety, distress and humiliation that have been befalling the aggrieved purchasers in abandoned housing projects.

This paper aims to highlight the rights of the purchasers in abandoned housing projects to obtain late delivery damages due to the delay of the vendor housing developers to complete the construction of the house buildings and deliver vacant possession within the prescribed period. The issue is: whether in abandoned housing projects, the purchasers can adequately also get late delivery damages due to the developer's delay to deliver vacant possession of the duly completed building within the prescribed time period? The research methodology that this paper will use is a mixture of legal research methodologi and social research methodology. In other words, this paper is socio-legal writing.

40|$|Sometimes {{a person}} may enter into a {{contract}} {{as a result of a}} statement made to him which is false. If the statement is a term of the contract he will have a remedy for breach of contract. If the statement is not a term of the contract it is called a mere misrepresentation, and the consequence is <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> A misrepresentation is an untrue statement of fact which is one of the causes which induces the contract. A misrepresentation is statement, or conduct, which conveys a false or wrong impression. A contract may be rescined on the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable ground for believing it to be true, as where an honest mistake is made. The types of misrepresentation are various. Acording to the Obligation Act it is not any misrepresentation cause the rescind of contract, but only the importance one. The importance misrepresentations are: the error in supstantia and error in personae if the contract is made bearing in mind intuit personae contract. This paper explanes different kinds of misrepresentation giving some proposal for legal interpretation of the provisions of the Obligation Act. The misrepresentation means an untrue statement of facts, made by one party to the other in the course of negotiating a contract, that induces the other party to enter into the contract. The person making the misrepresentation is called the representor, and the person whom it is made is the representee. A false of fraudulent misrepresentation is one made with knowledge of its falsehood, and intended to deceive. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation representor did not honestly believe in the truth of his statement, which is not the same as saying that he knew it to be false. A negligent misrepresentation is one made with no reasonable grounds for believing in to be true. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable grounds for believing in to the true, as where an honest mistake is made. A fraudulent misrepresentation is actionable as a tort. When a person has been induced to {{enter into a contract}} by misrepresentation, he may in general either (1) affirm the contract and insist of the misrepresentation being made good, if that is possible, or (2) rescind the contract if it is still executory, and if all parties can be restored to their original positions, or (3) bring an action for damages, or (4) rely upon the misrepresentation as a defense to an action on the contract. A contract may be rescinded of the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. Specific performance will not be decreed if a definite untrue representation has been relied on. It is clear that the claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation is a claim in tort. So the general governing rule is that the plaintiff should be restored to the position he would have been in if the representation had not been made.
