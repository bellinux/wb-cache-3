5|$|Following the 2010 General Election the new {{government}} scrapped the database {{as one of their}} measures 'to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under the Labour Government and <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> state intrusion.'

5|$|One of Hareide's last {{actions in}} office was {{to approve the}} {{construction}} of a hydroelectric power plant in the Hatteberg watershed in Kvinnherad, a protected natural area.

5|$|In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev {{organize}} the Secret Speech, which Khrushchev {{delivered to the}} 20th Party Congress, that denounced Stalin's personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> some of the stifling restrictions on nationalism and culture imposed during Stalin's time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in Yerevan, where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Heraclius had {{concentrated}} a large army at Antioch to <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> Syria. Khalid got {{the news}} from Roman prisoners in Northern Syria. After his past experiences Heraclius had been avoiding pitched battles with the Muslims. He planned to isolate the Muslim corps from each other, and separately encircle and destroy the Muslim armies. Five massive armies were launched in Syria from different routes in June 636 to recapture it.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing kickoff saw {{yet another}} Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball {{off of the}} kickoff, letting it <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> into the end zone. Frey {{recovered}} the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule {{it would have been}} a touchback and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back James Starks, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{distributed}} applications, a {{group of}} multiple ob- jects cooperates to achieve some objectives. The ob- jects may suffer from kinds of faults. If some object o is faulty, o is <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> to the checkpoint and ob- jects which have received messages from o are also required to be <b>rolled</b> <b>back.</b> In this paper, we define influential messages whose receivers are required to be <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> if the senders are <b>rolled</b> <b>back</b> in the object-based computation model. By using the in- fluential messages, an object-based checkpoint (O) is defined to denote a semantically consistent global state of the system while being inconsistent with the traditional message-based definition. We show that less O-checkpoints are taken than the message-based ones. ...|$|R

5|$|Knowing that {{he could}} not fight on without the support of the army, Jacobo Árbenz {{resigned}} on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Operation Leap2 {{began on}} 4 June with {{the advance of}} the HV 4thGuards Brigade. HVO troops took Crni Lug and the {{mountain}} pass en route to Bosansko Grahovo, the operation's chief objective. Its left flank, in the border area, was protected by the 3rdBattalion of the 126thHome Guard Regiment and the Tactical Sniper Company attached to the HV Split Corps. The VRS counterattacked on 6–7 June, trying to <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> the 4thGuards Brigade. The VRS push failed, as did its efforts to contain the advance with close air support and M-87 Orkan rockets. On 6 June (the same day as the VRS counterattack), {{the second phase of}} Operation Leap2 began. The 1stBattalion of the 1stGuards Brigade supported by the HV 264th Reconnaissance Sabotage Company and elements of the HV 1st HGZ advanced north from Livno, capturing the high ground near Glamoč and blocking the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road by 10 June. To pin down the VRS on the right flank of the attack, the HVO 2nd Guards Brigade attacked VRS positions on Golija Mountain south-west of Glamoč.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E
