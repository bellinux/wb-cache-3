500|$|The 59th Boat Race {{took place}} on 22 March 1902. [...] Held annually, the Boat Race is a {{side-by-side}} rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. [...] Although Oxford used swivel <b>rowlocks</b> {{for the first time}} in the history of the race, Cambridge won by five lengths in a time of 19 minutes 9 seconds. [...] The victory took the overall record to 3325 in Oxford's favour.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>rowlock</b> , {{sometimes}} spur (due to {{the similarity}} {{in shape and}} size), oarlock (USA) [...] or gate (Australia) is a brace that attaches an oar to a boat. When a boat is rowed, the <b>rowlock</b> acts as a fulcrum, and, in doing so, the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the <b>rowlock.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Rowlock</b> {{cavity wall}} was {{widely used in}} rural house in Southern Jiangsu Province from 1980 s to 1990 s. As one type of masonry structures, the seismic {{performance}} of <b>rowlock</b> cavity wall has rarely been studied on. Based on the report of General Seismic Investigation in Jiangsu Qidong, one 1 / 2 -scale <b>rowlock</b> cavity wall structure was modeled as the existing rural house, and was tested on shaking table in lab of Southeast University. After analyzing the failure state of the model, and examining the structural parameters such as natural frequency, damping ratio, floor acceleration, floor shift, strain and crack of the model in load condition of different earthquake wave and intensity, the seismic performance of <b>rowlock</b> wall structure was assessed. And the seismic capacity of the whole model and each piece of <b>rowlock</b> wall was also analyzed. Based on the mortar strength field inspected in model wall, the seismic capacity of model structure under the action of rarely occurred earthquake of level 6 seismic precautionary intensity was estimated. The result showed that the model structure would collapse under the load condition. Obviously, this can not satisfy the seismic precautionary requirement in Code for Seismic Design of Buildings (GB 50011 - 2001). Therefore, some principal reinforcement suggestions were discussed and proposed for existing <b>rowlock</b> cavity wall buildings. The research result of this paper could provide some theoretical foundation for the Aseismic Residential Project of rural peasant house, and also could be referred to for further research on <b>rowlock</b> cavity wall structures...|$|R

500|$|With a hard frost impeding Cambridge's {{practice}} in Ely, the crew relocated, {{at the invitation}} of Sir John Edwards-Moss, to Henley-on-Thames where parts of the river were clear of ice. [...] Oxford disregarded Felix Warre's latest boat in favour of the previous year's vessel, however with the inclusion of the recently patented [...] "swivel rowlock". [...] According to Oxford rower and author George Drinkwater (who rowed at bow for the Dark Blues in this race), the <b>rowlocks</b> [...] "were not altogether a success" [...] and stated that while Cambridge could [...] "row a faster stroke", the Dark Blues [...] "were very ponderous".|$|E
2500|$|The boat is {{a unique}} find that was {{measured}} at [...] by [...] and weighed [...] It had benches, <b>rowlocks,</b> two rows of nine oars and a paddle rudder for steering. It also included tools for grappling, three forks, a yardarm and a spear. The tools are of much lighter design than the ship's hull and are shown in the illustration. The boat suggests that the hoard was a votive deposit to the Celtic sea god Manannán mac Lir.|$|E
2500|$|The western river dory, though sharing {{features}} {{with sea}} dories, is adapted {{for a different}} place and purpose. [...] The key differentiating features are wider beam, more flare to prevent waves coming on board, and extensive built-in buoyancy/storage areas with water-resistant hatches to shed water and keep the boat afloat {{in the event of}} a capsize. [...] The first small flat bottomed dory run of note on the Colorado River was made by Ramon Montez and George Flavell on a 1896 river cruise from Green River, Wyoming, through the Grand Canyon to Temple Bar, Arizona. Western river dories have additional special features such as strong <b>rowlocks,</b> long oars, and long blade oars to operate in the highly aerated waters in rapids. In rapids the master rower faces down river to see the rock and or hydraulic obstacles. In a rapid the oars are often used to steer the boat as well as to propel it. The first documentation of this [...] "stern first" [...] technique in Grand Canyon was by George Flavell in 1896. Credit for the [...] "stern first" [...] technique is often given to Nathaniel Galloway who used it on his cruise through Grand Canyon a few months after the Flavell-Montez cruise.|$|E

5000|$|Rearward-facing systems:This is {{probably}} the oldest system used in Europe and North America. A seated rower pulls {{on one or two}} oars, which lever the boat through the water. The pivot point of the oars (attached solidly to the boat) is the fulcrum. The motive force is applied through the rower's feet.In traditional rowing craft, the pivot point of the oars is generally located on the boat's gunwale. The actual fitting that holds the oar may be as simple as one or two pegs (or thole pins) or a metal oarlock (also called <b>rowlock</b> - [...] "rollock"). In performance rowing craft, the <b>rowlock</b> is usually extended outboard on a [...] "rigger" [...] to allow the use of a longer oar for increased power.|$|R
