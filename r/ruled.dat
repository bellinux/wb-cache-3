5|$|According to Richard Hoggett, the {{practice}} of being <b>ruled</b> {{by more than one}} individual may have been a common occurrence in East Anglia as it was for the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Kent and Northumbria. Ecgric and Sigeberht may have simultaneously <b>ruled</b> the peoples known as the North-folk and South-folk, who lived in the parts of their kingdom that would later become the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, Carver notes that Ecgric may not have reigned jointly with Sigeberht, but could just have plausibly <b>ruled</b> as a sub-king or served as an administrator within a region under East Anglian hegemony, only rising as king of the East Angles after Sigeberht's abdication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Association <b>rule</b> {{algorithms}} often {{generate an}} excessive number of <b>rules,</b> {{many of which}} are not significant. It is difficult to determine which <b>rules</b> are more useful, interesting and important. We introduce a rough set based process by which a <b>rule</b> importance measure is calculated for association <b>rules</b> to select the most appropriate <b>rules.</b> We use ROSETTA software to generate multiple reducts. Apriori association <b>rule</b> algorithm is then applied to generate <b>rule</b> sets for each data set based on each reduct. Some <b>rules</b> are generated more frequently than the others among the total <b>rule</b> sets. We consider such <b>rules</b> as more important. We define <b>rule</b> importance as the frequency of an association <b>rule</b> among the <b>rule</b> sets. <b>Rule</b> importance is different from <b>rule</b> interestingness in that it does not consider the predefined knowledge on what kind of information is considered to be interesting.
