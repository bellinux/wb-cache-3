50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>rosoxacin</b> {{begins with a}} modified Hantzsch pyridine synthesis employing as component parts ammonium acetate, two equivalents of methyl propiolate, and one of 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. Oxidation of the resulting dihydropyridine (2) with nitric acid followed by saponification, decarboxylation, and reduction of the nitro group with iron and HCl acid gives aniline 3. This undergoes the classic sequence of Gould-Jacobs reaction with methoxymethylenemalonate ester to form the 4-hydroxyquinoline ring, and then alkylation with ethyl iodide and saponification of the ester to complete the {{synthesis of}} the antibacterial agent <b>rosoxacin</b> (4).|$|E

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} <b>rosoxacin,</b> a new quinoline antibacterial compound, was determined against the causative organisms of three sexually transmitted diseases. <b>Rosoxacin</b> demonstrated {{a high degree}} of activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinical isolates, with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 50 % of these being 0. 03 microgram/ml.

40|$|An open {{study was}} {{designed}} primarily to evaluate the efficacy of <b>rosoxacin</b> {{in the treatment of}} gonorrhoea caused by penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and non-PPNG strains. A total of 199 patients (99 men and 100 women) satisfactorily completed follow up examinations, 50 men and 50 women having received <b>rosoxacin</b> 300 mg orally and the remainder having received kanamycin 2 g intramuscularly. <b>Rosoxacin</b> achieved an overall cure rate of 94 % (96. 7 % for PPNG and 90 % for non-PPNG strains).

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the new antibacterial agent, <b>rosoxacin,</b> a quinoline derivative, with spectinomycin was made in women with uncomplicated cervical, urethral, pharyngeal, and rectal gonorrhoea. <b>Rosoxacin</b> was given in three oral regimens: 200 mg in a single dose, 300 mg in a single dose, and 300 mg in two doses of 150 mg four hours apart. All culture results 72 hours after administration were negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in all 81 women compared with 107 of 109 who received 2 g spectinomycin intramuscularly. Thirty-five of the women successfully treated with <b>rosoxacin</b> harboured penicillinase-producing strains of N gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and 46 non-penicillinase-producing (non-PPNG) strains. Fifty of the women treated with spectinomycin had PPNG strains and 59 non-PPNG strains.

Susceptibility to <b>rosoxacin</b> was determined for 6 pretreatment gonococcal isolates from these patients and for 194 stored clinical isolates; 296 (98. 7 %) of these 300 isolates, including 10 strains of penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhaeae, required a minimal inhibitory concentration of {{less than or equal}} to 0. 062 microgram/ml. Urethral or cervical infection with Chlamydia trachomatis coexisted with gonococcal infection in 14 (22 %) of 63 patients and persisted in 7 of 10 patients treated with <b>rosoxacin.</b> Postgonococcal urethritis developed in 11 (34 %) of 32 men who were monitored for 12 to 30 days.

40|$|One hundred {{seven men}} with Haemophilus ducreyi-positive {{chancroid}} {{were assigned to}} receive 300 mg of <b>rosoxacin</b> as a single dose or 150 mg twice daily for 3 days. Ulcers and buboes were followed clinically and bacteriologically for 1 month. Of 40 evaluable males on the 3 -day regimen, 38 (95 %) were cured, while only 14 of 23 (61 %) males on the single-dose regimen were cured; this regimen was discontinued. There was one ulcer relapse at day 21 in both groups; the one relapse in the single-dose group had a persistent culture-positive bubo. Eight of nine (89 %) buboes followed to the endpoint on the 3 -day <b>rosoxacin</b> regimen were cured, versus three of six (50 %) on the single-dose regimen. Adverse effects were mainly related to {{the central nervous system}} but were minor and did not require intervention. None of the treatment failures was due to organisms resistant to <b>rosoxacin,</b> and failure of the single-dose regimen presumably was related to duration of tissue levels rather than to drug resistance.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of the new spectinomycin analog U- 63366 and four new quinolone derivatives, <b>rosoxacin,</b> norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, were {{compared with those of}} penicillin, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and spectinomycin against 222 beta-lactamase-negative and 25 beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains.

40|$|In a {{controlled}} trial of <b>rosoxacin</b> {{in patients with}} non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), 150 mg of the antibiotic given twice daily for 10 days was compared with 300 mg triple tetracycline (Deteclo) given twice daily for the same period. Only six (19 %) of 31 patients treated with <b>rosoxacin</b> were free of urethritis after 10 days; Chlamydia trachomatis was reisolated from 12 (92 %) of 13 patients who were chlamydia positive originally, and Ureaplasma urealyticum was reisolated from 12 (80 %) of 15 patients who were ureaplasma positive originally. In contrast, 18 (58 %) of 31 patients treated with triple tetracycline were cured clinically after 10 days; C trachomatis was not reisolated from any of 10 patients who were chlamydia positive originally, and U urealyticum was reisolated from only three (17 %) of 18 patients who were ureaplasma positive originally. These results {{were consistent with the}} antimicrobial inactivity of <b>rosoxacin</b> in vitro and they cannot be reconciled with previous reports of successful use of this antibiotic in NGU. Ureaplasmas were isolated more frequently and in larger numbers from chlamydia negative than from chlamydia positive patients, but it is probable that ureaplasmas resistant to tetracycline were not responsible for persistent urethritis...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} norfloxacin, amifloxacin, cinoxacin, cipr{{ofloxacin}}, flumequine, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin (OFL), oxolinic acid, perfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and <b>rosoxacin</b> to inhibit the in vitro supercoiling activity of Micrococcus luteus DNA gyrase was {{compared with the}} ability of each drug to inhibit {{the growth of the}} M. luteus strain from which the gyrase was purified. The potency of the quinolones as DNA gyrase inhibitors did not always correlate with antimicrobial potency. For example, OFL was a less potent inhibitor of gyrase than <b>rosoxacin,</b> yet the MIC of OFL was 16 -fold lower than that of <b>rosoxacin.</b> Similarly, the MICs of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (the most potent of the antibiotics tested in these assays) were several hundredfold lower than the MIC of nalidixic acid (the least potent of these antibiotics), but the inhibition of purified gyrase by these two quinolones was only 8 - to 16 -fold lower than that of nalidixic acid. These results suggest that factors in addition to inhibition of gyrase supercoiling activity are important in determining the potency of these drugs. Further studies indicated that the uptake of norfloxacin, OFL, and amifloxacin by M. luteus cells may not account for the large differences in MICs observed for these drugs (MICs of 0. 8, 2. 0, and 128 micrograms/ml, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of metronidazole-resistant Trichomonas vaginalis {{and questions about}} the safety of metronidazole are significant concerns in treatment of trichomoniasis. At 24 h, a microtiter assay was used to test antimicrobial susceptibility of 16 recent isolates; the MICs of metronidazole ranged from less than 0. 06 to 25 micrograms/ml. Observable motility as an endpoint correlated imperfectly with survival as measured in pour plates. Quantitative pour plate cultures of six T. vaginalis isolates after timed exposures to antimicrobial drugs demonstrated exquisite sensitivity to metronidazole with minimal trichomonacidal concentrations of 0. 025 to 0. 100 micrograms/ml. Killing of some T. vaginalis isolates by clotrimazole and <b>rosoxacin</b> occurred only at concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the in vitro susceptibility of Legionella pneumophila ATCC 33152 (serogroup I) to 13 antibiotics alone and {{in combination with}} rifampin (0. 1 mg/liter) by three methods. Extracellular susceptibility was determined by MIC determinations and time kill curves in buffered yeast extract broth, while intracellular susceptibility was determined by peripheral human monocytes in RPMI 1640 culture medium. Antibiotic concentrations {{equal to or greater}} than the broth dilution MIC inhibited or killed L. pneumophila by the time kill method, except {{this was not the case}} for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antibiotic concentrations below the broth dilution MIC did not inhibit Legionella growth. The only antibiotic-rifampin combinations which produced improved killing of L. pneumophila by the time kill method were those in which the logarithmic growth of L. pneumophila occurred during the experiment (<b>rosoxacin,</b> amifloxacin, cinoxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and doxycycline). Neither direct MICs nor time kill curve assays accurately predicted intracellular L. pneumophila susceptibility. Rifampin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, <b>rosoxacin,</b> enoxacin, amifloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and doxycycline all inhibited intracellular L. pneumophila growth at readily achievable concentrations in serum. Cefoxitin and thienamycin showed no inhibition of growth, although they were present extracellularly at concentrations that were 20 to 1, 000 times their broth dilution MICs. Clindamycin was the only antibiotic that was able to inhibit intracellular L. pneumophila growth at an extracellular concentration below its MIC. The gentamicin (5 mg/liter) -rifampin combination was the only antibiotic-rifampin combination which demonstrated decreased cell-associated Legionella survival in this model of in vitro susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of the new spectinomycin analog U- 63366, the new macrolide roxithromycin (RU 28965), and five new quinolone derivatives (pefloxacin, <b>rosoxacin,</b> norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were studied against 23 multiresistant strains of Haemophilus ducreyi (beta-lactamase producers) isolated in Paris and were compared with the activities of tetracycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid. All strains were uniformly susceptible to the seven new antibiotics tested. Ciprofloxacin had the greatest inhibitory effect in vitro (the MIC for 90 % of the strains tested [MIC 90] was 0. 016 microgram/ml), and U- 63366 was the most active aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotic (MIC 90, 0. 25 microgram/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{isolates}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{obtained from}} patients attending clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa, were tested by a broth dilution technique for their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of benzyl penicillin G, ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, spectinomycin, rosaramicin, chloramphenicol, and <b>rosoxacin.</b> None of the isolates tested produced beta-lactamase. The MICs of penicillin ranged {{from less than}} or equal to 0. 007 to 0. 5 micrograms/ml.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether employing antibiograms {{is useful to}} separate Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, we determined the MICs of 12 antibiotics for 104 human clinical strains and 74 swine strains. Of 74 swine strains, 5 (7 %) were hippurate positive, as were 93 (89 %) of 104 human strains. The 12 antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, furazolidone, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, <b>rosoxacin,</b> rosaramicin, tetracycline, and Sch 32063. Isolates from humans were significantly (P less than 0. 001) more susceptible than swine strains to clindamycin, erythromycin, rosaramicin, and Sch 32063. Of 11 human hippurate-negative strains, 3 (27 %) were resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, rosaramicin, and Sch 32063, compared with 1 of 93 (1 %) hippurate-positive strains. Nearly all human and swine strains were susceptible to furazolidone and nalidixic acid. Campylobacter isolates from humans and swine have different antibiograms, and the susceptibility to certain antibiotics, such as clindamycin, may be helpful for differentiation of C. jejuni from C. coli...|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} spontaneous mutants from Escherichia coli K- 12 with low-level {{resistance to}} norfloxacin. These mutants were classified {{into the following}} three types {{on the basis of}} their properties: (i) NorA appeared to result for mutation in the gyrA locus for the A subunit of DNA gyrase; (ii) NorB showed low-level resistance to quinolones and other antimicrobial agents (e. g., cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline), and the norB gene was considered to map at about 34 min on the E. coli K- 12 chromosome; (iii) NorC was less susceptible to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was hypersusceptible to hydrophobic quinolones such as nalidixic acid and <b>rosoxacin,</b> hydrophobic antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. Susceptibility to bacteriophages and the hydrophobicity of the NorC cell surface also differed from that of the parent strain. The norC gene was located near the lac locus at 8 min on the E. coli K- 12 chromosome. Both NorB and NorC mutants had a lower rate of norfloxacin uptake, and it was found that the NorB mutant was altered in OmpF porin and that the NorC mutant was altered in both OmpF porin and apparently in the lipopolysaccharide structure of the outer membrane...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{strains of}} Haemophilus ducreyi {{isolated}} in Thailand from patients with chancroid were {{tested by the}} agar dilution method against 10 antimicrobial agents and typed by outer membrane protein pattern by using sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. All strains produced beta-lactamase and were resistant to tetracycline, kanamycin, and sulfonamides. Most had a decreased susceptibility to trimethoprim (MIC for 50 % of the strains [MIC 50], 0. 5 micrograms/ml) and chloramphenicol (MIC 50, 8 micrograms/ml). Strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC 90, 0. 001 micrograms/ml), ceftriaxone (MIC 50, 0. 0015 micrograms/ml), erythromycin (MIC 50, 0. 015 micrograms/ml), <b>rosoxacin</b> (MIC 50, 0. 03 micrograms/ml), and spectinomycin (MIC 50, 8 micrograms/ml). The degree of antimicrobial resistance found in Thailand is higher than that reported for H. ducreyi isolated in other regions. Five different outer membrane protein patterns were found by analyzing proteins {{in the range of}} 29 to 61 kilodaltons, but 98 % of the Thai strains fell into three patterns which did not differ greatly.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{resistance of}} genital mycoplasmas to tetracycline poses {{a problem because}} tetracycline {{is one of the}} few antimicrobial agents active against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydiae, gonococci, and other agents of genitourinary-tract disease. Since the quinolones are a promising group of antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of M. hominis and U. urealyticum to the newer 6 -fluoroquinolones were determined by the agar dilution method. Ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, and ofloxacin had good activity against M. hominis, with the MIC for 50 % of isolates tested (MIC 50) being 1 microgram/ml. Fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, pefloxacin, and <b>rosoxacin</b> had MIC 50 s of 2 micrograms/ml. Enoxacin, norfloxacin, and amifloxacin had MIC 50 s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml, and cinoxacin and nalidixic acid were inactive (MIC 50, greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml). Overall, the activities of 6 -fluoroquinolones for ureaplasmas were similar to those for M. hominis, with MICs being the same or twofold greater. The most active 6 -fluoroquinolones against ureaplasmas were difloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin, with MIC 50 s of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was unusual in that the MIC 50 for M. hominis was 1 microgram/ml, whereas the MIC 50 for ureaplasmas was 8 micrograms/ml.

40|$|A {{selective}} {{spectrophotometric method}} for {{the determination of}} <b>rosoxacin</b> (ROS), a 4 -quinolone antimicrobial agent, has been developed and validated. The method {{was based on the}} reaction of ROS with alkaline sodium nitroprusside (SNP) reagent at room temperature forming a red colored chromogen measured at 455 nm. The conditions affecting the reaction (SNP concentration, pH, color-developing time, temperature, diluting solvent and chromogen stability time) were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, good linear relationship (r= 0. 9987) was obtained between the absorbance and the concentration of ROS in the range of 20 - 50 microg ml(- 1). The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 2. 5 and 8. 4 microg ml(- 1), respectively. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of bulk drug and laboratory-prepared tablets; the mean percentage recoveries were 100. 1 +/- 0. 33 and 101. 24 +/- 1. 28 %, respectively. The results were compared favourably with those obtained by the reported method; {{no significant difference in the}} accuracy and precision as revealed by the accepted values of t- and F-tests, respectively. The robustness and ruggedness of the method was checked and satisfactory results were obtained. The proposed method was found to be highly selective for ROS among the fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
