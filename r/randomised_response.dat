40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} economic issues surrounding corruption at the firm-level in Nigeria {{with a specific}} focus on bribery. This involves {{an analysis of the}} paying and reporting of bribes by firm managers in Nigeria. The first chapter uses data from two business surveys to explain the determinants of the incidence of bribery and the magnitude of bribes, respectively. A two-stage analysis is conducted to test for the independence of the processes determining the incidence and the magnitude of bribery. The results show that the propensity to bribe is determined by required meetings with public officials while the size of bribe is driven by firm profitability indicators. The second chapter tests the reliability of methods used to ask individuals sensitive questions on different forms of business malpractice. Indirect methods are tested against the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> method. The indirect method protects the managers from stigmatisation by asking them about the behaviour of an agent representative of themselves; the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> method asks the interviewee to base their response on the result of a private coin-toss. The results show that the indirect method produces higher and more plausible estimates of wrongdoing than the andomised response method. The third chapter investigates why the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> method sometimes fails in eliciting honest responses from sensitive questions despite assuring the managers of anonymity. The roles of trust in the interviewer and the probability of detection are considered along with other potential explanations. Results indicate that lack of trust and the fear of detection are associated with underreporting of sensitive acts. The final chapter examines the relationship between bribery and ethnic networks. The ethnicities of the managers and their local political representatives are used to measure ethnic networks. Results show that co-ethnic firm managers are less likely to pay a bribe than non co-ethnics. Also, there is a positive association between ethno-linguistic fractionalisation and bribery which, in fractionalised areas, eradicates the negative effect of co-ethnicity on bribery...|$|E

40|$|THE {{purpose of}} this class {{exercise}} is (a) to reinforce the student’s grasp of tree diagrams, probability calculations, etc., and (b) to mention a topic of considerable practical importance, the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> technique. It comes from Hutchinson (1993). Suppose I wish to determine what {{proportion of the population}} drive faster than the speed limit, fail to pay taxes, go to church on Sunday, etc. I am not the least bit interested in whether a specific individual drives faster than the speed limit, but I do want to get an honest overall estimate for the whole population- and people are often not honest when answering questions like these. The <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> method can be used here. It relies upon the respondent knowing that the interviewer does not know whether the respondent is answering the sensitive question, or is answering a perfectly harmless question. An example suitable for class use is the following. • Spin a coin twice. Show no-one the results. • If the first spin resulted in a head, answer the question marked H. If the first spin resulted in a tail, answer the question marked T. H: Outside of class, do you study for at least 15 hours per week? T: Did the second spin of the coin result in a tail? Let p be the proportion of students who study for at least 15 hours per week outside of class. The tree diagram can be drawn, and used to find that the proportion answering “yes” is...|$|E

40|$|Rules restricting {{resource}} use are ubiquitous to conservation. Recent increases in poaching of iconic {{species such as}} African elephant and rhino have triggered high-profile interest in enforcement. Previous studies have used economic models to explore how the probability and severity of sanctions influence poacher-behaviour. Yet despite evidence that compliance can be substantial when the threat of state-imposed sanctions is low and profits high, few have explored other factors deterring rule-breaking. We use the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> technique (RRT) and direct questions to estimate the proportion of rural residents in north-western Taiwan illegally killing wildlife. We then model how potential sources of deterrence: perceived probabilities of detection and punishment, social norms and self-imposed guilt, relate to non-compliant behaviour (reported via RRT). The perceived likelihood of being punished and two types of social norms (injunctive and descriptive) predict behaviour and deter rule-breaking.

40|$|Many {{approaches}} to conserving and managing natural resources depend upon rules, but {{the existence of}} rules alone does not guarantee compliance. Information on rule breaking behaviour is needed for designing interventions to improve compliance. However, directly investigating rule breaking is difficult as perpetrators may not wish to identify themselves. Other disciplines have developed methods for answering sensitive questions but so far these have not been widely applied in conservation. Using rule breaking among fly fishers as a case study, we tested two methods specifically designed for collecting sensitive data (the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> technique (RRT) and the nominative technique), against a conventional self-complete questionnaire. RRT resulted in much higher estimates of the prevalence of rule breaking than the self-complete questionnaire, particularly for more sensitive questions. The nominative technique yielded extremely low estimates, possibly because respondents did not know enough about their friends’ rule breaking behaviour, or {{did not want to}} discuss it in a face-to-face interview. Despite requiring large sample sizes we suggest that RRT is a useful method for obtaining information about rule breaking and could be more widely used, for example in studies of poaching and illegal resource extraction...|$|E
40|$|Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) {{has proved}} to be a highly {{valuable}} tool in a range of screening methods. We present in this work the design and use of a novel yeast effector–reporter system for selection of sequences recognised by DNA-binding proteins in vivo.

A galactose-inducible effector allows discrimination between reporter activation caused by the protein under study and activation due to endogenous factors. The system mimics the physiological gene dosage relationship between transcription factor and target genes in vivo by using a low copy effector plasmid and a high copy reporter plasmid, favouring sequence selectivity. The utility of the novel yeast screening system was demonstrated by using it to refine the definition of an optimal recognition element for the c-Myb transcription factor (MRE).

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of the dynamical behaviour of mechanical structures the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) are most commonly used. However, the first approach is limited to applications in the low-frequency range due to its computational load and its deterministic character. The SEA has a much lower computational load but is only applicable at high frequencies due to its underlying assumptions. In-between the low- and high-frequency ranges there is a relatively wide mid-frequency-range, for which neither FEM nor SEA is applicable. Recently, the Wave Based Method (WBM) has been proposed for structural dynamic problems in the mid-frequency range. It is an indirect Trefftz-based technique in that it approximates the dynamic response variables by a function series expansion of exact solutions of the governing differential equation. Previous validations have shown its superior convergence and reduced calculation times as compared to the FEM. Although the method increases the attainable frequency range, it is still a deterministic technique. Non-determinism (variability and uncertainty), however, cannot be ignored in the mid-frequency range and should be accounted for in a sensible way. It has been shown previously that when there is enough non-determinism in the dynamic properties of a system, the response statistics become insensitive to the source of non-determinism. Based on this principle, this paper compares several ways to <b>randomise</b> the <b>response</b> of a structural system by introducing random point mass distributions, random inclusions or random boundary conditions using the WBM. The intrinsic efficiency of the WBM and its capacity to include non-determinism in an efficient way enables the method to tackle problems up to the high-frequency range. A numerical example validates the applicability of the proposed method. The mean response, the outer bounds of the ensemble and the calculation efficiency of the different approaches are compared and discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

It {{is not known}} whether or to what extent SDM contributes to the welfare arising from a consultation, and how important this contribution is relative to other attributes of a consultation. AIM: To identify patient preferences for SDM relative to other utility bearing attributes of a consultation. DESIGN OF STUDY: In parallel with a randomised trial in training GPs in SDM competencies and risk communication skills, a discrete choice experiment exercise was conducted to assess patients' utilities. SETTING: Twenty general practices in South Wales, UK. METHOD: Five hundred and eighty-four responders from 747 patients attending the <b>randomised</b> trial (<b>response</b> rate = 78 %). All patients had one of four conditions (atrial fibrillation, menorrhagia, menopausal symptoms or prostatism) and attended a consultation with a doctor in their own practice. Patients were randomised to attend a consultation either with a doctor who had received no training in the study or risk communication training alone or SDM training alone, or both combined. RESULTS: Five key utility bearing attributes of a consultation were identified. All significantly influenced patient's choice of preferred consultation style (P< 0. 001). Larger increases in utility were associated with changes on "doctor listens" attribute, followed by easily understood information, a shared treatment decision, more information and longer consultation. Utilities were influenced by whether the doctor had received risk communication training alone or SDM training alone, or both combined, prior to the consultations. The randomised trial itself had identified that the communication processes of these consultations changed significantly, with greater patient involvement in {{decision making}}, after the training interventions. CONCLUSION: Shared treatment decisions were valued less than some other attributes of a consultation. However, patient utilities for such involvement appeared responsive to changes in experiences of consultations. This suggests that SDM may gain greater value among patients once they have experienced it...|$|R

Several clinical trials {{have investigated the}} efficacy of treatment duration longer than 48 weeks, but yielded discordant results. METHODS: We performed a structured search of PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane library to identify randomised clinical trials in HCV genotype 1 patients who were treated either for 48 or 72 weeks. Sustained viral response (SVR) data were pooled and a sample size weighted pooled proportion was calculated. RESULTS: We identified five studies matching our criteria. Studies randomised at baseline (n= 1), at absence of rapid virological response (RVR) at week 4 (n= 1), at early virological response at week 12 (EVR) (n= 1) or at slow response at week 24 (n= 2). In the RCT that randomised at absence of RVR, SVR was significantly higher in the extended treatment arm (57 vs 42 %, p= 0. 02) with an RR of 1. 35 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 75). This tendency was also observed in the studies that <b>randomised</b> at slow <b>response</b> (44 vs 35 %), although no longer statistically significantly different.

Recently, non-randomised models {{have been shown to}} be an efficient and cost effective design when comparing with <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> models. However, sample size formulae for such non-randomised designs are not yet available. In this article, we derive sample size formulae for the non-randomised triangular design based on the power analysis approach. We first consider the one-sample problem. Power functions and their corresponding sample size formulae for the one- and two-sided tests based on the large-sample normal approximation are derived. The performance of the sample size formulae is evaluated in terms of (i) the accuracy of the power values based on the estimated sample sizes and (ii) the sample size ratio of the non-randomised triangular design and the design of direct questioning (DDQ). We also numerically compare the sample sizes required for the randomised Warner design with those required for the DDQ and the non-randomised triangular design. Theoretical justification is provided.

40|$|The {{trade in}} {{wildlife}} and keeping of exotic pets {{is subject to}} varying levels of national and international regulation and is a topic often attracting controversy. Reptiles are popular exotic pets and comprise a substantial component of the live animal trade. High mortality of traded animals raises welfare concerns, and also has implications for conservation if collection from the wild is required to meet demand. Mortality of reptiles can occur at any stage of the trade chain from collector to consumer. However, there is limited information on mortality rates of reptiles across trade chains, particularly amongst final consumers in the home. We investigated mortality rates of reptiles amongst consumers using a specialised technique for asking sensitive questions, additive <b>Randomised</b> <b>Response</b> Technique (aRRT), as well as direct questioning (DQ). Overall, 3. 6 % of snakes, chelonians and lizards died within one year of acquisition. Boas and pythons had the lowest reported mortality rates of 1. 9 % and chameleons had the highest at 28. 2 %. More than 97 % of snakes, 87 % of lizards and 69 % of chelonians acquired by respondents over five years were reported to be captive bred and results suggest that mortality rates may be lowest for captive bred individuals. Estimates of mortality from aRRT and DQ {{did not differ significantly}} which is in line with our findings that respondents did not find questions about reptile mortality to be sensitive.

Unresectable stage III NSCLC patients received CDDP (60 mg/m 2), GEM (1 g/m 2, days 1 and 8) and VNR (25 mg/m 2, days 1 and 8) with reduced dosage of GEM and VNR during radiotherapy (66 Gy). Two cycles of CT with radiotherapy followed by two further cycles of CT alone were administered in arm A or the reverse sequence in arm B. The study was prematurely closed for poor accrual due to administrative problems. Forty-nine eligible patients were <b>randomised.</b> <b>Response</b> rates and median survival times were, respectively 57 % (95 % CI: 36 - 78 %) and 17 months (95 % CI: 9. 3 - 24. 6 months) in arm A and 79 % (95 % CI: 64 - 94 %) and 23. 9 months (95 % CI: 13. 3 - 34. 5 months) in arm B (p > 0. 05). Chemotherapy dose-intensity was significantly reduced in arm A. Grade 3 - 4 oesophagitis occurred in 5 patients. One case of grade 5 radiation pneumonitis was observed. In conclusion, chemoradiotherapy with CDDP, GEM and VNR appears feasible as initial treatment or after induction chemotherapy.

40|$|Low cost air {{pollution}} sensors have substantial potential for atmospheric research {{and for the}} applied control of pollution in the urban environment, including more localized warnings to the public. The current generation of single-chemical gas sensors experience degrees of interference from other co-pollutants and have sensitivity to environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and supply voltage. There are uncertainties introduced also because of sensor-to-sensor response variability, although this is less well reported. The sensitivity of Metal Oxide Sensors (MOS) to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) changed with relative humidity (RH) by up to a factor of five over the range 19 - 90 %RH and with an uncertainty in the correction of a factor two at any given RH. The short-term (second to minute) stabilities of MOS and electrochemical CO sensor responses were reasonable. During more extended use inter-sensor quantitative comparability was degraded due to unpredictable variability in individual sensor responses (to either measurand or interference or both) drifting over timescales of several hours to days. For timescales longer than a week identical sensors showed slow, often downwards, drifts in their responses which diverged across six CO sensors by up to 30 % after two weeks. The measurement derived from the median sensor within clusters of 6, 8 and up to 21 sensors was evaluated against individual sensor performance and external reference values. The clustered approach maintained the cost competitiveness of a sensor device, but the median concentration from the ensemble of sensor signals largely eliminated the <b>randomised</b> hour-to-day <b>response</b> drift seen in individual sensors and excluded the effects of small numbers of poorly performing sensors that drifted significantly over longer time periods. The results demonstrate that for individual sensors to be optimally comparable to one another, and to reference instruments, they would likely require frequent calibration. The use of a cluster median value eliminates unpredictable medium term response changes, and other longer term outlier behaviours, extending the likely period needed between calibration and making a linear interpolation between calibrations more appropriate. Through the use of sensor clusters rather than individual sensors existing low cost technologies could deliver significantly improved quality of observations...|$|R

40|$|Many {{conservation}} interventions aim {{to influence}} people’s behaviour. Success depends upon {{a proper understanding}} of what motivates behaviour. I begin by reviewing social psychological models of behaviour, discussing how social psychological predictors of behaviour have been studied within conservation. Many studies focus on general attitudes towards conservation, rather than attitudes towards specific behaviours impacting on conservation success, assuming general attitudes are a useful indicator of behaviour, despite mixed evidence. Interventions depending upon rules require information about the quantity of people, {{and the types of}} people, breaking rules. However, when the subject of investigation is sensitive because it is illegal or socially taboo, it is naive to expect that people will respond honestly to questions about rule breaking when asked directly. Specialised methods exist for investigating sensitive topics yet are rarely used within conservation. I provide evidence that the <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> technique (RRT) produces more accurate estimates of illicit behaviours compared to conventional surveys. Further, I show that RRT can be adapted to investigate how non-sensitive social psychological characteristics of respondents, such as their attitudes towards specific conservation-related behaviours, can be linked to their behaviour. This paves the way for using RRT to test the effectiveness of innocuous questions as proxy indicators for people’s involvement in illicit behaviours. There has been concern that sanctions for wildlife crimes do not reflect how serious crimes are in terms of illegal profits or the threat status of targeted species. Sanctions should reflect how serious a crime is, whilst being socially acceptable. I use conjoint analysis to understand public and professional opinions as to which aspects of wildlife crimes make them more or less serious, and so deserving of a greater or lesser sentence. Results highlight the gravity judiciaries place on illegal profits when setting sentences. Finally, to understand how sanctions relate to species threat status, I analyse 23 years of wildlife crime sanctioning from the United Kingdom providing evidence that sanction severity increases with threat status and corresponding legal protection.

40|$|Abstract Background An {{advantage}} of <b>randomised</b> <b>response</b> and non-randomised models investigating sensitive issues {{arises from the}} characteristic that individual answers about discriminating behaviour cannot {{be linked to the}} individuals. This study proposed a new fuzzy response model coined ' Single Sample Count ' (SSC) to estimate prevalence of discriminating or embarrassing behaviour in epidemiologic studies. Methods The SSC was tested and compared to the established Forced Response (FR) model estimating Mephedrone use. Estimations from both SSC and FR were then corroborated with qualitative hair screening data. Volunteers (n = 318, mean age = 22. 69 ± 5. 87, 59. 1 % male) in a rural area in north Wales and a metropolitan area in England completed a questionnaire containing the SSC and FR in alternating order, and four questions canvassing opinions and beliefs regarding Mephedrone. Hair samples were screened for Mephedrone using a qualitative Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry method. Results The SSC algorithm improves upon the existing item count techniques by utilizing known population distributions and embeds the sensitive question among four unrelated innocuous questions with binomial distribution. Respondents are only asked to indicate how many without revealing which ones are true. The two probability models yielded similar estimates with the FR being between 2. 6 % - 15. 0 %; whereas the new SSC ranged between 0 % - 10 %. The six positive hair samples indicated that the prevalence rate in the sample was at least 4 %. The close proximity of these estimates provides evidence to support the validity of the new SSC model. Using simulations, the recommended sample sizes as the function of the statistical power and expected prevalence rate were calculated. Conclusion The main advantages of the SSC over other indirect methods are: simple administration, completion and calculation, maximum use of the data and good face validity for all respondents. Owing to the key feature that respondents are not required to answer the sensitive question directly, coupled with the absence of forced response or obvious self-protective response strategy, the SSC has the potential to cut across self-protective barriers more effectively than other estimation models.

To develop, {{validate}} and use {{a procedure}} specific questionnaire to evaluate patient experience and satisfaction following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under either general (GA) or local anaesthesia (LA). Methods. Twenty post-CEA patients were interviewed. Data were content analysed and recurrent themes used to generate the specific carotid endarterectomy experience questionnaire (CEA-EQ). The CEA-EQ consists of 15 pre-op and 13 postoperative questions. Validity was established by correlation with the FRS Patient Satisfaction with Surgical Services (SSSQ) and State form of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) in 69 patients (35 LA, 34 GA). Subsequently 88 patients randomised to GA CEA and 88 to LA CEA received the CEA-EQ. A local anaesthetic intraoperative experience questionnaire (LA-EQ) was also developed and given to LA patients only. Results. Validity was confirmed through significant correlations with the STAI-S (r= 0. 67, p< 0. 001) and the SSSQ (r= 0. 44, p< 0. 001). In the <b>randomised</b> prospective study <b>response</b> rates were greater than 90 %. Overall experience and satisfaction with CEA was high. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in anxiety, satisfaction or overall experience between anaesthetic techniques. LA CEA was associated with a significantly better perception of recovery. The majority of LA patients found the procedure acceptable. Conclusions. The CEA-EQ is a valid tool to assess qualitative aspects of CEA patient care. Overall satisfaction and experience with CEA is good and not related to anaesthetic technique. LA CEA is not associated with any increased anxiety, is tolerated by the majority of patients and is associated with a better perception of recovery...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} a practical, hospital-based nurse-coordinated prevention programme on cardiovascular risk, integrated into the routine clinical care of patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome, as compared with usual care only. Design <b>RESPONSE</b> (<b>Randomised</b> Evaluation of Secondary Prevention by Outpatient Nurse SpEcialists) was a randomised clinical trial. Setting Multicentre trial in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings. Participants 754 patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome. Intervention A nurse-coordinated prevention programme, consisting of four outpatient nurse clinic visits, focusing on healthy lifestyles, biometric risk factors and medication adherence, in addition to usual care. Main outcome measures The main outcome was 10 -year cardiovascular mortality risk as estimated by Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation at 12  months follow-up. Secondary outcomes included Framingham Coronary Risk Score at 12  months, in addition to changes in individual risk factors. Risk factor control was classified as ‘poor’ if 0 to 3 factors were on target, ‘fair’ if 4 to 6 factors were on target, and ‘good’ if 7 to 9 were on target. Results The mean Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation at 12  months was 4. 4 per cent (SD 4. 5) in the intervention group and 5. 4 per cent (SD 6. 2) in the control group (p= 0. 021), representing a 17. 4 % relative risk reduction. At 12  months, risk factor control classified as ‘good’ was achieved in 35 % of patients in the intervention group compared with 25 % in the control group (p= 0. 003). Attendance to the nurse-coordinated prevention programme was 92 %. In the intervention group, 86 rehospitalisations were observed against 132 in the control group (relative risk reduction 34. 8 %, p= 0. 023). Conclusions The nurse-coordinated hospital-based prevention programme in addition to usual care is a practical, yet effective method for reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary disease. Our data suggest that the counselling component of the programme may lead to a reduction in hospital readmissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of doping in elite sports is relevant {{for all those}} involved in sports, particularly for evaluating anti-doping policy measures. Remarkably, few scientific articles have addressed this subject so far, and the last review dates back to 1997. As a consequence, the true {{prevalence of}} doping in elite sports is unknown. Even though {{it is virtually impossible}} to uncover the exact prevalence of a prohibited activity such as doping, various methods are available to uncover parts of this particular problem, which enables the circumvention (to a certain degree) of the issues of truthfulness, definition problems and the limits of pharmacological evidence. This review outlines the various methods that exist and presents the scarce data available in this area. It is concluded that a combination of questionnaires using the <b>Randomised</b> <b>Response</b> Technique and models of biological parameters is able to provide the statistical possibilities to reveal accurate estimates of this often undisclosed practice. Data gathered in this way yield an estimation of 14 – 39  % of current adult elite athletes who intentionally used doping. These period prevalences have been found in specific sub-groups of elite athletes, and the available data suggest that the prevalence of doping is considerably different between sub-groups with varying types of sport, levels and nationalities. The above-mentioned figure of 14 – 39  % is likely to be a more accurate reflection of the prevalence of intentional doping in elite sports than that provided by doping control test results (estimate of doping: 1 – 2  % annually) or questionnaire-based research (estimations between 1 and 70  % depending on sport, level and exact definitions of intent and doping). In the future, analytical science may play a more important role in this topic if it may become feasible to detect very low concentrations of prohibited substances in sewage systems downstream of major sporting events. However, it is clear that current doping control test results show a distinct underestimation of true doping prevalence. It does not seem feasible to distil better estimates of the prevalence of doping based on performance indicators or ego documents because of the various existing effects that influence athletic performance. Such information can only be used as extra information to augment the accuracy of prevalence rates that have been found by using other techniques. True doping prevalence studies have been scarce in elite sports so far. With the correct application of the available scientific methods, preferably using harmonised definitions of the terms ‘doping’ and ‘elite sports’, more information on this topic may be gathered in a relatively short time. This would assist anti-doping professionals in the future in order to evaluate the effects of possible anti-doping measures, and better anti-doping policies would serve athletes who compete without doping. The existing anti-doping measures seriously impact the lives of elite athletes and their immediate entourage, which imposes a moral burden to evaluate these measures in the best possible way...|$|E
