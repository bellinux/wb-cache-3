40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{considerable}} interests in geometric-based methods for image retrieval. These methods consider the image space as a smooth manifold and apply manifold learning techniques to find a Euclidean embedding. Thus, the Euclidean distances in the embedding space {{can be used as}} approximations to the geodesic distances on the manifold. A main advantage of these methods is that the <b>relevance</b> <b>feedbacks</b> during retrieval can be naturally incorporated into the system as prior information. In this paper, we consider the retrieval problem as a classification problem on manifold. Instead of learning a distance measure, we aim to learn a classification function on the image manifold. Considering efficiency is a key issue in image retrieval, especially on the Web scale, we propose a novel approach for image retrieval on manifold. This approach is based on a regularized linear regression framework. The local manifold structure and user-provided <b>relevance</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are incorporated into the image retrieval system through a Locality Preserving Regularizer. Extensive experiments are carried out on a large image database which demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

Uncertainties can occur due to changing document space {{as well as}} stochasticity and non-stationarity of the user. A new filtering model based on established techniques in information retrieval and artificial intelligence is proposed. These techniques include document representation by vector-space model, document classification by unsupervised learning, and user modeling by reinforcement learning.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised subspace learning algorithm for image retrieval. In relevance feedback-driven image retrieval system, the user-provided information can be used to better describe the intrinsic semantic relationships between images. Our algorithm is fundamentally based on LPP which can incorporate user’s <b>relevance</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> As the user’s feedbacks are accumulated, we can ultimately obtain a semantic subspace in which different semantic classes can be best separatedandthe retrieval performance can be enhanced.

30|$|The {{interaction}} of users with search services {{has been recognized}} as an important mechanism for expressing and handling user information needs. One traditional approach for supporting such interactive search relies on exploiting <b>relevance</b> <b>feedbacks</b> (RF) in the searching process. For large-scale multimedia collections, however, the user efforts required in RF search sessions is considerable. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel semi-supervised approach for implementing RF-based search services. In our approach, supervised learning is performed taking advantage of relevance labels provided by users. Later, an unsupervised learning step is performed {{with the objective of}} extracting useful information from the intrinsic dataset structure. Furthermore, our hybrid learning approach considers feedbacks of different users, in collaborative image retrieval (CIR) scenarios. In these scenarios, the relationships among the feedbacks provided by different users are exploited, further reducing the collective efforts. Conducted experiments involving shape, color, and texture datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Similar results are also observed in experiments considering multimodal image retrieval tasks.|$|R

40|$|Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) {{systems have}} been widely used {{for a wide range of}} {{applications}} such as Art collections, Crime prevention and Intellectual property. In this paper, a novel CBIR system, which utilizes visual contents (color, texture and shape) of an image to retrieve images, is proposed. The proposed system builds three feature vectors and stores them into MySQL database. The first feature vector uses descriptive statistics to describe the distribution of data in each channel of RGB channels of the image. The second feature vector describes the texture using eigenvalues of the 39 sub-bands that are generated after applying four levels 2 D DWT in each channel (red, green and blue channels) of the image. These wavelets sub-bands perfectly describes the horizontal, vertical and diagonal edges that exist in the multi-resolution analysis of the image. The third feature vector describes the basic shapes that exist in the skeletonization version of the black and white representation of the image.

40|$|In search engines, ranking {{algorithms}} {{measure the}} importance and relevance of documents mainly based on the contents and relationships between documents. User attributes are usually not considered in ranking. This user-neutral approach, however, may not meet the diverse interests of users, who may demand different documents even with the same queries. To satisfy this need for more personalized ranking, we propose a ranking framework, Social Network Document Rank (SNDocRank), that considers both document contents {{and the relationship between}} a searcher and document owners in a social network. This method combines the traditional tf-idf ranking for document contents with our Multi-level Actor Similarity (MAS) algorithm to measure to what extent document owners and the searcher are structurally similar in a social network. We implemented our ranking method in a simulated video social network based on data extracted from YouTube and tested its effectiveness on video search. The results show that compared with the traditional ranking method like tf-idf, the SNDocRank algorithm returns more relevant documents. More specifically, a searcher can get significantly better results by being in a larger social network, having more friends, and being associated with larger local communities in a social network.

40|$|The Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) {{provides}} a reliable ERP marker of performance monitoring (PM). It is usually larger for negative compared to positive feedback, and for unexpected relative to expected feedback. In two experiments, we assessed whether these effects could be modulated by goal <b>relevance,</b> defined as <b>feedback</b> informativeness (reliability) and/or {{impact on a}} person’s goals. 64 -channels EEG was recorded while 30 participants (in each experiment) performed a speeded Go/NoGo task across blocks in which the feedback on task performance was deemed either relevant or not. At the ERP level, the FRN component was larger for (frequent) negative compared to (deviant) positive feedback exclusively when the feedback was relevant (Experiment 1). When the probability {{of positive and negative}} feedback was balanced (Experiment 2), this valence-driven FRN effect was absent. However, across these two experiments, the FRN was always larger for irrelevant than relevant feedback. Moreover, the subsequent P 300 component was larger for feedback in the relevant than the irrelevant blocks. This effect was valence-unspecific in Experiment 1, while in Experiment 2 larger P 3 amplitudes were recorded for negative than positive (relevant) feedback. Across the two experiments, a larger Correct-Related Negativity (CRN) in the irrelevant than relevant context was also observed, suggesting that PM is flexible. These ERP findings indicate that goal <b>relevance</b> influences <b>feedback</b> (and response) processing during PM, with two non-overlapping neurophysiological effects: It gates reward prediction error brain mechanisms (FRN effect), before enhancing subsequent motivational processes (P 300 effect). status: publishe...|$|R
