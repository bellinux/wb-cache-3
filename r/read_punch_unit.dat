50|$|The IBM 046 Tape-to-Card Punch and the IBM 047 Tape-to-Card Printing Punch (which {{was almost}} identical, {{but with the}} {{addition}} of a printing mechanism) <b>read</b> data from <b>punched</b> paper tape and punched that data into cards. The IBM 063 Card-Controlled Tape <b>Punch</b> <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards, punching that data into paper tape.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} punched-card device was IBM 5424 Multifunction Card <b>Unit</b> (MFCU) which <b>read,</b> <b>punched,</b> printed on and sorted the new 96-column cards. Available as RPQs (special order equipment) to handle 80-column cards were the IBM 2560 Multifunction Card Machine (MFCM) which could <b>read,</b> <b>punch,</b> {{interpret}} and sort, and the IBM 1442 which could only <b>read</b> and <b>punch.</b> A smaller (IBM 5203) printer {{was attached to}} the main system (see photo, fan-fold paper showing). Later on, IBM offered multiple models of the existing IBM 1403 printer line, which had been originally built for the IBM 1401 computer. A modified Selectric typewriter was often used as a console.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, a US$400,000 {{upgrade to}} the main library was completed, {{including}} new data processing equipment, including equipment that would create and <b>read</b> <b>punch</b> cards.|$|R
50|$|The UNIVAC Card to Tape {{converter}} <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> {{cards at}} 240 cards per minute and wrote their data on metal UNIVAC magnetic tape using a UNISERVO tape drive.|$|R
50|$|The 407 <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards, totaled {{fields on}} the cards, made simple decisions, printed results, and, {{with the aid}} of a summary punch, output results on punched cards that could be input to other {{processing}} steps.|$|R
50|$|The 2780, first {{shipped in}} 1967, came in four models. The Model 1 could <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards and {{transmit}} {{the data to}} a remote host computer, and receive and print data sent by the host. The Model 2 added the ability to punch card data received from the host, The Model 3 could only print data received from the host, but not send data. The model 4 could <b>read</b> and <b>punch</b> card data, but had no printing capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Readers {{and punches}} include a hopper for input cards {{and one or}} more {{stackers}} for cards <b>read</b> or <b>punched.</b> A function called stacker select allows the controlling computer to choose which stacker a card just <b>read</b> or <b>punched</b> will be placed into.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 056 {{verifier}} {{used most}} of the same mechanical and electrical components as the 024/026 keypunches {{with the exception of}} the <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> and print head. The <b>punch</b> <b>unit</b> had sensing pins in place of the punches. The holes sensed or not sensed would trip a contact bail when the configuration was other than that entered by the verifier operator. This stopped the forward motion of the card, and presented a red error light on the machine cover. The notching mechanism was located in the area occupied by the print mechanism on a 026 printing keypunch. It had a solenoid which drove the notching mechanism, and another that selected the top notch punch or end of card punch.|$|R
50|$|Because all I/O is {{performed}} by the processor the system is particularly suited to controlling timing-dependent devices such as the 2560, where a card can be <b>read,</b> <b>punched</b> into, printed on, and sent to a specified output stacker with tight timing requirements if full rated speed was to be maintained.|$|R

60|$|But all {{the while}} the microbe was getting in some unostentatious but clever work. A week later Shoeblossom began to feel queer. He had {{occasional}} headaches, and found himself oppressed by a queer distaste for food. The professional advice of Dr. Oakes, the school doctor, was called for, and Shoeblossom took up his abode in the Infirmary, where he <b>read</b> <b>Punch,</b> sucked oranges, and thought of Life.|$|R
5000|$|Column binary - this feature, data-mode 2, allowed all {{possible}} combinations of holes to be <b>read</b> or <b>punched</b> in a column.|$|R
5000|$|While the Bull punch {{was used}} with the UNIVAC Solid State 80 for 80 column cards the UNIVAC Solid State 90 used the Univac {{manufactured}} [...] "Tower Punch" [...] for 90 column cards. The Tower Punch operating at 150 cards per minute used mechanical pin sensing in the pre <b>punch</b> <b>read</b> and the post <b>punch</b> <b>read</b> stations giving the ability to <b>read</b> a card, <b>punch</b> additional information into the card, and check read the results in the post punch station.|$|R
50|$|The IBM 402 and IBM 403 Accounting Machines were tabulating {{machines}} {{introduced by}} International Business Machines {{in the late}} 1940s. The 402 could <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards at a speed of 80 to 150 cards per minute, depending on process options, while printing data at a speed of up to 100 lines per minute. The built-in line printer used 43 alpha-numerical type bars (left-side) and 45 numerical type bars (right-side, shorter bars) to print a total of 88 positions across a line of a report.|$|R
50|$|The KL-51 is an {{off-line}} keyboard {{encryption system}} that <b>read</b> and <b>punched</b> paper tape {{for use with}} teleprinters. In NATO it was called RACE (Rapid Automatic Cryptographic Equipment).|$|R
5000|$|Erik (voiced by Randy Pearlstein) - A robot with {{senses and}} emotions, though {{more often than}} not has a cynical viewpoint. He is able to <b>read</b> <b>punch</b> cards, but is annoyed that {{everyone}} assumes he can. His dream is to be a human boy. It is possible that he is a former human who was murdered and became a robot to survive as stated during the last episode but it is unknown if this is true as this was all part of an elaborate practical joke on Mark.|$|R
5000|$|The Read (RD) {{instruction}} read an 80 column card of {{numeric data}} into ten memory words; {{the distribution of}} digits to words determined by the card reader's control panel wiring. When used with the 533 Reader <b>Punch</b> <b>unit's</b> Alphabetic device, a combination of numeric and alphanumeric columns (maximum of 30 alphanumeric columns) could be read. [...] An expansion feature allowed more alphanumeric columns but certainly not over 50, as only ten words (five characters per word) were stored on the drum by a card read operation.|$|R
60|$|He got in at Ipswich {{with seven}} {{different}} weekly papers under his arm. I noticed {{that each one}} insured its reader against death or injury by railway accident. He arranged his luggage upon the rack above him, {{took off his hat}} and laid it on the seat beside him, mopped his bald head with a red silk handkerchief, and then set to work steadily to write his name and address upon each of the seven papers. I sat opposite to him and <b>read</b> <b>Punch.</b> I always take the old humour when travelling; I find it soothing to the nerves.|$|R
50|$|The 1402 uses IBM 80-column {{punched card}} format, {{although}} an option {{was available to}} process 51-column cards. A column Binary option allowed cards with any combination of holes to be <b>read</b> and <b>punched.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Peripherals device {{have always}} been much slower than core {{processing}} units. This was an especially severe problem for early mainframes. For example, a job which <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards or generated printed output directly was forced to run {{at the speed of}} the slow mechanical devices. The first spooling programs, such as IBM's [...] "SPOOL System" [...] (7070-IO-076) copied data from punched cards to magnetic tape, and from tape back to punched cards and printers. Hard disks, which are even faster and support random access, started to replace this use of magnetic tape in the middle 1960s, and by the 1970s had eliminated this use of tape.|$|R
50|$|Four {{different}} tape <b>punch</b> <b>units</b> {{are available}} for use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second tape punch, usually a typing reperforator (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second tape punch is driven by its own motor.|$|R
5000|$|IBM 1442 was a {{combination}} IBM card reader and card <b>punch.</b> It <b>read</b> and <b>punched</b> 80-column IBM-format punched cards and was used on the IBM 1440, the IBM 1130, the IBM 1800 and System/360 and was an option on the IBM System/3. The 1442 could read up to 400 cards per minute. Cards were <b>read</b> and <b>punched</b> one column {{at a time and}} binary cards were permitted. Cards were read using photocells, illuminated by fiber optics, unlike the IBM 1402, which still used wire brushes to read cards. It was even possible to create (but not read) [...] "IBM Doilies," [...] cards with every possible hole punched. Few other pieces of IBM equipment could do this without sustaining damage.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to information structuring is presented. Basic to the structure {{is the notion of}} an Entity-an object, concept, or event-and associations among Names for Entities. Discussed {{on the basis of these}} concepts is an Entity Set Model for information structuring. Data stru ctur es and acc es sing in data-base II Information organization The ultimate purpose of a data-base system is not to <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards or magnetic spots on disks. These functions are only incidental aspects of the information representation being used. The real purpose is to store and present valuable structured information in a timely and efficient manner. Although practical steps have been taken toward achieving data structure independence, the processing of structured information has been constrained by a given technological representation...|$|R
50|$|In {{the model}} 407, each type bar was {{replaced}} with a type wheel, with the characters along the outside edge. To print, each wheel was rotated to the correct character position, then the entire wheel was pushed forward to strike the paper. This action was somewhat faster in that the wheels were less massive than the bars and could be positioned more rapidly. Still, however, speeds of 150 lines per minute were all that were achieved. Although this might seem slow by later printing standards, {{the speed at which}} electromechanical accounting machines could <b>read</b> <b>punched</b> cards and perform their basic arithmetic functions meant that no faster printing speeds were needed. The IBM 1132 was the last printer manufactured by IBM to use this technology.|$|R
5000|$|Model 14 (1925) - On December 23, 1924, Howard Krum and Sterling Morton {{filed an}} {{application}} on the 14-Type type-bar tape printer which matured into Patent No. 1,745,633. The Model 14 {{was a family}} of devices, printing, <b>reading</b> or <b>punching</b> narrow tapes; Baudot code. About 60,000 were built.|$|R
5000|$|The Turing machine {{shown here}} {{consists}} of a special paper tape that can be erased as well as written with a [...] "tally mark". Perhaps the TABLE {{is made out of}} a similar [...] "read only" [...] paper tape reader, or perhaps it <b>reads</b> <b>punched</b> cards. Turing's biographer Andrew Hodges (1983) has written that Turing as a child liked typewriters. A [...] "'miraculous machine' -- a mechanical process which could work on Hilbert's decision problem" [...] (Hodges p. 98) had been suggested by G. H. Hardy, one of Turing's teachers. Nevertheless, [...] "His machine had no obvious model in anything that existed in 1936, except in general terms of the new electrical industries, with their teleprinters, television 'scanning', and automatic telephone exchange connections. It was his own invention." [...] (Hodges p. 109) ...|$|R
50|$|Input was {{normally}} {{done with}} a hexadecimal keyboard, using a machine language monitor program, and the display only consisted of a 7-segment display. Backup storage of written assembler programs was primitive: only a cassette type interface was typically provided, or the serial Teletype interface was used to <b>read</b> (or <b>punch)</b> a papertape.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} measure of speed is cards per minute, abbreviated CPM: The number of cards {{which can be}} <b>read</b> or <b>punched</b> in one minute. Card reader models vary from 300 to around 2000 CPM. If all columns of an 80 column card encode information this translates to approximately 2500 characters per second (CPS).|$|R
5000|$|The 2540 {{attached}} to a System/360 multiplexer or selector channel through an IBM 2821 Control Unit. A standard 2540 processed standard IBM 80 column punched cards. The card reader (2540R) and card punch (2540P) devices were separately addressable and functioned independently. The 2540 normally <b>read</b> and <b>punched</b> EBCDIC data, called data-mode 1.|$|R
