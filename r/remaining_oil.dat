5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the <b>remaining</b> <b>oil.</b> Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
5|$|The stern section {{remained}} aground, but did {{not pose}} a significant oil spill threat as {{the majority of the}} oil on board had already leaked or burned. Some <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> that was found on board was skimmed or pumped out manually. In June 1999, Green Atlas awarded a ship breaking contract to Donjon Marine Co. and Fred Devine Diving and Salvage. Although the two companies were able to remove approximately one-third of the stern, their attempts to dismantle the largest section or tow it to sea were unsuccessful and had to be abandoned over the winter. However, work did not resume in the spring of 2000, and in 2001, a salvage expert hired by Green Atlas claimed the stern should not be removed because it would create a dangerous work environment. The state later accused Green Atlas of sabotaging the stern removal effort in order to save money; a protracted legal battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) bow section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the bow from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The bow section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the bow was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The bow was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the bow and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the bow section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> within.|$|E

40|$|The 2010 Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{resulted}} in the release of 5 million barrels of crude oil from the Macondo wellhead into the Gulf of Mexico. Oil from the spill was documented on 1, 772 km of shoreline with 847 km of shoreline <b>remaining</b> <b>oiled</b> {{a year after the}} spill, and 687 km of shoreline <b>remaining</b> <b>oiled</b> two years after the spill. Currently, there are few data available concerning long-term, sublethal effects associated with chronic exposure to crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the anthropogenic-induced stress of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure, aquatic organisms living in estuarial areas of the Gulf of Mexico must also contend with environmental stressors including large fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and salinity. For this study, Fundulus grandis was chosen as a model species to investigate the combined effects of oil contaminants (PAHs) and environmental stressors.

Once all <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> {{had been removed from}} the wreck, the vessel was cut into 8 separate pieces using a cutting wire and raised from the seabed. The same method was previously used in the salvage of MV Tricolor, a car carrier that sank in the English Channel in 2002, and to remove the bow of the Russian submarine Kursk before the rest of the hull was raised.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the <b>remaining</b> <b>oil.</b> It assumes that, as fluids from the reservoir are produced, {{there will be a}} change in the reservoir pressure that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the Canadian export {{pipeline}} system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space {{by reducing the}} monthly allocation of each shipper to {{a certain percentage of}} its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota tight oil production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the sinking, engineers used ROVs to seal cracks in the tanker's hull, now 4000 meters below the sea surface, and slowed the leakage to a trickle of 20 litres a day. By 2004, engineers had removed the oil still in the tanker by drilling small holes in the wreck, using remotely operated submersible vehicles (ROVs) {{like the one that}} originally explored the wreck of the RMS Titanic. The oil was then pumped into large aluminium shuttles, specially manufactured for this salvage operation. The filled shuttles were then floated to the surface. The original plan to fill large bags with the oil proved to be too problematic and slow. After the oil removal was completed, a slurry rich in microbiologic agents was pumped in the hold to speed up the breakdown of any <b>remaining</b> <b>oil.</b> The total estimated cost of the operation was over €100 million.|$|E

25|$|In {{the evening}} of 7 June German {{aircraft}} bombed and destroyed an oil tank facility in the town. At around 0200hrs, before Nordkapp was ready to sail west and start five years of service in exile, two ships arrived at Svolvær and started destroying the <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> tanks with artillery fire. Assuming the ships to be German the second in command of Nordkapp, Ensign Andersen, who was {{in command of the}} ship as Lieutenant Commander Seip was in a conference on land at the time, sailed out and attacked the two unknown ships. As he opened up on the two ships with his single cannon, they quickly returned fire and a 45-minute artillery duel ensued. Neither side managed to hit their adversary during the fight, and eventually the two sides discovered each other's true identity. The ships Nordkapp had been battling for three quarters of an hour were Ranen and the 655-ton Royal Navy ASW trawler Northern Gem. Ranen had been bombarding German positions together with Nordkapp just four days previously.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the loss}} of marine life, the initial burning of the oil and the {{successful}} removal of the bow section prevented {{what could have been}} a worse spill. Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that [...] "at least 82 percent of the oil on board New Carissa never reached the wildlife or the pristine shoreline of Oregon's coast". The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed out beyond the continental shelf, into very deep water. Any <b>remaining</b> <b>oil</b> on board is unlikely to have affected marine life since the low temperatures at the bottom of the ocean would have caused it to solidify.|$|E
