40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the content of}} six feature length films, which showed in theaters in 2010 and 2011, from a communication perspective. Five of the scrutinized films are Academy Award winning and nominated films for Best Editing. The sixth film was the top grossing Christian feature film to be widely released within the two years. Utilizing Foss 2 ̆ 7 s <b>rhetorical</b> <b>schema</b> {{for the evaluation of}} visual imagery, this {{study examines}} and evaluates the composition of dialogue scenes within each film, identifying the functions of shot composition and movement choices within each film, individually. Through identification of a function, assessment and support found for that function, and scrutiny of said function, each film shows unique storytelling techniques that enhance the narrative for the audience. The functions of the Academy films are compared and contrasted with the Christian film and a discussion on film making practices and story enhancement through editing...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the limited}} {{scholarship}} on Sedulius Scottus focuses on his poems and treatise, De Rectoribus Christianis. As {{the product of a}} central ecclesiastical figure in Liège, the intellectual capital of Louis the German’s kingdom, Sedulius’ biblical exegesis also deserves study. The Carolingians revered classical society and culture {{and at the same time}} sought to become a wholly Christian empire, thus, it is not surprising that the content of Sedulius’ Collectaneum in Apostolum contains both classical and Christian elements. In 1997, J. Frede published a critical edition of Sedulius’ Collectaneum in Apostolum, but there remains today neither a translation nor specific study of this work in any modern language. My thesis seeks to provide an introduction and translation for the Prologue and commentaries on Galatians and Ephesians as contained in Frede’s critical edition of Sedulius Scottus’ Collectaneum in Apostolum. 	After situating Sedulius in his historical context and highlighting the tradition of biblical collectanea, I present external evidence – which demonstrates Sedulius’ familiarity with Donatus’ Vita and Servius’ commentary on the Aeneid – as well as intertextual links to the latter works to argue that Servius’ pedagogical commentary served as a literary model for Sedulius’ Collectaneum. I also introduce and explain Sedulius’ organizing template for the Prologue, which is his employment of the classical <b>rhetorical</b> <b>schema,</b> “the seven types of circumstance”. This schema is an important rhetorical tool of many classical and medieval authors that has heretofore been misrepresented as originating from Hermagoras. Sedulius’ literary style and format are examined as matters of introduction, which further reveals the influence of Servius. The commentaries within the Collectaneum in Apostolum are essentially based on older, formative religious writers such as Jerome, Augustine, and Pelagius. Not only do I survey Sedulius’ doctrinal stances on important theological and ecclesiastical issues of his time, but I discuss Sedulius’ reception of the above three authors in particular and demonstrate how his Collectaneum in Apostolum attempts to harmonize their sometimes discordant voices...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{generating}} a coherent paragraph presenting arguments for a conclusion in a text generation system. Existing text planning techniques are not appropriate for this task for two main reasons: they do not explain how arguments can be linked together in a linear presentation order and they do not explain how the rhetorical function of a proposition affects its wording. In previous work in text generation, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>schemas</b> (McKeown, 1985) and RST (rhetorical struc-ture theory) (Mann & Thompson, 1987) have been proposed as operational techniques to produce coherent paragraphs. We have found, however, that these tech-niques, in their current forms, are not appropriate to ad-dress the task of generating argumentative paragraphs for two main reasons: first, RST relations are too generic to perform argument selection and construct coherent ar-gument chains; second, rhetorical relations in both theories do not influence directly linguistic realization and therefore cannot determine wording decisions of the type illustrated in Figure 1...|$|R
40|$|This study investigated: i) whether Indonesian {{students}} transfer their Indonesian (L 1) <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, {{and cultural}} conventions when engaged in seminars in English (L 2) in Indonesian academic contexts; ii) whether Australian students transfer their Australian English (L 1) <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions when engaged in seminar presentations in Indonesian (L 2) in Australian academic contexts; iii) {{the extent to}} which and in what ways the respective <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions differ; iv) the functions of discourse markers in these seminars; and v) the use of signposts in presentations. The analysis of the <b>schema,</b> the <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions is limited to: i) the overall schema of a seminar; ii) the major components of a presentation; iii) the exchange structure of the question and answer sessions; iv) the rhetorical structure of presentation introductions; iv) the rhetorical structure of questions; and v) the rhetorical structure of answers. The data were obtained from tape and video recordings of four groups of student seminars as presented below. 1. Indonesian students' seminars conducted in Indonesian in Indonesian academic settings. 2. Indonesian students' seminars conducted in English in Indonesian academic settings. 3. Australian students' seminars conducted in English in Australian academic settings. 4. Australian students' seminars conducted in Indonesian in Australian academic settings. The Indonesian students' seminars in Indonesian and in English were held at the IKIP (Higher Institution for Teacher Training) Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The Australian students' seminars in English were held at Curtin University of Technology, Australia. The Australian students' seminars in Indonesian were held at Curtin University of Technology and Murdoch University, Australia. The ++seminars were part of students' course assignments. The topics of the seminars were social and educational issues. The age of the students ranged from 20 to 30 years old. A total of 67 seminars comprised the data. The findings have shown that:(i) Indonesian students transfer their Ll <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions when engaging in seminars conducted in English in Indonesian academic settings. (ii) Australian students transfer their Ll <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions when engaging in seminars conducted in Indonesian in Australian academic settings. (iii) Indonesian students' <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions in seminars conducted in Indonesian differ from the Australian students' <b>schema,</b> <b>rhetorical</b> structures, and cultural conventions in seminars conducted in English. (iv) The equivalent discourse markers across the four groups have the same functions. (v) Indonesian students used more signposts in their presentations in English {{than the rest of the}} groups. The report of the study is presented in nine sections as shown below. Section A presents the introduction, review of the related literature, and methodology. Section B presents findings of the Indonesian data in Indonesian. Section C presents findings of the Australian data in English. Section D compares the findings of the Indonesian data in Indonesian and the Australian data in English. Section E presents the findings of the Indonesian data in English. Section F compares the findings between: i) the Indonesian data in Indonesian and the Indonesian data in English; and ii) the Indonesian data in English and the Australian data in English. Section G presents the findings of the Australian data in Indonesian. Section H compares the findings between: i) the Australian data in English and the Australian data in Indonesian; and ii) the Australian data in ++Indonesian and the Indonesian data in Indonesian. Section I presents conclusions, implications, and recommendations for further study...|$|R
40|$|Ontology {{authoring}} is a specialised task requiring amongst {{other things}} a deep {{knowledge of the}} ontology language being used. Understanding and reusing ontologies can thus be difficult for domain experts, who tend not to be ontology experts. To address this problem, we have developed a Natural Language Generation system for transforming the axioms that form the definitions of ontology classes into Natural Language paragraphs. Our method relies on deploying ontology axioms into a top-level <b>Rhetorical</b> Structure Theory <b>schema.</b> Axioms are ordered and structured with specific rhetorical relations under rhetorical structure trees. We describe here an implementation that focuses on a sub-module of SNOMED CT. With some refinements on articles and layout, the resulting paragraphs are fluent and coherent, offering a way for subject specialists to understand an ontology’s content without need to understand its logical representation...|$|R
