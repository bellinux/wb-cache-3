5|$|In 1980 United Artists, {{which had}} {{provided}} {{much of the}} funding for the Bond films, fell into financial difficulties following the box office failure of Heaven's Gate (1980), bringing uncertainty {{to the future of}} the funding. The situation was <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> May 1981, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired United Artists.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> a more functional way.|$|E

5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses {{to have anything to}} do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E
5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after they agreed to receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E
5|$|After Rhodesia's {{reconstitution}} as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's government disowned {{many old}} monuments making {{reference to the}} fallen of the World Wars, including the Hull memorial at Shangani. The Hull family <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> 2003 to take the plaque down and donate it to the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum, an idea that the museum welcomed. The plaque was removed, flown to England free of charge by MKAirlines—a freight carrier owned by a former Rhodesian Air Force pilot, Mike Kruger—and ceremonially delivered to the Tangmere museum curator on 17 April 2004 by Hull's sister, Wendy Bryan.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{a genetically}} clearly {{differentiated}} {{representative of the}} genus Boletopsis, which according to the investigations of Cooper and Leonard separated relatively early from the precursor of most other known species. Only a North American species, B.leucomelaena, branches off from their phylogenetic tree even earlier. However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must be <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> favor of the tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, Union Bank of Switzerland reached CHF 6.96billion of assets, {{narrowly}} edging {{ahead of}} Swiss Bank Corporation {{to become the}} largest bank in Switzerland. The rapid growth was punctuated by the 1967 acquisition of Interhandel (Industrie- und Handelsbeteiligungen AG, the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie), which made UBS {{one of the strongest}} banks in Europe. Interhandel had become cash-rich when a dispute concerning GAF Materials Corporation, a subsidiary formerly known as General Aniline & Film and seized by the U.S. government during the war, was <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> 1963 and the subsidiary was disposed of.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise. After this was <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E

5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House.

However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be <b>resolved.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
