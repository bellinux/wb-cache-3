40|$|The U. S. wood {{products}} {{industry is a}} leader in the production of innovative wood materials. New products are taking shape within a growth industry for fiberboard, plywood, particle board, and other natural material-based energy efficient building materials. However, at the same time, standards for clean air are becoming ever stricter. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) during production of {{wood products}} (including methanol, formaldehyde, acetylaldehyde, and mercaptans) must be tightly controlled. Conventional VOC and HAP emission control techniques such as <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> oxidation (RTO) and regenerative catalytic oxidation (RCO) require significant amounts of energy and generate secondary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and spent carbon. Biological treatment of air emissions offers a cost-effective and sustainable control technology for industrial facilities facing increasingly stringent air emission standards. A novel biological treatment system that integrates two types of biofilter systems, promises significant energy and cost savings. This novel system uses microorganisms to degrade air toxins without the use of natural gas as fuel or the creation of secondary pollutants. The replacement of conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizers</b> with biofilters will yield natural gas savings alone in the range of $ 82, 500 to $ 231, 000 per year per unit. Widespread use of biofilters across the entire forest products industry could yield fuel savings up to 5. 6 trillion Btu (British thermal units) per year and electricity savings of 2. 1 trillion Btu per year. Biological treatment systems can also eliminate the production of NOx, SO 2, and CO, and greatly reduce CO 2 emissions, when compared to conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizers.</b> Use of biofilters for VOC and HAP emission control will provide not only the wood products industry but also the pulp and paper industry with a means to cost-effectively control air emissions. The goal of this project was to demonstrate a novel sequential treatment technology that integrates two types of biofilter systems – biotrickling filtration and biofiltration – for controlling forest product facility air emissions with a water-recycling feature for water conservation. This coupling design maximizes the conditions for microbial degradation of odor causing compounds at specific locations. Water entering the biotrickling filter is collected in a sump, treated, and recycled back to the biotrickling filter. The biofilter serves as a polishing step to remove more complex organic compounds (i. e., terpenes). The gaseous emissions from the hardboard mill presses at lumber plants such as that of the Stimson Lumber Company contain both volatile and condensable organic compounds (VOC and COC, respectively), as well as fine wood and other very small particulate material. In applying bio-oxidation technology to these emissions Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) and Bio•Reaction (BRI) evaluated the potential of this equipment to resolve two (2) control issues which are critical to the industry: • First, the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions (primarily methanol and formaldehyde) and • Second, the fine particulate and COC from the press exhaust which contribute to visual emissions (opacity) from the stack. In a field test in 2006, the biological treatment technology met the HAP and COC control project objectives and demonstrated significantly lower energy use (than <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizers</b> (RTOs) or <b>regenerative</b> catalytic oxidizers (RCOs), lower water use (than conventional scrubbers) all the while being less costly than either for maintenance. The project was successfully continued into 2007 - 2008 to assist the commercial partner in reducing unit size and footprint and cost, through added optimization of water recycle and improved biofilm activity, and demonstration of opacity removal capabilities...|$|R

50|$|A <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizer</b> (RTO) is a {{piece of}} {{industrial}} equipment used for the treatment of exhaust air. The system is a type of thermal oxidizer that uses a bed of ceramic material to absorb heat from the exhaust gas. It then uses this captured heat to preheat the incoming process gas stream and destroy air pollutants emitted from process exhaust streams at temperatures ranging from 815 °C (1,500 F) to 980 °C (1,800 F).|$|E
40|$|During the {{manufacture}} of wood composites, paper, {{and to a lesser}} extent, lumber, large amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as terpenes, formaldehyde, and methanol are emitted to air. Some of these compounds are hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The air pollutants produced in the forest products industry are difficult to manage because the concentrations are very low. Presently, <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizers</b> (RTOs and RCOs) are commonly used for the destruction of VOCs and HAPs. RTOs consume large amounts of natural gas to heat air and moisture. The combustion of natural gas generates increased CO 2 and NOx, which have negative implications for global warming and air quality. The aforementioned problems are addressed by an absorption system containing a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as an absorbent. RTILs are salts, but are in liquid states at room temperature. RTILs, an emerging technology, are receiving much attention as replacements for organic solvents in industrial processes with significant cost and environmental benefits. Some of these processes include organic synthesis, extraction, and metal deposition. RTILs would be excellent absorbents for exhausts from wood products facilities because of their unique properties: no measurable vapor pressure, high solubility of wide range of organic compounds, thermal stability to 200 °C (almost 400 °F), and immisciblity with water. Room temperature ionic liquids were tested as possible absorbents. Four were imidizolium-based and were eight phosphonium-based. The imidizolium-based ionic liquids proved to be unstable at the conditions tested and in the presence of water. The phosphonium-based ionic liquids were stable. Most were good absorbents; however, cleaning the contaminates from the ionic liquids was problematic. This was overcome with a higher temperature (120 °C) than originally proposed and a very low pressure (1 kPa. Absorption trials were conducted with tetradecy(trihexyl) phosphonium dicyanamide as the RTIL. It was determined that it has good absorption properties for methanol and α-pinene, is thermally stable, and is relatively easy to synthesize. It has a density of 0. 89 g/mL at 20 °C and a molecular weight of 549. 9 g/mol. Trials were conducted with a small absorption system and a larger absorption system. Methanol, formaldehyde, and other HAPs were absorbed well, nearly 100 %. Acetaldehyde was difficult to capture. Total VOC capture, while satisfactory on methanol and α-pinene in a lab system, was less than expected in the field, 60 - 80 %. The inability to capture the broad spectrum of total organics is likely due to difficulties in cleaning them from the ionic liquid rather than the ability of the ionic liquid to absorb. It’s likely that a commercial system could be constructed to remove 90 to 100 % of the gas contaminates. Selecting the correct ionic liquid would be key to this. Absorption may not be the main selection criterion, but rather how easily the ionic liquid can be cleaned is very important. The ionic liquid absorption system might work very well in a system with a limited spectrum of pollutants, such as a paint spray line, where there are not very high molecular weight, non volatile, compounds in the exhaust...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the FBC over traditional rotor concentrators lies {{in its ability to}} achieve any concentration ratio up to the lower explosive limit (LEL).

Reducing the volume of air to be oxidized from 100,000 CFM to 1,500 CFM (66:1 concentration ratio), allows for a much lower energy usage and consequently, fewer CO2 and NOX emissions.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a gas-turbine cogeneration system that makes effective use of the calorific value of the volatile organic compound (VOC) gases exhausted during production processes at a manufacturing plant. The system utilizes the high-temperature exhaust-gas from the <b>regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizer</b> (RTO) which is used for incinerating VOC gases. The high-temperature exhaust gas is employed to resuperheat the steam injected into the gasturbine. The steam-injection temperature raised in this way increases the heat input, resulting in the improved efficiency of the gas-turbine. Based on the actual operation of the system, we obtained the following results: - Operation with the steam-injection temperature at 300 Â Â°C (45 Â Â°C resuperheated from 255 Â Â°C) increased {{the efficiency of the}} gasturbine by 0. 7 %. - The system can enhance the efficiency by 1. 3 % when the steam-injection temperature is elevated to 340 Â Â°C (85 Â Â°C resuperheated).

40|$|In Japan, malodor {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most serious public nuisances for many years, and various kinds of techniques are developed to control odor. Government and some organizations have tried to make related industries install appropriate odor control systems by detailed instructions, occasionally by presenting handbooks and manuals. However, some of traditional methods may become economically unreasonable because some new methods are now gaining popularity. In future, Japanese manufacturers will have to supply some low-energy technologies to achieve more effective odor control and to have them accepted worldwide. In this report, the market of industrial odor control systems in Japan is introduced. A rough estimation suggested that the scale of this market is around 13 - 22 billion yen/year in the present, but it will increase up to 30 billion yen/year after five years. Then, outlook for several major odor control methods are explained. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>oxidizer</b> (RTO) and plasma oxidizer are the typical examples of state-or-the-art odor control methods, but biofiltration will play an important role of the environmental-friendly method for odor and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) control. 1) Background Japan has a strict policy on odor nuisance, and it is defined by The Offensive Odor Control Law (1972). This law regulates emission of odor against all industries located in designated area, and the measurement of odor is conducted by ether instrument or human nose. Especially, sensory odor measurement, which uses human nose and measures detection threshold, detects all kinds of odor compounds. Therefore it is necessary for industry to control all kinds of odorous compounds, if their area is regulated by a certain value of Odor Index which is calculated by the value of dilution-to-threshold. On the other hand, Japan has been outdistanced on the policy for control of VOCs until now, and several national measures were enforced quite recently: for instance, PRTR (Pollutant Release an...|$|E
