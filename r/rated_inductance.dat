50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{body had}} a central corridor connecting the end cabs, with equipment located on either side. The electrical system included four pantographs (2 for DC, 2 for AC). For AC drive a body mounted 9.3 MW transformer outputs 6 separate traction outputs at 1650 V, {{and a separate}} heating winding. The 1650V output is rectified to 3000 V DC; under 3 kV operation the input is connected directly through an intermediate diode four quadrant chopper. DC smoothing is via 8.550 MW <b>rated</b> <b>inductances</b> located under the locomotive. The DC link supplies six IGBT three phase inverters (grouped in three sets of two, one set per bogie), each driving a traction motor. The system allows individual axle control including anti-slip, as well as electrical dynamic braking.|$|R
40|$|Using the Fourier series {{solution}} to the ambipolar diffusion equation, the robustness of the body diodes of SiC MOSFETs during reverse recovery has been studied. Parasitic bipolar latch-up during the reverse recovery of the body diode is a possible if there is sufficient base current and voltage drop across the body resistance to forward bias the parasitic BJT. SiC MOSFETs have very low carrier lifetime and thin epitaxial drift layers, {{which means that the}} dV/dt during the recovery of the body diode can be quite high. This dV/dt coupled with the parasitic drain-to-body capacitance can cause a body current. The paper introduces a new way of assessing the reliability of SiC MOSFETs during the reverse recovery of the body diode. The impact of switching <b>rates,</b> parasitic <b>inductances</b> and carrier lifetime on the activation of the parasitic BJT has been studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{brushless}} {{dc motor}} (BDCM) has high-power density and efficiency relative to other motor types. These properties make the BDCM well suited for applications in electric vehicles provided a method can be developed for driving the motor over the 4 to 6 : 1 constant power speed range (CPSR) required by such applications. The present {{state of the art}} for constant power operation of the BDCM is conventional phase advance (CPA) [1]. In this paper, we identify key limitations of CPA. It is shown that the CPA has effective control over the developed power but that the current magnitude is relatively insensitive to power output and is inversely proportional to motor inductance. If the motor inductance is low, then the rms current at rated power and high speed may be several times larger than the current <b>rating.</b> The <b>inductance</b> required to maintain rms current within rating is derived analytically and is found to be large relative to that of BDCM designs using high-strength rare earth magnets. Th us, the CPA requires a BDCM with a large equivalent inductance...|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{actuator}} trajectories for an ITER hybrid scenario ramp-up are computed using {{a numerical}} optimization method. For both L-mode and H-mode scenarios, the time trajectory of plasma current, EC heating and current drive distribution is determined that minimizes a chosen cost function, while satisfying constraints. The cost function is formulated to reflect two desired {{properties of the}} plasma q profile {{at the end of}} the ramp-up. The first objective is to maximize the ITG turbulence threshold by maximizing the volume-averaged s / q ratio. The second objective is to achieve a stationary q profile by having a flat loop voltage profile. Actuator and physics-derived constraints are included, imposing limits on plasma current, ramp <b>rates,</b> internal <b>inductance</b> and q profile. This numerical method uses the fast control-oriented plasma profile evolution code RAPTOR, which is successfully benchmarked against more complete CRONOS simulations for L-mode and H-mode mode ITER hybrid scenarios. It is shown that the optimized trajectories computed using RAPTOR also result in an improved ramp-up scenario for CRONOS simulations using the same input trajectories. Furthermore, the optimal trajectories are shown to vary depending on the precise timing of the L–H transition...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{permanent}} magnet inductors for dc biased inductor applications are considered. The inductor designs utilize the persistent flux {{of a permanent}} magnet to partially offset the flux in the magnetic core due to current in the winding. The addition of the permanent magnet allows for decreased inductor mass for a given inductor current, loss, and <b>inductance</b> <b>rating.</b> This dissertation presents the first formal optimization of permanent magnet inductors. Optimized inductor designs are achieved using a population-based, multi-objective optimization algorithm in which the design parameters consist of the permanent magnet material type and geometry of the magnetic core, conductor, and permanent magnet. By comparing Pareto-optimal fronts, it is shown that the mass of a permanent magnet inductor is significantly {{less than that of}} a traditional EI core inductor for a given loss. Then, an optimization algorithm of a dc-dc power converter utilizing a permanent magnet inductor is presented. The algorithm includes both a magnetic and thermal analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|The nonferromagnetic debris {{is easier}} to be {{detected}} as the excitation frequency increases; however, the sensitivity of ferromagnetic metal debris decreases as the excitation frequency increases. This paper is aimed at finding a range of excitation frequency that fit both ferromagnetic metal debris detection and nonferromagnetic metal debris detection. The equivalent circuit of the metal debris detection system with microinductor sensor is analyzed in this paper. The formulae of relationship between the sensitivity and excitation frequency are achieved according to the equivalent circuit. The simulation model of metal debris detection with the microsensor coil is built with the Ansoft software. The equivalent inductance and the electromagnetic induction field of the microinductor sensor are simulated as the excitation frequency changed. The experimental test is carried out with the prototype of microinductor sensor. The simulation results and the test results are compared. The studies indicate {{that the relationship between}} the excitation frequency and the changing <b>rate</b> of sensor <b>inductance</b> can be described by the fitting formulae. A higher sensitivity can be obtained if a suitable excitation frequency is selected. These researches have reference value for the design of inductor sensor and the parameters setting in the experimental test...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} enhancing {{the performance of a}} four-phase switched reluctance motor by using capacitors to produce additional supply voltage during the rise and fall periods of a motor phase current. The voltage rating of the inverter components increases and extra capacitor/diode combinations are needed. The operation and analysis of a series voltage boost circuit are detailed for different modes of operation with a study of the effect of the boost capacitor voltage on the current waveform. Different voltage boost circuit configurations are compared. The predicted and measured results show that the boost circuit increases both torque and output power and, improves the efficiency of the machine, especially at high speeds.

40|$|Our {{prior studies}} {{indicated}} that postural fainting relates to splanchnic hypervolemia and thoracic hypovolemia during orthostasis. We hypothesized that thoracic hypovolemia causes excessive sympathetic activation, increased respiratory tidal volume, and fainting involving the pulmonary stretch reflex. We studied 18 patients 13 – 21 yr old, 11 who fainted within 10 min of upright tilt (fainters) and 7 healthy control subjects. We measured continuous {{blood pressure and}} heart <b>rate,</b> respiration by <b>inductance</b> plethysmography, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) by capnography, and regional blood flows and blood volumes using impedance plethysmography, and we calculated arterial resistance with patients supine and during 70 ° upright tilt. Splanchnic resistance decreased until faint in fainters (44 ± 8 to 21 ± 2 mmHg·l− 1 ·min− 1) but increased in control subjects (47 ± 5 to 53 ± 4 mmHg·l− 1 ·min− 1). Percent change in splanchnic blood volume increased (7. 5 ± 1. 0 vs. 3. 0 ± 11. 5 %, P < 0. 05) after the onset of tilt. Upright tilt initially significantly increased thoracic, pelvic, and leg resistance in fainters, which subsequently decreased until faint. In fainters but not control subjects, normalized tidal volume (1 ± 0. 1 to 2. 6 ± 0. 2, P < 0. 05) and normalized minute ventilation increased throughout tilt (1 ± 0. 2 to 2. 1 ± 0. 5, P < 0. 05), whereas respiratory rate decreased (19 ± 1 to 15 ± 1 breaths/min, P < 0. 05). Maximum tidal volume occurred just before fainting. The increase in minute ventilation was inversely proportionate to the decrease in ETCO 2. Our data suggest that excessive splanchnic pooling and thoracic hypovolemia result in increased peripheral resistance and hyperpnea in simple postural faint. Hyperpnea and pulmonary stretch {{may contribute to the}} sympathoinhibition that occurs at the time of faint...|$|R
40|$|A lumped parameter, {{state space}} {{model for a}} tokamak {{transformer}} including the slow flux penetration in the plasma (skin effect transformer model) is presented. The model does not require detailed or explicit information about plasma profiles or geometry. Instead, this information is lumped in system variables, parameters and inputs. The model has an exact mathematical structure built from energy and flux conservation theorems, predicting the evolution and non-linear interaction of plasma current and internal inductance as functions of the primary coil currents, plasma resistance, non-inductive current drive and the loop voltage at a specific location inside the plasma (equilibrium loop voltage). Loop voltage profile in the plasma is substituted by a three-point discretization, and ordinary differential equations are used to predict the equilibrium loop voltage {{as a function of}} the boundary and resistive loop voltages. This provides a model for equilibrium loop voltage evolution, which is reminiscent of the skin effect. The order and parameters of this differential equation are determined empirically using system identification techniques. Fast plasma current modulation experiments with random binary signals have been conducted in the TCV tokamak to generate the required data for the analysis. Plasma current was modulated under ohmic conditions between 200 and 300 kA with 30 ms rise time, several times faster than its time constant L/R ˜ 200 ms. A second-order linear differential equation for equilibrium loop voltage is sufficient to describe the plasma current and internal inductance modulation with 70 % and 38 % fit parameters, respectively. The model explains the most salient features of the plasma current transients, such as the inverse correlation between plasma current ramp <b>rates</b> and internal <b>inductance</b> changes, without requiring detailed or explicit information about resistivity profiles. This proves that a lumped parameter modelling approach can be used to predict the time evolution of bulk plasma properties such as plasma inductance or current with reasonable accuracy; at least under ohmic conditions without external heating and current drive sources...|$|R
