5000|$|The {{steering}} axis (the red dotted {{line in the}} diagram above) {{does not have to}} pass through the centre of the wheel, so the caster can be set independently of the mechanical trail, which is the distance between where the {{steering axis}} hits the ground, in side view, and the point directly below the axle. The interaction between caster angle and trail is complex, but roughly speaking they both aid steering, caster tends to add damping, while trail adds 'feel', and <b>returnability.</b> In the extreme case, such as the caster wheel on a shopping trolley, the system is undamped but stable, as the wheel oscillates around the 'correct' path. The shopping trolley/cart setup {{has a great deal of}} trail, but (somewhat confusingly) no caster. Complicating this still further is that the [...] forces at the tyre do not act at the centre of the contact patch, but at a distance behind the nominal contact patch. This distance is called the pneumatic trail and varies with speed, load, steer angle, surface, tyre type, tyre pressure and time.

X-O Manowar premiered May 2, 2012, with the creative team of writer, Robert Venditti, and artist, Cary Nord. The {{first issue of}} X-O Manowar received over 42,000 preorders, making Valiant the largest new publisher launch in over a decade. Controversy initially arose over {{the size of the}} sales, with some prominent creators suggesting that Valiant may have incentivized comic book retailers to take a stronger position by offering <b>returnability,</b> which at that point was only being offered by DC Comics. This subsided when the first issue of X-O Manowar arrived at stores to strong consumer sell through velocity, and pre-order data was announced for subsequent issues of X-O Manowar which showed similarly strong orders. The first issue of X-O Manowar eventually sold through 4 full-priced printings and 3 additional reduced-priced printings. The release of X-O Manowar was followed by Harbinger, launched in June 2012 by writer Joshua Dysart and artist Khari Evans; Bloodshot, launched in July 2012 by writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Manuel Garcia; and Archer & Armstrong, launched in August 2012 by writer Fred Van Lente and artist Clayton Henry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{a method}} to {{reproduce}} realistic driving feeling and improve the <b>returnability</b> of steer-by-wire systems (SBW) is proposed by measuring the roadwheel motor’s current directly. The key contribution presented here is a novel method to recreate the driving feeling in term of force feedback with simple and cheap current sensors. A current sensor is used to fully measure the steering torque on the rack of steering mechanism. This measured steering torque therefore, includes the overall effects of road conditions, aligning moments, tire properties and so on. Beside that, a free control scheme is proposed to improve <b>returnability</b> {{as well as the}} handwheel stability in a free motion. Moreover, during this research, the significant frequency effect of handwheel motions was found. This effect could be useful and valuable for improving steer-by-wire development based on torque-map based method. This method is investigated with simulation results using the control design and simulation module in LabVIEW programming language. The simulated results show that this method offers a cheaper and simpler solution for the development of steer-by-wire systems. In addition, stability and <b>returnability</b> of handwheel in steer-by-wire systems could be improved. I...|$|E

40|$|The tyre {{lateral force}} is a {{function}} of side slip and camber. While the lateral force due to side slip is {{the main part of the}} total cornering force, it saturates at a certain level of side slip angle even when the available tyre-road friction has not been fully utilised. In such a situation, the use of an appropriate extra camber could increase the safety, stability, and manoeuvrability of the car. This research serves as a further step to put the theory of variable caster steering into eect. The key idea of the theory is actively varying the caster to produce the required extra camber in a good fashion. In this investigation, the theory was examined in a specic case: developing a variable caster scheme to counteract roll camber - a phenomenon that generally limits the tyre lateral force and hence the maximum lateral acceleration of the car. By applying the variable caster scheme, the lateral force is increased. Therefore, the lateral grip capacity of the car is expanded. The benet of the variable caster was also further exploited to improve the steering <b>returnability</b> during low speed cornering. The theory of variable caster steering began with the development of road steering wheel kinematics. In order to do that, a number of coordinate systems was introduced to suciently describe the steering motion of a road steering wheel. The homogeneous transformation was then utilised to map coordinates between the systems. By doing so, the kinematics was developed. It was then used in two ways. The rst was to determine the camber, which is the orientation of the wheel, as a function of steering axis orientation, vehicle motion, suspension geometry, and steering angle, for a cornering car. The other was for developing a novel method to determine kingpin moment which aects the <b>returnability</b> of the steering wheels during low speed cornering. Then a rollable vehicle model, which is capable of capturing important characteristics of a turning car such as load transfer and roll motion, was constructed. The Magic Formula was used for tyre force modelling to take the camber contribution and the non-linear characteristics of the tyre into account. MATLAB/Simulink was used to simulate the dynamic response of the vehicle to steering input. The steering wheel kinematics and the dynamics model of the car were later validated using both multi-body and experimental data. More specically, the validation of the wheel kinematics was done by a road steering wheel model built in ADAMS software; the dynamic vehicle model was validated using data from eld tests and from a full car model constructed in the CarSim environment. A kinematics analysis of the camber function determined earlier was carried out. On the basis of the analysis, a scheme of varying the caster with the primary aim of countering the roll camber was proposed. The dynamic responses of the vehicle to dierent steering inputs were examined to evaluate its dynamic performance with and without the variable caster strategy. The simulation results show that the roll camber phenomenon, for the caster-controlled car, is reduced signicantly. The associated lateral acceleration and yaw rate increase without compromising other handling characteristics. The variable caster strategy, therefore, provides a more manoeuvrable car with expanded turning capacity compared to the passive car. To take advantage of the variable caster, a caster conguration that can improve the <b>returnability</b> of the steering wheels in low speed cornering manoeuvres was also suggested. Using the novel method for determining the kingpin moment, we showed that the caster conguration provides a better steering <b>returnability</b> during low speed cornering...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} part of {{this thesis}} explains the term biomass and the principles of obtaining energy from it, i. e. the processes of thermochemical and biochemical conversion, and consequently deals with using such energy {{for the production of}} heat and electricity. It briefly introduces the current situation in utilising the biomass for the purposes of power engineering. The term of cogeneration is explained, along with defining its types and assessing their suitability for specific fuels {{from the point of view}} of price, efficiency, etc. The chapter on conditions for using the biomass focuses on the problem points of supplying biomass to the place of delivery, such as limitations in transport distance, storage and quality requirements, or, for example, the smell around the biogas stations. The second part of the chapter lists the conditions for power take-off, especially thermal, namely due to the irregularity of such take-off. It also mentions possible solutions, which consist in placing the units along with suitable objects or the trigeneration method of operation. The thesis also mentions some specific properties of biomass significant to power generation, such as low heating value of wood-gas or biogas, or their lower cleanliness. This is connected to another subject, which is also discussed here, namely the conditions for environment-friendly operation of units. Various types of dangerous substances, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, dioxins, etc. are mentioned along with the conditions for their removal. The last chapter of the research part introduces the conditions for connecting the units to the power system; particular interest is paid to the necessary protection during failure conditions, power quality (power factor), and further also the impact of the production facility on the voltage conditions in the point of connection and impact on the level of ripple control signal. The practical part deals with the project of a cogeneration unit for a small woodworking manufacture with a locksmith’s workshop, taking into account the operation’s energy demands, purchase price of the equipment and the fuel consumption. Due to the low energy output consumption, the source of energy is a combustion engine with electrical output of 30 kW, operated on wood-gas produced in a gasification generator.

Interpreting the <b>returnability</b> index as an equilibrium constant for a reaction network in equilibrium with a hypothetical reference system, enables us to quantify {{the extent to which}} a metabolic network is in disequilibrium. Further, by introducing a new directed centrality measure via an extension of the subgraph centrality metric to directed networks, we are able to characterise individual metabolites by their participation within metabolic pathways. To demonstrate these ideas, we study 116 metabolic networks of bacteria. In particular, we find that the equilibrium constant for the metabolic networks decreases significantly in-line with variability in bacterial habitats, supporting the view that environmental variability promotes disequilibrium within these biochemical reaction system...|$|E
