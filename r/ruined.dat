40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 It is {{the goal}} of my {{dissertation}} to explain our peculiar aesthetic fascination with architectural <b>ruins</b> and to show why <b>ruins</b> are worthy of our time and aesthetic appreciation. I propose a model of aesthetic appreciation specific to <b>ruins,</b> one that not only presents a methodology of interpreting and evaluating <b>ruins,</b> but also suggests how we ought to preserve and display these objects of immovable material culture. I discuss four key examples: Bannerman Castle (Fishkill, New York), Mỹ Sơn Archaeological Site (Quảng Nam Province, Việt Nam), Gas Works Park (Seattle, Washington), and the recent “rust belt” <b>ruins</b> (Detroit, Michigan). Before proceeding to my aesthetic account I propose a definition of “ruins”—a difficult task for many reasons. Foremost, it is not clear when a structure sufficiently decays to become a <b>ruin</b> or when a <b>ruin</b> sufficiently decays to become a pile of rocks and cease being a <b>ruin.</b> This {{is a classic example of}} the sorites paradox. If one seeks a definition of “ruins” that delineates such rigid markers as necessary and jointly sufficient conditions, the project is hopeless. I define “ruins” from the perspective of social ontology, where I argue these objects are partially constituted by their communities viewing them as such. The literature I draw upon is interdisciplinary. Philosophical, literary, museological, and art historical texts buttress my contemporary account of <b>ruins</b> appreciation, which encompasses <b>ruins</b> of antiquity as well as modern-day <b>ruins.</b> I argue that the role of the picturesque in <b>ruin</b> appreciation has been overemphasized, while the role of <b>ruins</b> in theories of the sublime has been underemphasized. Ultimately, however, I argue for a pluralistic account of the aesthetic value of <b>ruins.</b> My account of <b>ruins</b> provides a unique framework for the ethical identification, preservation, and consumption of <b>ruins.</b> If we see <b>ruins</b> as in the process of decay, and we have good reasons to respect the aesthetic integrity of <b>ruins,</b> we ought to allow a <b>ruin</b> to ruinate. Paradoxically then, in order to “preserve” the special aesthetic value of a <b>ruin,</b> we should allow it to decay. Another paradox centers on <b>ruin</b> appreciation, which historically has been wedded to tourism. While all tourism provides challenges for <b>ruin</b> preservation, contemporary <b>ruins</b> face unique worries of exploitation, exploitation of descendant and co-existent <b>ruin</b> communities as well as exploitation of the <b>ruin</b> itself...|$|R

In the perturbed risk model, <b>ruin</b> {{may be caused by}} a claim or by oscillation. We decompose the <b>ruin</b> probability into the sum of two <b>ruin</b> probabilities, one is the probability that <b>ruin</b> is caused by a claim and other is the probability that <b>ruin</b> is caused by oscillation. Integro-differential equations for these <b>ruin</b> probabilities are derived when the interest force is constant.

40|$|Assume {{that the}} surplus of an insurer follows a {{compound}} Poisson surplus process. When the surplus is below zero or the insurer is on deficit, the insurer could borrow {{money at a}} debit interest rate to pay claims. Meanwhile, the insurer will repay debts from her premium income. The negative surplus may return to a positive level if debts are reasonable. However, when the negative surplus is below some critical level, the surplus is {{no longer able to}} be positive. Absolute <b>ruin</b> is said to occur at this moment. Many questions about absolute <b>ruin</b> have not yet been solved. In this paper, we study absolute <b>ruin</b> questions by defining an expected discounted penalty function at absolute <b>ruin</b> or the Gerber-Shiu function at absolute <b>ruin.</b> The function includes the absolute <b>ruin</b> probability, the Laplace transform of the time to absolute <b>ruin,</b> the deficit at absolute <b>ruin,</b> the surplus just before absolute <b>ruin,</b> and many other quantities related to absolute <b>ruin.</b> First, we derive a system of integrodifferential equations satisfied by the Gerber-Shiu function and obtain a defective renewal equation that links the integro-differential equations in the system. Then, we show that when the initial surplus goes to infinity, the absolute <b>ruin</b> probability and the classical <b>ruin</b> probability are asymptotically equal for heavy-tailed claims while the ratio of the absolute <b>ruin</b> probability to the classical <b>ruin</b> probability goes to a positive constant that is less than one for light-tailed claims.
