25|$|The angular {{velocity}} of a particle is measured around or {{relative to a}} point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ɸ and θ in radians), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity (v) of the particle has a component along the radius (<b>radial</b> <b>component,</b> v‖) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, v⊥). If there is no <b>radial</b> <b>component,</b> then the particle moves in a circle. On the other hand, {{if there is no}} cross-radial component, then the particle moves along a straight line from the origin.|$|E
25|$|Only the <b>radial</b> <b>component</b> of the {{velocity}} is relevant. When the reflector is moving {{at right angle}} to the radar beam, it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the radar beam produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.|$|E
25|$|A radial motion {{produces}} {{no change}} {{in the direction of the}} particle relative to the origin, so, for the purpose of finding the angular velocity, the <b>radial</b> <b>component</b> can be ignored. Therefore, the rotation is completely produced by the perpendicular motion around the origin, and the angular velocity is completely determined by this component.|$|E

25|$|Of course, this radial force, {{which is}} the cause of the current, creates a <b>radial</b> <b>component</b> of {{electron}} velocity, generating in turn its own Lorentz force component that opposes the circular motion of the electrons, tending to slow the disc's rotation, but the electrons retain a component of circular motion that continues to drive the current via the radial Lorentz force.|$|E

Using simulations and Zernike aberrations, I found that rotationally symmetric coefficients are correctly determined but that asymmetric coefficients are underestimated. This underestimation is more pronounced as radial order of the aberrations becomes smaller and as angular dependence of aberrations becomes greater. There is also "leakage" to other orders, and errors are slightly affected by the sampling pattern.

500|$|Based on {{the work}} of Kepler and {{probably}} Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the conatus principle, the idea of aether and a fluid vortex. This theory is expounded in the work Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis (1689). According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a <b>radial</b> <b>component</b> can be explained by a [...] "harmonic vortex" [...] for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of conatus, to account for the radial motion.

40|$|Surface {{currents}} and ocean swell are measured using an HF radar with a compact cross-loop antenna design. This unique direction-finding radar {{has been widely}} used for long-term monitoring and for coastal oceanography applications over the last ten years. Numerous studies have evaluated errors associated with these devices under a host of environmental and seasonal conditions, and reliable comparisons between HF radar surface current measurements and those from other technologies indicate a range of 0. 08 to 0. 15 ms − 1, while internal error estimates that are made using the spread of data values in a time series or spectrum from the radar systems generally lead to errors of around 0. 2 ms − 1. These error estimates are typically based on manufacturer-recommended operating parameters that can include up to 25 specific parameters or assumptions made about the data. In particular, one of the dominant parameters in computing ocean surface currents from SeaSonde devices is the averaging time of both the power spectra and the computed <b>radial</b> <b>components</b> of the surface current vectors. This paper explores the relative effect of temporal averaging for two SeaSonde stations inWestern Australia. By analysing 31 days of radial data, we evaluate the statistical characteristics of noise in the spectra and determine the limits to the assumption that it represents a stationary ensemble of independent samples. The improvement in accuracy as we integrate over different time intervals from 10 to 180 minutes is determined by these characteristics. These results are applied to error analysis for the <b>radial</b> <b>components</b> of surface {{currents and}} compared with the errors in the gridded values of the <b>radial</b> <b>components.</b> Finally, the effects of calibrated and uncalibrated antenna patterns on the <b>radial</b> <b>components</b> is evaluated {{in the context of}} the temporal and spatial errors...|$|R

Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).|$|E

40|$|AbstractPreviously, we {{have shown}} that humans with {{amblyopia}} exhibit deficits for global motion discrimination that cannot be simply ascribed {{to a reduction in}} visibility or contrast sensitivity.
