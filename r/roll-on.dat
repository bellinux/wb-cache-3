25|$|The {{networks}} of the North and South Islands were independent {{of one another}} until {{the introduction of the}} inter-island <b>roll-on</b> roll-off rail ferry service in 1962 by the Railways Department, now branded The Interislander.|$|E
25|$|Peninsula Searoad Transport {{operates}} a vehicular ferry service across {{the mouth of}} the bay between Queenscliff and Sorrento using two <b>roll-on</b> roll-off vessels. Ferries also run from St Kilda to Williamstown, Victoria across Hobsons Bay. These ferries, like the many recreational cruises, mostly operate for tourists and run around the bay in various locations.|$|E
25|$|The class uses five {{different}} standards of overhead: domestic catenary {{in each of}} Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; fixed-height catenary on LGV lines; and taller catenary in the Channel Tunnel, designed to accommodate double-deck car-carrying trains and <b>roll-on</b> roll-off heavy goods vehicle trains. The driver must lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between catenary systems.|$|E
50|$|Arrid {{deodorants}} and antiperspirants come in 5 different forms: solids, clear gels, sprays, <b>roll-ons</b> and cream.|$|R
50|$|Glyceryl {{hydroxystearate}} is {{an ingredient}} {{found in some}} personal care products. It is commonly used as an emollient, emulsifying agent, or bodying agent. It is often found in facial care, foot care, and lip care products, sunblock, self-tanners, moisturizers, shampoos, creams, lotions, soaps, concealers, and <b>roll-ons</b> and after sun exposure treatments.|$|R
50|$|For centuries, bathing was {{far from}} common {{in many parts of}} the world. Heavy {{colognes}} were used to mask body odor. Not until the late nineteenth century did chemists develop products that prevented the formation of body odors. Early antiperspirants included creams, solids, pads, dabbers, <b>roll-ons,</b> and powders. Today, anti-perspirant sticks are most common. But an older form of sweat protection, underarm liners, never went away.|$|R
25|$|Port of Tubigon, {{the busiest}} among the smaller ports, {{offers more than}} ten daily round trips plying the Cebu-Bohol route. Catagbacan Port in Loon serves the <b>roll-on</b> {{roll-off}} services between Cebu and Bohol {{for those who have}} vehicles. Port of Jagna offers service between Bohol to Cagayan and Camiguin (with roll-on/roll-off) route. The other ports are Ubay, Talibon, Getafe, Buenavista, and Clarin.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of these components {{can be compared}} with the ball-applicator of <b>roll-on</b> antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a buffer between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.|$|E
25|$|The Main North Line, {{sometimes}} referred to as part of the South Island Main Trunk Railway, is a railway line that runs north from Christchurch in New Zealand up the east coast of the South Island through Kaikoura and Blenheim to Picton. It is a major link in New Zealand's national rail network and offers a connection with <b>roll-on</b> roll-off ferries from Picton to Wellington. It was also the longest railway construction project in New Zealand's history, with the first stages built in the 1870s and not completed until 1945.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{developed}} in 1908 by an Australian pharmacist and his wife. The products are available in varying forms including as aerosols, pumps, <b>roll-ons,</b> sticks and creams. In 2015 the brand launched a new range of fragrances with a new canister design, {{at the same time}} changing the proven formula. This has resulted in wide spread consumer backlash with many product review websites and forums giving very poor reviews and airing complaints that the new formula simply doesn't have the deodorant effect of the old formula.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with her}} work as a nightclub performer, Wild {{performed}} in several well-known New York-based bands, including the <b>Roll-Ons,</b> Pulsallama, the Wild Hyaenas (with then-boyfriend Keith Streng of The Fleshtones), polka-rockers Das Furlines, and most famously, the neo-psychedelic Mad Violets. In addition to playing locally in many of Manhattan's celebrated rock venues (The Dive, Irving Plaza, CBGB, Danceteria, Andy Warhol's Underground, and others), she and her bands toured extensively, including US performance dates at Boston's The Rat, Miami's Club Nu, and the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. Overseas appearances included London (The Venue), Leeds and Manchester (The Haçienda), England with Pulsallama in 1982, and Tokyo in 1988 with John Sex.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of West Nile virus (WNV) infec-tion in Canada {{has led to}} high levels of anxietyand vigilance. As there is no vaccine currently available, illness is prevented by avoiding bites of infected mosquitoes. DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, also known as N,N-diethyl- 3 -methylbenzamide) is the most effective and most widely used insect repellent. It was first used by the US military in 1946 and has been sold commercially for al-most half a century. Products are available with concentra-tions of 5 % to 100 % of DEET and {{come in a variety of}} forms: aerosols, pump sprays, lotions, creams, liquids, sticks, <b>roll-ons,</b> towelettes and wristbands. The US Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has esti-mated that 30 % of Americans are using DEET-based in-sect repellents to avoid mosquito bites, as well as bites of other insects, such as the ticks responsible for transmittin...|$|R
25|$|Major {{agricultural}} {{products of the}} region include palay, corn, coconut, gold, banana, rubber, oil palm, calamansi, prawns, milkfish, crabs, seaweeds and mango. Caraga's proximity to Cebu and Manila makes it a favorable shipping point for products to and from these markets. Nasipit Port {{can serve as a}} secondary shipping hub to Cagayan de Oro when traffic volume from other points in Mindanao increases. With a <b>roll-on,</b> roll-off (RORO) ferry service now in place, Surigao City serves as a vital transportation link for trucks and buses bound for Luzon.|$|E
25|$|The C-123T has {{recently}} been revived by {{a joint venture between}} the US-based Fleetwings Aircraft Company and the South African company Elmer Group. In 2010, they announced a project to initially remanufacture old airframes for African customers and, where there was demand, to build new aircraft. The airframes would be fitted with new turboprop Rolls-Royce T56-A-15 engines, a glass cockpit and other enhancements. The proposed C-123T would have had a 25,000lb payload capability, and a take-off run of just over 1,000ft at 50,000lb MTOW. Possible applications included maritime patrol, search and rescue, and even use as a gunship, while <b>roll-on</b> packages have already been developed for mid-air refueling and agricultural applications.|$|E
500|$|Although ships {{no longer}} dock {{in the town}} of Bridgwater, [...] of cargo were handled within the port authority's area in 2006, most of which was stone {{products}} via the wharf at Dunball. It is no longer linked to the railway system. The link was removed in the 1960s as part of the railway closures following the Beeching Report. Dunball railway station, which had opened in 1873, was closed to both passengers and goods in 1964. All traces of the station, other than [...] "Station Road", have been removed. The wharf is now used for landing stone products, mainly marine sand and gravels dredged in the Bristol Channel. Marine sand and gravel accounted for [...] of the total tonnage of [...] using the Port facilities in 2006, with salt products accounting for [...] in the same year, while the <b>roll-on</b> roll-off berth at Combwich is used occasionally for the transfer of heavy goods for the two existing Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. With the possible future construction of the two Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations by EDF Energy, it is proposed that Combwich wharf be employed to transfer heavy goods to the sites. Combwich Pill is the only site where recreational moorings are available in the estuary.|$|E
40|$|While {{graphic design}} as a {{profession}} is still relatively new, {{for most of its}} existence, practitioners have been criticised for their role in damaging the environment and society through the outputs they produce and the organisations for which they communicate. In 1964, Ken Garland’s First Things First Manifesto condemned an industry wasting talents on “trivial purposes, which contribute little or nothing to our national prosperity”. He proposed “a reversal of priorities” and challenged designers to stop congratulating themselves for work done to sell “slimming diets, fattening diets, deodorants, fizzy water, cigarettes, <b>roll-ons,</b> pull-ons and slip-ons ” and focus more on “more useful and more lasting forms of communication ” (1964, n. p.). Victor Papanek (1985, 68) also criticised the emphasis the industry placed on consumerism and proposed that 10 percent of a studio output be devoted to activities in contemporary social, environmental, financial, and ethical spheres. This criticism has continued through to this millennium, with an updated First Things First Manifesto published in 1999, and with authors, such as David Berman (2009), who repeat Papanek’s 10 percent output proposal. This scrutiny has increased as the broader population realises that the current state of being is one of unsustainable growth—as indicated by numerous reports, from Our Commo...|$|R

2500|$|After 1945, the {{passenger}} market declined to India but boomed to Australia {{with the advent}} of paid-passages for literate & healthy European immigrants known as Ten Pound Poms. [...] P built 15 large passenger liners, including , , , and , culminating in , its last & largest in 1961. By 1968 over 1 million immigrants had arrived—many via P Australia ended the program. [...] P entered the cruise market and began to sell and scrap many of these liners. [...] It concentrated mainly on cargo ships.

The latest vessels, [...] (2013; for Raasay), [...] (2013; for Tarbert) and [...] (2015; for Lochranza), built by Ferguson Shipbuilders are pioneering seagoing <b>roll-on</b> roll-off vehicle and passenger diesel-electric hybrid ferries.|$|E
2500|$|Freight {{services}} on both lines operated {{for many years}} as feeder services from rural districts to nearby major centres and harbours, rather than utilising long-distance services between the important cities. The first through freight from Christchurch to Invercargill did not operate until December 1970. During the 1970s and 1980s, patterns of freight haulage changed dramatically, {{with the last of}} the branch lines closing and an emphasis placed upon long-distance haulage. [...] The South Island Main Trunk is now used to carry significant quantities of long-distance freight, and it connects with the North Island via <b>roll-on</b> roll-off ferries between Picton and Wellington. [...] These ferries have allowed freight trains to be operated from Auckland to Christchurch on a 30-hour schedule.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, an {{independent}} {{review of the}} safety and functionality of the ship revealed that some operating limitations {{will have to be}} accepted, as sea-keeping performance is poor in high sea states. The [...] "selection of a commercial <b>Roll-on,</b> Roll-off (Ro-Ro) design" [...] has [...] "been at the root of differences of opinion between Tenix, the Ministry of Defence and New Zealand Defence Force and the shortfalls in performance". The issues included that the propellers can come out of the water when the ship pitches in rough seas, with concern that this may affect the ship's machinery. The report also recommended relocating the ship's boats (or protecting them from waves if relocation was not possible) and adding more ballast or improving the ballasting system of Canterbury.|$|E
