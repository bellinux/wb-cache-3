50|$|In {{some areas}} of the world (e.g. the mid-western USA), {{rainfall}} intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity, with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water.

50|$|The Newark Supergroup {{consists}} {{largely of}} poorly sorted nonmarine sediments; typical rocks are breccia, conglomerate, arkose sandstone, siltstone, and shale.

Some of the strata are detailed {{to the level}} of varves, with indications of Milankovitch cycles. In preserved lake sediments, Semionotus fossils are especially common.|$|E
50|$|Rain fade {{is usually}} {{estimated}} experimentally and {{also can be}} calculated theoretically using scattering theory of rain drops. <b>Rain</b> <b>drop</b> size distribution (DSD) is an important consideration for studying rain fade characteristics. Various mathematical forms such as Gamma function, lognormal or exponential forms are usually used to model the DSD.

Since rain is a non-homogeneous process in both time and space, specific attenuation varies with location, time and rain type.|$|E

50|$|In an {{undisturbed}} forest, {{the mineral}} soil {{is protected by}} a layer of leaf litter and an humus that cover the forest floor. These two layers form a protective mat over the soil that absorbs the impact of <b>rain</b> <b>drops.</b> They are porous and highly permeable to rainfall, and allow rainwater to slow percolate into the soil below, instead of flowing over the surface as runoff. The roots {{of the trees and}} plants hold together soil particles, preventing them from being washed away. The vegetative cover acts to reduce the velocity of the raindrops that strike the foliage and stems before hitting the ground, reducing their kinetic energy. However it is the forest floor, more than the canopy, that prevents surface erosion. The terminal velocity of <b>rain</b> <b>drops</b> is reached in about 8 m. Because forest canopies are usually higher than this, <b>rain</b> <b>drops</b> can often regain terminal velocity even after striking the canopy. However, the intact forest floor, with its layers of leaf litter and organic matter, is still able to absorb the impact of the rainfall.|$|R
