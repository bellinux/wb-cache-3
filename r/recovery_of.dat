5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than in-depth <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E

30|$|Accuracy was {{examined}} using the determination <b>of</b> the <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> Cd, Pb, and As. The recovery study {{was performed by}} comparing the concentration in the sesame-spiked samples to the respective non-extract standards (Cd, Pb, and As in solution).

Relative standard deviations for within-laboratory repeatability (RSDr, n = 7) range from 1.6 to 2.6. The <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> the mineral elements {{were in the order}} of 97.6 % to 98.4 %.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a high {{concentration}} of ionized air molecules on sampling T 1 phage aerosols of submicron particle size was evaluated by comparing the phage <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> all-glass impingers (AGI- 4) and type 6 filter papers.

These reductions in recovery were greater with positive ions than with negative ions or ions of mixed polarity. The AGI- 4 allowed considerable slippage, which was not affected by the air ions.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{estimates of}} annual survival rates of tawny owls (Strix aluco) ringed in southern Finland from several different sampling methods: <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> birds ringed as young; recaptures of birds ringed as young; <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> birds ringed as adults {{as well as}} young; combined <b>recoveries</b> and recaptures <b>of</b> birds ringed as young, and combined <b>recoveries</b> and recaptures <b>of</b> birds ringed as adults and young. From 1979 to 1998, 18 040 young owls were ringed, of which 983 were recaptured as breeders in subsequent years during this period, and 1764 were recovered dead at various locations. In addition, 1751 owls were ringed as adults, of which 612 were later recaptured and 199 were recovered dead. First-year survival rates estimated using only <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> birds ringed as young averaged 48 %, while apparent survival rates estimated using only recaptures from birds ringed as young averaged 10 - 13 %. Use of combined recapture-recovery models, or supplementary information from <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> birds ringed as adults, produced survival estimates of 30 - 37 %. Survival estimates from young-recoveries-only models were biased high, because of violation of the assumption <b>of</b> constant <b>recovery</b> rates with age: birds dying in their first-year were one-third {{less likely to be}} found and reported than older birds. In contrast, recaptures-only models confounded emigration with mortality. Despite these differences in mean values, annual fluctuations in estimated first-year survival rates were similar with all models. Estimates of adult survival rates were similar with all models, while those for second-year birds were similar for all models except recaptures-only. These results highlight the potential biases associated with analysing either recaptures or <b>recoveries</b> alone <b>of</b> birds ringed as young, and the benefits of using combined data. ...|$|R

5|$|Prior to <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the Akutan Zero, {{technical}} information from three other downed Zeros {{was available to}} the Allies. One Zero (serial number 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the wing spars and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the Akutan Zero.|$|E
