The properties of these binders were used to quantify the contribution of binder in resisting permanent deformation and fatigue crackmg. Bituminous mixtures of different BRA binders and petroleum bitumen were prepared. Ordinary bitumen was added to the mixture of granular BRA to achieve the optimum bitumen content. It was found that BRA binders yield mixtures with better stifhess modulus, rate of permanent deformation, and creep stifhess compared to petroleum bitumen mixture. Mixtures with a higher percentage of granular BRA yield a better performance when compared to the mixture of pure BRA bitumen.

40|$|Motion generates {{sound or}} noise; unless {{the sound is}} audible, motion seen nearby seems either {{stealthy}} or illusionary. Pitch, or frequency, is associated with speed. Loudness is associated with distance {{and the power of}} the generator. Loud noises are awesome and ominous. Music remains inexplicable. Sound pressure is proportional to the number of generators. Noise from motor vehicles is generated by engine accessories, exhaust, engine knock, air flow, rattles, and tires on the pavement. A few years ago, considerable study was devoted to the squeal of tires while cornering, braking, and accelerating. Indeed, the squeal has been abated. Knobby tires, bald tires, and studded tires generate more noise than ribbed and siped tires. Knobbly treads generate vibrations in the casing of the tire. Tires in traction cause the tread rubber to stretch (shear) in proportion to the force; slippage and "snap-back " likely occurs. Air pocketed in tread cavities and compressed under the footprint of the tire may induce whistles or pops.

40|$|AbstractOne {{type of road}} {{pavement}} material which is developed to be more resistant to permanent deformation is the SMA (Stone Matrix Asphalt). Utilization of the SMA mix in Indonesia has constraints in gain stabilizer and also difficulty to comply the gradations, mainly because it needs a relatively large amount of filler. Alternative of local materials {{that can be used}} is asbuton (natural <b>rock</b> <b>asphalt</b> from Buton Island). Asbuton is expected to act as a stabilizer and simultaneously provides an additional filler. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of the SMA that uses the asbuton. The methodology used in this research is the experimental method, its starts from material testing, design mix and performance testing that includes dynamic modulus, permanent deformation and fatigue resistance. The results obtained showed asbuton can prevent asphalt draindown as well as increase the proportion of filler. Draindown asphalt can be prevented by using binder absorbers with fiber cellulose and viscosity boosters with asbuton. Asbuton (LGA 50 / 25) can behave as a stabilizer as well as cellulose fiber. Addition of asbuton also improves the performance of the SMA mix, as shown with increase in the value of dynamic stability. In terms of resistance to fatigue, SMA with cellulosa as stabilizer and SMA with asbuton as stabilizer, relatively have the same performance. Master curve of dynamic modulus indicates SMA with asbuton as stabilizer is relatively stiffer at high temperatures (more than 4. 4 °C), but relatively less stiff (less brittle) at low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The huge {{deposit of}} Buton <b>Rock</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (BRA) in Lawele of Buton Island, Indonesia, {{has not been}} {{utilized}} optimally. The less optimal usage was {{due to lack of}} knowledge on its characteristics. It is expected {{that there will be a}} shortage in petroleum bitumen, due to high price or limited sources of petroleum in the future. In this research, the bitumen used was penetration grade 80 / 100 as control. Numerous bitumen tests were conducted in the laboratory to investigate the characteristic of BRA bitumen such as the penetration, softening point, and viscosity test. Only one aggregate gradation was considered under this investigation. An attempt was made to evaluate the mixture characteristics of BRA. The optimum bitumen content by using the Superpave mix design method were 6 %, 6 %, 6. 5 %, 7 % for petroleum bitumen, BRA bitumen, 10 % BRA granular and 15 % BRA granular, respectively. Then by using Universal Testing Machine (UTM), the samples were tested for performance tests which were Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus Test and Dynamic Creep Test. The samples were tested at different temperatures of 30 ˚C, 40 ˚C, 50 ˚C using the Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus Test. Similarly, the samples were tested at 45 ˚C using Dynamic Creep Test. It was observed that the effectiveness of using BRA as granular showed better performance in the asphalt mixture. From the results, the use of 15 % BRA granular showed the highest stiffness modulus and the highest permanent deformation resistance when compared with 10 % of BRA granular and BRA bitumen. In addition, the use of 15 % BRA granular showed the highest creep resistance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{digital image processing}} based finite element method for the two-dimensional mechanical analysis of geomaterials by actually taking into account their material inhomogeneities and microstructures. The proposed method incorporates the theories and techniques of digital image processing, the principles of geometry vectorization and the techniques of automatic finite element mesh generation into the conventional finite element methods. Digital image techniques are used to acquire the inhomogeneous distributions of geo-materials including soils, <b>rocks,</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete and cement concrete in digital format. Digital image processing algorithms are developed to identify and classify the main homogeneous material types and their distribution structures that form the inhomogeneity of a geomaterial in the image. The interfaces of the main homogeneous material types are vectorized to form the internal material geometric structure and sub-regions. The vectorized digital images are used as inputs for finite element mesh generations using automatic mesh generation techniques. Lastly, the conventional finite element methods are employed {{to carry out the}} computation and analysis of geomechanical problems by taking into account the actual internal inhomogeneity of the geomaterial. Using asphalt concrete as an example, the paper gives a detailed explanation of the proposed digital image processing based finite element method. The paper further applies the new method to the mechanical analysis of the so-called Brazilian indirect tensile test in rock mechanics and pavement engineering. The numerical results show that this new digital image process based finite element method can take into account the material inhomogeneities in the geomechanical analysis which can have significant effects on the tensile stress distribution along the loading axis of the Brazilian indirect tensile tests. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending.

It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed <b>rock</b> with <b>asphalt,</b> which acts as the binding agent.
