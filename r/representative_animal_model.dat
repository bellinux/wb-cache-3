Recently, reports have begun to emerge that apolipoprotein E and low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice may spontaneously develop unstable atheroscle-rosis, with plaques in certain parts of the arterial tree showing features suggestive of plaque rupture. Here we discuss the problems inherent in applying definitions of plaque rupture as seen in human arteries to mice; the anatomic locations in mice where unstable plaques do and do not occur; methods of inducing plaque instability in mice; and how to assess plaque stability in mice. These considerations lead us to a number of general recommendations. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2007; 27 : 714 - 720.) Key Words: plaque rupture <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> apoE knockout mouse vascular histopathology It is generally accepted that the rupture of an atheroscleroticplaque, with ensuing clot formation, underlies most cases of myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on exten-sive studies of postmortem human material. Although these studies are important in identifying histological features of clinical syndromes, they have some limitations: 1. Post-symptom selection of patients may bias toward particular underlying mechanisms. 2. The time span between symptom onset and tissue analysis will be accompanied by changes in tissue composition. 3. Within-subject temporal histopathologic analysis is impossible. 4. Retrospective interpretation cannot be backed up by experimental verification. Clearly, although valuable in setting end points of disease development and as a reference for validating experimental data, this retrospective strategy has some flaws when study-ing the pathophysiology of the disease. Consequently, there is {{an urgent need}} for <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> where prospective examination of the events leading up to plaque rupture and the rupture process itself can be performed...|$|R
40|$|COPD is a {{major cause}} of global {{mortality}} and morbidity but current treatments are poorly effective.

40|$|Abstract Whether iron {{deposition}} is an epiphenomenon of {{the multiple}} sclerosis (MS) disease process or may play a primary role in triggering inflammation and disease development remains unclear at this time, and should be studied at {{the early stages of}} disease pathogenesis. However, it is difficult to study the relationship between iron deposition and inflammation in early MS due to the delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis, and the poor availability of tissue specimens. In a recent article published in BMC Neuroscience, Williams et al. investigated the relationship between inflammation and iron deposition using an original animal model labeled as "cerebral experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis", which develops CNS perivascular iron deposits. However, the relative contribution of iron deposition vs. inflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of MS remains unknown. Further studies should establish the association between inflammation, reduced blood flow, iron deposition, microglia activation and neurodegeneration.

While several rodent models for {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) are available, their relevance in recapitulating renal and cardiovascular features of diabetes in man is not entirely clear. Here we evaluate {{at the molecular level}} the similarity between Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, as a model of T 2 D-associated vascular complications, and human disease by urinary proteome analysis. Urine analysis of ZDF rats at early and late stages of disease compared to age- matched LEAN rats identified 180 peptides as potentially associated with diabetes complications. Overlaps with human chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers were observed, corresponding to proteins marking kidney damage (eg albumin, alpha- 1 antitrypsin) or related to disease development (collagen). Concordance in regulation of these peptides in rats versus humans was more pronounced in the CVD compared to the CKD panels. In addition, disease-associated predicted protease activities in ZDF rats showed higher similarities to the predicted activities in human CVD.

The second aim {{of this study is to}} develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool for atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that coronary artery disease is reflected in a specific urine polypeptide pattern that originates from proteins present in atherosclerotic plaque (Chapter 4). Thirdly, ApoE-deficient mice provide a controllable pattern of atherosclerosis in experimental conditions.

We found that IgG class aCL appeared in 6 · 9 % of non-diabetic NOD mice at weeks 5 – 15. The rates increased with age to 31 · 6 % at weeks 16 – 25 and 71 · 9 % at weeks 26 – 35. In addition, the titre and incidence of aCL were higher in diabetic mice than in non-diabetic mice. It was also found that aCL in NOD mice involved β 2 -glycoprotein I (β 2 -GPI) -dependent and -independent aCL, when β 2 -GPI {{was added to the}} aCL assay system. The IgG subclass of both β 2 -GPI-dependent and -independent aCL belonged exclusively to IgG 2 a. In addition, immunohistochemical studies revealed the predominant accumulation of IgG 2 a- or IgG 3 -positive B lymphocytes within insulitis. These results suggest that the autoimmunity in NOD mice may thus be associated with Th 1 predominant immunological response. In conclusion, aCL with multiple antigenic specificity were produced in NOD mice along with the development of insulitis and diabetes.

40|$|The {{morbidity}} burden {{associated with}} anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis is increasing, and many novel biological therapies are now entering the drug development pipeline. There is thus {{an urgent need}} to develop a <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> to facilitate testing of these agents. We previously examined the effect of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody on leukocyte-endothelial interactions in WKY rats via immunization with human myeloperoxidase. We now seek to extend this model so that all animals reliably develop crescentic glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage. We also wish to investigate whether there is a genetic contribution to vasculitis development in this rat strain. Using escalating doses of human myeloperoxidase, we found that a dose of 1600 microg/kg induced pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage in all immunized animals. We also found that the addition of pertussis toxin and killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the adjuvant when immunizing with 400 microg/kg of myeloperoxidase resulted in crescentic glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage in all animals. However, when Lewis, Wistar Furth, or Brown Norway rats were immunized using a similar protocol, no animals developed hematuria or glomerulonephritis, despite having identical levels of anti-human myeloperoxidase antibodies. We conclude that, by adjusting the immunization regimen, all WKY rats immunized with myeloperoxidase develop experimental autoimmune vasculitis, thus facilitating future therapeutic studies. The resistance of Lewis rats to experimental autoimmune vasculitis provides a genetic basis for future studies of anti-myeloperoxidase antibody-associated vasculitis...|$|E

In immunocompetent littermates however, primary human GBM tissue is invariably rejected. Here we show that after repeated passaging cycles in nude rats, human GBM spheroids are enabled {{to grow in the}} brain of immunocompetent rats. In case of engraftment, xenografts in immunocompetent rats grow progressively and host leukocytes fail to enter the tumor bed, similar to what is seen in nude animals. In contrast, rejection is associated with massive infiltration of the tumor bed by leukocytes, predominantly ED 1 + microglia/macrophages, CD 4 + T helper cells and CD 8 + effector cells, and correlates with elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 α, IL- 18 and TNF-α [corrected]. We observed that in nude rat brains, an adaptation to the host occurs after several in vivo passaging cycles, characterized by striking attenuation of microglial infiltration. Furthermore, tumor-derived chemokines that promote leukocyte migration and their entry into the CNS such as CXCL- 10 and CXCL- 12 are down-regulated, and the levels of TGF-β 2 increase. We propose that through serial in vivo passaging in nude rats, human GBM cells learn to avoid and or/ suppress host immunity. Such adapted GBM cells are in turn able to engraft in immunocompetent rats without signs of an inflammatory response...|$|E

Pathophysiologically, chronic wounds are stuck in the inflammatory state of healing. The role of bacterial biofilms in suppression and perturbation of host response could be an explanation for this observation. An inhibiting effect of bacterial biofilms on wound healing is gaining significant clinical attention {{over the last few}} years. There is still a paucity of suitable <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> to recapitulate human chronic wounds. The etiology of the wound (venous insufficiency, ischemia, diabetes, pressure) has to be taken into consideration as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities display tremendous variation in humans. Confounders such as infection, smoking, chronological age, sex, medication, metabolic disturbances, and renal impairment add to the difficulty in gaining systematic and comparable studies on nonhealing wounds. Relevant hypotheses based on clinical or in vitro observations can be tested in <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models,</b> which provide crucial tools to uncover the pathophysiology of cutaneous skin repair in infectious environments. Disposing factors, species of the infectious agent(s), and time of establishment of the infection are well defined in suitable <b>animal</b> <b>models.</b> In addition, several endpoints can be involved for evaluation. Animals do not display chronic wounds in the way that humans do. However, in many cases, <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> can mirror the pathological conditions observed in humans, although discrepancies between human and animal wound repair are obvious.

Non-selective immunosuppressive drugs have been used in immune-mediated GN but often result in systemic side effects and occasionally fatal infective complications. There is increasing evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies that abnormal activation of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated GN. Activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR 1) have been demonstrated in anti-GBM disease.

The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a model for human type 1 diabetes. Linkage and congenic strain analyses have identified several NOD mouse Idd (insulin dependent diabetes) loci, which have been mapped to small chromosome intervals, for which the orthologous regions in the human genome can be identified. Here, we have conducted re-sequencing and association analysis of six orthologous genes identified in NOD Idd loci: NRAMP 1 /SLC 11 A 1 (orthologous to Nramp 1 /Slc 11 a 1 in Idd 5. 2), FRAP 1 (orthologous to Frap 1 in Idd 9. 2), 4 - 1 BB/CD 137 /TNFRSF 9 (orthologous to 4 - 1 bb/Cd 137 /Tnrfrsf 9 in Idd 9. 3), CD 101 /IGSF 2 (orthologous to Cd 101 /Igsf 2 in Idd 10), B 2 M (orthologous to B 2 m in Idd 13) and VAV 3 (orthologous to Vav 3 in Idd 18).

40|$|The nonreceptor {{tyrosine}} kinase SYK has recently received {{a good deal}} of attention as a critical oncogene in various hematologic malignancies. A newly developed model of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) using the ITK-SYK fusion gene should serve as a powerful tool to dissect the signaling cascades important for SYK-associated malignancy in the context of t(5; 9) PTCL. PTCL constitutes a rare but highly aggressive group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas that respond poorly to standard chemotherapy regimens, with longterm survival of < 30 % (Rodríguez et al., 2009). The molecular underpinnings of these heterogeneous lymphomas are largely unknown, and because of this, fully <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> systems are not currently available. Recently, a recurrent translocation was identified in a subset of PTCL that fuses the inducible T cell kinase (ITK) gene on chromosome 5 with the spleen {{tyrosine kinase}} (SYK) gene on chromosome 9 to form the ITK-SYK fusion gene (Streubel et al., 2006). The t(5; 9) (q 33;q 22) is found in � 18 % of all PTCL–not otherwise specified (NOS) cases and represents one of the few recurrent translocations identified in this disease. In this issue, Pechloff et al. describe the first mouse model for the t(5; 9) -associated malignancy. Insertion of the human ITK-SYK fusion cDNA into the Rosa 26 locus preceded by a loxP-flanked stop cassette generated an inducible construct. Rosa-lsl-ITK-SYK mice were crossed with CD 4 -Cre and CD 19 -Cre transgenic mice to activate ITK-SYK expression in T and B cells, respectively.

It is unknown whether exposure of a 3 D renal tissue model to Stx will yield a more in vivo-like response than 2 D cell culture. In this study, we characterized Stx 2 -mediated cytotoxicity in a bioengineered 3 D human renal tissue model previously shown to be a predictor of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and compared its response to Stx 2 exposure in 2 D cell culture. Our results demonstrate that althoughmanymechanistic aspects of cytotoxicity were similar be-tween 3 D and 2 D, treatment of the 3 D tissues with Stx resulted in an elevated secretion of the kidney injury marker 1 (Kim- 1) and the cytokine interleukin- 8 compared to the 2 D cell cultures.

Aberrations in epigenetic enzymes and chromatin binding proteins {{have been linked to}} prostate cancer and they may form a novel class of drug targets in the future. In this thesis we systematically evaluated the epigenenome as a prostate cancer drug target. We functionally silenced 615 known and putative epigenetically active protein coding genes in prostate cancer cell lines using high throughput RNAi screening and evaluated the effects on cell proliferation, androgen receptor (AR) expression and histone patterns. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) were found to regulate AR expression. Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors reduced AR signaling and inhibited synergistically with androgen deprivation prostate cancer cell proliferation. In particular, TMPRSS 2 - EGR fusion gene positive prostate cancer cell lines were sensitive to combined HDAC and AR inhibition, which may partly be related to the dependency of a fusion gene induced epigenetic pathway. Histone demethylases (HDMs) were identified to regulate prostate cancer cell line proliferation. We discovered a novel histone JmjC-domain histone demethylase PHF 8 to be highly expressed in high grade prostate cancers and mediate cell proliferation, migration and invasion in in vitro models. Additionally, we explored novel HDM inhibitor chemical structures using virtual screening methods. The structures best fitting to the active pocket of KDM 4 A were tested for enzyme inhibition and prostate cancer cell proliferation activity in vitro. In conclusion, our results show that prostate cancer may efficiently be targeted with combined AR and HDAC inhibition which is also currently being tested in clinical trials. HDMs were identified as another feasible novel drug target class.

The E 98 DIPG tumors presented a strikingly similar histhopathology to autopsy material of a DIPG patient, including diffuse and perivascular growth, brainstem- and supratentorial invasiveness and leptomeningeal growth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was effectively employed to image the E 98 DIPG tumor. [(18) F] 3 '-deoxy- 3 '-[(18) F]fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was applied to assess the subcutaneous (s. c.) E 98 tumor proliferation status but no orthotopic DIPG activity could be visualized. Next, E 98 cells were cultured in vitro and engineered to express firefly luciferase and mCherry (E 98 -Fluc-mCherry). These cultured E 98 -Fluc-mCherry cells developed focal pontine glioma when injected into the pons directly. However, the diffuse E 98 DIPG infiltrative phenotype was restored when cells were injected into the pons immediately after an intermediate s. c. passage. The diffuse E 98 -Fluc-mCherry model was subsequently used to test escalating doses of irradiation, applying the bioluminescent Fluc signal to monitor tumor recurrence over time.

This review discusses the principal models used to study early human embryo development and initial stages of implantation in vitro. While each model has limitations, exploiting these models will improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms and embryo-endometrium cross-talk at the early implantation site. They provide valuable tools to study early embryo development and pathophysiology of reproductive disorders and have revealed novel disease mechanisms such as the role of epigenetic modifications in recurrent miscarriage. Embryo implantation is dependent on a complex interaction between the developing embryo and maternal uterine cells. An association between abnormal implantation and reproductive failure is evident, both in normal pregnancy and in assisted reproduction patients. Failure of implantation is the pregnancy rate-limiting step in assisted reproduction. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the responsible signals in the interaction between human embryo and maternal uterine cells in embryo implantation is a prerequisite for further improvement of assisted reproduction outcomes and the development of effective interventions to prevent reproductive problems.

Individuals who are affected by osteoporosis {{may be subject to}} serious fractures and it is estimated that annually approximately 1. 5 million fractures can be attributed to this disease [1]. The disease is categorized as the direct side effect of increased bone porosity and bone loss and is directly linked to estrogen deprivation [2]. Animal models are often used to make initial conclusions about the effects of the disease or pharmacological treatments. In this study, sheep were chosen as a <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> due to their similar metabolic characteristics to that of a human. Like most animals, the ovine does not undergo a natural menopause and an ovariectomy was necessary to replicate the condition. The study objective was to quantify compact bone density present in ovine at three months post ovariectomy. The study included 112 ovine separated into different treatment groups. The treatment groups were separated into 4 groups of 28 based on season of surgery: autumn, winter, spring, and summer. Each seasonal group was further divided into 2 groups of 14; the first group underwent an ovariectomy; and the second group underwent a sham surgery, in which the ovaries were visualized and handled but left in the abdomen. One group was sacrificed 3 months post operatively and the other group was sacrificed at 12 months post operatively. This study specifically looks at ewe sacrificed at 3 months. The radius from each sheep was cut into the anatomical sectors: cranial, caudal, craniolateral, craniomedial, caudomedial, and caudolateral. Each anatomical sector was turned into a microradiograph for analysis. Densitometry was performed to determine the density of each specimen using the estimated thickness of aluminum (ETA) as the key. Statistical analysis assessed the resulting data to understand the effects of treatment, season of sacrifice, season of surgery, and anatomical sector by comparing both mean ETA and standard deviation ETA to understand changes in bone density. The results revealed significant differences between the ovariectomy and sham groups as well as variation within season of surgery and season of sacrifice in both groups. Anatomical sector showed no significant variation. The differences in the thickness of aluminum seen in the sheep that underwent a sham operation {{can be attributed to the}} presence of estrogen. The sheep that underwent an ovariectomy showed differences in the estimated thickness of aluminum that can be attributed to other seasonal characteristics including the influence of Vitamin D. The results and conclusions within this study can be used to influence bone material characteristics and bone loss test protocols in future osteoporosis and estrogen depletion studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Stroke is {{an acute}} {{neurological}} injury secondary to vascular pathology, {{and is the}} second biggest killer of Australians and {{the leading cause of}} adult disability. The rationale of current therapy for occlusive stroke is rapid reperfusion of the ischaemic brain to limit the size of the injury. However, there are no standard neuroprotective therapies that have proven to be beneficial in clinical stroke, despite in excess of 1000 novel drugs showing promise in preclinical rodent studies. The consistent failure of clinical translation in rodent models suggests that they are perhaps not the best choice to simulate the intracranial pathophysiological changes that occur following human cerebral ischaemia, and that a better <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> with similar neuroanatomical features is required. Small ruminants such as the sheep have proven to be valuable in traumatic brain injury models, and a surgical model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has recently been developed in the sheep. However, the existing model has a number of shortcomings and is in need of further characterisation before its widespread use in preclinical testing. The aim of this study was therefore to characterise the pathophysiological and radiological response to both temporary and permanent MCAO using a sheep model. Methods: Several different studies were performed. In the first to determine the feasibility of the project, 18 adult male and female Merino sheep were randomised to sham surgery (n= 6), permanent MCAO (n= 6) or 2 h temporary MCAO (n= 6), and animals had intracranial pressure (ICP) and regional brain tissue oxygen (PbtO₂) monitored for 4 h. 6 further animals had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after permanent (n= 3) or temporary (n= 3) MCAO. In the second study, 10 adult Merino sheep were randomised to sham surgery (n= 5) or temporary MCAO (n= 5), with continuous monitoring of PbtO₂ to determine the relationship between duration of temporary MCAO and the development of regional hypoxia. In the third study, 28 adult female Merino sheep were randomised to sham surgery (n= 6), permanent MCAO (n= 10) or temporary MCAO (n= 12), and monitored for 24 h under light general anaesthesia. MRI was performed in 12 animals (permanent MCAO n= 6, temporary MCAO n= 6). Stroke volume was calculated after staining fresh brains with 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Results: The first study demonstrated the feasibility of performing surgical MCAO, with significantly larger ischaemic lesion areas on histology and MRI following permanent versus temporary occlusion. The second study demonstrated that PbtO₂ fell from a mean baseline of 45. 0 +/- 14. 1 mmHg to a predefined hypoxic threshold of 15 mmHg after 42. 4 +/- 11. 2 minutes of temporary MCAO, at a rate of 1. 3 mmHg/min. The third study showed a significantly elevated ICP, infarct volumes of 27. 4 +/- 6. 4 %, evidence of space occupying cerebral oedema on MRI and a 30 % mortality rate following permanent MCAO monitored for 24 h. Conclusions: A surgical model of temporary and permanent proximal MCAO stroke has been developed in the sheep. The response of the sheep brain to cerebral ischaemia shares many features with the human brain, particularly following permanent proximal occlusion and the development of space occupying cerebral oedema. The sheep as a representative model of human occlusive stroke appears highly promising for use in preclinical testing, for drugs that demonstrate efficacy in the sheep model {{may be more likely to}} successfully translate to clinical stroke.

40|$|AbstractDespite large {{investments}} in drug development, the overall {{success rate of}} drugs during clinical development remains low. One prominent explanation is flawed preclinical research, in which the use and outcome of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> is pivotal to bridge the translational gap to the clinic. Therefore, {{the selection of a}} validated and predictive <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> is essential to address the clinical question. In this review, the current challenges and limitations of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> are discussed, with a focus on the fit-for-purpose validation. Moreover, guidance is provided on the selection, design and conduct of an <b>animal</b> <b>model,</b> including the recommendation of assessing both efficacy and safety endpoints. In order to improve the clinical translation, the use of humanized mouse models and preclinical applications of clinical features are discussed. On top, the translational value of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> could be further enhanced when combined with emerging alternative translational approaches. Focal points:•BedsideAnimal models are essential for translation of drug findings from bench to bedside. Hence, critical evaluation of the face and predictive validity of these models is important. Reversely, clinical bedside findings that were not predicted by animal testing should be back translated and used to refine the <b>animal</b> <b>models.</b> •BenchsideProper design, execution and reporting of <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> results help to make preclinical data more reproducible and translatable to the clinic. •IndustryDesign of an <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> strategy is part of the translational plan rather than (a) single experiment(s). Data from <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> are essential in predicting the clinical outcome for a specific drug in development. •CommunityReview, standardization and refinement of <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> by disease expert groups helps to improve rigor of <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> testing. It is important that the applied <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> are validated fit-for-purpose according to stringent criteria and reproducible. •GovernmentsAs during drug development fit-for-purpose <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> are key for success in clinical translation, financial investments and support from the government to develop, optimize, validate and run such translation tools are important.

40|$|Corpus luteum (CL), a {{transient}} endocrine structure formed from the ruptured ovarian follicle after ovulation, secretes progesterone (P 4) {{that is essential}} for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in mammals. The biosynthesis and secretion of P 4 from CL depends, in general, on trophic hormones of the anterior pituitary gland and on hormones or factors originating from ovary, uterus, embryo and placenta. The structure and function of CL tissue is regulated by intricate interplay between two types of factors, namely, the luteotrophic factors, which stimulate CL growth and function, i. e., P 4 secretion, and the luteolytic factors, which inhibit CL function and lead to luteal regression. In monoovulatory species such as higher primates and bovines, a striking diversity in the regulation of CL function exists not only between species, but also within the species during different stages of the luteal phase. In higher primates, unlike other species, {{one of the important}} characteristics of CL regulation is that, during non-fertile cycle, circulating LH appears to be the sole trophic factor responsible for maintenance of its function, and during fertile cycle, chorionic gonadotropin (CG), an LH analogue, originating from placenta maintains CL function. In higher primates, the role/involvement of luteolytic factors during luteolysis remains elusive. On the other hand, in the bovine species, the role/involvement of luteolytic factor, prostaglandin (PG) F 2 α during luteolysis is well established. It {{should be pointed out that}} in both the species, the mechanism of luteolysis is still poorly understood and the work presented in this thesis attempts to address these lacunae. Further, in bovines, studies have been carried out to examine potential trophic factor(s) responsible for the maintenance of CL function. Chapter I provides an extensive review of literature on CL structure and function with emphasis on factors that influence its growth, development, function and demise in primates and bovines. In Chapter II, employing bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) as the <b>representative</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> for higher primates, various studies have been conducted to examine the role of molecular modulators involved in regulation of CL function, particularly during spontaneous luteolysis. Although, it is well established that LH is essential for the maintenance of CL function in higher primates, the mechanism(s) responsible for the decline in serum P 4 levels at the end of non-fertile cycles, without a concomitant change in circulating LH milieu, remains to be addressed. Several experiments have been conducted to examine the component(s) of luteotrophic (LH/CG) signaling that is/are modulated during luteolysis in the bonnet monkey CL. To understand the relative lack of responsiveness of CL to the circulating LH during the late luteal phase, LH/CG receptor (R) dynamics (expression of LH/CGR and its various transcript variants) was examined throughout the luteal phase and during different functional states of the monkey CL. The results indicated presence of LH/CGR mRNA, its transcript variants and functional LH/CGR protein in the monkey CL on day 1 of menses. Moreover, the functionality of receptors was tested by confirming the biological response of the CL to bolus administration of exogenous LH preparations, which eventually suggested factor(s) downstream of LH/CGR activation to account for the decline in CL function observed during non-fertile cycle. Studies have been conducted to identify molecular modulators that would selectively exploit intraluteal processes to regulate trophic signaling pathways that are critical to the control of luteal function. Immunoblot and qPCR analyses were carried out to examine presence and activation of Src family of kinases (SFKs) and cAMP-phosphodiesterases (PDEs) during various functional states of CL. The results revealed an increased activation of Src (phosphorylated at Tyr 416) during spontaneous and PGF 2 α/CET-induced luteolysis that may participate in the regulation of cAMP levels in part by increasing the cAMP-PDE activity observed during spontaneous luteolysis. This observation raised the question on the possible mechanism by which CG, an analog of pituitary LH, rescues CL function during early pregnancy. Thus, subsequent experiments involving LH/hCG administration in CET-treated animals as well as simulated early pregnancy animal model were conducted and the results revealed that, a bolus of LH/hCG decreased Src activation and cAMP-PDE activity accompanying a momentous increase in cAMP levels in both these models that further led to a concomitant increase in P 4 secretion. Although the mechanisms of action of LH/CG involve modulation of a number of signaling pathways in the CL, by far, the results from various experiments suggested that it leads to activation of Src kinase and cAMP-PDE, thus causing inhibition of various elements of the primary signaling cascade- AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB during spontaneous luteolysis. One of the consequences of activation of Src kinase and cAMP-PDE was the regulation of expression of genes associated with steroidogenesis and it was observed that expression of SR-B 1, a membrane receptor associated with trafficking of HDL-CE into the luteal cells, was lower in the regressed CL. The results taken together suggest that the decrease in responsiveness of CL to LH milieu during non-fertile cycles is not associated with changes in LH/CGR dynamics, but, is instead coupled to the activation of Src kinase and cAMP-PDE, inhibition of molecules downstream of LH signaling, and a decrease in the SR-B 1 expression that regulates cholesterol economy of the luteal cell, and in turn, P 4 secretion. The control of primate CL function appears to be dominated by the luteotrophic factors (LH/CG) over the luteolytic factors, since the process of luteal regression was overcome by administration of LH/CG. Further, in the primate CL, the molecular modulators of LH/CG signaling (Src kinase and PDE) are maintained in the repressed state by the luteotrophic factor LH/CG for maximum steroidogenic function. In contrast, in non-primate species, without invoking a role for the luteotrophic factor, essentially the synthesis and secretion of luteolytic factor, PGF 2 α, from the uterus is kept in check during pregnancy by the trophoblast derived IFN- and thus allowing CL to continue to function that is essential for maintenance of pregnancy. In the bovine species, the mechanism of PGF 2 α-induced luteolysis that involves a change in expression of genes associated with various processes of cellular function is poorly understood. Experiments were conducted utilizing buffalo cows (Bubalus bubalis) as a model system, to determine temporal changes in the global gene expression profile of the CL in response to PGF 2 α treatment. For this purpose, CL tissues were collected on day 11 of estrous cycle without treatment (designated as 0 h) and at 3, 6 and 18 h post PGF 2 α treatment for various analyses. Global changes in gene expression pattern in the CL were investigated employing Affymetrix GeneChip bovine genome array and the results are presented in Chapter III. The hybridization intensity values obtained by microarray analysis were subjected to R/Bioconductor tool. Following the application of highly stringent statistical filters to eliminate false positives, a set of differentially expressed genes were identified. The differentially expressed genes were further classified based on a fold change cut-off filter of ≥ 2, and the analysis revealed 127 genes to be differentially expressed within 3 h of PGF 2 α administration, of these 64 and 63 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. Analysis of microarray data at 6 h post PGF 2 α administration revealed 774 genes to be differentially expressed, of which 544 genes were up-regulated, while 230 genes were down-regulated. The microarray analysis performed on CL tissues collected at 18 h post PGF 2 α administration showed that out of the total 939 differentially expressed genes, 571 genes were up-regulated, while 368 genes were down-regulated. Analysis of the ontology report for the biological processes category showed that initially in response to PGF 2 α administration, genes regulating steroidogenesis, cell survival and transcription were differentially regulated in the CL, but at later time points, differential expression of genes involved in apoptosis, PGF 2 α metabolism, tissue remodeling and angiogenesis was observed. Further, involvement of molecules downstream of LH/IGF- 1 activation was investigated and the results obtained indicated that PGF 2 α interfered with the LH/IGF- 1 signaling since the expression of LH/CGR, GHR and pAkt were down-regulated following PGF 2 αadministration. Furthermore, the functional luteolysis observed post PGF 2 αadministration appeared to be due to an interruption in cholesterol trafficking to inner mitochondrial membrane, since StAR expression was inhibited. The results obtained also demonstrated that the expression of AGTR 1, VEGFR 2 and R 3 were down-regulated following PGF 2 α administration. Further, the data obtained also suggested modulation of expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors upon PGF 2 α-treatment indicative of an involvement of other autocrine or paracrine factor(s) in the regression of bovine CL. This was an interesting finding as it suggests a novel and potential functional relationship between angiogenesis and the luteolytic response of CL to PGF 2 α administration. In bovines, despite extensive research being carried out to examine factors involved in the regulation of development and function of the CL, the trophic factor(s) required for maintenance of CL function, especially, P 4 biosynthesis and secretion are not well characterized. It was hypothesized that the function of the CL during its finite lifespan must be responsive to LH as well as to various growth factors. Thus, experiments were conducted to examine the effects of increased LH and GH/IGF-I on the maintenance of CL function during mid luteal phase and post PGF 2 α administration and the results of these studies are presented in Chapter IV. To elucidate the role of LH as a trophic factor in the regulation of CL function, effects of increased endogenous LH through GnRH administration and exogenous hCG injections were examined. The results indicated an absence of noticeable effect of various hCG/GnRH treatments on circulating P 4 levels. On the other hand, administration of GH resulted in increased serum IGF- 1 and P 4 levels. It was further observed that the administration of a combination of hCG and GH increased serum P 4 levels better than treatment with GH alone. Further experiments were carried out to examine the complex reciprocal relationship between LH/GH and PGF 2 α on expression of genes involved in the regulation of luteal structure and function. In buffalo cows, administration of exogenous hCG and/or GH following inhibition of CL function by PGF 2 α administration did not prevent the PGF 2 α-induced decline in serum P 4 levels, but PGF 2 -mediated decrease in expression of LH/CGR and GHR genes was prevented upon GH administration. However, the decrease in StAR expression was not restored by hCG and GH treatments, thereby indicating that PGF 2  action was not prevented by hCG and/or GH treatments. Taken together, the results of studies carried out in buffalo cows employing various experimental model systems suggest essential role for LH and GH/IGF- 1, however, these factors were unable to reverse PGF 2 α-induced luteolysis. Further, our crucial findings of the effects of increased endogenous LH and IGF- 1, in addition to their relationship with luteolytic agents such as PGF 2 α will open new avenues for studying the mechanisms involved in the regulation of structural and functional properties of the buffalo CL. It is well known that a large number of buffalo cows experience loss of pregnancy and infertility due to inadequate luteal function and/or failure of timely insemination. Results from our studies suggest that the incorporation of PGF 2 α and hCG or GH/IGF- 1 protocols in buffalo cows to be beneficial for improving their breeding efficiency as these protocols are likely to increase luteal function with defined luteolysis. To summarize, the results of studies described in the present thesis provide new insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of CL function during luteolysis in the monoovulatory species. The results suggest that the maintenance of CL function appears to be dependent on both luteotrophic and luteolytic factors, but with a varied degree of dominance between the two species examined. Further, the results indicate that while the luteotrophic factors (LH/CG) dominate the CL regulation in primates, the regulation of CL function in bovines is dominated by the actions of luteolytic factor (PGF 2 α). In monoovulatory species, the luteotrophic and luteolytic factors following binding to their specific plasma membrane receptors on the luteal cells, would counteract each other and modulate activation of various downstream signaling molecules subsequently leading to regulation of gene expression and P 4 secretion (Fig. 5. 1).

In primates, LH/CG activates a multitude of intracellular signaling cascades, primarily Gαs/AC/cAMP/PKA/CREB leading to changes in gene expression. LH during early and mid luteal phase and CG during pregnancy maintain the activation of Src and PDE in an inhibitory state. However, during the late luteal phase of non-fertile cycle, results in present study suggests that activated Src levels and PDE activity increase, with accompanying decrease in cAMP and pCREB levels leading to concomitant decrease in SR-B 1 expression, and in turn, P 4 secretion. Surprisingly, regulation of apoptotic gene expression and CL regression are still unclear. In bovines, PGF 2 α of uterine origin mediates changes in luteal gene expression and results in decreased P 4 secretion, principally by reduction in StAR level. The present study suggests that during luteolysis PGF 2 α affects the genes regulated by LH, by interfering with LH (and perhaps IGF- 1) signaling leading to alteration in the expression of genes crucial for CL structure and function.
