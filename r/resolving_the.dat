5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E

5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{became a major}} problem. By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, especially during the summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and Harrison {{wished to}} see American power and trade {{expanded}} across the Pacific and were {{especially interested in}} securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine’s predecessor, had accepted {{an invitation to a}} three-party conference in Berlin aimed at <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Question.|$|E

5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, Richard, {{had died in a}} hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father {{at the time of his}} death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. <b>Resolving</b> <b>the</b> paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923.

The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for <b>resolving</b> <b>the</b> dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.|$|E
