40|$|In this paper, using a newly defined {{cooling coil}} load {{calculation}} method for stratified air distribution (STRAD) systems, {{the effects of}} separate location of the return and exhaust grilles on thermal comfort and energy saving are experimentally investigated. The results clearly demonstrated the extra energy saving potentials for STRAD systems with separate locations of return and exhaust grilles. After using the experimental results to validate our CFD method, numerical investigation is carried out for an office setting. Decreasing the height of return grille will increase exhaust air temperature and significantly reduce the cooling coil load. However, the risk of poor thermal comfort caused by too large temperature difference between the head and foot levels also increased, when the <b>return</b> <b>inlet</b> is located close to the floor level. Locating the exhaust grilles at ceiling level and close to external wall while locating the return grilles at the upper boundary of the occupied zone are recommended in practice. It is demonstrated that the purpose to simultaneously achieve satisfied thermal comfort and prominent energy saving can be attained with a STRAD system via deliberate locations of supply outlets and return and exhaust grilles {{in relation to the}} heat source locations.

40|$|The {{design of}} a water based thermal store {{for use in a}} {{domestic}} central heating system has been investigated theoretically, experimentally and numerically. The transient operation of the store during both the space heating and domestic hot-water modes of operation have been investigated separately. Heat transfer correlations in terms of Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers have been developed in order to predict the natural convection heat transfer coefficient for the outside surface of the horizontal axis finned tube heat exchanger coil located within the store. These heat-transfer correlations can predict the value of the heat transfer coefficient with an accuracy of better than 5 % and are in good agreement with existing heat transfer correlations developed for the same geometry of finned tubes and modes of heat transfer. The effect of the water flow rate in the heat exchanger coil on the internal heat transfer coefficient is also investigated. This flow rate should be above 4 litre/minute to achieve a high rate of heat-transfer from the wall of the heat exchanger to the water in the pipe. A detailed investigation of the use of horizontal and vertical baffles to increase the effectiveness of heat delivery in the domestic hot water mode has been carried out. Some improvements can be achieved by the use of a horizontal flat plate located {{in the middle of the}} store. This plate, when correctly sized enhances stratification and hence improves the effectiveness of heat recovery. Vertical plate arrangements and a rectangular duct situated around the upper heat exchanger coil were found to be ineffective. However, due to an increased velocity of the water around the heat exchanger, the external heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger was increased by 12 %. The comparison of experimental observations with computer simulations of the development of the thermocline in the store during the space heating mode of operation showed the presence of a jet in the bottom region of the store at the <b>return</b> <b>inlet.</b> The jet induces a significant amount of mixing in the store which reduces the effectiveness of heat recovery. Correlations in terms of Richardson number and effectiveness of heat delivery have been developed to characterize the effect of this jet. An inlet arrangement designed to achieve a Richardson number exceeding 3 significantly reduces the mixing created by the jet and can increase the amount of heat delivered in the space heating mode by approximately 5 %...|$|E

40|$|Introduced in {{this article}} is a 1 : 15 brine model {{experiment}} rig with an actual large space building as the research object, which provides different concentration brine for a simulation of the stratified air conditioning in the steady-state flow field featured with columnar air supply in the bottom, heat source on the ground, the central air return, and air exhaust from roof in a large space. According to the similarity theory, it is concluded that the similarity criterion numbers applied here are Reynolds number (Re) and Archimedes number (Ar) for designation of experiment rig size, choosing device type, and confirming experiment condition. In the designation of key components of experiment rig, the application of automation control makes brine recovery and recycling in the process; designation of electrical control system makes a centralized control of experiment start–stop and the adjustment of the pipeline flow, realizing automation in the whole experiment process. Particle image velocimetry testing technology is used to get velocity vector field of air return mouth area in the model under various working conditions, and also proper orthogonal decomposition method is applied to analyze flow field structure of air return mouth area and reconstruct it. Consequently, we can get a kinetic energy ratio of return air entrainment of lower air-conditioning section and upper non-air-conditioning section in large space. Experiments show that under the conditions of same air supply, indoor environment temperature difference, and height and direction of <b>return</b> air <b>inlet,</b> fastening the speed of return air suction, the entrainment of flow field around it strengthens accordingly. The entrainment of <b>return</b> air <b>inlet</b> has more kinetic energy in the lower air-conditioning section than the upper non-air-conditioning section...|$|R

40|$|The Rivers Inlet {{sockeye salmon}} (Oncorhynchus nerka) {{population}} was historically {{the third most}} numerous in British Columbia, with returns routinely exceeding one million adults. In recent years, the population has drastically declined, culminating in an utter failure of the adult spawning population in 1999, when returns were estimated at 3600 fish. Poor marine survival has been proposed as {{the primary cause of}} the decline. Existing evidence, including concurrent declines in sockeye salmon populations from nearby watersheds indicate the problem may lie in the early marine phase. We provide evidence suggesting that a crucial, population-limiting window may exist in the early marine phase, as the newly smolted juvenile sockeye salmon emerge into Rivers Inlet and nearby waters. Unless appropriate abiotic conditions exist in the lead-up to the juvenile migration, the brood year may suffer significant mortality.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} heat and mass transfer in counter-flow recuperators used for energy recovery in air handling units (AHU) under sub-zero outdoor air temperature operating conditions is presented. The most probable variants of year-round heat exchanger operation performance, which characterized by existence of three active heat and mass transfer zones (“dry”, “wet”, “frost”), and effect of the latent heat of water vapour condensation on the realization of these variants was determined. It was established, that the frost tends to take place with increasing temperature effectiveness of the heat exchanger.

Qualitatively, {{the influence of}} basin geometry {{does not change the}} presence of stable equilibrium.

50|$|In operation, {{progressive}} cavity {{pumps are}} fundamentally fixed flow rate pumps, like piston pumps and peristaltic pumps, and {{this type of}} pump needs a fundamentally different understanding than the types of pumps to which people are more commonly introduced, namely ones that {{can be thought of}} as generating pressure. This can lead to the mistaken assumption that all pumps can have their flow rates adjusted by using a valve attached to their outlet, but with this type of pump this assumption is a problem, since such a valve will have practically no effect on the flow rate and completely closing it will involve very high pressures being generated. To prevent this, pumps are often fitted with cut-off pressure switches, rupture discs (deliberately weak and easily replaced), or a bypass pipe that allows a variable amount of a fluid to <b>return</b> to the <b>inlet.</b> With a bypass fitted, a fixed flow rate pump is effectively converted to a fixed pressure one.|$|R
40|$|An {{assembly}} of devices provides for both humidification of the reactant gas streams of {{a fuel cell}} and removal of the product water (the water generated by operation of the fuel cell). The assembly includes externally-sensing forward-pressure regulators that supply reactant gases (fuel and oxygen) at variable pressures to ejector reactant pumps. The ejector supply pressures depend on the consumption flows. The ejectors develop differential pressures approximately proportional to the consumption flow rates at constant system pressure and with constant flow restriction between the mixer-outlet and suction ports of the ejectors. For removal of product water from the circulating oxygen stream, the assembly includes a water/gas separator that contains hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes. The water separator imposes an approximately constant flow restriction, regardless {{of the quality of}} the two-phase flow that enters it from the fuel cell.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a design concept for return passages in multistage centrifugal compressors. Flow in a baseline return passage is analyzed to identify loss sources that have substantial potential for reduction. For the geometry analyzed, {{it is found}} that mismatched incidence of the return vane, separation on the hub surface at the exit of the return bend, and blockage due to separation on the shroud surface near the <b>return</b> bend <b>inlet</b> lead to losses which have such potential. Preliminary designs were developed and computationally assessed to determine effective geometries for eliminating separation on the hub at the return bend exit and for reducing losses. Then, based on assessment of the preliminary designs, other features of the loss generation were addressed. The geometry proposed includes an increased axial extent of the return bend, an increasing radius of curvature through the return bend, and lean of the return vane leading edge, mitigating the loss mechanisms identified in the baseline return passage. The three-dimensional calculations showed a cumulative loss coefficient that was 10 % lower than the baseline. The design described was carried out with a fixed inlet condition, and a second return passage was thus developed to determine the potential loss reduction if the inlet geometry were modified. (The design of the impeller required to achieve the modified inlet flow was not considered.) The cumulative loss coefficient was reduced by 27 % compared with the baseline, with the implication that an area for exploration is integration of the impeller and return passage flow fields. by Benjamin W.

50|$|The {{community}} developed around 1924 {{during a}} period of sparse caribou populations when the Innu began spending their summers along the shoreline of Davis Inlet. This location was chosen because of its accessibility, its offering of other non-caribou food sources, and the presence of a Hudson's Bay Company trading post that was able to supply traps, ammunition, tobacco, butter, sugar and flour to the Innu in exchange for furs. Davis Inlet was also frequented by Roman Catholic missionaries, whom the Innu found helpful. In the following years the Innu began transitioning from a nomadic lifestyle to a more sedentary one, travelling inland to hunt caribou in the fall and winter, but spending the summer at Davis Inlet. Without prior consultation, in 1948 the Newfoundland government relocated the Innu of Davis Inlet to the small community of Nutak in northern Labrador, promising better opportunities for fishing and hunting. However, two years later the Innu surprised government officials by <b>returning</b> to Davis <b>Inlet,</b> having made their way back through the interior of Labrador on foot. The government continued to consider relocation of the Innu, and in 1967 with the urging of government officials and missionaries the Innu of Davis Inlet moved and settled on Iluikoyak Island on a year-round basis, establishing the Davis Inlet community (known as Utshimasits by the Innu).|$|R

50|$|On 20 November 1863 {{she stood}} out to sea, {{arriving}} off Fortress Monroe on the 23d, thence to Norfolk Navy Yard. She departed Hampton Roads 5 December {{to join the}} Fleet off Wilmington, North Carolina, for active blockading duty. The crew of the Governor Buckingham rapidly gained experience {{with the problem of}} tracking blockade runners. On 20 December with the assistance of Aries she captured the notorious blockade runner Antonica of Nassau, which ran ashore. Antonicas captain and crew attempted to get away in two small boats; but when fired upon they gave themselves up, and the 26 men were taken aboard as prisoners. After boarding and taking possession of the prize in early morning of 21 December, Aries and the tug Violet sent out boats to assist, without success, as the tide had left her fast. On 3 January 1864, Governor Buckingham was with the flagship Fahkee when the blockade runner Bendigo ran aground during the chase; after efforts at salvage failed on 11 January Bendigo was destroyed. That same day the British blockade runner Ranger was discovered after landing her passengers from Bermuda at Merrill's Inlet, 5 miles NE. She was intercepted by Minnesota, Governor Buckingham, Daylight, and Aries when she approached the Western Bar, and was beached and fired by her crew. Attempts by the squadron to extinguish the fire and haul her off were frustrated by Confederate sharpshooters, whose fire completely commanded her decks. Later Governor Buckingham proceeded to Norfolk Navy Yard, for overhaul. She sailed from Hampton Roads on 3 July 1864 to return to blockade duty off Wilmington, and soon after was attached to the 1st Division off New Inlet. From 11 to 25 September she was at Beaufort, S.O., then back on her old station, she chased a blockade runner ashore on 25 September, firing five shots, three of which took effect as the target drove high and dry on the beach. One of the crew was killed, three wounded, and the steamer sent the surgeon and steward to their relief. Next day the blockade runner was set afire, but 20 bales of cotton, part of her cargo, were salvaged. On 30 September 1864 Governor Buckingham took part off Fort Fisher in the destruction of the British-based blockade runner Black Hawk. Having been damaged in several accidental collisions, she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for drydocking on 27 October, and <b>returned</b> off New <b>Inlet</b> on 3 December. Later that month she took part in the first engagement of the Fleet against Fort Fisher, renewing the engagement for 2 days; then her boats were sent in to reembark troops. The second attack upon Fort Fisher (13 to 16 January 1865) resulted in its capture. On 13 January Governor Buckingham was stationed off Half Moon Battery, assisting troops from the transports to land; she also landed provisions, ammunition and entrenching tools. After the battle on 16-17 January she was employed in carrying the wounded to the transports. On several occasions, in obedience to orders, she shelled the woods near Half Moon Battery. She remained in the area of Fort Fisher through January, dispersing bands of Confederate troops, and on the 19th shelled them out of entrenchments near the beach, allowing Union forces to advance and capture a number of prisoners. On 4 February Governor Buckingham stood out to sea, arriving Norfolk Navy Yard on the 8th. As her boilers and machinery were out of repair, she was decommissioned 27 March and on 12 July 1865 was sold at public auction at California.|$|R
