5|$|Following an 1846 treaty, the Winnebago {{tribes of}} Iowa were {{relocated}} to the Long Prairie <b>reservation</b> <b>in</b> central Minnesota {{in the late}} 1840s establishing an important presence in the territory. Because of the poor land in the new reservation the tribe subsequently negotiated a treaty in 1856 allowing them to relocate further south to Blue Earth but ceding substantial land in the process.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley. Their culture was destroyed when gold {{was discovered in}} the early 1850s, causing the subsequent Rogue River Wars. After an 1853 treaty, most of the Takelmas lived on the Table Rock <b>Reservation.</b> <b>In</b> 1856, after the wars ended, they were moved to the Grand Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Reservation.|$|E

5|$|Fort Ridgely {{was built}} in 1853–1854 near the Dakota <b>reservation</b> <b>in</b> southwestern Minnesota, near modern New Ulm. It was named by U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in honor of three army {{officers}} named Ridgely {{who had died in}} the Mexican-American War. The fort was created to watch over the Minnesota River Valley, in addition to the larger frontier. It replaced Fort Doge in Iowa, which was decommissioned during the same period. The fort operated as a military post until 1867.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, {{mindful of}} the federal government's {{disallowance}} of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use {{of the power of}} <b>reservation</b> <b>in</b> Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.|$|E

5|$|Many {{friends and}} acquaintances came to visit the Houstons at Woodland, {{including}} members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe who had allied with Houston during the Texas Revolution; he in return had assisted them in their being granted a <b>reservation</b> <b>in</b> east Texas.

Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Rogue River Indians {{were removed}} in 1856 to {{reservations}} further north. About 1,400 {{were sent to}} the Coast Reservation, later renamed the Siletz Reservation. To protect 400natives still in danger of attack at Table Rock, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, ordered their removal, involving a forced march of 33days, to the newly established Grande Ronde <b>Reservation</b> <b>in</b> Yamhill County, Oregon.|$|E

The highway progressed onward, passing over the Thruway {{on its way to}} a junction with Dunfee Road, a connector leading to US20. NY323 met US20 itself a short distance to the northwest.|$|E

5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile {{of most of the}} rest of the Dakota to the Crow Creek <b>Reservation</b> <b>in</b> Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished {{on the lower}} river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian <b>Reservation.</b> <b>In</b> 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the Grande Ronde Reservation.|$|E
5|$|During 2004, some {{leaders of}} the White Stag Academy {{organized}} a comparable program for the Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast. The program teaches the eleven leadership skills used by White Stag. It was held at Cutter Scout Reservation {{for two years and}} is currently held at Boulder Creek Scout <b>Reservation</b> <b>in</b> the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Girl Scouts assumed leadership of the program after 2006 and renamed it Camp Artemis, after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, animals, and the natural environment. The Youth Staff are referred to as members of ALTA (Artemis Leadership Training Adventure). They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11 – 17 each summer.|$|E
