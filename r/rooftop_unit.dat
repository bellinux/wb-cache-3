40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{assessing}} and extending specific virtual sensors for rooftop units with micro-channel condensers, {{which are a}} growing part of the market. The <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> virtual sensors provide low-cost measurements {{of the amount of}} refrigerant charge, cooling capacity and compressor power and are expected to be embedded within manufactured products in the factory. In addition, a low-cost approach for training the virtual refrigerant charge sensor in an open lab space was proposed and evaluated. The accuracy of virtual <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> sensors were evaluated over a wide range of conditions using measurements obtained in environmental (psychrometric) chambers and were generally within ± 10 % of the values determined from more direct measurements. The concept of low-cost open lab training for virtual charge sensor along with some guidelines to choose open lab training points was evaluated and found to give similar accuracy as sensors trained using a wide range of operating conditions. The total cost of embedding the three virtual sensors in a <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> at a factory would be in the range of $ 60 to $ 120 per unit. This is much less than the cost of directly measuring only two of the three quantities: unit cooling capacity and compressor power. There is no practical direct measurement method for the amount of refrigerant charge to enable cost comparisons with the cost of virtual charge sensing. ...|$|E

The system modeling {{is based on a}} component-based modeling approach, which facilitates flexible simulation of complicated system configurations.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a research and development (R&D) program to design and optimize an active desiccant-vapor compression hybrid rooftop system. The primary objective was to combine the strengths of both technologies to produce a compact, high-performing, energy-efficient system that could accommodate any percentage of outdoor air and deliver essentially any required combination of temperature and humidity, or sensible heat ratio (SHR). In doing so, such a product would address the significant challenges imposed on the performance capabilities of conventional packaged rooftop equipment by standards 62 and 90. 1 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. The body of work completed as part of this program built upon previous R&D efforts supported by the U. S. Department of Energy and summarized by the Phase 3 b report ''Active Desiccant Dehumidification Module Integration with Rooftop Packaged HVAC Units'' (Fischer and Sand 2002), in addition to Fischer, Hallstrom, and Sand 2000; Fischer 2000; and Fischer and Sand 2004. All initial design objectives established for this development program were successfully achieved. The performance flexibility desired was accomplished by a down-sized active desiccant wheel that processes only a portion of the supply airflow, which is pre-conditioned by a novel vapor compression cycle. Variable-speed compressors are used to deliver the capacity control required by a system handling a high percentage of outdoor air. An integrated direct digital control system allows for control capabilities not generally offered by conventional packaged rooftop systems. A 3000 -cfm prototype system was constructed and tested in the SEMCO engineering test laboratory in Columbia, MO, and was found to operate in an energy-efficient fashion relative to more conventional systems. Most important, the system offered the capability to independently control the supply air temperature and humidity content to provide individual sensible and latent loads required by an occupied space without over-cooling and reheating air. The product was developed using a housing construction similar to that of a conventional packaged <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit.</b> The resulting integrated active desiccant rooftop (IADR) is similar in size to a currently available conventional <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> sized to provide an equivalent total cooling capacity. Unlike a conventional <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit,</b> the IADR can be operated as a dedicated outdoor air system processing 100 % outdoor air, as well as a total conditioning system capable of handling any ratio of return air to outdoor air. As part of this R&D program, a detailed investigation compared the first cost and operating cost of the IADR with costs for a conventional packaged approach for an office building located in Jefferson City, MO. The results of this comparison suggest that the IADR approach, once commercialized, could be cost-competitive with existing technology [...] exhibiting a one-year to two-year payback period [...] while simultaneously offering improved humidity control, indoor air quality, and energy efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} on automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) for HVAC systems has shown promising benefits like earlier detection and more accurate isolation of different faults. Â While most researchers, equipment manufacturers, and policymakers agree that HVAC system FDD {{is important and}} {{has the potential to}} reduce significant energy waste due to faulty system operation, widespread adoption of these tools has been slow. Â An automated fault detection and diagnosis system has been developed for packaged (rooftop) air conditioners based on the VOLTTRONTMÂ monitoring and controls framework developed by the Department of Energy. Â The system implements a virtual-sensor-based FDD methodology capable of isolating common <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> faults such as improper refrigerant charge level, heat exchanger fouling, liquid-line restrictions, and compressor valve leakage. Â A fault impact evaluation component has also been implemented {{in order to determine the}} relative impact that faults have on system performance. Â This is accomplished using virtual sensor outputs and manufacturersâ€™ performance map reference models for performance indices such as cooling capacity and COP. Â This system has been implemented using low-cost electronics components and was be tested using a 5 -ton RTU in a laboratory environment. Â In this work, a high-level overview of the automated <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) FDD system structure will be presented detailing how individual software agents interact along with a description of the computational and network requirements of the system.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} about {{the impact on the}} environment of the refrigerants used in HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R equipment are driving development and evaluation of alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potentials (GWPs). Â A new refrigerant blend, labeled DR- 55, has been developed to be a design-compatible alternative to R 410 A. Â The composition was selected to closely match the capacity of R 410 A. Â DR- 55 has the same GWP as R 32 while having a lower burning velocity than R 32 and DR- 5 A. Â Additional benefits include slightly higher thermodynamic efficiency than R 410 A, significantly lower compressor discharge temperature than R 32, and slightly lower sensitivity to ambient temperature than R 410 A (ie, better capacity and efficiency at high ambient temperatures). Â The characteristics of DR- 55 have been introduced by Kujak and Schultz (2015) and Kujak and Schultz (2016 a). Â DR- 55, DR- 5 A, and R 32, along with R 410 A as baseline, have been tested in a 4 -RT commercial unitary <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) in both heating and cooling modes. Â Overall unit performance has been reported by Schultz, et al (2015 a,b) and by Kujak and Schultz (2016 b). Â DR- 55 and DR- 5 A were observed to have performance characteristics very similar and even superior to expectations based on their thermodynamic properties. Â This paper will report the performance of DR- 55, DR- 5 A, and R 32 in comparison to R 410 A at the component level in the <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> tests. Â Analysis of refrigerant-side pressure drop and heat transfer performance in the evaporator and condenser will be presented. Â The lower mass flow rates associated with the alternate refrigerants (wider domes) compared with R 410 A produced lower effective temperature glides in the evaporator and resulted in higher pressures entering the compressor. Â This benefit was offset partially by slightly higher condensing saturation temperatures than R 410 A. Â Compressor performance in terms of volumetric and isentropic efficiencies was observed to be relatively insensitive to the refrigerant present. Â Samples of DR- 55 refrigerant were obtained before and after simulated leak/recharge events. Â Measurement of the compositions indicates that there was essentially no fractionation of the DR- 55 (glide of 2 Â°Fd) while the unit was running under steady-state conditions and no shift in composition despite the repeated leak/recharge events.

40|$|Implementation of {{advanced}} controls and diagnostic features in small commercial buildings typically requires real-time {{monitoring of the}} energy flows, such as the power consumption and cooling capacity of rooftop units.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the investigation of}} two active desiccant module (ADM) pilot site installations initiated in 2001. Both pilot installations were retrofits at existing facilities served by conventional heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems that had encountered frequent humidity control, indoor air quality (IAQ), and other operational problems. Each installation involved combining a SEMCO, Inc., ADM (as described in Fischer and Sand 2002) with a standard packaged <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> built by the Trane Company. A direct digital control (DDC) system integral to the ADM performed the dual function of controlling the ADM/rooftop combination and facilitating data collection, trending, and remote performance monitoring. The first installation involved providing preconditioned outdoor air to replace air exhausted from the large kitchen hood and bathrooms of a Hooters restaurant located in Rome, Georgia. This facility had previously added an additional <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> {{in an attempt to}} achieve occupant comfort without success. The second involved conditioning the outdoor air delivered to each room of a wing of the Mountain Creek Inn at the Callaway Gardens resort. This hotel, designed in the ''motor lodge'' format with each room opening to the outdoors, is located in southwest Georgia. Controlling the space humidity always presented a serious challenge. Uncomfortable conditions and musty odors had caused many guests to request to move to other areas within the resort. This is the first field demonstration performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory where significant energy savings, operating cost savings, and dramatically improved indoor environmental conditions can all be claimed as the results of a retrofit desiccant equipment field installation. The ADM/rooftop combination installed at the restaurant resulted in a reduction of about 34 % in the electricity used by the building's air-conditioning system. This represents a reduction of approximately 15 % in overall electrical energy consumption and a 12. 5 -kW reduction in peak demand. The cost of gas used for regeneration of the desiccant wheel over this period of time is estimated to be only $ 740, using a gas cost of $ 0. 50 per therm [...] the summer rate in 2001. The estimated net savings is $ 5400 annually, resulting in a 1 - 2 year payback. It is likely that similar energy/cost savings were realized at the Callaway Gardens hotel. In this installation, however, a central plant supplied the chilled water serving fan coil units in the hotel wing retrofitted with the ADM, so it was not metered separately. Consequently, the owner could not provide actual energy consumption data specific to the facility. The energy and operating cost savings at both sites are directly attributable to higher cooling-season thermostat settings and decreased conventional system run times. These field installations were selected as an immediate and appropriate response to correct indoor humidity and fresh air ventilation problems being experienced by building occupants and owners, so no rigorous baseline-building vs. test-building energy use/operating cost savings results can be presented. The report presents several simulated comparisons between the ADM/roof HVAC approach and other equipment combinations, where both desiccant and conventional systems are modeled to provide comparable fresh air ventilation rates and indoor humidity levels. The results obtained from these simulations demonstrate convincingly the energy and operating cost savings obtainable with this hybrid desiccant/vapor-compression technology, verifying those actually seen at the pilot installations. The ADM approach is less expensive than conventional alternatives providing similar performance and indoor air quality and provides a very favorable payback (1 year or so) compared with oversized rooftop units that cannot be operated effectively with the necessary high outdoor air percentages...|$|E
40|$|The multi-year {{research}} study was initiated {{to find solutions}} to improve packaged equipment operating efficiency in the field. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), with funding from the U. S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Building Technologies Office (BTO) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) conducted this research, development and demonstration (RD&D) study. Packaged equipment with constant speed supply fans {{is designed to provide}} ventilation at the design rate at all times when the fan is operating as required by building code. Although {{there are a number of}} hours during the day when a building may not be fully occupied or the need for ventilation is lower than designed, the ventilation rate cannot be adjusted easily with a constant speed fan. Therefore, modulating the supply fan in conjunction with demand controlled ventilation (DCV) will not only reduce the coil energy but also reduce the fan energy. The objective of this multi-year research, development and demonstration project was to determine the magnitude of energy savings achievable by retrofitting existing packaged rooftop air conditioners with advanced control strategies not ordinarily used for packaged units. First, through detailed simulation analysis, it was shown that significant energy (between 24 % and 35 %) and cost savings (38 %) from fan, cooling and heating energy consumption could be realized when packaged air conditioning units with gas furnaces are retrofitted with advanced control packages (combining multi-speed fan control, integrated economizer controls and DCV).

40|$|A <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) is {{typically}} {{referred to as}} a unitary system, which employs direct-expansion (DX) air-condensing equipment for cooling and then provides the conditioned air to the space through dedicated air distribution system. Over the years, the DX RTU has wide applications due to its greater flexibility, lower installation cost, and more useful space. System challenges may include reliability, noise, vibration, and humidity control; however, most of these issues have been resolved by technology advancements. One challenge, the compressor 2 ̆ 2 short-cycling, 2 ̆ 2 has not been successfully solved with satisfactory partial load performance and minimum initial cost. This excessive on/off cycling drastically reduces the compressor reliability and increases space humidity. ^ The problem is attributed to the system load modulation not matching the building load variation. Although significant progress has been made to resolve short-cycling, current methods cannot provide a satisfactory solution. Dr. Mingsheng Liu (2004) developed and patented (US 60 / 701, 608) an advanced control algorithm to resolve the DX RTU 2 ̆ 7 s short cycling. This algorithm is based on the fundamental vapor compression theory that different evaporating temperatures will produce varied refrigeration effects. Elimination of the system cycling may be achieved by optimizing supply air temperature reset to match building load condition. ^ This research develops and justifies this advanced control algorithm. A mathematic model has been built to simulate the system performance loads for different weather conditions. Results show short-cycling to be completely eliminated under various operating conditions with no extra energy cost under higher load or humid weather condition and significant savings under the lower load or dry weather condition. In addition, field investigation has been conducted in a functioning office building, which further proves the effectiveness of this advanced control algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|As the United States {{sees the}} {{continued}} expansion of photovoltaic (PV) and other distributed solar generation technologies into the distribution grid, {{there is an}} increased need to find approaches to mitigate integration challenges associated with renewable resources. Depending on the renewable resource, the integration challenges will vary. Much of the challenge with integration {{is associated with the}} uncontrolled oscillations of output power, for example, from a PV array. Both solar and wind resources rely on environmental conditions to produce power. However compared to wind, solar generation resources such as PV typically produce more second to minute oscillations due to cloud patterns. With low levels of penetration, the impact is minimal. This paper focuses on developing advanced control strategies for building equipment like the rooftop units along with energy storage technologies to support seamless PV integration into buildings. A forecasting approach for PV is presented along with model-based control strategies for using load to support the integration of PV. The forecasting model takes as input solar irradiance and module temperature to estimate the output power of PV based on an interconnected voltage. The first step is to poll the cloud patterns for the day and utilize this information to project the cloud density each hour. The trained neural network defines relationship of this cloud cover to the amount of expected solar irradiance that is measured. Temperature data is collected from weather application and is inserted as an initial temperature to the PV model and thermal model. The model develops the corresponding PV curves based on the current module temperature reading and the solar irradiance data provided. The model predicts the average power output of the PV array over the next one-hour time window. A control algorithm for the <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> is presented that utilizes this PV forecast to optimize the energy consumption to match the PV peak generation. The model is validated using irradiance, temperature, and PV output power measurements from Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s 50 kW PV array...|$|E
40|$|A new {{building}} {{application for a}} pre-existing HVAC software tool which calculates the benefits of desiccant-assisted HVAC equipment versus {{the performance of a}} standard vapor-compression system is used to model the monitored results, see Yborra and Spears (2000), for three full-service restaurants. A standard vapor-compression system, an enthalpy assisted vapor-compression system, and a desiccant-assisted vapor-compression system are compared. The vapor-compression portion of each system is comprised of three rooftop units, specifications for each may be found in Yborra and Spears, "Field- Evaluation of Alternative HVAC Strategies to Meet Ventilation, Comfort, and Humidity Control Criteria at Three Full-Serve Restaurants". The software tool uses DOE 2. 1 E as a calculation engine which runs in the background. Previously, the software tool could model two different hotel configurations, a quickserve restaurant, a supermarket, a retail store, an ice arena, a school, a movie theater, a nursing home and a hospital. With the larger eating area, the full-serve restaurant had the capacity for sensible or enthalpy heat recovery from the exhausted air in the sit-down area. Quick-Serve Restaurants (QSR's) were precluded from these energy saving devices as the exhausted air was heavily laden with grease. Still, even with the kitchen exhausts facing away from the <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) intakes, the enthalpy wheels showed noticeable loading from grease. As the field monitoring was performed near Philadelphia, PA, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) hour-by-hour bin TMY 2 meteorological data was used for Philadelphia to model the annual outdoor conditions experienced by each site. Output was provided in the form of humidity bins, monthly energy usage and cost, as well as total annual gas and electric costs. As the fill-serve restaurants were located on the North-Eastem region of the United States, patron comfort was of greater importance to management than annual energy cost savings. Once the model results were determined to properly reflect those of the case studies, the different building equipment types were "moved" around the United States by choosing different bin weather data sets corresponding to Chicago, IL, Atlanta, GA, and Houston, TX. While the default energy rates available in the program are 4 years old, the economic results provide a sound cost comparison...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} program {{targeting}} the market transformation of packaged rooftop air conditioning, five high-efficiency rooftop air conditioning products were selected in 2002 by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Unitary Air Conditioner (UAC) Technology Procurement ([URL] In February 2003, Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia was chosen as the demonstration site. With the goal of validating the field performance and operation of one of the awarded products, a 10 -ton high-efficiency packaged <b>rooftop</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) manufactured by Global Energy Group (GEG) was installed at Fort Gordon in October 2003. Following equipment installation, power metering, air- and refrigerant-side instrumentation was installed on the GEG RTU and a 4 -year old typical-efficiency 20 -ton RTU manufactured by AAON. The GEG and AAON units were instrumented identically and operated May through July, 2005, to observe performance under a range of conditions. Based on the data collected as part of this demonstration, the GEG equipment performed at least 8 % better in stage- 1 (single compressor running) cooling and at least 16 % better in stage- 2 (both compressors running) than the baseline AAON equipment. Performance comparisons are based on what we call application EER normalized to equivalent specific fan power. The full-load, specific-fan-power-normalized application EERs at ARI design conditions were 10. 48 Btu/Wh for the GEG and 9. 00 Btu/Wh for the baseline machine. With a cost premium of nearly 50 %, and slightly higher maintenance costs, the life-cycle cost analysis shows that the GEG technology pays for itself [...] a positive net-present value (NPV) [...] only in climates and buildings with long cooling seasons. Manufacture of this equipment on a larger scale can be expected to reduce costs {{to the point where it}} is more broadly cost-effective. The assumed 10 -ton baseline and new-technology unit costs are $ 3824. 00 and $ 5525. 00 respectively. If the new technology cost is assumed to drop as sales increase to $ 4674. 50 for a 10 -ton unit (i. e. the original cost difference is halved), the life-cycle costs improve. A grid of first cost, annual maintenance cost and electricity price is enumerated and the results presented in the report show the sensitivity of life cycle cost to these three financial parameters in each of eight different climates...|$|E
40|$|Sensors play an {{important}} role in guiding building systems to achieve desired operation and efﬁciency. However, sensors are subject to continuous degradation and failures over time. Although a periodical calibration is needed, it is exceptionally difﬁcult and/or impractical to many sensors with a conventional manual approach. Uncalibrated problematic sensors could signiﬁcantly compromise the systems 2 ̆ 7 performance and lead to unintended loss of energy efﬁciency in buildings. We propose a methodology, termed virtual in-situ calibration, to solve this critical issue. It is developed by mathematically extracting the characteristics of essential aspects involved in a calibration, including the environment assessment, benchmark establishment, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation. A case study of a supply air temperature sensor in <b>rooftop</b> <b>units</b> illustrates the implementation process; the erratic uncertainty is reduced from ± 19. 2 °C to ± 0. 7 °C after the virtual in-situ calibration. The calibration method can be implemented online to signiﬁcantly improve the reliability of sensor networks in buildings...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the floor space in commercial and federal buildings is cooled by single-package <b>rooftop</b> air conditioning <b>units.</b> These units are located on flat roofs and usually operate during the day under hot conditions. They are usually less energy efficient than a chiller system for building cooling. Several U. S. companies are developing systems that employ ice storage in conjunction with chillers to replace older, inefficient <b>rooftop</b> <b>units</b> for improved performance and minimal use of on-peak electricity. Although the low evaporator temperatures needed for ice making tend to reduce {{the efficiency of the}} chiller, the overall operating costs of the ice storage system may be lower than that of a packaged, conventional rooftop installation. One version of this concept, the Roofberg{reg_sign} System developed by the Calmac Corporation, was evaluated on a small building at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Roofberg system consists of a chiller, an ice storage tank, and one or more <b>rooftop</b> <b>units</b> whose evaporator coils have been adapted to use a glycol solution for cooling. The ice storage component decouples the cooling demand of the building from the operation of the chiller. Therefore, the chiller can operate at night (cooler, more efficient condensing temperatures) to meet a daytime cooling demand. This flexibility permits a smaller chiller to satisfy a larger peak cooling load. Further, the system can be operated to shift the cooling demand to off-peak hours when electricity from the utility is generated more efficiently and at lower cost. This Roofberg system was successfully installed last year on a small one-story office building in Oak Ridge and is currently being operated to cool the building. The building and system were sufficiently instrumented to allow a determination of the performance and efficiency of the Roofberg system. Although the energy efficiency of a simulated Roofberg storage/chiller concept operating in the full storage mode was about equal to what could be expected through a simple rooftop efficiency upgrade, the operating costs for the Roofberg system could be much more favorable depending on the utility rate structure. The ability of Roofberg to move much of the cooling load to off-peak periods enables it to take advantage of on-peak demand charges and time-of-use electricity rates. The Roofberg system, as installed, was able to reduce the on-peak energy use of the cooling system to 35 % of the on-peak energy consumption of the baseline system. A comparative analysis of a rooftop replacement and Roofberg indicated that the Roofberg system on Building 2518 would be the better economic choice over a range of demand charges and on-off peak energy prices which are typical of utility rate tariffs for commercial buildings...|$|R
