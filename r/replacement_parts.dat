5|$|The Shuttle fleet {{lost two}} orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003. While the 1986 loss was mitigated by {{building}} the Space Shuttle Endeavour from <b>replacement</b> <b>parts,</b> NASA did not build another orbiter {{to replace the}} second loss. NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making <b>replacement</b> <b>parts</b> quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any <b>replacement</b> <b>parts</b> for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E

5|$|US Navy divers {{began its}} initial recovery, later {{aided by a}} team of {{volunteer}} divers from Great Britain, Iceland, Norway and the United States, bringing up the remains that were sent to the Northrop Aircraft Corporation in Hawthorne, California. Restoration was completed by a 300 strong volunteer group, including 14 retired ex-Northrop employees who had been involved in the original N-3PB production line. The complex restoration required the construction of <b>replacement</b> <b>parts</b> primarily by templating many damaged or corroded original aircraft components {{in order to create a}} complete airframe. In November 1980 the restored N-3PB was gifted to Norway by the Northrop Aircraft Corporation and the San Diego Aerospace Museum. This only surviving aircraft is currently on exhibition as part of Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection at Gardermoen, Norway.|$|E
5|$|In September 1967, Melbourne {{travelled}} to the United States {{to collect}} new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a major refit on {{her return to}} Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while Melbourne was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft {{were not to be}} provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam's heavy anti-aircraft defences. This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and <b>replacement</b> <b>parts</b> in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program, while also disrupting Melbournes post-refit reactivation. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own <b>replacement</b> <b>parts,</b> using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and <b>replacement</b> <b>parts</b> were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E

50|$|After decayed {{or broken}} {{areas of the}} tooth are {{corrected}} by the dentist, an image (scan) is taken of the prepared tooth and the surrounding teeth. This image, called a digital impression, draws the data into a computer. Proprietary software then creates a <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> for the missing areas of the tooth, creating a virtual restoration. This is called reverse engineering. The software sends this virtual data to a milling machine where the <b>replacement</b> <b>part</b> is carved out of a solid block of ceramic or composite resin. Stains and glazes are fired to the surfaces of the milled ceramic crown or bridge to correct the otherwise monochromatic appearance of the restoration. The restoration is then adjusted in the patient’s mouth and cemented or bonded in place.|$|R
