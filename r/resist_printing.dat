While the grayscale image turns to halftone image using the improved error diffusion algorithm, binary watermark is embedded in the edge po-sition.

40|$|Ensuring robust {{patterning}} after OPC {{is becoming}} more and more difficult due to the continuous reduction of layout dimensions and diminishing process windows associated with each successive lithographic generation. Lithographers must guarantee high imaging fidelity throughout the entire range of normal process variations. As a result, post-OPC verification methods have become indispensable tools for avoiding pattern printing issues. The majority of these methods are primarily based on lithographic simulations of pattern printing behaviour across dose and focus variations. The models used for these simulations are compact optical models combined with one single resist model. Even if very predictive resist models exist, they have often a large number of parameters to fit and suffer from long computing times to execute the simulations. Simplified resist models are thus needed to enhance run-time computing during simulation. The objective of this study is to test the predictability of such resist models across the process window. Two different resist models will be considered in this study. The first resist model is a pure variable threshold resist model. The second resist modelling approach is a simplified physical model which uses Gaussian convolutions and a constant threshold to model <b>resist</b> <b>printing</b> behaviour.

50|$|Donald Farnsworth {{at the art}} {{workshop}} Magnolia Editions {{developed a}} digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin. Instead, a series of 'masks' (layers of <b>resist)</b> are <b>printed</b> onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: “The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic random dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you’re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that’s etched are the light tones.” Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the light values be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the lighter values {{to protect them from}} subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.|$|R

The text {{is the most popular}} medium over the internet and many researchers have proposed text watermarking methods in past years. In this study, we propose a new watermarking method based on skeleton algorithm for hiding messages in Chinese text image. In the embedding process, on the basis of character segmentation, the skeleton of each character is extracted and then the location of the bounding box of each skeleton is recorded. Secondly, in each text line, the average center line of the bounding boxes is calculated and the centers of character skeletons are shifted to a position higher or lower than the average center line. The shifting pattern constitutes the watermark. In the extracting process, we firstly conduct the binarization and deskewing operation to the printed-scanned image. Then the remaining phase is very similar to the embedding process. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can successfully <b>resist</b> the <b>print</b> and scan attack and holds much better robustness than that does not use skeleton algorithm...|$|R

In this paper, we report on three topics, The first topic is an analysis of line edge roughness (LER) using a mask Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and the Actinic Inspection Tool (AIT) to compare resist images printed with the ASML ADT. The results of the analysis show a good correlation between the mask AFM and the mask SEM measurements, However, the <b>resist</b> <b>printing</b> results for the isolated space patterns are slightly different.

40|$|The {{region of}} Gujarat {{in the west}} has been an {{important}} textile export zone of India and remains an important source of printed cloth, in terms of both volume and quality. Early evidence of Gujarat’s involvement in international trade of colourful block printed textiles comes from the fragments found at the Fostat excavations in Egypt. These have been dated back to the fifteenth century and have been printed by the <b>resist</b> <b>printing</b> technique. The designs, motifs and colours are typical of the hand block printed textiles characteristic of the region today. Khavda and Dhamadka villages in Kutch were known for printing the exotic rich blue and red cloth known as Ajrakh. These cloths were printed in a complicated sequence that involved both resist and mordant techniques. The deep blue sheen was derived from repeated dipping in indigo followed by vigorous beating and polishing. The most highly prized Ajrakh textiles were bipuri, i. e. the ones printed identically on both sides. Traditionally these were used by men as turbans, lungis (sarongs) and shoulder cloths and also as yardages for women’s skirts and veils. The last fifty years has witnessed a tremendous change in every sphere of life, be it economic, social, technological or aesthetic. More and more, old techniques, design structures and patterns are disappearing or losing integrity as a result of transition into other regional or cultural contexts. Ajrakh, with its rich visual vocabulary {{is in a state of}} transition, as traditional processes, raw materials, designs, product categories and markets are evolving within the worldwide phenomenon called globalization. In spite of the omnipresent changes that have occurred over the last millennium, the printers of Ajrakh in Kutch continue to print some of the same design motifs that have been popular since very earlier times. The origin of Ajrakh can be traced to Sind, Pakistan. Although the name Ajrakh has many legends as to its origin but more popularly the term seems to be derived from Azrak, which means blue in Arabic. The artisans who made these textiles belonged to the Khatri community (both Hindus /Muslims) and have had artisans from the Gajjar community making the blocks in a place called Pethapur, near Ahmadabad. Ajrakh (a term thought to be derived from azraq, the Arabic for blue) has a multitude of uses. Always made in a rectangular format (about 2. 5 x 1. 8 m), Ajrakhs may be used as turbans, shawls, or lungis by men and in certain areas of Kutch, as odhnies by women, not to mention the many household uses to which a large rectangular cloth can be put (Charpai-cover, curtain, floorspread). The designs are restricted to a range of geometrical patterns based on squares, with stars, circles and ellipses arranged symmetrically within them. The traditional colouring of Ajrakh is deep blue and red, with a small amount of white and black. According to popular legend, this textile tradition was started in the family of late Mohammad Siddiki when in the year 1586, Raja Bharmal I, invited his forefathers, to migrate from Sind and settle in Dhamadka, Kachchh. The printers amongst the crafts persons who migrated to Dhamadka from Sind were printing the true Azrak – blue, red and white, used by men of the Maldhari community...|$|E

With a focused white-light or RGB beam even full color imaging with high resolution is possible from an amazingly small device. The form factor is also very interesting for the application in endoscopes. Further applications are light curtains for intrusion control and the generation of arbitrary line patterns for triangulation. Scanning a measurement beam extends point measurements to 1 D or 2 D scans. Automotive LIDAR (laser RADAR) or scanning confocal microscopy are just two examples.

40|$|International audienceAn {{apparatus}} for immersion interferometric lithography {{is described}} here where the interfering beams {{are created by}} illuminating a first diffraction grating followed by a second diffraction grating recombining the diffracted beams onto the photo-resist plane. The main advantage of this system is to be achromatic: thus {{it is possible to}} use a basic commercial ArF excimer laser as the exposure source. We present here the calculations made to evaluate the different parameters that can influence the depth-of-focus in the immersion configuration. As the set-up is mainly based on the two diffraction gratings, it matters to properly design it. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show the optimization made on the diffraction gratings in taking into account their fabrication process since they are fabricated using the capabilities of the silicon line available in our laboratory. On one hand, calculations have been done to determine the second grating period as a function of the first grating period and the ”immersion NA”. By simply adding a fluid to a “dry” system, we will indeed be able to improve the depth of focus but not the resolution. In playing with the diffraction grating periods, we are able to benefit from the introduction of the immersion fluid. We have performed simulations in order to optimize the grating diffraction efficiency as a function of the etch depth and the fractional linewidth. Finally we report on first results obtained with the achromatic immersion interferometer.

40|$|Abstract: This {{technical}} paper reports progress {{on two fronts}} on the proposed {{research in the field}} of Nanoxerography. Aspect 1 reports on a new nanolens approach on the basis of charged <b>resist</b> structures to <b>print</b> nanoparticles with high resolution – a 3 fold size reduction has been observed between the structures and the assembled particles. Directed assembly was observed due to a naturally occurring inbuilt charge differential at the material interface which was further enhanced by corona charging to yield a field strength exceeding 1 MV/m in Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KFM) measurements. The assembly process is independent of the nanomaterial source and type – an evaporative, plasma, and electrospray source have been tested to deposit silicon and metallic nanoparticles. Aspect 2 reports on a new approach to produce high resolution charge patterns using a process that can be scaled to large areas since prior processes were limited to cm 2 sized substrates. A new process was discovered that can potentially scale Nanoxerography to large area printing and possibly roll-to-roll processing. While an extension to roll-to-roll is outside of the scope of the proposed work we decided to include preliminary results on the process in this report. The process is called Nanocontact Electrification and uses forced delamination of insulating surfaces which result in uncompensated surface charges. The process produces charged surfaces and associated fields that exceed the breakdown strength of air leading to strong long range adhesive forces and force distance curves which are recorded over macroscopic distances. The process is applied to fabricate charge patterned surfaces for nanoxerography demonstrating 200 nm resolution nanoparticle prints and applied to thin film electronics where the patterned charges are used to shift the threshold voltages of underlying transistors...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{as soon as}} {{they were}} invented in 1858, {{chemical}} dyes were introduced to Japanese artists and craftsmen. Chemically dyed red, purple, orange and blue silk yarns were woven into elaborate textiles used to furnish the Meiji palaces, costume Noh actors, and wrap Buddhist priests, while dyers adapted resist techniques such as yuzen and stencil <b>resist.</b> Japanese wood-block <b>print</b> artists also responded to the new colors and incorporated them into their work creating vibrant scenes of life during the Meiji period. The bright, bold colors produced with the early synthetic dyes became emblematic of the technological advances of the Meiji period and were know as “the colors of progress. ” This paper is based on a study begun at the Museum of Fine Arts to identify the chemical dyes used in Japan in both textiles and wood-block printing. Standards for the identification of chemical dyes have been created by the Museum’s Conservation Science Department and will serve as a basis for determining which chemical dyes were used by the Japanese and, because many woodblock prints are dated, maybe even begin to identify when the dyes were introduced. The Museum’s collection provides a remarkable resource for such a study. Its woodblock print collection and its collection of Japanese textiles and costume are unrivaled in the United States. The collection contains a remarkable number of Meiji-era textiles collected by one of the museum’s most significant donors of Japanese art, William Sturgis Bigelow. Bigelow lived and traveled throughout Japan during the Meiji period and collected all types of Japanese art, both traditional and contemporary. The Meiji-period textiles and costume that entered the collection include a selection of Noh theater costume, kimono, textile lengths, yuzen samples, furnishing textiles and Buddhist textiles, including kesa, ohi, and uchishiki. The Museum’s collection also contains a book of Meiji-period textile samples purchased by the MFA’s first curator Charles Loring during a visit to the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. The samples in this book will be analyzed and will provide evidence of the first wholesale use of aniline dyes in Japan. While one aspect of this study is to better understand which dyes were used in Japan, an important theme of this paper will be the reasons why chemical dyes were so readily accepted in Meiji Japan and their propagandistic role within the Meiji government as symbols of progress...|$|R
40|$|This exegesis {{presents}} {{the practice of}} handprinted textile design through the activity of designing, sampling and printing fabric. An underlying issue of my textile print practice is the preservation and dissemination of traditional hand printing skills. As textile print technology advances into digital print production and the textile design motif into computer generated imagery and pattern, traditional textile design hand processes are declining. The objective {{of this research is}} to examine and establish refined methods of textile design hand printing, using reactive dye resist techniques onto cellulose fabric. The relationship between design and practice is significant for a textile designer producing handprinted textiles and relies on a connection of technical knowledge and creative output. This is because textile print design involves the use of general design fundamentals in relation to colour, imagery, pattern and composition as well as an understanding and appreciation for fabric and its tactility. In this instance, producing hand-printed textiles with dyes further requires a technical knowledge of dye classes, chemicals and the ways through which imagery {{can be applied to the}} surface of the fabric. The methodology of my research explores a design process that requires creative and craft components as well as a technical comprehension that is informed by chemistry. The scope and impetus for this project originates in an examination of historical and cultural direct resist techniques. The research has been realised through the trialling of contemporary means for <b>printing</b> <b>resist</b> techniques onto cellulose fabrics using reactive dyes. The outcomes include recipes, detailed processes, fabric sampling and the production of a range of larger textile pieces. The exegesis component demonstrates how a working method was established and reflected upon with an examination of literature that addresses the overlap between the chemistry of reactive dyes and the needs of the small-scale or designer-maker print practitioner. This extends to the documentation of different reactive dye classes and comparisons of dye stability for a printed end. The investigations carried out in the print workshop are presented with a survey of the repetitious nature of dye testing and sampling. The samples investigate the possibilities of using reactive dyes for the colour with starch and gum paste as the resist.

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a common}} technique {{in the production of}} printed electronics. Its flexible printing plates offer many advantages, especially regarding printing on rigid and fragile substrates. Nevertheless, one major drawback is the so-called halo effect where ink is squeezed {{at the edges of the}} raised elements of the printing plate during transfer onto the substrate. The result is a halo-like structure surrounding the desired layout with a zone depleted of ink in-between. The approach of this study is to utilize the halo effect in flexographic printing for the structuring of a resist layer in wet etching processes of silver layers with the goal of integrating this process into printed electronics production. For this, three different aspects need to be considered. The first aspect is the influence of post-processing on printed silver layers. I investigated the effect of several parameters of photonic curing on the etching rate and on the sheet resistance of printed silver nanoparticle layers. For the latter, I utilized design of experiments (DoE). The second aspect is the impact of printing parameters on the behavior of printed lines regarding the halo effect in flexography. I investigated the halo effect of printed line structures on an IGT F 1 printability tester, also utilizing DoE. With this method, I structured a resist layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for wet etching processes. The third aspect is the transferral of the layout of the <b>printed</b> etch <b>resist</b> to the silver layer using wet etching. For these trials I used nitric acid as etchant. The results of these investigations are the following: The printed silver layers were homogenous with a roughness of few ten nanometers. As expected, photonic curing does increase the conductivity. The extend of the increase depends on the energy density the sample is exposed to. I found a method to evaluate the isotropy of the electrical properties of printed silver layers using the correction factor in van der Pauw measurements. When printing line shaped elements the halo effect needs to be considered. Nearly all printed samples, regardless the printing parameters, show a more or less pronounced halo effect. Here, the most influential parameter is the pick-up volume: A high pick-up volume results in wide halos around a printed line with a distinct void in-between. The second largest impact has the printing force, whereas the influence of the printing speed is almost negligible. It was not possible to determine a relation between degree of post-processing, i. e. energy density during photonic curing, and etching rate. The measurements were inconclusive. Therefore, I used a different dilution of the etchant to transfer the layout of the <b>printed</b> <b>resist</b> structures into the silver layer. Using the halo effect in flexographic printing for structuring the resist layer, we can obtain line widths smaller than those attainable by directly using flexographic printing. To achieve this, anilox rollers with low pick-up volume are needed. Nevertheless, those lines are hardly reproducible. Their line quality needs further improvement regarding edge sharpness, bulging and interruptions...|$|R
