40|$|The subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) {{distance}} metric is {{a fundamental}} way of comparing evolutionary trees. It has wide-ranging applications, such as to study lateral genetic transfer, viral recombination, and Markov chain Monte Carlo phylogenetic inference. Although the rooted version of SPR distance can be computed relatively efficiently between rooted trees using fixed-parameter-tractable maximum agreement forest (MAF) algorithms, no MAF formulation is known for the unrooted case. Correspondingly, previous algorithms are unable to compute unrooted SPR distances larger than 7. In this paper, we substantially advance understanding of and computational algorithms for the unrooted SPR distance. First we identify four properties of optimal SPR paths, each of which suggests that no MAF formulation exists in the unrooted case. Then we introduce the <b>replug</b> distance, a new lower bound on the unrooted SPR distance that is amenable to MAF methods, and give an efficient fixed-parameter algorithm for calculating it. Finally, we develop a "progressive A*" search algorithm using multiple heuristics, including the TBR and <b>replug</b> distances, to exactly compute the unrooted SPR distance. Our algorithm is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on small trees, and allows computation of unrooted SPR distances as large as 14 on trees with 50 leaves.

40|$|The Italian colonial {{architecture}} is a chapter {{yet to be}} completed, although in recent {{years there has been}} a keen interest in the topic, which has led to important events. The period of greatest expansion of Italian colonialism is the one between {{the second half of the}} twenties, when fascism began the arrangement of the " Terre d’Oltremare " and the important year 1936, when was made the proclamation of the Empire. The Italian colonial developments in Albania was so particular. They were expected economic agreements for the construction of public works, financial assistance to the country, and its entry into the Society of Nations. The present study was conceived with the aim of identifying a specific strand of the Italian colonial, that is what born inside of the Rationalism, and eventually the emergence of colonial and modern architecture. In 1928 were founded the National Bank of Albania, a subsidiary of the Bank of Italy, and the SVEA which guaranteed, plus a huge loan, the use of companies with Italian capital for the construction of the road network and the completion of the new capital Tirana, whose plan was entrusted to architect Armando Brasini. In the Italian colonies have worked among the best urban planners and architects of the time, each with its own training and their militancy in the various movements of the era. Finally, these great masters of architecture studied the ancient local construction systems and materials used, <b>replugging</b> the achievements of modern technology with the great heritage of tradition.

50|$|Later that night, the Simpsons hear {{a strange}} noise outside like {{something}} {{falling from the}} sky. Marge then hears something glugging and belching downstairs. Homer and Bart decide {{to go to the}} basement and investigate. Down in the basement, Bart sees a shadowy figure opening up a can of Duff Beer, who is revealed to be Bender, who reveals he is from the future. Homer and Bender become instant best friends. The next day, Lisa starts to doubt that Bender is actually from the future, since robotic technology in the present is relatively advanced, so Lisa takes Bender to Professor Frink's laboratory. Bender admits that he does not recall why he was sent to the present, so Frink unplugs and <b>replugs</b> Bender's mission protocol, causing Bender to reveal his mission is to terminate Homer; however, he cannot do it, having developed a close friendship with him. A hologram of Turanga Leela and Philip J. Fry and some rabbit-shaped creatures that are attacking New New York appears. Seeing that Bender has not yet killed Homer, Leela and Fry encourage Bender to kill Homer. Lisa asks why he must be killed, and Professor Hubert Farnsworth replies that the creatures have Homer's DNA and Bender was sent back to kill Homer before the creatures could evolve from him. The Professor, Leela and Fry go into the past to kill Homer themselves, but Bender protects Homer, preventing Leela from shooting him. Everyone goes home but Farnsworth, Frink and Lisa, who stay back at the lab to analyse a DNA sample.|$|R

40|$|Currently, most {{cell phones}} utilize wired {{adapters}} to charge, which cause a minor hassle when one frequently needs to unplug and <b>replug</b> their device whenever they {{pick it up}} to use while it is charging. The charging adapter is a pad that phones can be placed on to wirelessly charge the device. The charging adapter consists of two components: the wireless charging platform to supply and transmit the power, and the wireless charging receiver for phones that do not already have an internal receiver included, specifically targeting newer generation iPhones that utilize a lightning port (i. e. iPhone 5, 6, 6 s, 7, 7 s). The wireless charging receiver connects to the smartphone through the charging port and rests between {{the back of the}} phone and its casing. The entire system fully charges the device to 100 % battery capacity within three hours and automatically shuts off upon completion. A unique feature of the charger is that it operates regardless of the orientation of the phone on the pad (an LED indicator notifies the user that the device is charging). The size of the entire charging assembly does not exceed that of a small textbook, allowing ease of transportation and use on a table or surface with limited space. Additionally, the incorporation of an ellipsed surface {{at the top of the}} 3 D-printed base centers the phone while charging and biases it towards the middle where optimum power transfer is achieved. Reverse engineering was done on market examples and designs were made to create a charging platform to supply power. Then a development kit was used to test methods of improving the performance...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the task}} of {{building}} adaptive system software relies on wizardry. Feedback controls for such software systems are written in an ad-hoc manner and are often brittle. As a result, {{it is difficult to}} move an existing control, such as TCP flow control [1], to a new domain such as admission control for CPU scheduling. In addition, existing controls are built with implicit assumptions about the system’s run-time environment and can become unstable in the face of large or discontinuous variations in the environment. We advocate a systematic approach for building adaptive system software based on feedback-control theory. We have implemented the SWiFT toolkit that incorporates this approach. Feedback control helps produce predictable control components. It requires the control goal and design specifications to be clearly stated, thus allowing analysis of properties such as stability. Our approach allows us to leverage the existing body of knowledge in hardware control for controlling software systems. SWiFT allows systematic implementation of feedback-control mechanisms by providing a framework and methodology for building controls that are modular, dynamically reconfigurable, and predictable. Modularity results from our use of components and containers as the underlying abstraction. SWiFT also allows easy dynamic reconfiguration of components by limiting the interaction between components to a simple input/output model and by supporting guarding and <b>replugging</b> of controllers [2]. This reconfiguration allows the application to adapt efficiently across a wide range of operating conditions. SWiFT supports predictability by providing analysis tools based on control theory. Also SWiFT provides GUI debugging tools such as a software oscilloscope and a library of feedback components such as low pass filters to simplify building adaptive system software. We have implemented SWiFT in C++ and Java and we have applied it to user-level applications running on Windows NT. Version 1. 0 of SWiFT is available (along with a tutorial) a...|$|R

50|$|Walter Naugus is {{the name}} of his reboot universe's counterpart, and he and King Acorn had both been banished into the Special Zone by Dr. Eggman after he began his rise to power. This was Naugus' just desserts, as he had plotted with Eggman and Snively to {{overthrow}} the king. The two eventually escaped, and Naugus sought to claim the kingdom for himself, only to lose his powers as a result of Eggman's Genesis Wave. Seeking to restore them, he stole technology from Eggman and imprisoned the king in order to force hologram Freedom Fighter NICOLE to create a means by which he could restore his magic. However, she ended up restoring his memories of the original reality instead, which caused him to flee Mobotropolis in terror, allowing Sonic and Tails to rescue NICOLE and the king. He later joins up with his twin sister Wendy to take over Eggmanland, using several Master Emerald shards to regain his magic. After the plan failed, he gets away and begins to rebuild the Master Emerald supposedly. He later runs into trouble with Knuckles and Amy and Team Dark, responding by compromising Omega and coaxing Knuckles into giving him the Master Emerald shards by pretending to another echidna named Nixus. After some difficulty, he reconstructed the Master Emerald, but his powers were still limited, and he was defeated by Team Dark while Knuckles and Amy <b>replugged</b> the Master Emerald back into Angel Island, thus saving it from crashing onto the restoring planet. Naugus was incarcerated by G.U.N. In this reality his grotesque form, not recognizable as any one species, has apparently been identified as a Troll.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} United States Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) {{sponsored}} project, The Quantification of Wellbore Leakage Risk Using Non-destructive Borehole Logging Techniques, {{the construction}} and integrity of a 68 year old well was studied. This study builds upon previous work examining the integrity of existing wells through shale formations. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure well integrity through potential caprocks and aid in understanding the potential leakage risk posed by old wells that intersect CO 2 injection projects. The well was originally completed as a production well in the Gulf Coast region in 1945 and then plugged and abandoned in 1969. The well was re-entered and re-completed as an observation well for a CO 2 injection project in 2008. It was <b>replugged</b> and abandoned after completing its observation role in 2013. For this study the well was logged using cement bond log and ultrasonic mapping tools, tested and sampled using a dynamic tester, and cored using a sidewall coring tool. The age of this well makes it the oldest well to be studied in this manner and this is the first well to be studied this way in the region. The results of the study indicate that much of the material behind the casing is unconsolidated cement. Logging results in many places in the well show poor isolation potential and indicate a microannulus. The logs also indicate removal of material during hydraulic testing which was confirmed by laboratory analysis. Of the six cores collected, four consisted of unconsolidated, soft, cement or rock, one consisted of heavily altered cement, and one consisted of slightly altered cement. The results of study are an interesting contrast to earlier field studies because they show an old well that lacked integrity at most of the test and sample points. However, the logging and a core sample in the squeezed zone indicate that there was zonal isolation between the injection and monitoring zones. The logging and mapping data along with the analysis of the “core” material collected provide insight into the potential leakage pathways within the well...|$|E
