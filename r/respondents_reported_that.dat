Results: <b>Respondents</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> the needs of dying patients are often insufficiently addressed by health care professionals.

The highest rated classes of variations included in the curriculum are arterial (76 %), venous (68 %), followed by organs (64 %). All trainees learn about anatomical variations from surgeons and radiologists (100 %) and via suggested textbooks of the specialty (87. 1 %). A total of 54. 8 % <b>report</b> <b>that</b> specialty training curricula do not suggest specific anatomical variation classifications for the trainees to learn, and 16. 1 % are uncertain if the colleges provide such kind of instruction.
