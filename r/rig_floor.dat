40|$|Increased {{demand for}} oil and gas pushes {{producers}} to develop and enhance methods for exploring deeper reservoirs located in offshore fields. With greater depths comes greater complications, this greater water depth along with other unknown formation factors in conjunction with the high daily rental cost of offshore rigs, equipment and personnel renders performing research and development on a deep water offshore well prohibitively expensive. However, with the occurrence of incidents such as the Macondo in 2010, regulators and operators have been prompted to be more cautious and perform research in offshore drilling operations, to better understand the unknown factors which involve the deepwater conditions. This thesis investigates riser gas migration while drilling offshore wells using the EC-Drill? technology. EC-Drill? is a variation of Dual Gradient Drilling, where two fluid gradients are achieved by controlling the annular mud level in the riser via subsea pumps, voiding the top section to air, forming the two gradients; air in top section and drilling mud for the remaining fluid column, providing dynamic control of the Bottom Hole Pressure and improved drilling and well control capabilities, which reduce costs, non-productive time and create a safer drilling environment. However, one of the issues of voiding the riser to air in the EC-Drill? is that if a gas kick occurs or gas is drilled, then the gas entering the system will rise to the voided section of the riser creating a combustible mixture of gas and air below the <b>rig</b> <b>floor,</b> leading to devastating results such as equipment damage, losing the well, and even death. These results make it important to understand and mitigate the problem of gas migration. This study provides the design process of the experiment facility in which the gas migration study was performed and the preliminary tests that were done to study gas migration. The method of elimination that was proposed for the testing facility was called the ?top fill technique?, where additional drilling fluid is injected {{from the top of the}} riser in the annulus, causing a downward flow motion which is meant to prevent the gas from rising up. The injected drilling fluid is then returned to the <b>rig</b> <b>floor</b> through the EC-Pump mounted on the riser along with the gas. This method requires a priori knowledge of the amount of drilled gas, mud properties, circulation rates, the injection rate and the required downward flow which is obtained through experiments. To perform the necessary experiments a small-scale simulator was designed at the University Services Building at Texas A&M University, following the guidelines provided by the EC-Drill? Technology Providers and available literature. The model was scaled to 1 / 3 of actual riser size and initial tests were done using water to prove the successful design and installation of the equipment. Following this, the scaled model was prepared and calibrated to accommodate clear drilling mud to provide visual study of the gas migration phenomenon. However, due to the limitations of the pump rates and flow meters along with the use of water as a drilling mud, the tests were unsuccessful in fully mitigating the gas migration issue, leading to the need of upgrading the equipment that were used to run the tests...|$|E

40|$|Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD) are a {{portfolio}} of drilling systems that in various ways pumpreturns from the well through a mud return line (MRL) from the seafloor, or somewhere between the seafloor and the <b>rig</b> <b>floor.</b> Two variations exist, {{with or without a}} marine riser. The system without riser is an open system which is intended for tophole sections where a blowout preventer (BOP) is not used. When depths are reached that require a BOP, a subsea BOP can be applied together with a riser. Both systems results in the augmentation of the fluid column by adding a lighter fluid gradient on top of the outtake to the MRL and subsea pump. In the event of an open system, this will be the seawater, with riser different blanket fluids can be used, like seawater, nitrogen or just a lighter mud component like base oil. The controlled mud pressure (CMP) system is offered by AGR and applies a MRL together with a subsea pump to take returns from the wellhead to the rig. This system uses a riser,and can thus drill deeper than tophole applications and is intended to handle well control situations. Together with systems such as @Balanceâs dynamic annular pressure control (DAPC) system and Secure Drillingâs microflux control (MFC) it represents the future of automated kick detection, control and handling. The two latter are offered as parts or supplements to mainly managed pressure drilling (MPD) systems. One of them also aims to increase safety by automation to all drilling systems on any rig. The CMP technology can be seen as enabling and improving for drilling deep water prospects, as well as through zones with either tight drilling windows or depleted pressures. The potential for automated well control can become a major increase in safety and improvethe way kicks are handled. There are some challenges still to overcome, mainly the development of the anti u-tube valve, or other options to solve problems related to u-tubing, as well as looking into the issue of gas boiling in the circulation system. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} has typically used the single gradient system to drill wells offshore. With this system the bottom hole pressure was controlled by a mud column extending from the drilling rig to the bottom of the wellbore. This mud column was used to achieve the required bottom hole pressure. But, as the demand for oil and gas increased, the industry started exploring for oil and gas in deep waters. Because of the narrow margin between the pore and fracture pressures it is somewhat difficult to reach total depth with the single gradient system. This led to the invention of the dual gradient system. In the dual gradient method, heavy density fluid runs from the bottom hole to the mudline and a low density fluid from the mudline to the <b>rig</b> <b>floor</b> so as to maintain the bottom hole pressure. Several methods have been developed to achieve the dual gradient drilling principle. For this research project, we paid more attention to the liquid lift, dual gradient drilling (riser dilution method). This method of achieving dual gradient drilling was somewhat different from the others, because it does not utilize elaborate equipment and no major changes are made on the existing drilling rigs. In this thesis the technical feasibility of using the liquid lift method over the other methods of achieving dual gradient drilling was determined. A computer program was developed to simulate the wellbore hydraulics under static and dynamic conditions, injection rate and base fluid density required to dilute the riser fluid and finally, u-tubing phenomena. In this thesis we also identified some problems associated with the liquid lift method and recommendations were made on how these problems can be eliminated or reduced. Emphases were placed on the effect of u-tubing, injection rate of base fluid at the bottom of the riser and well control issues facing this system...|$|E
40|$|Three {{sites were}} drilled in the Izu-Bonin forearc basin during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 126. High-quality {{formation}} microscanner (FMS) data {{from two of}} the sites provide images of part of a thick, volcaniclastic, middle to upper Oligocene, basin-plain turbidite succession. The FMS images were used to construct bed-by-bed sedimentary sections for the depth intervals 2232 - 2441 m below <b>rig</b> <b>floor</b> (mbrf) in Hole 792 E, and 4023 - 4330 mbrf in Hole 793 B. Beds vary in thickness from those that are near or below {{the resolution of the}} FMS tool (2. 5 cm) to those that are 10 - 15 m thick. The bed thicknesses are distributed according to a power law with an exponent of about 1. 0. There are no obvious upward thickening or thinning sequences in the bed-by-bed sections. Spaced packets of thick and very thick beds may be a response to (1) low stands of global sea level, particularly at 30 Ma, (2) periods of increased tectonic uplift, or (3) periods of more intense volcanism. Graded sandstones, most pebbly sandstones, and graded to graded-stratified conglomerates were deposited by turbidity currents. The very thick, mainly structureless beds of sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and pebble conglomerate are interpreted as sandy debris-flow deposits. Many of the sediment gravity flows may have been triggered by earthquakes. Long recurrence intervals of 0. 3 - 1 m. y. for the very thickest beds are consistent with triggering by large-magnitude earthquakes (M = 9) with epicenters approximately 10 - 50 km away from large, unstable accumulations of volcaniclastic sand and ash on the flanks of arc volcanoes. Paleocurrents were obtained from the grain fabric of six thicker sandstone beds, and ripple migration directions in about 40 thinner beds; orientations were constrained by the FMS images. The data from ripples are very scattered and cannot be used to specify source positions. They do, however, indicate that the paleoenvironment was a basin plain where weaker currents were free to follow a broad range of flow paths. The data from sandstone fabric are more reliable and indicate that turbidity currents flowed toward 150 infinity during the time period from 28. 9 to 27. 3 Ma. This direction is essentially along the axis of the forearc basin, from north to south, with a small component of flow away from the western margin of the basin...|$|E

If no action is taken to stop a kick once it begins, then the fluids will be pushed out of the borehole and will be flowing uncontrollably to surface (blow-out). Blow-out is prevented by closing off the well at the surface with special kind of valves (Blow-out Preventers - BOPs). When pressure control over the well is lost, swift action must be taken to avert the severe consequences. These consequences may include: â endangering of human life, â loss of rig and equipment, â negative influence on the environment, â additional costs of bringing the well under control again, â loss of reservoir production.

With the depleting reservoirs on land and increasing demand for hydrocarbons, the exploration for reservoirs has been moving to deeper and deeper water. The current technology has reached its limit in water depth, and new technology needs to be introduced if exploration is to be continued into even deeper water. One proposed method is subsea mudlift drilling (SMD), which is a joint industry project. The method uses a seafloor pump, which pumps the mud from the annulus at seafloor, through a separate small diameter pipe, such as the choke and kill line, to the <b>rig</b> <b>floor.</b> Because of the expected problems with u-tubing, a drillstring valve (DSV) has been developed to be installed in the drillstring. With new drilling technology comes new well control procedures. The toolkit is a well control tool that is used for almost any well control situation that may arise. The purpose of the research at hand was to develop and present a toolkit for subsea mudlift drilling on the basis of conventional toolkits. The DSV had not previously been modeled, and its response to changes in mudweight, flowrate, water depth etc. has been unknown to this point in time. The toolkit includes a model for the DSV, which can generate plots of pressure drop over the DSV for any changes. The results were examined for several cases, and the pressure response and characteristics of the DSV were mapped. The optimum location for the DSV in the drillpipe also was investigated. It was found that if the DSV were located just above the blow out preventer (BOP), the pressure differential over the DSV would be maximized. Maximizing the pressure difference over and under the flowcone on the DSV will result in a larger opening in the DSV, and thus less pressure will be lost through the DSV choke. If logging tools are to be run in the drillstring, the DSV must be placed {{in the bottom of the}} drillstring, near the bit. It is also recommended that all measurement while drilling (MWD) tools be installed between the bit and the DSV, as this will also increase the pressure differential over the DSV flowcone. During conventional drilling a straight-line approximation is often used to predict the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule. This research also established that for low flowrates, with no geometric well deviation, such a method might also be used for SMD. However, using a well control method as that is tailored for subsea mudlift drilling, the flowrate will be relatively high and the straight-line approximation will not be valid. In the case of high flowrates and a deviated well, the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule should always be calculated using the toolkit...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} the Deepwater Horizon {{drilling}} rig's blowout preventer has been pointed to {{as one of the}} main causes of the Macondo accident on April 10 th 2010. The blowout preventer system is one the most important safety barriers in a hydrocarbon well. The accident has created a demand for improved methods of assessing the reliability of blowout preventer systems. The objective of this master thesis is to propose improvements to current reliability assessment methods for complex safety critical systems such as the blowout preventer. The report begins by describing the blowout preventer system. It is a system consisting of two main subsea parts containing the annular and ram blowout preventer valves which are used to seal off a well {{in the event of a}} subsea well kick. These annular and ram type preventers are governed by an electro-hydraulic control system which is operated by human interaction from control panels located on the <b>rig</b> <b>floor.</b> A functional analysis of the blowout preventer system is presented next. Essential functions are defined, and performance criteria for these functions identified. An approach to classification of blowout preventer functions is also presented, before the report moves on to the analysis of four main operational situations to which the blowout preventer is exposed, and whose characteristics have implications for the system's ability to act as a safety barrier. The pros and cons of different widely used blowout preventer system configurations is also discussed. Three main types of configurations are mentioned in the report; the modern configuration, traditional configuration and the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer system configuration. A literature survey which documents previous blowout preventer reliability studies performed by Per Holand on behalf of SINTEF is presented. An evaluation of validity of the operational assumptions which have been made in these previous studies is also provided, such as such as assumptions regarding operational situations, failure input data, and several important assumptions regarding testing of blowout preventer systems. Regulations and guidelines which are relevant to blowout preventer reliability are also described here. The report further discusses how the blowout preventer may fail, and which types of failures modes are considered critical from a safety perspective. Some theoretic principles behind common cause failures are presented, along with a description of how common cause failures should be included in reliability assessments of safety critical systems through an approach called the PDS approach. This is followed by a discussion of possible sources for common cause failures in the blowout preventer system. As a suggestion towards how reliability assessments of blowout preventers can be improved, and some of the identified challenges solved, a reliability quantification method is presented. The method is based on post-processing of minimal cut sets from a fault tree analysis of the blowout preventer system, and produces more conservative and accurate approximations of the reliability than those produced through conventonal methods. The method is also capable of taking into account common cause failures. The results from the calculations are presented and discussed. An event tree which illustrates the effect from an escalated well control situation on the blowout preventer's ability to act as a safety barrier is also presented, along with a discussion of how blowout preventer reliability could possibly be more appropriately assessed through event tree analysis. Finally, the conclusions from the thesis are provided. The main conclusions are that the approach based on fault trees and post-processing of minimal cut sets can certainly be used to improve the quality of blowout preventer reliability estimates, and also provides a sound platform for including common cause failures in the analysis. Another key finding is that the fault tree, which is a "static model", poorly illustrates the criticality of "preventer-specific" components in escalated well control situations, since the unavailablility of certain functions due to operational conditions has little or no implication of the reliability estimates produced. In contrast, the criticality of common control system components is certainly emphasised by the fault tree model. The author suggests that quantificaiton of blowout preventer systems through fault tree analysis should be supplemented by event tree analysis to better evaluate the effect from escalation of the well control situation. Furthermore, the author recommends that a test coverage factor should be included when calculating the safety unavailability of components exclusive to shearing rams, since these cannot be fully function tested through conventional, non-destructive blowout preventer tests. It is also recommended that the industry investigate the accuracy with which the location of tool joints in the wellbore annulus can be determined through current methods. Improper spacing of tool joints is critical in a well control situation where the shear rams must be activated. </p...|$|E
