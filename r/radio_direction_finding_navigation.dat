50|$|A {{weather or}} {{sounding}} balloon is a balloon (specifically {{a type of}} high-altitude balloon) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed {{by means of a}} small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> or <b>navigation</b> systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS).

5000|$|Watt and Herd {{wrote an}} {{extensive}} {{paper on the}} system in 1926, referring to it as [...] "An instantaneous direct-reading radiogoniometer" [...] and stating {{that it could be}} used to determine the direction of signals lasting as little as 0.001 seconds. The paper describes the device in depth, and goes on to explain how it could be used to improve <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> and <b>navigation.</b> In spite of this public demonstration, and films showing it being used to locate lightning, the concept apparently remained unknown outside the UK.

50|$|An ARDF {{competition}} normally {{takes place}} in diverse wooded terrain, such as in a public park or natural area but competitions have also been held in suitable suburban areas. Each competitor receives a detailed topographic map of the competition area. The map will indicate {{the location of the}} start with a triangle and the location of the finish with two concentric circles. Somewhere within the competition area designated on the map, the meet organizer will have placed five low power radio transmitters. The locations of the transmitters are kept a secret from the competitors and are not marked on the map. Each transmitter emits a signal in Morse code by which it is easily identifiable to the competitors. The transmitters automatically transmit one after another in a repeating cycle. Depending on entry classification, a competitor will attempt to locate as many as three, four, or all five of the transmitters in the woods, and then travel to the finish line in the shortest possible time. Competitors start at staggered intervals, are individually timed, and are expected to perform all <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> and <b>navigation</b> skills on their own. Standings are determined first by the number of transmitters found, then by shortest time on course. Competitors who take longer than the specified time limit to finish may be disqualified.|$|R

50|$|Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> (ARDF, {{also known}} as radio orienteering and radiosport) is an amateur racing sport that {{combines}} <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> with the map and compass skills of orienteering. It is a timed race in which individual competitors use a topographic map, a magnetic compass and <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> apparatus to navigate through diverse wooded terrain while searching for radio transmitters.

50|$|Another {{variation}} of the sport, Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area, requires less athletic skill and more technical <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> skills. In a ROCA course, the transmitters put out very little power, typically 10 to 200 mW, and can be received over only very short distances. The transmitters are physically small, and marked with a control card that is {{no larger than a}} typical postcard with a unique number identification. Because of the low power and short distances involved, most ROCA competitors walk the entire course, and focus their attention on the <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> tasks rather than navigation.|$|R

50|$|The sport {{originated}} in Northern Europe and Eastern Europe {{in the late}} 1950s. Amateur radio was widely promoted in the schools of Northern and Eastern Europe as a modern scientific and technical activity. Most medium to large cities hosted one or more amateur radio clubs at which members could congregate and learn about the technology and operation of radio equipment. One of the activities that schools and radio clubs promoted was <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding,</b> an activity that had important civil defense applications during the Cold War. As few individuals in Europe had personal automobiles at the time, most of this <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> activity took place on foot, in parks, natural areas, or school campuses. The sport of orienteering, popular in its native Scandinavia, had begun to spread {{to more and more}} countries throughout Europe, including the nations of the Eastern Bloc. As orienteering became more popular and orienteering maps became more widely available, it was only natural to combine the two activities and hold <b>radio</b> <b>direction</b> <b>finding</b> events on orienteering maps.|$|R
