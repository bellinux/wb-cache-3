40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{graph-based}} approach to modelling asynchronous languages and {{show how the}} new model {{can be viewed as}} a collapse of the standard transition system model for asynchronous behaviour by utilising the commuting properties of asynchronous transitions. The motivation behind these new models stems from the issue of regularity for asynchronous processes. We note that the class of <b>regular</b> <b>processes</b> fails to contain many useful asynchronous processes and we identify a larger subclass of BPP accordingly. We call this new class asynchronously <b>regular</b> <b>processes.</b> Using the new models we provide two appealing abstract characterisations of asynchronous bisimulation equivalence, namely, as spans of open maps and as a winning strategies for a bisimulation game. Also, by exploiting the coincidence of finite graphs with <b>regular</b> <b>processes</b> we see that bisimulation is polynomial time decidable over our class of asynchronously <b>regular</b> <b>processes.</b> 1 Introduction It is becoming increasingly cle [...] ...|$|R

The proposed scheme is orthogonal to the techniques that reduce the spatial density of collected samples deactivating nodes with similar measurements. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used along with these techniques. Results show that for very <b>regular</b> <b>processes</b> the scheme can reduce around 90 % the total amount of samples sent in the network and even for less <b>regular</b> <b>processes</b> the proposed scheme can reduce between 10 and 20 % the total amount of samples sent with small reconstruction errors.
