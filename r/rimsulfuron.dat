40|$|ABSTRACTPanicoid grasses {{are major}} weeds of maize and {{sugarcane}} {{as well as}} of several other important grains, including sorghum, pearl millet, and foxtail millet. Pot trials were conducted to study the activity and potential interactions of topramezone in mixture with recommended rates of <b>rimsulfuron</b> or nicosulfuron on three annual panicoid grasses (i. e.

On the basis of fresh weight reduction, topramezone alone provided 78 % control of E. oryzoides, 68 % control of E. phyllopogon, and 99 % control of P. miliaceum. Topramezone plus <b>rimsulfuron</b> or nicosulfuron provided decreased control of both Echinochloa spp. compared with topramezone alone. The decreased control of E. oryzoidesand E. phyllopogon was more pronounced with <b>rimsulfuron</b> as a companion herbicide in the mixtures. Slightly decreased control of P. milaceum was observed with topramezone plus <b>rimsulfuron</b> compared with topramezone alone, but {{this was not the case}} for topramezone plus nicosulfuron.

40|$|A {{modified}} {{method for}} the analysis of nicosulfuron, <b>rimsulfuron</b> and prosulfuron was developed and validated by using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection in the ultraviolet region (HPLC-UV-DAD). The most important experimental parameters of extraction procedure and HPLC-UV-DAD technique were optimised in respect to those sulfonylurea herbicides. High recoveries of the microwave-assisted extraction were obtained by using a dichloromethane–acetonitrile mixture (2 : 1 volume ratio) acidified with acetic acid (0. 8 vol. %) with the addition of urea. The mean recoveries at three spiking levels ranged from 97. 47 to 98. 76 % for nicosulfuron, 97. 88 to 99. 17 % for <b>rimsulfuron</b> and from 97. 91 to 99. 83 % for prosulfuron. The limits of detection of nicosulfuron, <b>rimsulfuron</b> and prosulfuron were 0. 95, 0. 91 and 0. 89 μg kg– 1, respectively. The accuracy of the developed method was confirmed by HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry parallel analyses. The developed method was used to investigate the dissipation dynamics of sulfonylurea herbicides in the real field trials in Vojvodina Province, Serbia. The obtained half-lives were 0. 05, 0. 23 and 0. 15 days for recommended dose application of nicosulfuron, <b>rimsulfuron</b> and prosulfuron, respectively. Low residues and short half-life in soil suggested that the risk to sensitive rotational crops after application of those sulfonylurea herbicides is low when they are used in the appropriate dosages.

40|$|The {{side effects}} of {{sulfonylurea}} and imidazolinone herbicides on plant-associated bacteria were investigated under pure culture conditions. Eighteen isolates, belonging to the genera Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bacillus, Enterobacter Pseudomonas and Serratia, were exposed to four active compounds at concentration ranges {{similar to those in}} field soil. The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and <b>rimsulfuron</b> inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates. Surfactants in commercial formulation significantly enhanced <b>rimsulfuron</b> toxicity. With the exception of one Azospirillum strain, the differential tolerance of rhizobacteria to these herbicides was related to a differential sensitivity of their target, the activity of the first enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). Greenhouse pot studies were performed to assess the occurrence of inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in field conditions. Maize seedlings were bacterized with the two strains which had shown in vitro sensitivity to sulfonylureas. Following the application to the soil of a commercial formulation of <b>rimsulfuron</b> at rates of 0, 0. 2 and 0. 5 mol a. i. kg– 1, significative differences in the resulting degree of bacterial root colonization were found. Moreover, upon co-inoculation with two strains, one tolerant and one sensitive to the herbicide, the presence of <b>rimsulfuron</b> significantly enhanced root occupancy by resistant bacteria, suggesting that shifts in the microbial community structure of crop rhizosphere could indeed result as a consequence of weed control by AHAS inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{adsorption}} of the sulfonylurea herbicide <b>rimsulfuron,</b> [N-((4, 6 -dimethoxypyrimidin- 2 -yl) aminocarbonyl) - 3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinesulfonamide], on {{clay minerals}} with different saturating cations was studied. Three smectites with different lattice charge distribution (hectorite, montmorillonite and nontronite) were selected and made homoionic to Ca 2 +, Cu 2 + and AP +. Because of {{the instability of}} <b>rimsulfuron</b> in water, the experiments were carried out in chloroform solution. The interaction mechanism depends {{on the nature of}} the saturating cation and the tetrahedral layer charge of the silicate. Among the exchangeable ions studied, only AP + is able to produce degradation of the herbicide to N-(4, 6 -dimethox-ypyrimidin- 2 -yl) -N-[(3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinyl]urea. In this case, the lower the tetrahedral charge, the more active the degradation. The Ca 2 +-saturated clays are ineffective in the degradation. In contrast, the formation of a stable chelate complex with the saturating ion permits <b>rimsulfuron</b> to be adsorbed to a rather high extent into Cu(II) -clays and to be stable against degradation...|$|E
40|$|Four new adjuvants, each at a {{concentration}} of 1 parts per thousand, have been tested to activate and also to decrease {{the rate of the}} systemic graminicides fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and clodinafop-propargyl against blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) as possible substitutes of paraffinic oil (3 l/ha) in winter wheat and to activate the sulfonylureas <b>rimsulfuron</b> and nicosulfuron against bamyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.) and certain dicotyledonous weeds in maize in comparison with standard adjuvants for <b>rimsulfuron</b> (alkyl-aryl-polyglycolether) and nicosulfuron (formulation containing maize oil). Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and clodinafop-propargyl gave with the addition of new adjuvants ('Atplus' 450, SCS 3976, SCS 3338 and SCS 3610), the same very good (almost 100 %) control of A. myosuroides in comparison with addition of 3 l/ha paraffinic oil. In maize, the control off crus-galli L. with <b>rimsulfuron</b> or nicosulfuron was always better with addition of 'Atplus' 450, SCS 3976, SCS 3338 or SCS 3610 in comparison with the standard adjuvants. For the dicotyledonous weeds present, the results were more species dependent. With <b>rimsulfuron</b> and in comparison with standard adjuvant, control of Chenopodium, album L. was better if 'Atplus' 450 or SCS 3976 was added, that of Polygonum persicaria L. if SCS 3338 was added but against Matricaria recutita L. a tankmix with standard adjuvant was the best. With nicosulfuron in comparison with standard adjuvant, control of P. persicaria, io L. was better with addition of 'Atplus' 450, SCS 3338 or SCS 3610 and control of Stellaria media L. was only better with SCS 3338, while M. recutita and C. album were clearly better controlled with the standard nicosulfuron formulation with built-in maize oil.

Natural soil samples and the same soil after oxidation with H 2 O 2 (to destroy the organic matter) were treated with the herbicide and exposed to light irradiation or kept in the dark, as control samples. Kinetic parameters of reactions were calculated. Herbicide sorption was ascertained to be the more important reaction in the soil, but the retention of <b>rimsulfuron</b> was significantly reduced after H 2 O 2 treatment of soil.

40|$|Diffusion of {{herbicide}} residues and derived substances in ecosystems can arise from agrochemical treatments, depending on environmental interactions and the chemical {{characteristics of the}} parent molecules and their degradation products.

The fresh weight of both species was greatly decreased by trifluralin followed by fluometu-ron and atrazine. The dry weight was, in general, only slightly decreased by all the herbicides with the largest response with trifluralin. On the other hand, the activit-ies of PAL and Cl were greatly enhanced in both species by alachlor and <b>rimsulfuron,</b> but decreased by trifluralin. Fluometuron induced decreases in PAL activity of maize only and decreased Cl activity of maize and soybean seedlings. Moreover, hydroxyphen-olic compounds were increased in both species by alachlor and <b>rimsulfuron</b> and decreased by trifluralin and atrazine. Similarly, anthocyanin content was increased in both seedlings by alachlor and rimsulfu-ron, but decreased by trifluralin and fluometuron, whereas atrazine decreased the anthocyanin content in maize only. The present results indicate that stress is maintained by the different herbicides and confirm the controlling action of PAL and Cl on the production of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds during the induced state of stress. In addition, dry weight reduc-tion appeared to coincide with the changes in the parameters of secondary metabolism, suggesting a regulatory role of secondary metabolism on seedling growth.
