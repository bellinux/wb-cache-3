Notable results were: 1) Potassium and nitrate movement in the medium was slower than would occur by diffusion in water; therefore, movement {{can be explained by}} diffusion alone. Lack of visible water-stress symptoms, plant height, and shoot dry weights and fresh weights indicate that water flow rates were adequate to meet the demand of plant transpiration. Populations of T. harzianum increased with increasing concentrations of K⁺ and NO₃, and populations were higher when a corn plant was present. 2) A nonwoven polypropylene fabric container physically prevented root penetration, and reduced, but did not eliminate <b>root</b> <b>circling.</b> A Cu(OH) ₂-latex paint suspension applied to the fabric containers increased root density, and improved root distribution. Neither the fabric container nor the copper treatment had an adverse effect on plant growth. 3) Treating fabric root pouches with either copper treatment, Spinout or Texcide, significantly increased the percentage of corn root length colonized by the VA endomycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradix without adversely affecting plant shoot growth.

Trees with circling barriers had fewer numbers of roots than controls (no barriers), but mean root diameters were similar. Root depth 30 cm outside barriers was greater for trees with barriers, but at 90 and 150 cm away, depth was equivalent to controls. Roots tended to grow toward the soil surface after growing under the barriers. No consistent differences in root response {{to any of the}} four types of barriers tested were found for either species. Soil cultivation during the installation of a subsurface barrier (used to simulate a hardpan) resulted in lower soil bulk densities and a deeper distribution of roots in the soil profile than in plots which were not cultivated.

30|$|There is a flow {{diversion}} surface with zero speed in forming the cylindrical hollow billet process, {{in which the}} material flows inwards inside the radius of the shunt circle and outwards outside the shunt circle (Ghassemali et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2014). The outside diameter of the hollow billet is smaller than the <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> of the multi-sprocket. Therefore, the upsetting process in initially filling the die cavity was ignored to facilitate analysis (Wu and Wang 1992; Yang et al. 1999). The multi-row sprocket billet was divided into 2 N deformation units and each unit (N/ 2) was subdivided into five plastic deformation zones whose boundaries were ABCDEFGHI. It was assumed that billet fluids cannot cross or shear along the symmetrical planes AB and EFG. Hence half a tooth is used to analyze deformation characteristics throughout the cold semi-precision forging process.|$|E

The root fillet obtained thus is not necessarily an optimum profile in context to the bending stress induced during its operation. This work investigates the stress at the gear tooth profile by replacing the conventional trochoid fillet by polynomial curves. The circular root fillet profile is constructed by drawing an arc tangent to working profiles and <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> and this arc is taken as reference root fillet to generate alternative root fillet profile. The arc is divided into six segments. New fillet profiles are constructed by displacing the middle points radially using different relations and keeping the end points fixed. The improved root fillet profiles resulted into reduction of bending stress by 9 to 12 percentage. This results presented here are based on two dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|E

In the end, along the tooth curve and on the root cone conducting a variable cross section solid scanning to tooth shaped cross section, a complete gear tooth will be gained and at last model establishing will be finished.

40|$|Magnolia xsoulangeana, most {{commonly}} known as the Saucer Magnolia, is a small flowering tree belonging to the Magnoliaceae family. It is an interspecific hybrid of M. denudate and M. liliiflora, both of which are native to China. It is considered cold hardy through USDA Hardiness Zones 5 a, but can be found down through Zone 4 b. The tree has a rope-like root system that stays within the first 0. 3 meters of soil, and the tree prefers to grow in well-drained, moist soils. The next phase for M. xsoulangeana is to expand its market into woody decorative cuttings through sustainable greenhouse container production. Propagation would still be primarily through the use of stem cuttings, but instead of transplanting the rooted cuttings into the field the following year, they would be planted into their final containers and maintained in a greenhouse. During the winter, the greenhouse would not need to have additional lighting, and the temperatures in the greenhouse would only have to be maintained {{to the point where the}} root systems of the magnolias are not killed. Harvesting of the stems would occur in the early spring, and potentially in the summer if re-blooming types were used. In order to make this system function properly and be sustainable, breeders would need to select smaller cultivars that have a tolerance to drought. Smaller trees would make the system more manageable and give the producer the ability to maintain more trees. <b>Root</b> <b>circling</b> and girdling from the container’s restriction would also need to be overcome. Ideally, these smaller cultivars would also have smaller root systems, however it may still be necessary to use copper-coated containers, airpruning containers, or fabric containers. Research would need to be done to determine the effectiveness of each method. Drought tolerance would make the system more sustainable in that less water would be needed to maintain the plants. Other traits that should be bred for or maintained in the cultivar include longer vase life, color variety, and growth rate, the ability to re-bloom, and higher quality second blooms...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} control the quality of spline shaft in rolling process, an {{efficient}} measurement method for rolling performance evaluation is essential. Here, a newly developed on-machine non-contact measurement prototype based on laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder is proposed. The prototype is intended for the automated evaluation of the spline shaft rolling performance by measuring the dimensional change of tooth root, which is correlated with the surface residual stress and micro-hardness. Laser displacement sensor and rotary encoder are used to record the polar radius and polar angle of each point on measuring section. Data are displayed in a polar coordinate system and fitted in a gear. Through multipoint curvature method, the roots of spline shaft are recognized automatically. Then, the dimensional change can be calculated by fitting the radius of the tooth <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> before and after rolling. Systematic error covering offset error is also analyzed and calibrated. At last, measurement test {{results show that the}} system has advantages of simple structure, high measurement precision (radius error <[*] 0.6  μm), high measurement efficiency (measuring time <[*] 2  s) and automatic control ability, providing a new opportunity for the efficient evaluation of various spline shafts in high-precision mechanical processing.|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{misalignment}} of gear <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> and base circle and accurate transition curve, an improved mesh stiffness model for healthy gear is proposed, {{and it is}} validated by comparison with the finite element method. On {{the basis of the}} improved method, a mesh stiffness model for a cracked gear pair is built. Then a finite element model of a cracked gear coupled rotor system in a one-stage reduction gear box is established. The effects of crack depth, width, initial position, and crack propagation direction on gear mesh stiffness, fault features in time domain and frequency domain, and statistical indicators are investigated. Moreover, fault features are also validated by experiment. The results show that the improved mesh stiffness model is more accurate than the traditional mesh stiffness model. When the tooth root crack appears, distinct impulses are found in time domain vibration responses, and sidebands appear in frequency domain. Amplitudes of all the statistical indicators ascend gradually with the growth of crack depth and width, decrease with the increasing crack initial position angle, and firstly increase and then decrease with the growth of propagation direction angle...|$|E

Part 2, herein reported, presents the experimental results showing the comparative size of plants varying with the size of pots in nursery stages. For pot-transplanting individuals allowing for determination of the space for roots, polygonal wood-board pots with adjustable inside dimensions were used, one side of which was replaced by a glass plate facilitating the observation of the root growth appearing on its surface. Comparative diameters of the pots were 7 cm, 10 cm and 13 cm, respectively, with the common depth of 12 cm. The eggplant variety used was ”Kurume Naganasu”, which was seeded, germinated and preliminarily transplanted in the electically bottom-heated frame. Observation of the growth after the second transplanting ware made each week, and the resulting plants ready to set were grown in ordinary hexagonal wood-board pot, which were carefully dug out, and final measurements were taken, at the end of the experiment. The result of the experiment is summarized as below : (1) Growth of the plants in larger transplanting-pot was much greater than those raised in smaller pots, where as the latter were still less than the control not transplanted from pots. (2) Number of roots of plants raised in smaller pots surpassed the others, especially the control to the extent of almost twiee as many at the setting period, but these roots became over-aged, and no fresh root development was noted at the time of setting. From this respect, the eggplant ready to set seems to require to have the <b>root</b> <b>circle</b> not smaller than 13 cm in diameter, judging from the size of pot used.

The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's Hope Eyrie.) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs, pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new approach for drawing <b>rooted</b> trees on <b>circles.</b> Previous approaches either draw entire tree on a single circle or draw too many circles that every node and its children are on a new circle. As a result, they only work well on limited kinds of trees. In contrary, our approach adaptively choose how many circles to use based on a single user input {{and it can be}} generalized well to all kinds of trees. Our approach has three phases. First, we recursively divide the tree into a hierarchy of subtrees according to the user input. The subtrees are then processed from bottom to top of the hierarchy and each of them is drawn around a separated circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form the layout of the entire tree. Comparing to previous methods, our approach obtains both compact and pleasing tree drawings with less bends. Furthermore, our method naturally supports visualization interactions, such as locally zooming in/out, when user navigates the drawings. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Two {{years after}} the Revolution of Dignity, Odessa Oblast, one of Ukraine’s key regions in {{economic}} and political terms, is still strongly polarised as regards its residents’ views {{on the future of}} their country. The political <b>circles</b> <b>rooted</b> in the Party of Regions have maintained their influence to a great extent due to increasing dissatisfaction with the central government’s activity and with the economic crisis which has strongly affected the public. Politicians linked to the ancien régime remain the most important political players. Some pro-Ukrainian circles had pinned their hopes for change in the region on the nomination of the former Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, for governor of Odessa Oblast on 30 May 2015. At the beginning of his rule this politician made widely publicised promises to combat corruption, {{to improve the quality of}} the administration services, to develop infrastructure and to attract foreign capital. However, more than half a year has passed since he assumed office, and it is difficult to speak about any spectacular successes in reforming the region. Saakashvili has above all become a player on the national forum, supporting the presidential camp in their struggle with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and the oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, among others. However, his nomination has made Odessa Oblast more important for Ukraine, above all in political and symbolic terms. This is because Odessa Oblast is the best manifestation of the condition of the Ukrainian state two years since the Revolution of Dignity – rudimentary reforms or no reforms at all, strong resistance to any changes from the administration, strong local political-business connections, the lack of consolidation among post-Maidan groups and corruption inherent in the system...|$|R

Considering tbe pixels as square regions of tbe plane, a “correct ” algorithm should paint those pixels whose centers lie at {{less than half the}} desired line width from the curve, A straightforward implementation, scanning the display array evaluating the Euclidean distance from the center of each pixel to the curve, is impractical, and a standard quad-tree-) ikc rccursivc subdivision scheme is used instead. Then we attack the problem of testing whether or not the Euclidean distance from a point to an implicit curve is less than a given threshold For the most gcnernl case, when the implicit function is only required to have continuous first-order derivatives, we show how tn reformulate tbe test as an unconstrained global root-finding problem in a circular domain. For implicit functions with continuous deriv-ativesup to order k we introduce an approximate distance of order k. The approximate distance of order k from a po]nt to an implicit curve is asymptotically equivalent to the Euclidean distance and provides a suff]cicnt tw+tfor a polynomial of degree h not to have <b>roots</b> inside a <b>circle.</b> This is the main contribution of the article, By replacing the Euclidean distance test with one of these approximate distance tests, we obtain a practical rendering algorithm, proven to be correct for algebraic curves.
