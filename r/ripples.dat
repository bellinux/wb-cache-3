5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational <b>ripples</b> forming the shells of stars, similar to <b>ripples</b> spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small <b>ripples</b> form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The <b>ripples</b> are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} parameterise wave-formed <b>rippled</b> {{sediment}} beds involve {{the determination of}} a characteristic <b>ripple</b> height and length from the <b>rippled</b> surface. A substantial number of previous studies have indicated <b>ripple</b> fields formed in shallow water under real sea conditions will have considerable spatial and temporal variation in their parameters. There has been little work undertaken on quantifying the spatial variation of <b>rippled</b> beds {{in terms of their}} characteristic <b>ripple</b> height and length. This paper will present a method used to calculate a histogram of the <b>ripple</b> heights and lengths from the <b>rippled</b> surface using the zero up-crossing method. The inherent variability of <b>ripple</b> parameters will be discussed in terms of two sets of laboratory measurements taken at two very different scales. The conclusion of the paper is that traditional methods to predict <b>ripple</b> parameters have a bias towards <b>rippled</b> beds formed under medium mobility conditions. At higher and lower mobility conditions <b>rippled</b> beds will be inherently variable with a distribution of <b>ripple</b> parameters existing on a given bed at any given time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Rippling</b> {{is a form}} of {{rewriting}} {{that guides}} search by only performing steps that reduce the differences between formulae. Termination is normally ensured by a defined measure that is required to decrease with each step. Because of these restrictions, <b>rippling</b> will fail to prove theorems about, for example, mutual recursion where steps that temporarily increase the differences are necessary. Best-first <b>rippling</b> is an extension to <b>rippling</b> where the restrictions have been recast as heuristic scores for use in best-first search. If nothing better is available, previously illegal steps can be considered, making best-first <b>rippling</b> more flexible than ordinary <b>rippling.</b> We have implemented best-first <b>rippling</b> in the IsaPlanner system together with a mechanism for caching proof-states that helps remove symmetries in the search space, and machinery to ensure termination based on term embeddings. Our experiments show that the implementation of best-first <b>rippling</b> is faster on average than Isa-Planner’s version of traditional depth-first <b>rippling,</b> and solves a range of problems where ordinary <b>rippling</b> fails. ...|$|R
5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} of light, and {{can be thought of as}} <b>ripples</b> in spacetime. They should not be confused with the gravity waves of fluid dynamics, which are a different concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, <b>ripples</b> in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water <b>ripples.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new version of <b>rippling,</b> called {{relational}} <b>rippling.</b> <b>Rippling</b> is a heuristic for guiding proof search, especially in the step cases of inductive proofs. Relational <b>rippling</b> is designed for representations in which value passing is by shared existential variables, as opposed to function nesting. Thus relational <b>rippling</b> can be used to guide reasoning about logic programs or circuits represented as relations. Relational <b>rippling</b> is often part of a multiple phase process: typical proofs consist of mixed functional and relational <b>rippling</b> phases. The purely relational phase is called rippling-past. This formal account is the basis of an existing implementation, on which several examples have been tested...|$|R
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time <b>ripples</b> (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small <b>ripples</b> on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium – air or water, making it oscillate {{as they pass}} by. Wind waves are sea surface waves that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models. As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of <b>ripples.</b> When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create dunes, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the Taklamakan desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Rippling</b> is {{a special}} type of {{rewriting}} developed for induct-ive theorem proving. Bundy et. al. have shown that <b>rippling</b> terminates by providing a well-founded order for the annotated rewrite rules used by <b>rippling.</b> Here, we simplify and generalize this order, thereby enlar-ging the class of rewrite rules that can be used. In addition, we extend the power of <b>rippling</b> by proposing new domain dependent orders. These extensions elegantly combine <b>rippling</b> with more conventional term re-writing. Such combinations oer the exibility and uniformity of conven-tional rewriting with the highly goal directed nature of <b>rippling.</b> Finally, we show how our orders simplify implementation of provers based on <b>rippling.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Ripple marks also form in flowing water. There are {{two types}} of ripples: {{symmetric}} and asymmetric. Environments where the current is in one direction, such as rivers, produce asymmetric <b>ripples.</b> The longer flank of such <b>ripples</b> is on the upstream side of the current. Symmetric wave <b>ripples</b> occur in environments where currents reverse directions, such as tidal flats.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} continuous {{path tracking}} controller and {{its application to}} accurate control of two different linear synchronous motor machine tool axes are described. The controller consists of state feedback, feedforward, and motor <b>ripple</b> compensation.
