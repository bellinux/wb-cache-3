40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to analyse the shape {{stability}} <b>of</b> <b>plywoods.</b> Following operations were monitored: storing the construction veneers, spreading the gluing mixtures, prepressing, pressing and the storage <b>of</b> <b>plywoods.</b> The shape stability <b>of</b> <b>plywoods</b> is affected by various factors and technological parameters of particular operations. It {{is one of the}} important parameters to assess the quality and use <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> sheets in practice. On the basis of the analysis of the present condition of the problems a methodical procedure was prepared to determine causes <b>of</b> warping the <b>plywood</b> sheets.

The moisture and temperature of veneers and pressed plywood sheets rank among the most important parameters affecting shape stability.

Results showed that the warping <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> sheets resulted particularly from the area distribution and variation of the moisture <b>of</b> veneers and <b>plywoods,</b> which was also related to temperature.

30|$|Plywood is a wood-based panel {{material}} {{produced by}} alternately laminating veneers with parallel and perpendicular grain directions. The grain direction of each veneer may affect embedment behavior in plywood–solid wood nail joints. On the shear performance of plywood–solid wood nailed joints, {{the effect of}} the grain direction <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> has been investigated under single-shear loading. Stewart [22] conducted a single-shear test with nailed joint specimens. He prepared two types <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> joint specimens. In the joint specimes, the plywood was attached to become that the grain direction of surface veneer were parallel or perpendicular to the load direction. The load–deformation curves of the two types of specimens were not considerably different. Harada et al. [23] conducted the tests with similar types of specimen and reported no large difference in maximum load. However, the deformation at maximum load in the case <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> with perpendicular grain of the surface veneer was higher than that of parallel grain. Meanwhile, Demirkir and Colakoglu [24] reported that stiffness was higher when the surface direction <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> was parallel to the loading direction than when the surface direction <b>of</b> <b>plywood</b> was perpendicular to the loading direction. Hagiwara [25] reported no difference in shear performance between the parallel and perpendicular grain directions <b>of</b> <b>plywood.</b> However, when the angle between the grain and load directions was 30 °, 45 ° or 60 °, resistance performance decreased under a small load range.|$|R
