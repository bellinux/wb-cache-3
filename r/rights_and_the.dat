5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with her interest in spiritualism, women's <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mind cure.

5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas, believed that direct, militant action was the best path. Hays {{was the first of}} many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> US Constitution.|$|E

5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E

To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach's {{government}} also responded with legislation entitled the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Bill 46), which would split the EUB into two parts: the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas).

Opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners' <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. The legislation ultimately passed, and took effect at the beginning of 2008.|$|E
