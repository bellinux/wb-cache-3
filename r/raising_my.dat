The gurney carrying Homer rolls out of the back, and he once again falls to the floor of the canyon. Having arrived at the hospital he is put in the same ward next to Lance Murdock, where he tells him, [...] "You think you've got guts, try <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Mail in March {{reported}} that Laude's relatives {{said they had}} been offered 21 million Philippine pesos (US$468,000) if they agreed to lower the charge from murder to homicide. The Daily Mail further quoted the family saying that Julita Cabillan, Laude's mother, rejected the offer and said, [...] "No amount of money could pay for the years I spent <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> child." [...] One of Pemberton's lawyers, Benjamin Tolosa, said the Marine's legal team offered no money, saying [...] "It has been insinuated the demand came from us and that's absolutely false. It's contrary to what happened".|$|E
2500|$|Steele {{was born}} on October 19, 1958, at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's County, Maryland, and was adopted as an infant by William and Maebell Steele. His father died in 1962. His mother, who had been born into a {{sharecropping}} family in South Carolina, worked for minimum wage as a laundress to raise her children. After Steele's father died, she ignored her friends' appeals to apply for public assistance, later telling Steele, [...] "I didn't want the government <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> children". She later married John Turner, a truck driver. Michael and his sister, Monica Turner, were raised in the Petworth neighborhood of Northwest, Washington, D.C., which Steele has described as a small, stable and racially integrated community that insulated him {{from some of the}} problems elsewhere in the city. Steele's sister later married and divorced former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson.|$|E
5000|$|Many parodies of {{the song}} were produced, such as [...] "I Did Not <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Boy to Be a Coward," [...] and [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Boy to Be a Soldier, But I'll Send My Girl to Be a Nurse." [...] Parody poems and other {{responses}} were also produced such as [...] "They Didn't Raise Their Son to Be a Soldier", [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Dog to Be a Sausage", and [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Ford to Be a Jitney." [...] According to Groucho Marx, a popular joke of the period concerned a poker game in which a cardplaying mother states, [...] "I didn't <b>raise</b> <b>my</b> boy, he had the joker".|$|R

2500|$|After {{preliminary}} hearings during 2000, the inquest {{began in}} April 2001 {{with an initial}} estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks. The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: [...] "For anyone else {{it would be a}} tantrum, for me it's just <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> voice." [...] In the last few days of Hancock's life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his will and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her. The inquest was put on hold after allegations that Rinehart had paid witnesses to appear and that some had lied in their testimony. It resumed three months later with a smaller witness list and ended with the finding that Hancock had died of natural causes and not as a result of Porteous' behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{his life}} in New York, Popović said: [...] "I never stopped keeping tabs on things back home. Personally, I felt like my life ended. War, the country disintegrated, I lost the job that I worked for so many years, the only thing I had left was <b>raising</b> <b>my</b> children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go there every day to get the paper and read it cover to cover. I was well informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E

5000|$|His composition, [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Boy to Be a Soldier" [...] (1915) {{became a}} {{controversial}} protest song. It sold 650,000 copies {{in the first}} three months, which helped establish American World War I pacifism as a quantifiable political reality. The song continued to sell well until the United States entered the World War I in 1917. Then it was pretty much discarded. However, a few pro-war writers modified the lyrics in new melodies, including [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Boy To Be A Coward," [...] by Charles Clinton Case (1843-1918) (composer) and Franklin G. McCauley (lyricist) and [...] "I Didn't <b>Raise</b> <b>My</b> Boy To Be A Slacker," [...] a march by Theodore Baker (1917, G. Schirmer).|$|R
