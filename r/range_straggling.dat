5000|$|The {{analysis}} of Multiple Scattering {{was started by}} Bothe(Bothe, W,1921) and Wentzel (Wentzel, G,1922)in the Nineteen twenties using well-known approximation of small angles. The physics of energy straggling and Multiple Scattering was developed quite far by Williams from 1929 to 1945. Williams devised a theory, which consists of fitting the Multiple Scattering distribution as a Gaussian-like portion due to small scattering angles and the single collision tail due to the large angles. William, E.J., studied beta particle straggling, Multiple scattering of fast electrons and alpha particles, and cloud curvature tracks due to scattering to explain Multiple scattering in different scenario and he proposed a mean projection deflection occurrence due to scattering. His theory later extended to multiple scattering of alpha particles.Goudsmit and Saunderson provided a more complete treatment of Multiple Scattering, including large angles. [...] For large angles Goudsmit considered series of Legendre polynomials which are numerically evaluated for distribution of scattering. The angular distribution from Coulomb scattering has been studied in detail by Molière.,(Molière:1948) and further continued by Marion and coworkers. Marion, J.B., and Young, F.C., in their Nuclear Reaction Analysis provided Tabular information regarding energy loss of charged particles in matter, Multiple scattering of charged particles, <b>Range</b> <b>straggling</b> of protons, deuterons and alpha particles, equilibrium charge states of ions in solids and energies of elastically scattered particles. [...] Scott presents a complete review of basic theory, Mathematical methods, as well as results and applications.A comparative development of Multiple Scattering at small angles is presented by Meyer, based on a classical calculation of single cross section. [...] Sigmund and Winterbon reevaluated Meyer’s calculation to extend it to a more general case. Marwick and Sigmund carried out development on lateral spreading by Multiple Scattering, {{which resulted in a}} simple scaling relation with the angular distribution.|$|E

In consequence, an analytic solution of the linear Boltzmann equation is pursued {{in the form of}} a Green's function allowing flexibility in application to a broad range of boundary value problems. It has been established that simple solutions can be found for high charge and energy (HZE) ions by ignoring nuclear energy downshifts and dispersion.

40|$|III-N {{photonic}} {{devices have}} made great advances {{in recent years}} following the demonstration of doping of GaN p-type with Mg and n-type with Si. However, the deep ionization energy level of Mg in GaN ({approximately} 160 meV) limits the ionized of acceptors at room temperature to less than 1. 0 % of the substitutional Mg. With this in mind, the authors used ion implantation to characterize the ionization level of Ca in GaN since Ca had been suggested by Strite to be a shallow acceptor in GaN. Ca-implanted GaN converted from n-to-p type after a 1, 100 C activation anneal. Variable temperature Hall measurements give an ionization level at 169 meV. Although this level is equivalent to that of Mg, Ca-implantation may have advantages (shallower projected <b>range</b> and less <b>straggle</b> for a given energy) than Mg for electronic devices.
