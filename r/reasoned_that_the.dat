5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the {{political}} situation but with orders not to interfere in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion. Yeo's orders did not include Borgella's ships and Yeo <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Haitian flagship, the large frigate Heureuse Réunion (recently renamed from Améthyste and often reported under its former name), presented {{a serious threat to}} international trade in the region.|$|E
5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, {{it was his}} study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E

5|$|From the {{examples}} of her mother, Aunt Sally, and a neighbor neglected by her husband and left destitute, Stone early learned that women were {{at the mercy of}} their husbands’ good will. When she came across the biblical passage, “and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,” she was distraught over what appeared to be divine sanction of women’s subjugation, but then <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> injunction applied only to wives. Resolving to “call no man my master,” she determined to keep control over her own life by never marrying, obtaining the highest education she could, and earning her own livelihood.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of a new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally created {{as a part of}} the show's basic premise of Voyagers crew being stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Berman, Piller, and Taylor <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show's primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to fill this role.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defenses should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} gun in the F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was also aware that none of his pilots were trained in the use of a gun or dogfighting. He also <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drag of the pod would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E

5|$|The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, {{were the}} first to be hosted outside North America or Europe. The issue of professionalism became {{contentious}} during the Sapporo Games. Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States. Brundage <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned more than all the other skiers, was not allowed to compete. Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first (and as of 2017 only) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal; he triumphed in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be.|$|E

50|$|L&MR No.32 Experiment {{was built}} in 1833 with {{vertical}} cylinders mounted just behind the chimney, driving the wheels via a bell crank. The locomotive also had piston valves. These valves were probably <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> design was not a success, rather than the bell crank transmission, which was used successfully in other locomotives. Another <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> locomotive was not successful was steam leakage from the cylinders. Experiment was withdrawn after a few months.|$|R
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately gathered his ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent messages in the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was in sight of the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would be too late to catch them. He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{outright}} {{cancellation of}} the Boeing contract on 11 December 1947 was staved off by a plea from its president William McPherson Allen to the Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington. Allen <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> design was capable of being adapted to new aviation technology and more stringent requirements. In January 1948 Boeing was instructed to thoroughly explore recent technological innovations, including aerial refueling and the flying wing. Noting stability and control problems Northrop was experiencing with their YB-35 and YB-49 flying wing bombers, Boeing insisted on a conventional aircraft, and in April 1948 presented a US$30million (US$ today) proposal for design, construction, and testing of two Model 464-35 prototypes. Further revisions during 1948 resulted in an aircraft with {{a top speed of}} 513miles per hour (445kn, 825km/h) at 35,000feet (10,700m), a range of 6,909miles (6,005nmi, 11,125km), and a 280,000pounds (125,000kg) gross weight, which included 10,000pounds (4,500kg) of bombs and 19,875USgallons (75,225L) of fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They <b>reasoned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.|$|E
