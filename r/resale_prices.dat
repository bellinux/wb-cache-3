5|$|The <b>Resale</b> <b>Prices</b> Bill was {{introduced}} to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, {{to the detriment of}} competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted. However, he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.|$|E

An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket <b>resale</b> <b>prices.</b> For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher than face value.

In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher than face value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405). Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those marking up ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.|$|E

In {{the space of}} a single business quarter, Iger went from speaking of Frozens [...] "franchise potential" [...] (in February 2014) to saying that it was [...] "probably" [...] one of Disney's [...] "top five franchises" [...] (in May 2014). The film's massive popularity resulted in an unusually severe merchandise shortage in the United States and several other industrialized countries in April 2014, which caused <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> for higher-quality limited-edition Frozen dolls and costumes to skyrocket past $1,000 on eBay. By the time the merchandise shortage was finally resolved in early November 2014 (nearly a year after the film's release), Disney had sold over three million Frozen costumes in North America alone. Wait times for the meet-and-greets at Disney Parks soon regularly exceeded four hours and forced management in February 2014 to indefinitely extend what was originally intended as a temporary film promotion. Disney Parks later put on a temporary event (Frozen Summer Fun) at Disney's Hollywood Studios, then announced on September 12, 2014, that the Maelstrom ride at Epcot's Norway pavilion would be closed and replaced with a Frozen-based attraction, which opened in early 2016. On May 27, 2016, a live Frozen musical stage show officially opened at the Hyperion Theater in Disney California Adventure, replacing the venue's previous show, [...] By August 2014, the publisher Random House had sold over 8 million Frozen-related books. Tour operators, including Adventures by Disney, added more Norway tours in response to rising demand during 2014.|$|E

The thesis is composed of six parts, one of them dealing with block exemptions {{in general and the}} rest of them focusing on <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. Chapter one introduces the topic of block exemptions and explains the features of block exemptions that are common to all of them. Chapter two presents the definition of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance and describes the difference between fixed, minimum, maximum and recommended prices. Chapter three describes economic theories, which have influence on legal treatment of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. The chapter is divided into three subchapters, whereas the first one explicates pro-competitive effects of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance, the second one focuses on its anticompetitive effects and the third one summarizes the economic theories of impact of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. Chapter four examines the legal framework of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance in European law. Firstly, it describes the treatment of fixed, minimum, recommended and maximum prices.

2500|$|Although Yankee Stadium {{has been}} praised for its amenities, {{it also has}} been widely criticized for high ticket prices. Seats within the first eight rows in the lower bowl, called the [...] "Legends Suite", are among the highest-priced tickets in {{professional}} sports. Tickets cost $510 on average; the most expensive tickets cost $2,600 each. Legends Suite Seats have been regularly empty, with many ticket holders in this section having given up their tickets, and others remaining unsold, despite most other seats in the ballpark selling out. This has created an embarrassing image on television of the seats behind home plate being almost completely vacant. Consequently, a surplus of tickets for Legends Seats have emerged in the secondary market, and with supply exceeding demand, <b>resale</b> <b>prices</b> have dropped. Empty seats in the Legends Suite could even be seen during the 2009 playoffs, including World Series games. Even though all playoff games were sellouts, Legends Suite ticket holders were in the lounges and the restaurant underneath instead of their seats. Overall, the average ticket price is $63, the highest in baseball.|$|E

The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the scope of vertical restraints are analyzed through the identification of industry and size heterogeneities for each vertical restraint. Secondly, the determinants of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintence are explored focusing on the effect of the upstream firm effort to increase demand. A simple theoretical example is presented and a probability model is used to analyze the empirical determinants of limiting the <b>resale</b> <b>price.</b> The results confirm that those firms that make greater advertising effort impose <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> more frequently. Besides, larger firms and those firms that impose other restraints such as exclusive territories limit the <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> more frequently...|$|R

40|$|In {{large part}} {{for fear that}} it will foster and {{maintain}} manufacturers' or retailers' cartels, <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is strictly forbidden {{in a number of}} countries. Moreover economic theory has allowed for {{a better understanding of the}} motivations and outcomes of this practice and has made possible a revision of the strict prohibition. This thesis first outlines the theories explaining the use of <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance. What emerges from these theories is that <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is far from being an unequivocably deleterious form of conduct. Indeed, a manufacturer may seek to reach some results that are pro-competitive. Having outlined the arguments for and against the practice, an approach is proposed for detecting <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance that is likely to damage the consumers' interest. In fact, the problem arises only in cases of cartellization, or abuse of market power. The second part of the thesis is devoted to an analysis of four legislative regimes: those of the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland and the European Community. Three of these regimes include a strong prohibition against <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance, whereas the fourth, the Swiss cartel law, treats the practice as per se legal. Despite the diverging legal status reserved to this practice, the comparative law study will demonstrate first the consistency of an economic approach to each situation, and the weakness of the legal reasoning within this area. The analysis of these regimes serves to affirm the conclusions, that <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance constitutes a real danger only in the case where there is a cartel or abuse of market power. Since these cartel or abuse of market power abuse are themselves usually prohibited, the additional prohibition against <b>resale</b> <b>price</b> maintenance is redundant, and prevents some manufacturers from achieving possible pro-competitive results...|$|R
