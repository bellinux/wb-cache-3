40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} {{upon the}} market impact of commercially <b>releasing</b> <b>current</b> generation genetically modified (GM) food and food production in New Zealand (NZ). It evaluates the producer benefits of growing GM food and consumer attitudes towards GM food. Current commercially released GM products affect {{the type of}} production rather than {{the nature of the}} product itself and include herbicide resistant soybean and canola as well as insect resistant corn. Evidence of producer benefits from growing GM products is mixed, with some reports of increases in producer returns. However, there has been a definite shift in consumer preference away from GM food. This is seen both in the development of price premiums for GM-free food; trade diversion away from GM sources to GM-free sources, particularly in the Japanese market; and the positioning of key retail outlets in Europe as GM-free. However, issues remain as to how preferences will develop and whether current trends are short term or not. Of relevance to NZ is what would impact be of different preferences and impact of GM technology on key commodities for NZ. Therefore in this paper the impact of GM food on producers, consumers and trade in NZ is simulated under various scenarios using the LTEM (Lincoln Trade and Environment Model). The model simulates, against variou...|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{currents and}} concentration profiles generated by Ca 2 + {{release from the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol through IP 3 receptor channel clusters. Clusters are described as conducting pores in the lumenal membrane with a diameter from 6 nm to 36 nm. The endoplasmic reticulum is modeled as a disc with a radius of 1 – 12 mm and an inner height of 28 nm. We adapt the dependence of the currents on the trans Ca 2 + concentration (intralumenal) measured in lipid bilayer experiments to the cellular geometry. Simulated currents are compared with signal mass measurements in Xenopus oocytes. We find that <b>release</b> <b>currents</b> depend linearly on the concentration of free Ca 2 + in the lumen. The <b>release</b> <b>current</b> is approximately proportional to the square root {{of the number of}} open channels in a cluster. Cytosolic concentrations at the location of the cluster range from 25 μM to 170 μM. Concentration increase due to puffs in a distance of a few micrometers from the puff site is found to be in the nanomolar range. <b>Release</b> <b>currents</b> decay biexponentially with timescales of < 1 s and a few seconds.

40|$|In {{many types}} of muscle, {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + release for contraction consists of brief Ca 2 + sparks. Whether these result from the opening of one or many channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not known. Examining massive numbers of sparks from frog skeletal muscle and evaluating their Ca 2 + <b>release</b> <b>current,</b> we provide evidence that they are generated by multiple channels. A mode is demonstrated {{in the distribution of}} spark rise times {{in the presence of the}} channel activator caffeine. This finding contradicts expectations for single channels evolving reversibly, but not for channels in a group, which collectively could give rise to a stereotyped spark. The release channel agonists imperatoxin A, ryanodine, and bastadin 10 elicit fluorescence events that start with a spark, then decay to steady levels roughly proportional to the unitary conductances of 35 %, 50 %, and 100 % that the agonists, respectively, promote in bilayer experiments. This correspondence indicates that the steady phase is produced by one open channel. Calculated Ca 2 + <b>release</b> <b>current</b> decays 10 - to 20 -fold from spark to steady phase, which requires that six or more channels be open during the spark...|$|R
