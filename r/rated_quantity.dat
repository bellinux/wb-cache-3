30|$|Exergy analysis, {{based on}} second law of {{thermodynamics}} {{is an attractive}} way of evaluating the performance of thermal systems, {{especially when it comes}} to optimization [8]. Exergy analysis has been successfully carried out by many researchers for LHTS systems of different applications [9, 10, 11]. These studies have proved that the exergy analysis only can provide useful information on valuable energy during charging and discharging processes. When a heat transfer enhancement technique is employed for a LHTS system, the comparison between the systems in terms of exergy performance is more useful. This is because the design of LHTS systems musters a compromise between heat transfer <b>rate,</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality of stored/recovered energy [12].

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the local flame surface statistics of constant-pressure turbulent expanding flames. First the statistics of local length ratio is experimentally determined from high-speed planar Mie scattering images of spherically expanding flames, with the length ratio on the measurement plane, at predefined equiangular sectors, {{defined as the}} ratio of the actual flame length to the length of a circular-arc of radius equal to the average radius of the flame. Assuming isotropic distribution of such flame segments we then convolute suitable forms of the length-ratio probability distribution functions (pdfs) to arrive at the corresponding area-ratio pdfs. It is found that both the length ratio and area ratio pdfs are near log-normally distributed and shows self-similar behavior with increasing radius. Near log-normality and rather intermittent behavior of the flame-length ratio suggests similarity with dissipation <b>rate</b> <b>quantities</b> which stimulates multifractal analysis.
