5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to English, the {{relative}} pronoun {{can never be}} omitted in French, not even when the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> is embedded in another <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
25|$|In (4), the head, lalaki 'man', {{is found}} after {{or to the}} right of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> nagbigay ng bigas sa bata 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some {{position}} inside the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> Note that when the head appears {{to the right of}} or internally to the <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> the complementiser surfaces {{to the right of the}} head.|$|E
50|$|Restrictive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> {{are also}} called {{integrated}} <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> defining <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> or identifying <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Conversely, non-restrictive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are called supplementary, appositive, non-defining or non-identifying <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the special processing characteristics of head-final <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> As head-final <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> superficially resemble other prenominal modifiers such as adjectivals, stative verbs, and adjunctive/complement clauses, their status as a distinct kind has constantly been challenged. We present existing processing {{evidence to show that}} head-final <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> should be distinguished from other prenominal modifiers as they do involve structure-based filler-gap integrations (like those of head-initial <b>relative</b> <b>clauses)</b> and observe universal extraction effects. The evidence includes: (a) processing differences between possessive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> and adverbial <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in Mandarin; (b) processing differences between gapped <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> and adjunct clauses with null pronouns in Korean; and (c) subject-extracted <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> being easier to process than object-extracted <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in head-final relativization.

30|$|Subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are {{available}} in all languages. But not all languages have <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> which come {{at the end of}} this hierarchy, for example, object of comparison <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Most languages must follow this order. If a language has object and genitive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> it must have the intervening indirect object and object of preposition <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
25|$|A bound <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> {{the type}} most often considered, qualifies an {{explicit}} element (usually a noun or noun phrase) {{appearing in the}} main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
25|$|The normal {{word order}} of a Hurrian {{sentence}} is SOV. Within noun phrases, the noun regularly comes at the end. Adjectives, numbers, and genitive modifiers come before the noun they modify. Relative clauses, however, tend to surround the noun, {{which means that the}} noun the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> modifies {{stands in the middle of}} the <b>relative</b> <b>clause.</b> Hurrian has at its disposal several paradigms for constructing relative clauses. It can either use the relative pronouns iya and iye, which has already been described under 'pronouns' above, or the nominalising suffix -šše attached to a verb, which undergoes Suffixaufnahme. The third possibility is for both these markers to occur (see example 16 below). The noun, which is represented by the <b>relative</b> <b>clause,</b> can take any case, but within the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> can only have the function of the absolutive, i.e. it can only be the subject of an intransitive <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> or the object of a transitive one.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} Ethiopian Semitic {{languages}} very common use of relative clauses is in cleft sentences.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{ordering}} restriction of two <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> modifying the same head noun phrase in Chinese.

Specifically, we argue that <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> which serve to provide grounding information for the head noun tend to take precedence over other types of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> The proposed ordering restriction is shown to account for the ordering of multiple <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in both Chinese and English...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis corpus-based study {{presents}} how English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> {{are used}} {{in science and engineering}} journal papers. <b>Relative</b> <b>clauses</b> ensure semantic clarity and textual variety but they cause difficulty to non-native speakers of English due to their diverse uses and functions. With pedagogical purposes in mind, this research investigates how frequently and in what context <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are employed in three representative science and engineering journals, namely CELL, Journal of American Chemical Society, and IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits. In addition, <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> used in papers of English for Specific Purposes are investigated and compared with those in the science and engineering journal papers, to reveal the similarities and differences between them. Some unique features of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> used in science and engineering journal papers are identified, such as the frequent use of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> the high frequency of non-restrictive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in the papers of Journal of American Chemical Society and Journal of Solid-State Circuits, the high proportion of ‘prepositions + which,’ and the extremely high use of ‘that’ over ‘which’ for restrictive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Pedagogical suggestions are provided to help science and engineering paper authors and ESP/EAP practitioners use and teach <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in an efficient way...|$|R
25|$|A <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> {{is a kind}} of {{subordinate}} clause that contains an element whose interpretation is provided by an antecedent on which the {{subordinate clause}} is grammatically dependent; that is, there is an anaphora relation between the relativized element in the <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> and the antecedent on which it depends.|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} {{significant}} in {{that most of}} the previous studies have focused on the acquisition of subject and direct object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in first or second language acquisition. We further investigated indirect object and oblique <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in learning a foreign language. Moreover, we adopted an emergentist approach by studying the effect of the animacy of the referent on the acquisition of these <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> Knowing that different types of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> would create varying amounts of pressure on EFL learners’ minds, the teachers would adapt their teaching strategies to such factors to come up with better results. Besides, if EFL teachers appreciate the effect of the animacy on the comprehension of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> they would be more effective in teaching <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{language}} learners in English language especially as students of English Department, the students must acquire all the English grammar including <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> {{so they will}} be able to use them appropriately. <b>Relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are clauses which modify noun or noun phrase. They are introduced by the relative pronouns like who, which, whose, where, when, that, etc. The writer chooses <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> as her subject of research because they are parts of grammatical structures taught in the English Department of Petra Christian University. In this study, the writer tries to find out the most frequently types of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> and functions of relative pronouns also types of grammatical errors by fourth writing class students of English Department of Petra Christian University. The collected <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are classified and analysed to find out the types and the types of grammatical errors in <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> as seen in the students' writing assignments based on some underlying theories. They are Greenbaum and Quirk's theory and Francis for the <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> and also Dulay et. a. l. and Corder for theories of error and Charas and Ubol for errors classification. By using qualitative method of research, the writer collects all <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> used in forty students' writing assignments. The findings show that the most frequent types of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> are restrictive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> For the most common types of grammatical errors are omission of comma, omission of verb to `be' or linking verb and the last wrong form of verb. According to the result, the writer can judge that actually students have not acquired understanding in producing <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> because there are errors that appear in their clauses...|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{the second}} {{research}} question ‘Does the animacy of the referent affect {{the acquisition of}} different types of relative clauses?’ We found that the animacy/inanimacy of the referent affects the acquisition of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> There was no difference in the comprehension of the direct object versus oblique object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> because the referents were inanimate. But, {{there was a significant difference}} in the comprehension of subject <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> compared with indirect object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> which was due to the animacy of the referents.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the syntax of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in European Portuguese (EP) by focussing {{on the status}} of the relativizer que in restrictive and appositive <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> We propose a unified account of que in terms of a D-element and discuss the syntactic implications of this assumption for an adequate analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in EP.

40|$|Languages with {{distinct}} typological characteristics often present different chal-lenges {{to language}} processing and thus lead {{to differences in}} linguistic perfor-mances across languages. This study investigated the relations between linguistic typology, constraints on language processing, and crosslinguistic differences in language use. Two studies on Chinese and English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> were conduct-ed. The first study looked at the semantic properties of the head nouns in Chinese and English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses,</b> showing that shared communicative functions lead to shared patterns in Chinese and English relative clauses: the heads of object <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> tend to be inanimate nouns, while those of subject relative claus-es rend to be animate. The second study looked into the use of <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> in parallel texts, showing that the typological differences in terms of head positions in Chinese and English led to distinctive complexity patterns. Chinese <b>relative</b> <b>clauses</b> tend to be shorter (in terms of number of syllables and number of words) and less complex (in terms of embeddings other <b>relative</b> <b>clauses)</b> than English <b>relative</b> <b>clauses.</b> These results supported the Head-driven Constituent Complexity Hypothesis...|$|R

25|$|In this strategy, {{there is}} simply {{a gap in the}} <b>relative</b> <b>clause</b> where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese.
