5|$|When {{the game}} is ready for release, the {{publisher}} sends copies of {{the final version of}} the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary. The ESRB typically posts <b>rating</b> <b>information</b> for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.|$|E
500|$|The ESRB enforces {{guidelines}} {{that have been}} adopted by the video game industry {{in order to ensure}} responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display <b>rating</b> <b>information,</b> restricting where advertising materials for games rated [...] "Teen" [...] or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from [...] "glamoriz or exploiting" [...] a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated [...] "Mature" [...] or higher to be restricted to users who are appropriately aged. This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising [...] "to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate." [...] The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets. A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.|$|E

We also consider the problem of testing if one of these access structures is a substructure of an arbitrary access structure and we show that this problem is NP-complete. We provide several general lower bounds on <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> and average <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> of graphs.

We develop algorithms for discovering explicit codes for concealing any modulation in {BPSK, QPSK, 8 -PSK, 16 -QAM, 64 -QAM}.
