5|$|Iron is pervasive, but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap molasses.

The price of chicken nearly tripled since 2011.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} 40 {{personal}} interviews with meat department managers at {{grocery stores and}} supermarkets to investigate managers' expectations regarding the profitability potential of irradiated <b>red</b> <b>meats.</b> The study models managers' profitability expectations as function of many attributes and factors, such as the meat manager's or store's characteristics, how familiar the meat manager is with irradiation, and opinions held by the manager regarding irradiation's benefits consumer acceptance. The study also examines how profitability expectations may influence the expected timing of adoption by the manager's retail store, the projected percentage of <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> eventually allocated to irradiated <b>red</b> <b>meats,</b> and merchandising strategies.

5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are <b>red</b> <b>meat,</b> poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|Gomphus clavatus is edible; it {{is rated}} as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture {{that has been}} {{regarded}} as suiting <b>red</b> <b>meat</b> dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely {{if the weather is}} cool. G.clavatus has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar (Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden). It is highly regarded by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.|$|E

5|$|Modern western vegetarianism {{was founded}} in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society.

40|$|Meat {{consumption}} patterns {{have changed in}} the United States. A cursory inspection of the disappearance statistics for meat in the United States reveals that generally, the consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> has decreased or remained constant while the consumption of poultry and other meats has increased. Economists have had only modest success in developing cogent explanations for these changed {{consumption patterns}}, and a "chicken little" psychology has come to dominate much of the recent discourse. Arguments, {{for the most part}} not based on demand theory, have been put forth that recent consumption changes cannot be explained by relative prices, income, and simple demographic effects. Conjecture about lifestyles, health concerns, consumer attitudes toward <b>red</b> <b>meats,</b> and other factors suggest implicit prophesy of doom for the beef industry. Systematic analyses of consumption changes and assessments of the theory are needed to address these largely unsupported suppositions. ...|$|R
40|$|Adake Saiken, Fang Gu Department of Gastroenterology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, People’s Republic of China Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the lifestyle and lifestyle-related comorbidities independently associated with colorectal adenoma (CRA) recurrence in elderly Chinese people. Methods: During the 5 -year follow-up after the initial colonoscopy, participants aged > 60  years with the diagnosis and removal of CRA underwent a complete surveillance colonoscopy, and 152 participants with CRA recurrence plus 152 participants free of recurrence were included in this analysis. Results: Participants with CRA recurrence were more likely to consume less vegetables and fruits, and more <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> compared with the control group (P< 0. 05 for all). Lifestyle-related comorbidities, including hypertension and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), were more common in participants with CRA recurrence than in the control group (P< 0. 05 for all). In the multivariate analysis, pack-years of smoking were independently associated with an increased CRA recurrence (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 03; P< 0. 05). Eating less vegetables (OR: 099; P< 0. 05) and fruits (OR: 0. 98; P< 0. 05) was identified as a statistically independent factor influencing CRA recurrence, as was eating more <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> (OR: 1. 01; P< 0. 05). Hypertension was also found to be a factor independently associated with an increased CRA recurrence (OR: 2. 44; P< 0. 05). NAFLD had an independent association, with an increased CRA recurrence (OR: 3. 43; P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Smoking cigarettes, high consumption of <b>red</b> <b>meats,</b> low intake of fruits and vegetables, and the presence of hypertension and NAFLD were independently associated with an increased CRA recurrence in elderly Chinese people. This conclusion helps elderly Chinese people to make effective behavioral changes, such as smoking cessation, substitution of fruits and vegetables for <b>red</b> <b>meats,</b> and timely treatment of hypertension and NAFLD, to reduce CRA recurrence and colorectal cancer risk.

40|$|In {{this study}} we: a) {{estimated}} quarterly demand functions for <b>red</b> <b>meats</b> and broilers, b) estimated quarterly farm-wholesale and wholesale-retail marketing-margin equations for <b>red</b> <b>meats,</b> c) estimated red-meat quarterly inventory-investment equations, d) developed a complete econometric model of quarterly {{behavior of the}} beef- and pork-marketing sector, and e) applied quadratic programming to determine quarterly and annual levels of farm marketings of hogs and cattle that would maximize farmers’ annual cash receipts from hogs and cattle. Linear and logarithmic (constant elasticity) quarterly demand functions (with price as a dependent variable) were estimated for beef, pork, lamb, and broilers to measure quarterly variations in demand. Results from both functional forms indicated that, in beef and pork demand functions, intercepts vary quarterly, but slopes do not, whereas neither slopes nor intercepts vary quarterly in lamb demand equations. Logarithmic versions of the broiler demand function found quarterly variation in intercept, but not in slopes, whereas linear versions generally found no significant quarterly variation in slopes or intercept...|$|R
