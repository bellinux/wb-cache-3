60|$|I {{said there}} was nothing I longed for more than to see any city but Berlin, and should be delighted {{to be free of}} the odious {{military}} service. Indeed, I thought, from his splendour of appearance, the knickknacks about the room, the gilded carriage in the <b>remise,</b> that my uncle was a man of vast property; and that he would purchase a dozen, nay, a whole regiment of substitutes, in order to restore me to freedom.|$|E
60|$|Her {{carriage}} {{was one of}} the few private equipages {{that drove}} up to Madame Uccelli's door; most people had not even come in a <b>remise,</b> but, after the simple Florentine fashion, had taken the little cabs, which stretched in a long line up and down the way; the horses had let their weary heads drop, and were easing their broken knees by extending their forelegs while they drowsed; the drivers, huddled in their great-coats, had assembled around the doorway to see the guests alight, with that amiable, unenvious interest of the Italians in the pleasure of others. The deep sky glittered with stars; in the corner of the next villa garden the black plumes of some cypresses blotted out their space among them.|$|E
60|$|The {{travellers}} were an American family, {{which had}} long been wandering about Europe, and which was now destined it knew not whither, having just traversed a thousand miles of Germany in its devious course. Four years before, the same family had halted on the same spot, nearly {{on the same day}} of the month of October, and for precisely the same object. It was then journeying to Italy, and as its members hung over the view of the Leman, with its accessories of Chillon, Châtelard, Blonay, Meillerie, the peaks of Savoy, and the wild ranges of the Alps, they had felt regret that the fairy scene was so soon to pass away. The case was now different, and yielding to the charm of a nature so noble and yet so soft, within a few hours, the carriage was in <b>remise,</b> a house was taken, the baggage unpacked, and the household gods of the travellers were erected, for the twentieth time, in a strange land.|$|E

60|$|On Monday night, the Twentieth of June 1791, about eleven o'clock, {{there is}} many a hackney-coach, and glass-coach (carrosse de <b>remise),</b> still rumbling, or at rest, {{on the streets}} of Paris. But of all Glass-coaches, we {{recommend}} this to thee, O Reader, which stands drawn up, in the Rue de l'Echelle, hard by the Carrousel and outgate of the Tuileries; in the Rue de l'Echelle that then was; 'opposite Ronsin the saddler's door,' as if waiting for a fare there! Not long does it wait: a hooded Dame, with two hooded Children has issued from Villequier's door, where no sentry walks, into the Tuileries Court-of-Princes; into the Carrousel; into the Rue de l'Echelle; where the Glass-coachman readily admits them; and again waits. Not long; another Dame, likewise hooded or shrouded, leaning on a servant, issues in the same manner, by the Glass-coachman, cheerfully admitted. Whither go, so many Dames? 'Tis His Majesty's Couchee, Majesty just gone to bed, and all the Palace-world is retiring home. But the Glass-coachman still waits; his fare seemingly incomplete.|$|E
6000|$|The perfect {{good taste}} and {{indifference}} which the French manifest concerning the private affairs, and concerning {{the mode of}} living, of one who is admitted to the salons, has justly extorted admiration, even from the English, the people of all others who most submit to a contrary feeling. A hackney-coach is not always admitted into a court-yard, but {{both men and women}} make their visits in them, without any apparent hesitation. No one seems ashamed of confessing poverty. I do not say that women of quality often use fiacres to make their visits, but men do, and I have seen women in them openly whom I have met in some of the best houses in Paris. It is better to go in a private carriage, or in a <b>remise,</b> if one can, but few hesitate, when their means are limited, about using the former. In order to appreciate this self-denial, or simplicity, or good sense, it is necessary to remember that a Paris fiacre is not to be confounded with any other vehicle on earth. I witnessed, a short time since, a ludicrous instance of the different degrees of feeling that exist on this point among different people. A---- and myself went to the house of an English woman our acquaintance who is not very choice in her French. A Mrs. ----, the wife of a colonel in the English army, sat next A----, as a French lady begged that her carriage might be ordered. Our hostess told her servant to order the fiacre of Madame ----. Now Madame ---- kept her chariot, to my certain knowledge, but she disregarded the mistake. A---- soon after desired that our carriage might come next. The good woman of the house, who loved to be busy, again called for the fiacre of Madame ----. I saw the foot of A---- in motion, but catching my eye, she smiled, and the thing passed off. The [...] "voiture de Madame ----," [...] or our own carriage, was announced just as Mrs. ---- was trying to make a servant understand she wished for hers. [...] "Le fiacre de Madame ----," [...] again put in the bustling hostess. This was too much for a colonel's lady, and, with a very pretty air of distress, she took care to explain, in a way that all might hear her, that it was a <b>remise.</b>|$|E
6000|$|After a {{consultation}} with François, I sent the carriage {{to get a}} set of entirely new wheels, Brussels being a coach-making town, and taking a voiture de <b>remise,</b> we drove down to Antwerp. While the horses rested, {{we looked at the}} pictures in Malines. The [...] "Miraculous Draught of Fishes" [...] is thought {{by many to be the}} chef-d'oeuvre of Rubens, but, after conceding it a hardy conception and magnificent colouring, I think one finds too much of the coarse mannerism of the artist, even for such a subject. The most curious part of the study of the different schools is to observe how much all have been influenced by external objects, and how completely conventional, after all, the beau idéal of an artist necessarily becomes. It would be impossible, for one who knew the several countries, to mistake the works of Murillo, Rubens, or Raphael, for the works of artists of different schools, and this without reference to their peculiar manners, but simply as Flemings, Spaniards, and Italians. Rubens, however, is, I think, a little apt to out-Dutch the Dutch. He appears to me to have delighted in the coarse, while Raphael revelled in the pretty. But Raphael could and often did step out of himself and rise to the grand; and then he was perfect, because his grandeur was chastened.|$|E

60|$|Villa Papa Giulio is but {{a little}} place {{compared}} with something {{on the scale of}} the Villa Pamfili Doria though from its casino it has a charm far beyond that. What it may once have been as to grounds and gardens there is little to show now, and the Pamfili Doria itself had not much to show in gardens, though it had grounds, and to spare. It is, in fact, a large park, though whether larger than the Villa Borghese I cannot say. But it has not been taken by the state, and it is so far off on its hills that it is safe from the overrunning of city feet. It is safe even from city wheels, unless they are those of livery carriages, for numbered cabs are not suffered in its proud precincts. You partake of this pride when you come in your rubber-tired <b>remise,</b> and have the consolation of being part of the beautiful exclusiveness. It costs you fifteen francs, but one must suffer for being patrician, even for a single afternoon. Outside we had the satisfaction of seeing innumerable numbered cabs drawn up, and within the villa gates of meeting or passing the plebeians who had come in them, and were now walking while we were smoothly rolling in our victoria. The day was everything we could ask, very warm and bright below the Janiculum, on which we had mounted, and here on the summit delicious with cool currents of air. There had been beggars, on the way up, at every point where our horses must be walked, and we had paid our way handsomely, so that when we went back they bowed without asking again; this is a convention at Rome which no self-respecting beggar will violate; they all touch their hats in recognition of it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>remise</b> is {{a renewal}} of an attack in fencing. It is {{performed}} when one fencer's attack has failed, either because their opponent has parried or they missed. If the attacker immediately continues their attack in the same line, they have executed a <b>remise.</b> The name also is applied to repetitions of other actions which did not initially succeed (<b>remise</b> of the riposte, for example, is a riposte that initially missed but hit in a continuation). The <b>remise</b> {{is at the bottom}} of actions in taking priority.|$|E

5000|$|At sabre, it is {{generally}} easier to attack than to defend (for example, the timing favours <b>remises)</b> and high-level international sabre fencing is often very fast and very simple, although when required, top sabreurs do display an extended repertoire of tactical devices. In response to the relatively high speed of sabre fencing, the rules for sabre were changed to prohibit the forward cross-over (where the back foot passes the front foot) - {{it is now a}} cardable offence. Thus, the flèche attack is no longer permissible, so sabre fencers have instead begun to use a [...] "flunge" [...] (flying lunge). This attack begins like a flèche, but the fencer pushes off from the ground and moves quickly forward, attempting to land a hit before their feet cross over. Similarly, [...] "running attacks" [...] — consisting of a failed flèche followed by continuous <b>remises</b> — have also been eliminated.|$|R

The blocking time after registering a hit was reduced from 0.75 seconds to 0.25 seconds, so a fast <b>remise</b> can 'time out' a slow riposte. The contact time required to score a hit was also increased to 15 milliseconds to make flick hits less likely to register. It has been observed that, after these changes, some straight hits are not registered by the apparatus.
