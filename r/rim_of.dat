5|$|Driving {{through the}} east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce Canyon National Park in the north or to the north <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Canyon in the south. Due to the narrowness of the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only drive through the tunnel during limited hours.|$|E
5|$|I-70 enters Colorado from Utah, {{concurrent}} with US6 and US50, on {{a plateau}} {{between the north}} <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Ruby Canyon of the Colorado River and the south <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Book Cliffs. The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest conurbation in the area locally known as the Western Slope. The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita, Grand Junction and Palisade. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes {{to the north of}} downtown, while US6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US50 departs on a course toward Pueblo.|$|E
5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the bell, squeeze {{water out of the}} cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E

5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Mount Pleasant Road {{existed between}} St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, the road on the {{opposite}} rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following {{the construction of the}} Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{public areas}} of the park are the North and South <b>Rims</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Canyon itself. The rest of the park is {{extremely}} rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. Only the Navajo Bridge near Page connects the rims by road in Arizona; this journey can take around five hours by car. Otherwise, the two <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> the Canyon are connected via the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge and the Hoover Dam.|$|R
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{returned}} to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, Missouris crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for the <b>Rim</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, San Diego, Seattle, and Bremerton.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has named}} the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E

25|$|The coins {{differ in}} terms of size, weight and rim. Within each {{sequence}} the diameter and weight of the coins increase with their value. The 50-øre and 10-krone coins have smooth rims, while the <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> the 1- and 5-krone coins are milled. The <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> the 2- and 20-krone coins have interrupted milling. The 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins have {{a hole in the}} middle. Use of these various characteristics makes it easy for the blind and sight-impaired to tell the coins apart.|$|R
5|$|On 11 September, OG North paused {{offensive}} operations {{while the}} 4th and 7th Guards Brigades moved into reserve. They were {{replaced with the}} 1st and the 2nd Guards Brigades of the HVO, which became the spearhead of OG North. A probing attack by the 2nd Guards Brigade achieved some gains towards Jajce along the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Kupres Plateau. OGs South and West made another effort to capture Drvar, but were beaten back by VRS infantry supported by artillery and M-87 Orkan rockets.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
