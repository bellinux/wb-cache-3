5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more <b>recent</b> <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} our first {{investigations}} into the potential of optical dating for determining the rate of river flood sedimentation in the Ardenne region (S Belgium). Two samples collected from a <b>recent</b> <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> were used to investigate the extent of resetting in different particle size fractions of quartz (4 - 11 mu m, 63 - 90 mu m, 90 - 125 mu m, 125 - 180 mu m, 180 - 212 mu m and 212 - 250 mu m) {{as well as in}} polymineral fine (4 - 11 mu m) grains. Both samples show satisfactory OSL and IRSL characteristics. The IRSL signals from the polymineral fine grains yield an equivalent dose (D-e) of 3 - 4 Gy, while a D-e of 0. 3 - 0. 6 Gy was measured using large aliquots of quartz. Small aliquot analyses of 63 - 90 mu m and 212 - 250 mu m quartz grains confirm that the coarser fraction contains more grains with lower D-e's. Furthermore, for a modern sample (< 3 years old), similar to 60 % of the aliquots yields a D-e consistent with zero, indicating that these contain only well-bleached grains. These findings suggest that {{it might be possible to}} extract the true burial dose from dose distributions measured using small aliquots of coarse-grained (e. g. 212 - 250 mu m) quartz.

5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and <b>recent</b> laterites and <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits.</b> Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Transitional areas between upland {{and aquatic}} habitats, {{commonly}} known as wetland, were once viewed as unproductive areas and were drained for farming or pasture. Wetlands are now accepted as significant ecological resources, and their protection is a mandate of federal, state, and local land managers. Due to the diversity of wetland areas, the appropriate assessment of wetland resources cannot be accomplished without long term monitoring of wetland functions. Knowledge of the duration of saturation and associated anaerobic conditions of soils in wetlands is critical to correctly classify and assess wetland areas. Soil, hydrological, and biogeochemical characteristics of the soils of the Jackson-Frazier wetland were observed from October 1992 through March 1994. Weekly observations of water levels and redox potential at depths of 25, 50, and 100 cm were made in order to characterize the degree and duration of saturation and the anaerobic conditions in the soil over time. Permanently installed piezometers measured free water in the soil and indicated the presence of two separated water tables from {{the onset of the}} rainy season in October until February when the entire soil profile became saturated with free water. Platinum electrodes measured redox potential in the soil and indicated anaerobic conditions for ten months during the first season of observation and through March of the second season. Anaerobic conditions were considered to be achieved when Fe⁺³ was reduced to Fe⁺² at a potential of 200 millivolts. The highly reducing conditions correspond to periods of soil saturation indicated by piezometers. Concentrations of iron and manganese observed in soil profiles correspond to conditions of prolonged saturation and reduction confirmed by monitoring. A soil stratigraphic study done with auger holes revealed a <b>recent</b> <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> of montmorrillonitic clay overlying lacustrine silts identified as the Irish Bend Member of the Willamette Formation. The clay deposit overlying the surface of the wetland acts as an aquitard and creates extensive surface ponding, which maintains the saturated habitat required for wetland vegetation. The subsurface hydrology is controlled by water flowing through the Irish Bend silts which results in saturation of the soils from below. Biogeochemical transformations of iron and manganese due to suboxic and anaerobic conditions are controlled by this type of soil saturation in the Jackson-Frazier wetland...|$|R
50|$|The larger part of Norfolk's bedrock geology is {{concealed}} beneath superficial deposits, {{the oldest}} {{of which is a}} spread of glacial till dating from the Anglian glaciation. Interspersed with the till are sheets of glacial sands and gravels. The fact that the Chalk scarp in East Anglia is much reduced in height compared to its outcrop in Lincolnshire and the Chiltern Hills has been put down to erosion by the Anglian icesheet which reached as far south as Essex. The late Devensian glaciation resulted in the North Sea icesheet impinging upon the north coast of Norfolk.

40|$|The Fujairah 1 : 50 000 {{geological}} {{map sheet}} covers {{a segment of}} the Hajar Mountains extending from the Gulf of Oman around the city of Fujairah in the east, to the desert plains of the Rub’ Al Khali in the west. The solid geology predominantly comprises rocks of the Oman-UAE ophiolite complex, with a small area in the centre-north underlain by medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks (Bani Hamid Group). The ophiolitic rocks comprise an earlier magmatic suite of mantle harzburgite and dunite, overlain by a classic spreading-ridge crustal section of layered gabbro, through “high-level” gabbro (mainly isotropic to varitextured gabbro), to a Sheeted Dyke Complex and topmost pillow basalt. These were intruded by a later magmatic suite comprising some dunite, a predominantly ultramafic “Mixed Unit” (including peridotites and pyroxenites), voluminous wehrlite bodies, and a suite of younger gabbroic rocks and associated minor intrusions (various mafic dykes, tonalites and bodies of magmatic breccia). The metamorphic rocks occur as thin tectonic slices within a major north-west-trending fault zone. They fall within the P 4 unit of the Bani Hamid Group of rocks and comprise quartz schists and quartzites, with minor amphibolites and calc-silicate rocks, metamorphosed under amphibolite facies conditions. The solid geology is partially covered by Miocene-Pliocene and Quaternary deposits. These are most extensive in the west, where the Hajar Mountains descend onto the desert plains and comprise palaeo-alluvial fan sands and gravels deposited on variably silicified serpentinite and mantle peridotites. These have been incised by Quaternary fluvial systems and are patchily overlain by <b>Recent</b> <b>alluvial</b> fan <b>deposits.</b> Elsewhere, the Quaternary deposits consist of alluvium and dissected river terraces, with scree and alluvial cones developed on the mountain slopes. Coastal zone deposits of the eastern seaboard include raised beaches and sabkhas, locally overlain by broad, low-angled alluvial fans issuing from the main wadis. ...|$|R

50|$|In the Cenozoic Era, which {{extended}} from 66 {{million years ago}} to present day, igneous activity was renewed {{in the eastern part}} of the State. Approximately 45 million years ago, a complex of dikes and sills with compositions ranging from basalt to rhyolite were intruded into the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the area in and around Pendleton County. These unusual igneous rocks are some of the youngest in eastern North America. Late in the Cenozoic Era, in fact extending to less than 100,000 years ago, glaciers covered the northern part of the North American continent, extending almost to the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia, but not into the State. Prior to the advance of these ice sheets, drainage of the Monongahela River was northward to the St. Lawrence River system. The ice sheet caused damming and a lake extended as far south as Weston. Important lake deposits, predominantly clay, were thus laid down in the Monongahela River basin. Drainage was diverted westward into the Ohio River system. Divergence of the New River system that formerly drained northwestward caused the deposition of similar deposits in the old Teays River channel between Charleston and Huntington. Except for <b>recent</b> <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits,</b> there are no other known Cenozoic rocks.|$|E
