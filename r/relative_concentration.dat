40|$|Purpose: There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in markers for cartilage degradation in synovial joints because of their potential diagnostic and prognostic value. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to identify valuable degradation markers for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis (OA) by comparing the <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of carboxyterminal telopeptides type I and II (CTX-I and II), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and prostaglandin E- 2 (PGE(2)) in the synovial fluid (SF) of TMJs with OA with those of healthy symptom-free TMJs. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, participants were recruited from the University Medical Center Groningen (Groningen, the Netherlands). Cases were defined as patients with TMJ OA, and control patients had symptom-free TMJs. The outcome variables were the <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of CTX-I, CTX-II, COMP, and PGE(2) in osteoarthritic TMJ SF compared with symptom-free joints. An independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Results: Thirty cases (9 male, 21 female; mean age, 40. 1 yr; standard deviation, 15. 3 yr) and 10 controls (5 male, 5 female; mean age, 30. 3 yr; standard deviation, 10. 8 yr) were studied. No significant differences in <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of CTX-I (P =. 548), CTX-II (P =. 842), COMP (P =. 140), and PGE(2) (P =. 450) were found between the groups. Unexpected low <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of CTX-I and high <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of CTX-II were observed. Conclusions: Assumed changes in the SF concentration of CTX-I, CTX-II, COMP, and PGE(2) in TMJ OA seem to occur proportionally. Furthermore, the unexpected large contribution of CTX-II suggests that this marker may be useful to quantify cartilage degradation in TMJ OA.

During calcination all the Sb ions in an antimony-containing tin dioxide catalyst transform into the +5 oxidation state.

A significant change in the chemical environment surrounding the antimony nucleus occurs during the oxidation state change which can easily be monitored as an isomer shift in the Mössbauer spectrum.|$|E

Explosimeters designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the <b>relative</b> <b>concentration</b> of the atmosphere to the LEL—the LEL being 100%. A 5% displayed LEL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 5.0%, or approximately 0.25% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the explosion hazard is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of flammable gases or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their lower explosive or flammable limit.|$|E
25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts.

We also investigated the associations of genetic variants of milk proteins and casein haplotypes with <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of α S -CN phosphorylation isoforms and with the phosphorylation degree of α S -CN in French Montbéliarde cattle from the cheese production area of Franche-Comté. Detailed milk protein composition was determined by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry from 531 test-day morning milk samples. Parity, lactation stage, and genetic variation of cows contributed to the phenotypic variation in <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of individual α S -CN phosphorylation isoforms and in the phosphorylation degree of α S -CN. As lactation progressed, we observed a significant increase for <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of α S -CN isoforms with higher degrees of phosphorylation (α S 1 -CN- 9 P, α S 2 -CN- 13 P, and α S 2 -CN- 14 P) {{as well as for}} the phosphorylation degree of both α S 1 -CN and α S 2 -CN. Furthermore, the β-CN I variant was associated with a greater proportion of isoforms with lower degrees of phosphorylation (α S 1 -CN- 8 P, α S 2 -CN- 10 P, and α S 2 -CN- 11 P); the β-CN B variant was associated with a greater proportion of isoforms with higher degrees of phosphorylation (α S 1 -CN- 9 P, α S 2 -CN- 12 P to α S 2 -CN- 14 P).

40|$|Purpose: Most of {{the current}} {{understanding}} of articular cartilage maintenance and degradation is derived from large load-bearing synovial joints, in particular the knee joint. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify valuable degradation markers for cartilage degradation in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) by comparing the <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of carboxyterminal telopeptides of collagen types I and II (CTX-I and CTX-II), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and prostaglandin E- 2 (PGE(2)) in synovial fluid (SF) of TMJ and knee joints with cartilage degradation. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional comparative study, participants were recruited from the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands. Patients with TMJ osteoarthritis were compared with patients with knee osteoarthritis. The outcome variables were the <b>relative</b> SF <b>concentrations</b> of CTX-I, CTX-II, COMP, and PGE(2). An independent samples Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Results: Thirty consecutive patients (9 male, 21 female; mean age, 40. 1 yr; standard deviation, 15. 3 yr) with TMJ osteoarthritis and 31 consecutive patients (20 male, 11 female; mean age, 37. 4 yr; standard deviation, 13. 7 yr) who were scheduled for arthroscopy of the knee joint participated in this study.

An equation was derived describing the calibration factor {{as a function of}} the concentrations of the radon progeny and was used to calculate values of the calibration factor over the entire theoretical range of <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of radon progeny that comprise a constant collective radon progeny concentration. The results of these calculations showed that the calibration factor varies by approximately 10 % over the entire theoretical range of <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> of radon progeny. The range of <b>relative</b> <b>concentrations</b> that typically exist in indoor air is a small subset of the entire range that is theoretically possible; therefore, the calibration factor varies, in practice, due to this effect by less than 10 % and the inherent error introduced by the detection and analysis method is not serious. Loss of radon progeny, particularly 218 ~ 0, due to plateout on surfaces of the monitor before the progeny are collected on the filter has the effect of lowering the value of the calibration factor.
