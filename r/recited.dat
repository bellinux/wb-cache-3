This paper discussed an analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of the resting state and calming mind during reading (<b>reciting)</b> Quran. The data collection of this study involves four different conditions, which are before <b>reciting</b> the Quran, before reading a book, during <b>reciting</b> the Quran and during reading a book thus establishing the comparison between reading a book and <b>reciting</b> the Quran, and also the relationship between each parietal cortex value for each condition. Reading book acts as a controller for <b>reciting</b> Quran because both conditions use the same action (read). Ten healthy subjects were recruited to measure their behaviors of mind during <b>reciting</b> Quran and reading book by using EEG wave. The results showed the negative correlation between reading book and <b>reciting</b> Quran for each subject. Moreover, the Quran could become a tool for meditation, reduces stress and be in resting state (calming mind). The results hopefully can help people to recognize the advantages and the need of Islam's practice in human life...|$|R
