40|$|Multimodal {{registration}} of intraoperative ultrasound and preoperative computed tomography imaging {{is the basis}} for percutaneous hepatic interventions. Currently a rigid registration is performed manually by the surgeon using vessel structures and other anatomical landmarks for visual guidance. In this work we are presenting our approach for automation of this intraoperative registration step. Our method relies on the vessel structures visible in contrast enhanced CT and ultrasound B-Mode volumes. Therefore, an important part of this work is the intraoperative segmentation of vessel structures from ultrasound. For the nine randomly chosen patients studied in this paper, our system achieves a 3. 45 mm accuracy for the points used for <b>registration</b> (<b>target</b> registration error (TRE)) and 5. 01 mm for other landmarks which were not used for the registration process (fiducial registration error (FRE)).

40|$|Abstract. Brain {{asymmetry}} {{has been}} a topic of interest for neuroscientists for many years. The advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows researchers to extend the study of asymmetry to a microscopic scale by examining fiber integrity differences across hemispheres rather than the macroscopic differences in shape or structure volumes. Even so, the power to detect these microarchitectural differences depends on the sample size and how the brain images are registered and how many subjects are studied. We fluidly registered 4 Tesla DTI scans from 180 healthy adult twins (45 identical and fraternal pairs) to a geometrically-centered population mean template. We computed voxelwise maps of significant asymmetries (left/right hemisphere differences) for common fiber anisotropy indices (FA, GA). Quantitative genetic models revealed that 47 - 62 % {{of the variance in}} asymmetry was due to genetic differences in the population. We studied how these heritability estimates varied with the type of <b>registration</b> <b>target</b> (T 1 - or T 2 -weighted) and with sample size. All methods consistently found that genetic factors strongly determined the lateralization of fiber anisotropy, facilitating the quest for specific genes that might influence brain asymmetry and fiber integrity. ...|$|E

This measurement is conducted at the outlet of the cascade wind tunnel at the Mach numbers 0. 3 and 0. 4, attack angle about − 20 °, ambient pressure 95. 4 kPa and temperature 15 °C. The vane under study owns a large camber angle of about 40 ° and 4 × 10 pressure ports on its suction surface with a steel cubic stand attached. It is fixed vertically on the lower guide steel plate at the outlet through the stand for convenient acquisition of images. Conventional electronic static pressure (ESP) measurement is also fulfilled simultaneously with an ESP scanner for comparison. The method of intensity-based PSP technique is introduced, especially, with the self-made PSP system. The operating sequence of PSP measurement for improved accuracy is also proposed. The practical steps of image processing are described. As an image <b>registration,</b> <b>target</b> alignment is introduced after the 4 × 10 pressure ports have been selected as targets.

40|$|The CLARITY method renders brains {{optically}} transparent {{to enable}} high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically annotating CLARITY brains {{is necessary for}} discovering which regions contain signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution, but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges {{the most commonly used}} registration algorithms that need to match image histogram statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically generates an average template as an intermediate <b>registration</b> <b>target.</b> We determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM) for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Capturing an {{enclosing}} {{volume of}} moving subjects and organs using fast individual image slice acquisition has shown promise {{in dealing with}} motion artefacts. Motion between slice acquisitions results in spatial inconsistencies that can be resolved by slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods to provide high quality 3 D image data. Existing algorithms are, however, typically very slow, specialised to specific applications and rely on approximations, which impedes their potential clinical use. In this paper, we present a fast multi-GPU accelerated framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. It is based on optimised 2 D/ 3 D registration, super-resolution with automatic outlier rejection and an additional (optional) intensity bias correction. We introduce a novel and fully automatic procedure for selecting the image stack with least motion {{to serve as an}} initial <b>registration</b> <b>target.</b> We evaluate the proposed method using artificial motion corrupted phantom data as well as clinical data, including tracked freehand ultrasound of the liver and fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

We ensure high reconstruction accuracy by exact computation of the point-spread function for every input data point, which has not previously been possible due to computational limitations. Our framework and its implementation is scalable for available computational infrastructures and tests show a speed-up factor of 1. 70 for each additional GPU. This paves the way for the online application of image based reconstruction methods during clinical examinations. The source code for the proposed approach is publicly available...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop the role of {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) in the radiotherapy (RT) planning process. This began by assessing a prototype inline three-dimensional distortion correction algorithm. A number of quality assurance tests were conducted using different test objects and the 3 D distortion correction algorithm was compared with the standard two-dimensional version available for clinical use on the MRI system. Scanning patients using MRI in the RT position within an immobilisation mask can be problematic, since the multi-channel head coils typically used in diagnostic imaging, are not compatible with the immobilisation mask. To assess the image quality which can be obtained with MR imaging in the RT position, various MRI quality assurance phantoms were positioned within an immobilisation mask {{and a series of}} image quality tests were performed on four imaging coils compatible with the immobilisation mask. It was shown that only the 4 -channel cardiac coil delivered comparable image quality to a multi-channel head coil. An investigation was performed to demonstrate how MRI patient position protocols influence registration quality in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical RT. The consequences for target volume definition and dose coverage with RT planning were also assessed. Twenty patients with prostate cancer underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan in the RT position, a diagnostic MRI scan and an MRI scan in the RT position. The CT datasets were independently registered with the two MRI set-ups and the quality of registration was compared. This study demonstrated that registering CT and MR images in the RT position provides a statistically significant improvement in registration quality, target definition and target volume dose coverage for patients with prostate cancer. A similar study was performed on twenty-two patients with oropharyngeal cancer undergoing radical RT. It was shown that when patients with oropharyngeal cancer undergo an MRI in the RT position there are significant improvements in CT-MR image <b>registration,</b> <b>target</b> definition and target volume dose coverage...|$|E

Processing of point cloud data is achieved through laser scanning software packages.

The main processing tasks used on a laser scanning software package include registration, modelling and texture mapping. Investigation and comparison of two laser scanning processing packages (Leica Cyclone and InnovMetric PolyWorks) are performed in this study. The theoretical and mathematical backgrounds of the above functions are presented and discussed. The available methods and functions used by each of the packages for these tasks are addressed and discussed.

The point clouds from different scan positions are then registered to each other by several reference targets, {{as well as by}} key morphological features in the point cloud without positional changes such as tree trunks and poles in the surrounding areas. For the matching of the key features, cloud-based registration is applied based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm built in the RealWorks software (Besl and McKay 1992; Bergevin et al. 1996). In this algorithm, one point cloud is fixed as a reference, and another cloud is transformed (shift and rotation) to best match the reference. Overlap areas with the same morphological features for both the reference and moving clouds are necessary to perform the matching. The transformation of the moving cloud is iteratively refined to minimize the distance between closest points in the moving and reference point clouds. The aligned point clouds are finally merged after achieving the least error of the cloud-based registration (at millimeter scales). Such a cloud-based registration method has an advantage in that many tie points (<b>registration</b> <b>targets)</b> are not necessarily set.

40|$|We propose {{combining}} a supervoxel-based image representation {{with the}} concept of graph cuts as an efficient optimization technique for three-dimensional (3 -D) deformable image registration. Due to the pixels/voxels-wise graph construction, the use of graph cuts in this context has been mainly limited to two-dimensional (2 -D) applications. However, our work overcomes some of the previous limitations by posing the problem on a graph created by adjacent supervoxels, where the number of nodes in the graph is reduced from the number of voxels to the number of supervoxels. We demonstrate how a supervoxel image representation combined with graph cuts-based optimization can be applied to 3 -D data. We further show that the application of a relaxed graph representation of the image, followed by guided image filtering over the estimated deformation field, allows us to model "sliding motion. " Applying this method to lung image registration results in highly accurate image registration and anatomically plausible estimations of the deformations.

The parametric estimation of the non-linear diffeomorphism between the 2 D fixed and moving images has its basis in solving a set of non-linear equations of thin-plate splines. The regularized bending energy of the thin-plate splines along with the localization error of established correspondences is jointly minimized with the fixed and transformed image difference; where, the transformed image {{is represented by the}} set of non-linear equations defined over the moving image. The traditional thin-plate splines with established correspondences may provide good registration of the anatomical targets inside the prostate but may fail to provide improved contour registration. On the contrary, the proposed framework maintains the accuracy of registration in terms of overlap due to the non-linear thinplate spline functions while also producing smooth deformations of the anatomical structures inside the prostate as a result of established corrspondences.
