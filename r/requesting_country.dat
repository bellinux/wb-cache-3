50|$|The {{questions}} {{involved are}} often complex {{when the country}} from which suspects are to be extradited is a democratic country with a rule of law. Typically, in such countries, the final decision to extradite lies with the national executive (prime minister, president or equivalent). However, such countries typically allow extradition defendants recourse to the law, with multiple appeals. These may significantly slow down procedures. On the one hand, this may lead to unwarranted international difficulties, as the public, politicians and journalists from the <b>requesting</b> <b>country</b> will ask their executive {{to put pressure on}} the executive of the country from which extradition is to take place, while that executive may not in fact have the authority to deport the suspect or criminal on their own. On the other hand, certain delays, or the unwillingness of the local prosecution authorities to present a good extradition case before the court on behalf of the requesting state, may possibly result from the unwillingness of the country's executive to extradite.|$|E

5000|$|Once the OIA {{receives}} a foreign extradition request, it reviews {{the request for}} sufficiency and forwards sufficient requests to the United States Attorney's Office for the judicial district in which the fugitive is located. The U.S. Attorney's office then obtains a warrant, and the fugitive is arrested and brought before the magistrate judge or the US district judge. The government opposes bond in extradition cases. Unless the fugitive waives his or her right to a hearing, the court will hold a hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3184 {{to determine whether the}} fugitive is extraditable. [...] If the court finds the fugitive to be extraditable, it enters an order of extraditability and certifies the record to the Secretary of State, who decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the requesting government.

The objective of this work is to conduct an empirical analysis of the economic and political determinants of such conditionalities. In particular, our main contribution consists {{in the development of a}} new measure of conditionality, fiscal adjustment, and its comparison with the most used in the literature, the number of conditions. We choose fiscal adjustment because it is an adequate proxy for program austerity, since its implementation carries economic and political costs. In the empirical exercise, we use data from 184 programs in the period of 1999 and 2012, and estimate how our two measures of conditionalities respond to the economic and political factors. Our results suggest that they are quite different. The main determinant of the number of conditions is the political proximity of the borrowing country to the Fund’s major shareholders, the members of G 5. On the other hand, the main determinant of fiscal adjustment is the size of the government fiscal deficit. Finally, we did not find correlation between the size of fiscal adjustment and the number of conditions. These results suggest that the analysis of the content of IMF programs should take into account the different measures of agreed conditionality...|$|E
40|$|Amnesty International {{reports on}} {{incidents}} of torture in 70 countries, and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is practised {{in an even}} greater number of states. Many persons from these states leave their home countries and seek refuge in Europe (and elsewhere). They often claim to be threatened with torture or other ill-treatment. Potential victims of such treatment are not always recognized as 'refugees' {{within the meaning of}} the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which would otherwise protect them against refoulement? However, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights can sometimes provide a measure of assistance. According to this provision 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'. The European Court of Human Rights held in its judgment in the 1989 Soering case that Article 3 prohibits the extradition of a person who is threatened with torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the <b>requesting</b> <b>country.</b> Extradition in such circumstances would, according to the Court, 'plainly be contrary to the spirit and intendment of the Article' and would 'hardly be compatible with the underlying values of the Convention'. In two cases decided in 1991 the Court held that the same considerations apply to expulsion cases. Thus the Court confirmed the position held for about 30 years by the European Commission of Human Rights. The Court's reasoning is convincing and has been widely accepted. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to examine the conditions under which a person can avoid forcible return under Article 3. Some procedural aspects will also be discussed.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{applying}} {{the rule of}} non-inquiry {{to the issue of}} whether the requested person has been charged is analytically incorrect where the relevant treaty defines as extraditable persons who have been charged or convicted of certain offenses, thus requiring a judicial determination as to whether the person requested has been charged as part of the initial inquiry into extraditability. By contrast, the rule of non-inquiry is typically used to reject arguments of persons who are otherwise extraditable. This issue has not received much analysis perhaps because federal courts are reluctant to look beyond an arrest warrant issued by a foreign judge for fear that they lack the knowledge needed to evaluate such an order. This paper argues several reasons why courts should consider whether the person to be extradited will face trial proceedings. In addition to this procedural analysis regarding at what point the rule of non-inquiry is applicable, this paper also stresses why it is necessary for U. S. federal judges to understand the criminal justice systems of other countries, and to engage in an analysis of such systems. This paper first discusses the importance of understanding the criminal justice systems of other countries to explain why, as a matter of general policy, the rule of non-inquiry should not apply. Next, this paper briefly outlines the extradition process and asserts that as a matter of method of analysis, {{the question of whether the}} relator has been charged for purposes of the extradition treaty must be answered as a first step in determining whether the relator is extraditable at all, thus before the rule of non-inquiry enters the analysis. The focus of this paper then shifts to the meaning of the word charged in extradition treaties, and whether, as a matter of treaty interpretation, that term includes one who is sought by a foreign country for the purpose of preventive detention. The point of this paper is not necessarily to criticize the code provisions permitting preventive detention in certain countries, but rather to demonstrate that an order of preventive detention does not constitute a charge under U. S. extradition treaties, and further that U. S. federal courts should make an effort to examine the procedure of the <b>requesting</b> <b>country</b> to determine whether the requested person has been charged. Finally, this paper discusses some recent cases which indicate that federal courts might be beginning to seriously consider the issue raised in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Information and Communications Technology (ICT) {{companies}} like Google/YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter {{are in control}} of an enormous amount of expression on the Internet. More so than any individual country, these companies are responsible for making decisions with regard to a vast amount of Internet expression. They host billions of pages of Internet content, while responding on a daily basis to countless requests from countries and individuals around the world to take down content that is deemed objectionable or illegal. These powerful ICT companies have become the de facto sovereigns of cyberspace, with the power to balance freedom of expression against public and private interests on a day-to-day basis, as they make determinations about whether and when to accede to requests to censor speech. Google, for example, is responsible for facilitating seventy-one percent of the world’s Internet searches. As the owner of YouTube, Google is also responsible for hosting one hundred hours of new video content that users post every minute. Executives at Google are responsible for making determinations about which controversial content stays up and which comes down. Twitter decision-makers enjoy similar, vast power to determine which of the one billion tweets sent every five days get disseminated around the world and which get blocked. The same goes for Facebook, Yahoo, and other global ICT giants. What guidelines should these companies follow in determining which content to facilitate and which to take down? Under what circumstances should ICT companies accede to governments’ or individuals’ requests to censor content? How, if at all, should they implement such censorship requests? Given that most of these powerful companies are U. S. based, some have contended that these companies should implement the United States’ speech-protective values and refuse censorship requests from other, less speech-protective countries. For example, if France requests that a U. S. based ICT company like Yahoo block content that violates French hate-speech laws, Yahoo arguably should simply ignore the request and export the First Amendment to other countries. But after a French court decision in 2000 rendered Yahoo criminally liable in France for failing to block French citizens’ access to certain hate speech content it hosted, Yahoo – and other global ICT companies – began to rethink this approach. Although initially resisting France’s power to influence what content Yahoo hosts – resulting in lengthy legal battles –Yahoo ultimately modified its policies to prohibit hosting of hate speech content. Instead of Yahoo exporting the First Amendment, it would seem in this instance that France exported its own less speech-protective laws to the U. S. {{and the rest of the}} world. How should global ICT companies respond to countries’ requests to censor content in light of the Yahoo-France dispute, in which France asserted the power to seize Yahoo’s local assets and detain local Yahoo executives for failing to comply with its laws? Is there a middle ground between imposing the First Amendment on the rest of the world, and acceding to every other country’s speech-restrictive censorship requests? How should global ICT companies balance these myriad competing concerns, amidst vastly conflicting regional free speech regimes?In this chapter, I argue that ICT companies should adopt and implement a set of procedural guidelines embodying principles of digital due process that protect the due process rights that are essential to democratic societies, while respecting the autonomy of each democratic society to determine the contours of substantive free speech rights for its citizens. Protecting due process rights is the first step in protecting and respecting human rights, which transnational corporations – as well as countries – have a duty to protect. As United Nations’ Special Representative of the Secretary-General emphasized in his “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework, business enterprises as well as nations have a duty to respect human rights. An important part of respecting human rights is respecting the rights of individuals to receiving due process in the protection of their rights. ICT companies should adopt and implement a set of due process principles that, I argue, are implicit in the free speech and due process jurisprudence of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United States Constitution. Before implementing any country’s request that they block content, ICT companies should (1) ensure that the <b>requesting</b> <b>country</b> has articulated within its laws a narrow, specific description of what speech is illegal, to confine the discretion of decision-makers and to provide fair notice to individuals of what speech is illegal in the first instance; (2) ensure that affected parties have received notice in cases where their speech has been deemed illegal and have had the opportunity to be heard in a fair, independent, and impartial proceeding before a censorship decision is ordered; (3) require that the <b>requesting</b> <b>country</b> has issued a narrowly tailored, final judicial decision adjudicating the subject speech as illegal; (4) implement the resulting blocking order only within the country mandating such blocking; and (5) implement the resulting blocking order in an open and transparent manner...|$|E
