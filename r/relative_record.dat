The decision for United {{to play the}} Union {{was due to the}} Union's proximity to United, and their <b>relative</b> <b>record</b> during the 2010 season. The match will be played 6 April 2011 at the Maryland SoccerPlex. United hosts the Union due to winning a coin flip. The winner of the D.C.-Philadelphia match will host New England Revolution in the second phase of MLS qualification. That match is expected to be played in late April 2011.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{processes}} of deforestation and loss of habitats represent {{a major threat to}} many species of mammals. These processes cause changes in natural landscapes by decreasing area, connectivity, and fragment size, and increasing edge effects and number of fragments. Understanding which and how many species persist in disturbed fragments may indicate the species' minimum requirements and might contribute to their conservation. Here we show how the mammalian fauna of medium and large size (higher than 1 kg) are structured in a semideciduous seasonal forest fragment of 36. 5 ha in the urban area of Jataí, Goiás. We performed the sampling with 30 sand track plots (1 x 1 m). We analyzed the <b>relative</b> <b>record</b> frequency and built a collector's curve to demonstrate the sampling effort. With a total effort of 600 track plots × days, we recorded twelve species of mammals with our tracks sampling method, from which only the wild mammals were included in the analyzes (11 species). The estimated species richness reached 13 species (SD (Standard Deviation) = ± 1, CI (Confidence Interval) = ± 2 (11 &# 8211; 15 species). The species with the highest <b>relative</b> <b>record</b> frequency was Didelphis albiventris and the species with the lowest was Tamandua tetradactyla. The fragment size must be a limiting factor to the richness and to the occurrence of species, as it may not be sufficient to allow the persistence of a population or an individual. Disturbances that originated from houses, like domestic animals and movement of people, also contributed to the removal and extinction of species. To conserve the species in the fragment, we suggest the prevention of entrance of people and of domestic animals. We also recommend increased connectivity of the fragment with the landscape external to the urban area in order to allow the movement of the currently present species...|$|E

While Cordless Recordings handled the digital distribution, Nervous <b>Relatives</b> <b>Records</b> handled the physical distribution. This tour was used as promotion for their new album, Fighting Naked, and took place from March through April 2007.

The chapelry of Crosbie, together with that of Richardstoun (Riccartoun) were attached to Dundonald and were granted by the second Walter the Steward to the short lived Gilbertine Convent which he had founded at Dalmulin in 1238.

40|$|A {{version of}} a {{secretary}} problem is considered: Let X j, j = 1, [...] .,n be i. i. d. random variables. Like in the classical secretary problem the optimal stopper only observes Y j = 1, if X j is a (<b>relative)</b> <b>record,</b> and Y j = 0, otherwise. The actual X j-values are not revealed. The goal is to maximize the expected X-value at which one stops. We describe {{the structure of the}} optimal stopping rule, its asymptotic properties and the asymptotic expected reward. Three different families of distributions of X are considered, belonging to the three different domains of attraction of the maximum. It is shown that both the time of stopping, as well as the expected reward are strongly distribution dependent. The last section discusses an ‘inverse’ of ‘Robbins’ Problem’. domain of attraction; relative record; relative rank; Secretary Problem; stopping rule; stopping value...|$|E
40|$|The present {{status of}} the environment, {{including}} environmental problems such as heavy metal accumulation in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, is in part the consequence of long-term changes. Cores from peatlands and other natural archives provide us {{with the potential to}} study aspects of the atmospheric cycling of elements, such as metal pollutants, on timescales much longer than the decade or two available to us with atmospheric deposition monitoring programs. The past decade especially has seen a rapid increase in interest in the biogeochemical record preserved in peat, particularly as it relates to environmental changes (e. g. climate and pollution). Importantly, recent studies have shown that carbon dynamics, i. e., organic matter decomposition, may influence the record of atmospherically derived elements such as halogens and mercury. Other studies have shown that under certain conditions some downward movement of atmospherically deposited elements may also occur, which adds complexity to establishing reliable chronologies as well as inherent problems of estimating accurate accumulation rates of peat and past metal deposition. Thus, we still lack a complete understanding of the basic biogeochemical processes and their effects on trace element distributions. While many studies have validated the general temporal patterns of peat records, there has been a limited critical examination of accumulation records in quantitative terms. To be certain that we extract not only a qualitative record from peat, {{it is important that we}} establish a quantitative link between the archive and the few to several decades of data that are available from contemporary monitoring and research. The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to focus on improving the link between the long-term paleorecord and the contemporary monitoring data available from biomonitoring and direct deposition observations. The main research questions have therefore been: Are peat archives an absolute or <b>relative</b> <b>record?</b> And how are geochemical signals, including dating, incorporated in the peat archive? What temporal resolution is realistic to interpret by using peat cores...|$|E

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A <b>relative</b> <b>record's</b> key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding <b>records.</b> <b>Relative</b> files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|R

40|$|A machine {{learning}} approach {{based on the}} fuzzy clustering {{for the study of}} single channel ionic current at several conductance states is presented. The procedure is able to cluster current jumps values into an optimal number of well separated parti-tions corresponding to the conductance multistate levels by the use of an original fuzzy validation index, the Partition Sum of Squares (PSS). This procedure allows to discriminate the single channel from multi channels and spikes due current in a more efficient way by the use of open channel noise.
