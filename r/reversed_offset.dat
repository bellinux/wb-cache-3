40|$|Ebstein's anomaly of the {{tricuspid valve}} is characterised by {{downstream}} {{displacement of the}} tricuspid leaflets. In {{the case of the}} septal leaflet, the result is exaggerated offsetting of the atrioventricular valves. Thus it might be supposed that in Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve, downstream displacement of the aortic (septal) leaflet of the mitral valve could move its attachment beyond that of the tricuspid valve, resulting in <b>reversed</b> <b>offsetting.</b> To examine this hypothesis three patients each with a concordant atrioventricular connection were studied. The first, with Marfan's syndrome and without an abnormal mitral valve, had <b>reversed</b> <b>offsetting</b> shown by echocardiography. The second, without Marfan's syndrome and with Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve, showed echocardiographically normal offsetting but a displaced mural leaflet. The third, in whom Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve was confirmed at necropsy, showed all the features of the second case, with normal offsetting of the atrioventricular valves. Thus <b>reversed</b> <b>offsetting</b> is not a feature of Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve and in the first case this feature was caused by upward displacement of the tricuspid valve secondary to dilation of the aortic root...|$|R

A 100 -mm-thick annular sample of siliceous sand (0. 6 mm mean diameter) is submitted to shear by the mean of a rotating cylinder in a semi-Couette geometry. We explore the role of shear stress perturbations related to small <b>reverse</b> <b>offsets</b> of the loading interface. We show that controlled releases of the shear stress induce shear strength increases when resuming shear load (i. e. the Tightening-up effect of unloading or Tu-effect). However, a threshold of the shear stress perturbation amplitude to get a significant restrengthening is observed. The shear strength increase is shown to be logarithmically related {{to the amount of}} imposed <b>reverse</b> <b>offset</b> and linearly to the induced volumetric strain. These results suggest that small perturbations of the contact status (i. e. inelastic strain) in the granular assembly of the gouge interface, have a major influence on the fault restrengthening...|$|R

Although multiple advances in developing printing inks and pastes with novel properties are being made, the potential those can bring to electronics is hindered by their stability and performance during the printing process. In this study a UV-LED curable acrylic material was used to test the optimization of inks and pastes for three of the most common direct writing systems: Piezo-type Inkjet, <b>Reverse</b> <b>Offset</b> Roll to Plate, and Micro Deposition. The viscosity of the photosensitive acrylic matrix was controlled by either the addition of diluents or electronically functional reinforcement material. The contact angle of the optimized solutions on 16 different Polyester, Polyimide, and Paper films was observed. Solutions with larger contact angles showed better line definition for the Inkjet and the Micro Dispense systems. In addition to the contact angle differential, the rheological properties showed to be a determinant factor for the feasibility of a solution to undergo the <b>reverse</b> <b>offset</b> printing process. The UV curable acrylic demonstrated electrical conductivity when 2 % (wt.) MWCNT were ultrasonically mixed in the matrix and then cured with a 385 nm wavelength for 3 seconds.

40|$|International audienceA {{synthesis}} of existing borehole data and seismic profiles {{has been conducted}} in the Artois area (northern France), along the northern border of the Paris basin, in order to explore the possible control exerted at depth by the Upper Carboniferous Variscan thrust front {{on the distribution of}} Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic depositional centers and their subsequent uplift in Tertiary times. Such control was demonstrated recently in the Weald-Boulonnais basin (Eastern Channel area) that forms the western prolongation of the area under study but was so far poorly constrained in the Artois area. Presented data provide evidence for the topography of the Artois hills and the altitude of sedimentary layers to be controlled by the activity of a network of relaying WNW-ESE striking faults inducing the systematic uplift of the southern fault blocks. Those steeply S-dipping faults branch downward onto the ramp of the Variscan thrusts forming lis tric faults that locally Iimit to the north buried half-graben structures, filled with fan-shaped fluviatile Stephanian-Permian deposits. Such c 1 ear syn-rift geometry shows that the ramp of the main Variscan frontal thrust (the Midi thrust) has been reactivated as a normal fault in Stephanian-Permian times thus forming a very demonstrative example of a negative inversion process. The <b>reverse</b> <b>offset</b> of the transgressive Middle Cretaceous-Lower Eocene layers covering unconformably the Paleozoic substratum argue for a Tertiary (Middle Eocene-Late Oligocene?) contractional reactivation of the fault network thereby documenting a repeated inversion process along the Artois Variscan thrust front.

30|$|In {{the southwestern}} {{section of the}} Futagawa segment, most {{ruptures}} displayed 70 – 100  cm of dextral offset (Fig.  6 a). Near Dozon, at {{the eastern end of}} this section, ruptures are composed of two strands that bound the Kiyama plain, a 5 -km-long north strand along the northern edge and a 7 -km-long main strand, along the southern edge of the plain (Fig.  4 a). The main strand consisted of a left-stepping en echelon array of five sub-strands striking NE-SW. These sub-strands displayed dominantly dextral slip and south-side-up normal slip and were separated by releasing stepovers 1 – 2  km long and 0.5 – 1  km wide. This complex distribution of the sub-strands resulted in large scattering of measured displacements of the southwestern section (Fig.  6). The main strand ended just east of Shimojin, and the north strand continued eastward to the main strand in the adjoin central section. The north strand was a relatively continuous and displayed a few restraining double bends. Displacements on the two strands were largest (90 – 120  cm) at their northeastern tips, and systematically decreased toward the west (Fig.  6 a). These two strands constituted a tweezers-shaped pair of splay faults, connected by a NW-striking sinistral-slip rupture near their closest approach (Fig.  4 a, i). Most of the surface ruptures were accompanied by left-stepping en echelon arrays of open cracks associated with dextral faulting, sometimes with a small south-side-up normal component (Fig.  4 c, d, f, g, h). At ruptures south of Shimojin and in Shimotogawa, the north side was downthrown 40 – 50  cm by normal faulting (Fig.  4 e). Near Shimojin and Fukuhara, pairs of dextral ruptures striking NW–SE were connected by a rupture with sinistral and <b>reverse</b> <b>offsets</b> (Fig.  4 a, i). The vertical and horizontal displacements on those sinistral ruptures both systematically decreased toward the northwest. The ruptures along the main strand nearly coincided with the previously recognized fault trace.

However, in most incident response situations, the responder often has {{no control over}} the precise version of the operating system that must be responded to. It is therefore critical to ensure that memory analysis tools are {{able to work with}} a wide range of OS kernel versions, as found in the wild. This paper characterizes the properties of different Windows kernel versions and their relevance to memory analysis. By collecting a large number of kernel binaries we characterize how struct offsets change with versions. We find that although struct layout is mostly stable across major and minor kernel versions, kernel global offsets vary greatly with version. We develop a “profile indexing” technique to rapidly detect the exact kernel version present in a memory image. We can therefore directly use known kernel global offsets and do not need to guess those by scanning techniques. We demonstrate that struct offsets can be rapidly deduced from analysis of kernel pool allocations, as well as by automatic disassembly of binary functions. As an example of an undocumented kernel driver, we use the win 32 k. sys GUI subsystem driver and develop a robust technique for combining both profile constants and <b>reversed</b> struct <b>offsets</b> into accurate profiles, detected using a profile index...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The Whittier fault {{forms the}} central part of a fault system {{extending}} from the East Montebello fault at Whittier Narrows to the Elsinore fault, which is traced as far as the Mexican border. The Whittier fault forms a restraining bend in this fault system, resulting in uplift of the Puente Hills. The northwestern part of the Whittier fault in the Whittier oil field in the eastern Los Angeles basin strikes approximately N 65 °W and dips 70 - 75 ° northeast. The fault is near the range front of the Puente Hills northwest of Turnbull Canyon, and within the Puente Hills to the southeast. The central reach of the Whittier fault had normal separation in the Relizian and Luisian stages of the middle Miocene. From the Mohnian through Repettian stages of the late Miocene and early Pliocene, little, if any, offset occurred until the initiation of <b>reverse</b> <b>offset</b> in the Venturian stage of the late Pliocene. A component of right-lateral strike-slip may have been added {{near the end of the}} Pliocene, coinciding with the formation of the Elsinore fault. The Workman Hill and Whittier Heights faults may have formed in the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene, coinciding with the possible initiation of strike-slip on the Whittier fault. The present sense of slip on the Whittier fault southeast of the study area is nearly pure right-lateral strike-slip, with a slip rate of 2 - 3 mm/yr. The northwestern part of the Whittier fault has a component of reverse slip of approximately 1 mm/yr. The amount of strike-slip on this part of the fault was not determined by this study. The Rideout Heights, 304, and 184 low-amplitude anticlines formed in the Whittier oil field area in the late Miocene and early Pliocene. The Rideout Heights anticline is a southwest-verging fault-propagation fold trending northwesterly from the mouth of Turnbull Canyon through the Rideout Heights area. Strata are overturned in the southwest limb of the fold, and normally dipping in the northeast limb; the fold has been cut along its hinge by the Whittier fault. The 304 and 184 anticlines are north-verging and appear to be beddingplane shear folds in the northeast limb of the La Habra syncline. Recent strike-slip on the Whittier fault may have reactivated the 184 anticline, causing uplift of the footwall block south of Turnbull Canyon. North of Turnbull Canyon, the Whittier fault is at the range front with no evidence of Quaternary footwall uplift. The 304 anticline could be a fault-propagation fold from a previously-unknown southwest dipping blind reverse fault south of the Whittier fault; uplift on this fold could also be the cause of footwall uplift south of Turnbull Canyon. Active fault traces, possibly strike-slip, are on or near the Whittier fault south of Turnbull Canyon, but to the north, recent offsets appear to be northeast of the Whittier fault in the Puente Hills. These offsets may represent an attempt of the Whittier fault to straighten itself by bypassing the restraining bend at Turnbull Canyon. so, this movement is too recent to offset conglomerate beds more than a few tens of meters...|$|R

Two tones that differed in pitch or two lights served as signal stimuli. Blink startle was elicited during some of the stimuli and during interstimulus intervals. Shin conductance responses were larger during task-relevant stimuli in both groups. Larger blink facilitation during task-relevant stimuli was found only in the group presented with auditory stimuli, whereas larger blink latency shortening during task-relevant stimuli was found in birth groups.

"May, 2012 "Deformation along the southeastern margin of the Wind River Mountains during the late stages of the Laramide orogeny is a result of local ~N-S Laramide shortening, which is in contrast to the regional NE-SW shortening typical in the Laramide orogen. The shortening resulted in the reactivation of Precambrian brittle structures that are concentrated north of the region where the trend of the Wind River thrust changes from its typical NW-SE trend to a more E-W trend. The Spring Creek fault (SCF) is an ENE-trending feature that extends from the Archean core of the range across Paleozoic and Mesozoic units deformed in Sheep Mountain anticline (SMA). Laramide reactivation of the Spring Creek fault produced <b>reverse,</b> south-side-up <b>offset</b> and steep to overturned sections of the Tensleep Sandstone and Madison Limestone on the hanging wall of the fault.

40|$|UnrestrictedNatural scenes {{have many}} special {{statistical}} properties {{that have shaped}} our visual system through natural evolution. It may thus be necessary to use natural images directly to examine retinal-ganglion-cells’ (RGCs) properties, rather than to extrapolate their properties from artificial stimuli. In this study, we first inspected what the most important visual property determining the responses of an RGC to natural images is. A new method was developed to estimate with natural images the sizes of the receptive-field (RF) center and surround. We showed that the center sizes estimated with our method {{were similar to those}} obtained with standard artificial stimuli. Furthermore, the temporal mean contrast of the center of the RF strongly dominated the RGC’s responses, while surround contrast mostly showed a weak and division-like (as opposed to subtractive) inhibition. We then asked whether the RGCs’ responses also depend on the local visual textures of natural images, or the luminance variation from the mean. We observed that RGCs responded asymmetrically between the transition from homogeneous backgrounds to natural images (onset), and the <b>reverse</b> transition (<b>offset),</b> even if both transitions had the same local temporal mean contrast. Furthermore, the negative of the natural images inverted this asymmetry, and their histogram equalization eliminated it. Hence, the response asymmetry arose from the asymmetric intensity distribution in the natural images. We further developed a method, spike-triggered contrast histogram (STCH), to demonstrate that a natural image with strong visual texture tended to elicit larger responses than one with weak texture. To account for these results, a nonlinear-linear model was developed. It included multiple subunits of nonlinear inputs, each covering a sub-region of the RF. Finally, we investigated whether the RGCs’ responses adapt to the spatial and temporal contrasts of natural images.; We found that RGCs displayed a variety of contrast-adaptation types across the population when responding to a step mean-contrast change of natural images, and that their contrast adaptation depended on the natural-image contrast difference. Thus, multiple biophysical mechanisms might be involved in RGCs’ contrast adaptation, and different RGC types might use a distinct subset of these mechanisms for different visual tasks...|$|R

40|$|A general {{feature of}} tectonic faults is the {{juxtaposition}} of materials with dissimilar elastic properties {{in a variety of}} contexts and scales. Normal and <b>reverse</b> faults <b>offset</b> vertical stratifications, large strike-slip faults displace different crustal blocks, oceanic and continental crusts at subduction interfaces, and oceanic transforms juxtapose rocks of different ages. Bimaterial interfaces associated with rock damage are present with various degrees of sharpness in typical fault zone structures, and failure along a bimaterial interface can be effective even on microscopic scale of grain boundaries. A first order representation of a geological fault for seismic events is a frictional interface embedded in an elastic body. This study focusses on dynamic effects in the presence of material discontinuities altering dynamics of failure and dynamic rupture propagation on frictional interfaces. When the medium surrounding a fault is heterogeneous, the symmetry of stress is broken up and perturbations of normal stress introduces additional instability potentially generating additional propagation modes of rupture. This study presents three specific numerical investigations of the aforementioned rupture phenomena associated with material contrasts at the fault. A first numerical study (a) investigates 2 -D in-plane ruptures in a model consisting of two different half-spaces separated by a low-velocity layer and possible simultaneous slip along multiple faults. This study shows that bimaterial frictional interfaces are attractive trajectories of rupture propagation, and ruptures tend to migrate to material interfaces and becoming self-sustained slip pulses for wide ranges of conditions. In a second numerical study (b), the propagation of a purely material contrast driven rupture mode, that is associated with the so-calledWeertman or Adams-instable pulse, is shown to exist also in the general 3 -D case, where there is a mixing of in-plane and anti-plane modes, the bimaterial mechanism acting in the in-plane direction only. Finally, in a further numerical investigation (c) it is demonstrated, that the rupture dynamics and ground motion can be significantly influenced by bimaterial mechanisms of rupture propagation for ranges of parameters. The model studied here comprises heterogeneous initial shear stress on a slip-weakening frictional interfaces separating two dissimilar elastic bodies, a free surface. The discussion focusses on the diversity of existing rupture propagation modes and ground motion. The investigated models and obtained results are motivated and discussed in the context of complementary numerical investigations, theoretical studies of stability analysis, seismological vii observations of earthquakes and aftershock sequences, geological observations of fault zone structures, tomographic studies, and geodetic observations...|$|R

Probing the redshift range z = [0. 2, 1. 0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an X-ray-detected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation derived {{from a combination of}} clustering and weak lensing statistics. At z = 1, we find that the stellar mass in star-forming (SF) centrals is a factor of two less than in passive centrals at the same halo mass. This implies that the presence or lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochastic process. By z = 0, the <b>offset</b> <b>reverses,</b> probably {{as a result of the}} different growth rates of these objects. A similar but weaker trend is observed when dividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. Remarkably, we find that SF centrals at z ~ 1 live in groups that are significantly more clustered on 10 Mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passive centrals. We discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recent simulations, suggesting that SF centrals prefer halos with higher angular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halos are known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. If confirmed, this would be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history of halos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that form inside them...|$|R

Rigid acetal resin tint blocks, hand or laser engraved, generate tone or colour {{that may be}} applied {{to more than one}} image. Multiple overprinting produces variant colour mixtures. Their function is similar to late nineteenth-century tints devised for colour letterpress printing. Compound printing surfaces of linoleum or vinyl are segmented and joined to make removable and replaceable parts. They print variable configurations in a process that resembles historical solutions to simultaneous colour printing: from the Mentz Psalter (1475), to the compound plates of William Congreve (1820) and the segmented wood engravings of John Holt Ibbetson (1819). These compound surfaces also act as receptors for impressions from the tint blocks. Repositioning and offsetting them is expedited by press furniture especially devised for the project. Registration devices are based on the simple Japanese kent? system and laser-cut circular chases derived from traditional letterpress furniture. Printing the tint blocks directly onto the flexible compound surfaces produce two viable prints that are offsets of each other. They are <b>reversed,</b> but one <b>offset</b> is also tonally inversed. It is this unpredictable tonality that has driven this experimental project. Both the construction and processes developed using the Modular System directed historical research into functional colour relief printing which consequently unearthed examples that would influence the further development of the project. This has generated both devices and processes capable of wider applications. Printing surfaces employed in the Modular System may be laser engraved or cut and adapted to use in both lithography and intaglio printmaking...|$|R
40|$|The Azambuja {{fault is}} a NNE {{trending}} structure located 50 km NE of Lisbon, {{in an area}} of important historical seismicity. It is sited in the Lower Tagus Basin, a compressive foredeep basin related to tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic Lusitanian Basin in the Miocene. The fault is evident in commercial seismic reflection data, where it shows steep thrust geometry downthrowing the Cenozoic sediments to the east. It has also a clear morphological signature, presenting a NNE-SSW trending, east facing, 15 km long scarp, reaching a maximum height of 80 m. The fault scarp is the geomorphic appearance of a flexure expressed as a zone of distributed deformation, where Miocene and Pliocene sediments are tilted eastwards and are cut by steeply dipping meso-scale faults presenting <b>reverse</b> and normal <b>offsets,</b> with a net downthrow to the east. This pattern at the surface is compatible with a steep fault in the basement that tilts and branches through the overlying Cenozoic sedimentary cover. In order to constrain the neotectonic activity of this structure, detailed geological studies were conducted. Morphotectonics was studied through aerial photo interpretation, analysis of topographic maps and digital mapping. Those studies indicate Quaternary slip on the fault in the ranges of 0. 05 – 0. 06 mm per year. Seismogenic behaviour was assumed for the Azambuja fault based on the evidence of Quaternary tectonic activity and its location {{in an area of}} significant historical seismicity. Mw 6. 4 – 6. 7 maximum earthquakes, with recurrence intervals of 10000 – 25000 years, were estimated based upon the displaced morphological references, cumulative offsets and fault length...|$|R
40|$|Extracting benthic oxygen fluxes from eddy {{covariance}} {{time series}} {{measured in the}} presence of surface gravity waves requires careful consideration of the temporal alignment of the vertical velocity and the oxygen concentration. Using a model based on linear wave theory and measured eddy covariance data, we show that a substantial error in flux can arise if these two variables are not aligned correctly in time. We refer to this error in flux as the time lag bias. In one example, produced with the wave model, we found that an offset of 0. 25 s between the oxygen and the velocity data produced a 2 -fold overestimation of the flux. In another example, relying on nighttime data measured over a seagrass meadow, a similar <b>offset</b> <b>reversed</b> the flux from an uptake of − 50 mmol m − 2 d − 1 to a release of 40 mmol m − 2 d − 1. The bias is most acute for data measured at shallow-water sites with short-period waves and low current velocities. At moderate or higher current velocities (> 5 – 10 cm s − 1), the bias is usually insignificant. The widely used traditional time shift correction for data measured in unidirectional flows, where the maximum numerical flux is sought, should not be applied {{in the presence of}} waves because it tends to maximize the time lag bias or give unrealistic flux estimates. Based on wave model predictions and measured data, we propose a new time lag correction that minimizes the time lag bias. The correction requires that the time series of both vertical velocity and oxygen concentration contain a clear periodic wave signal. Because wave motions are often evident in eddy covariance data measured at shallow-water sites, we encourage more work on identifying new time lag corrections...|$|R
40|$|Substrate {{deformation}} by pyroclastic {{density currents}} is very sparsely {{described in the}} literature. The rare occurrence of syn-depositional substrate deformation suggests that special circumstances are required to transmit shear {{from the base of}} a pyroclastic density current into the deposited ignimbrite and the substrate. One example of a substrate deformed by a pyroclastic density current is found {{at the base of the}} Pleistocene ignimbrite at Monte Cimino, central Italy. A series of <b>reverse</b> faults that <b>offsets</b> the basal contact were produced by the shear force of the pyroclastic current during deposition of the ignimbrite. The faults formed on the vent-facing side of a palaeo-slope that strikes sub-parallel to the flow direction of the pyroclastic current. Fault offsets suggest motion was parallel to the flow direction of the pyroclastic current, rather than down-slope. We propose that these faults resulted from fluctuations in the shear force of the pyroclastic density current as it was channelled down a palaeovalley. The lower flow boundary, which separated the deposited ignimbrite and the substrate from the moving pyroclastic density current, momentarily stepped down into the substrate, so that the upper 0. 5 m of the substrate and about 1. 5 m of the deposited ignimbrite became incorporated into the current. This momentary coupling of the current and the substrate induced reverse faulting in the substrate and the deposited portion of the ignimbrite. Deposition appears to have been ongoing during the formation of these faults, as well as afterward. Following the formation of the faults, the lower flow boundary seems to have been quickly re-established above the faults (approximately 1. 5 m above the base of the ignimbrite), allowing deposition to continue without further deformation of the substrate...|$|R
