25|$|The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of the United Nations {{considers}} a bicycle to be a vehicle, {{and a person}} controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements {{before it can be}} used on public roads. In many jurisdictions, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a <b>roadworthy</b> condition.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006 {{a hundred}} and {{thirteen}} people were injured in a four-bus pile-up north of Pretoria. The accident happened at the PUTCO depot where three buses had stopped when a fourth hit a bus from behind, causing each one to ram the vehicle in front of it. The provincial minister said to the press that both accidents {{could have been avoided}} if the drivers followed the rules of the road and the buses were in a <b>roadworthy</b> condition. The Mpumalanga Roads and Transport Department met staff from PUTCO to discuss the condition of some of the company's buses.|$|E
25|$|An MOT test {{certificate}} confirms {{that at the}} time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. It does not mean that the vehicle is <b>roadworthy</b> for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle but not its safety forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.|$|E
500|$|Boise National Forest is home {{to three}} of Idaho's scenic byways, {{all of which are}} paved {{highways}} accessible to <b>roadworthy</b> vehicles. The Payette River Scenic Byway is an [...] route between Eagle and McCall on Idaho State Highway 55. The route follows the Payette River between McCall and Horseshoe Bend, but the majority of the highway does not pass through Boise National Forest; only a small portion north of Horseshoe Bend is in the Emmett Ranger District. Over half of the [...] Wildlife Canyon Scenic Byway, which travels between highway 55 and Lowman, passes through the forest, parallels the South Fork of the Payette River, and is signed as the Banks-Lowman Road. The Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway is a [...] road between Stanley and Boise following Idaho State Highway 21. This route passes over Arrowrock Reservoir and through Idaho City and Lowman, where it connects with the Wildlife Canyon Byway. North and east of Lowman the byway partially follows the South Fork of the Payette River before ascending to the [...] Banner Creek Summit at the forest's boundary with Salmon-Challis National Forest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to start {{production of the}} car {{was made by the}} Volkswagen Group in 2001. [...] The first <b>roadworthy</b> prototype was completed in August 2003. [...] It is identical to the later series variant except for a few details. [...] In the transition from development to series production considerable technical problems had to be addressed, repeatedly delaying production until September 2005.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} private auto customizers have built {{replicas of the}} DeLorean time machine. Starting with a stock DMC-12, they added most, if not all, the props used by the movie {{producers}} for the picture cars. [...] In addition to the interior and exterior props, they feature working indicator lights and switches along with the actual sounds which duplicate the ones made by the movie car's controls when activated. [...] These vehicles are, for the most part, <b>roadworthy</b> DeLoreans with stock drivetrains, and are frequently driven to car shows and Back to the Future-related events.|$|E
2500|$|When UPS ground {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their useful service life and are no longer <b>roadworthy</b> (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Cars {{built before}} 1919 are classed as veteran cars and later models as vintage cars. Today, four main clubs exist {{to support the}} {{preservation}} and restoration of these cars: the Model T Ford Club International, the Model T Ford Club of America and the combined clubs of Australia. With many chapters of clubs around the world, the Model T Ford Club of Victoria has a membership with {{a considerable number of}} uniquely Australian cars. (Australia produced its own car bodies, and therefore many differences occurred between the Australian bodied tourers and the US/Canadian cars.) In the UK, the Model T Ford Register of Great Britain celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010. Many steel Model T parts are still manufactured today, and even fiberglass replicas of their distinctive bodies are produced, which are popular for T-bucket style hot rods (as immortalized in the Jan and Dean surf music song [...] "Bucket T", which was later recorded by The Who). In 1949, more than twenty {{years after the end of}} production, 200,000 Model Ts were registered in the United States. In 2008, it was estimated that about 50,000 to 60,000 Ford Model Ts remain <b>roadworthy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The BEST uses CNG and {{conventional}} diesel buses. As of January 2015, the BEST has a fleet 3600 buses. The fleet comprises single-decker diesel buses (602), CNG buses (2694), double-decker buses (122) and [...] Cerita A/C buses (282). All are tagged with a route number and its corresponding destination. They {{are displayed in}} the front in Marathi and on the side in English. In June 2005, in order to cut costs, BEST decided to hire buses from private operators instead of procuring new buses. These buses would look {{the same as a}} regular bus, but the maintenance and salaries would be taken care of by the private operators. But, till 2013, no buses have been hired by them. The BEST plans to install GPS systems on its buses, to monitor them in realtime. BEST entered into a barter deal with M/s Amnet in 2007 to install three CCTVs in each bus. Amnet also received the rights to advertise in the buses using two LCD screens.To keep this bus fleet <b>roadworthy,</b> a two-tier system of maintenance is followed by Transportation Engineering Department. A workshop located centrally at Dadar acts as one work centre. Dadar workshop has a built up area of 27,170 square meters. All unit overhauling, repairing of body damages, tyre cut repairs, plant and equipment installation and repairs, reclamation activities are carried out in the workshop.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1969, Presley called Porter {{to ask him}} to fix {{the sound}} for him in the main {{showroom}} at the International Hotel (renamed the Las Vegas Hilton two years later); he said he could not hear himself the last time he sang there, and a new run was scheduled for January. Porter went to see Presley's first rehearsal there, and found three stage monitors hanging [...] high above the stage, with only one working. The hotel's engineers did not get the other two to work, so Porter had some of his own Shure Vocal Master loudspeakers brought over from the recording studio. He laid the column loudspeakers on their sides at the front lip of the stage and propped them up to aim at Presley, who was very happy with the result. Presley insisted upon having Porter mix his live show in January even though he was a recording engineer with no experience in live sound. Porter quickly learned about acoustic feedback during the first song, but backstage after the show, film stars and musical artists kept complimenting Presley, telling him that the concert sounded [...] "just like the album". Porter ended up mixing Presley's live concerts from then on. Presley paid Porter well for a touring sound engineer; a 1974 contract for nearly two weeks of touring during September–October netted Porter $2,600, an amount equivalent to $ in current value. Porter recorded several of these shows in the mid-1970s, released as albums, and witnessed firsthand Presley's physical decline from drug abuse. In 1975, Presley's doctors advised him to exercise more, so he had a racquetball court built at his mansion Graceland. Porter designed and supervised the installation of a powerful high-fidelity Electro-Voice loudspeaker sound system for the racquetball court and an adjoining lounge. On tour, Porter specified the best-sounding, most <b>roadworthy</b> equipment that existed: he used a Midas PRO4 mixing console and UREI equalizers. The tour was supported by Clair Brothers, who supplied all the audio gear and a monitor engineer, Bruce Jackson, who designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show. In August 1977, Porter was changing planes in Boston to fly to Portland, Maine, to mix a Presley concert when he heard that the singer had died. He attended Presley's heavily guarded funeral ceremony at Graceland. Between Presley appearances, Porter also handled sound duties for Ann-Margret in Las Vegas and on the road, under the business name Captain Audio Productions. He consulted on television specials for Ann-Margret and for Bob Hope in 1972–1973.|$|E
60|$|For Chaumette's 'Deputation every day' {{has worked}} out its result: a Constitution. It {{was one of the}} rapidest Constitutions ever put together; made, some say in eight days, by Herault Sechelles and others: {{probably}} a workmanlike, <b>roadworthy</b> Constitution enough;--on which point, however, we are, for some reasons, little called to form a judgment. Workmanlike or not, the Forty-four Thousand Communes of France, by overwhelming majorities, did hasten to accept it; glad of any Constitution whatsoever. Nay Departmental Deputies have come, the venerablest Republicans of each Department, with solemn message of Acceptance; and now what remains but that our new Final Constitution be proclaimed, and sworn to, in Feast of Pikes? The Departmental Deputies, we say, are come some time ago;--Chaumette very anxious about them, lest Girondin Monsieurs, Agio-jobbers, or were it even Filles de joie of a Girondin temper, corrupt their morals.

60|$|The driving of 3,000 four-horse wagons, under escort, ninety {{miles of}} road, {{is such an}} {{enterprise}} as cannot readily be conceived by sedentary pacific readers;--much more the attack of such! Military science, constraining chaos into the cosmic state, has nowhere such a problem. There are twelve thousand horses, for one thing, to be shod, geared, kept <b>roadworthy</b> and regular; say six thousand country wagoners, thick-soled peasants: then, hanging to the skirts of these, in miscellaneous crazy vehicles and weak teams, equine and asinine, are one or two thousand sutler people, male and female, not of select quality, though on them, too, we keep a sharp eye. The series covers many miles, as many as twenty English miles (says Tempelhof), unless in favorable points you compress them into five, going four wagons abreast for defence's sake. Defence, or escort, goes in three bulks or brigades; vanguard, middle, rear-guard, with sparse pickets intervening;--wider than five miles, you cannot get the parts to support one another. An enemy breaking in upon you, at some difficult point of road, woody hollow or the like, and opening cannon, musketry and hussar exercise on such an object, must make a confused transaction of it! Some commanders, for the road has hitherto been mainly pacific, divide their train into parts, say four parts; moving with their partial escorts, with an interval of one day between each two: this has its obvious advantages, but depends, of course, on the road being little infested, so that your partial escort will suffice to repel attacks. Toiling forward, at their diligent slow rate, I find these trains from Troppau take about six days (from Neisse to Olmutz they take eleven, but the first five are peaceable [Tempelhof, ii. 48.]);--can't be hurried beyond that pace, if you would save your laggards, your irregulars, and prevent what we may call RAGGERY in your rearward parts; the skirts of your procession get torn by the bushes if you go faster. This time Colonel Mosel will have to mend his pace, however, and {{to go in the}} lump withal; the case being critical, as Mosel knows, and MORE than he yet knows.|$|E
