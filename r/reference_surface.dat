5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the <b>reference</b> <b>surface</b> is pushed.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical <b>reference</b> <b>surface,</b> and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E
25|$|Two {{levels of}} {{abstraction}} {{are employed in}} the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler <b>reference</b> <b>surface.</b> The simplest choice for the <b>reference</b> <b>surface</b> is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the <b>reference</b> <b>surface.</b> The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the <b>reference</b> <b>surface,</b> the correspondence being along the normal to the <b>reference</b> <b>surface</b> which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.|$|E

25|$|Tensor LEED is {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{computational}} effort needed by avoiding full LEED calculations for each trial structure. The scheme is as follows: One first defines a <b>reference</b> <b>surface</b> structure for which the I-V spectrum is calculated. Next a trial structure is created by displacing some of the atoms. If the displacements are small the trial structure can be considered as a small perturbation of the reference structure and first-order perturbation theory can be used to determine the I-V curves of a large set of trial structures.|$|E

Here, we are concerned with the separation of the spherical <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> along the longitudinal direction. We show that these surfaces should be equally spaced with respect to the fractional Fourier transform order, rather than being equally spaced with respect to the distance of propagation along the optical axis. The spacing should be of the order of the reciprocal of the space-bandwidth product of the signals. The space-dependent longitudinal and transverse spacings define a grid that reflects the structure of Fresnel diffraction. © 2011 Optical Society of America...|$|R

25|$|Before a disk can be accessed, {{the drive}} needs to {{synchronize}} its head {{position with the}} disk tracks. In some drives, this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile <b>reference</b> <b>surface.</b> In either case, the head is moved {{so that it is}} approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.|$|E

This work describes the use of uleSIMS as both a spectroscopic and depth-profiling tool for the characterization of {{the early stages of}} corrosion formed on <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> of silver. These samples are being developed to help with the characterization of tarnished surfaces in a cultural heritage context, and uleSIMS enables the tarnishing to be studied from its very earliest stages due to its high sensitivity (ppm-ppb) and surface specificity. We show that, uleSIMS can be used effectively to study the surface chemistry and aid the development of <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> themselves. In particular, handling contaminants, surface dust, and residues from polishing are relatively easy to identify allowing them to be separated from the parts of the mass spectrum specific to the early stages of corrosion.

5000|$|However, planetocentric {{longitude}} {{is always}} measured positively to the east, {{regardless of which}} way the planet rotates. East {{is defined as the}} counter-clockwise direction around the planet, as seen from above its north pole, and the north pole is whichever pole more closely aligns with the Earth's north pole. Longitudes traditionally have been written using [...] "E" [...] or [...] "W" [...] instead of [...] "+" [...] or [...] "−" [...] to indicate this polarity. For example, the following all mean the same thing:The <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> for some planets (such as Earth and Mars) are ellipsoids of revolution for which the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius; in other words, they are oblate spheroids. Smaller bodies (Io, Mimas, etc.) tend to be better approximated by triaxial ellipsoids; however, triaxial ellipsoids would render many computations more complicated, especially those related to map projections. Many projections would lose their elegant and popular properties. For this reason spherical <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> are frequently used in mapping programs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{graticule}} {{is formed}} by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed {{with reference to the}} rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the <b>reference</b> <b>surface.</b> Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the Prime Meridian) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the Equator. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0°, the North Pole has a latitude of 90° North (written 90°N or +90°), and the South Pole has a latitude of 90° South (written 90°S or −90°). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal {{to the surface of the}} sphere is [...] along the radius vector.|$|E

40|$|Electroanalysis offers {{cheap and}} {{selective}} analysis of interesting solutions. However, {{one of the}} most common drawbacks is the accessibility for electrochemical sensing. By using high-pressure microfluidics with an integrated three-electrode system, new possibilities open for increased accessibility. Therefore, there is a need to fabricate sustainable <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> into highly pressure tolerant microchannels. In this thesis, Ag/AgCl <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> were in-situ fabricated in high-pressure microfluidic chips. This was performed by electroplating Ag on thin film Pt in microchannels and then chlorinating the silver into Ag/AgCl. Electroanalysis of ferrocyanide was carried out in a microfluidic chip using one of the in-situ fabricated Ag/AgCl references. The half-wave potential showed to be around + 251 mV and the electrochemical water window was measured to 1400 mV with a range between - 300 mV and + 1100 mV. The obtained values show to be comparable to reference data of similar experiments performed elsewhere. For some applications of electrochemistry, a catalysis surface is beneficial. Nanoporous Pt black has proved to generate high catalytic performance in electrochemistry. Therefore, attempts have been carried out to fabricate Pt black onto Pt thin films, with the vision to succeed with such fabrication within microfluidic channels. To summarize, this project work has showed a possibility to in-situ fabricate Ag/AgCl <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The project has also showed how to use such <b>surfaces</b> as <b>reference</b> electrodes for electroanalysis in high-pressure microfluidic chips. Lastly, new challenges and ideas to fabricate catalysis surfaces on thin film electrodes in flow channels have been presented.

The project accomplishments are summarized below: (1) ERA Systems, Inc., The MESERAN Company has designed, developed, built, evaluated, tested, and delivered MicroSolventEvaporator systems to KCP, Astro Pak, and Lockheed Martin, that automatically deposit and evaporate successive small quantities (5 - 10 microliters) of solvents onto clean <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces.</b> (2) ERA Systems, Inc., The MESERAN Company, and KCP have designed, procured, and evaluated stainless steel disks with specific machined grooves to be used as <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> with the MicroSolventEvaporator and MESERAN Analyzers. (3) KCP evaluated various cleaning processes to easily clean the <b>reference</b> <b>surfaces</b> to acceptable levels. Even though some methods (or a combination of methods) may have worked better than others, an easy method that most companies could use to acceptably clean the disks was desired. Aqueous ultrasonic cleaning with Dirl Lum 603 (30 g per liter concentration) followed by flowing DI water and ultrasonic DI water rinses, nitrogen blow drying, and baking in a HEPA filtered oven at 220 F for 30 minutes proved to be a relatively simple method that most companies could use.
