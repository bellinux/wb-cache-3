5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the <b>Regulators.</b> They obtained an indictment against many of the <b>Regulators</b> charging them with murder. The <b>Regulators</b> responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{continued}} intervening {{on behalf}} of Keating after the April 1987 meetings, contacting both Wall and California state <b>regulators</b> and continuing to receive large amounts of new donations to the voter registration projects from Keating. DeConcini also continued {{on behalf of}} Keating, contacting Wall, California State <b>regulators,</b> and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) advocating approval of a sale of Lincoln as a December 1988 alternative to government seizure. Bank <b>regulators</b> refused to approve the sale of Lincoln. Glenn too continued to help Keating after the April 1987 revelation, by setting up a meeting with then-House Majority Leader Jim Wright.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} do {{not believe}} that the compliance pyramid applies when legitimate differences of views exist as to compliant behaviour. <b>Regulators</b> all need to establish their positions in this situation, but it is clear that some <b>regulators</b> do still apply the compliance pyramid when the law is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Blower Motor <b>Regulator</b> - If {{this part}} fails, the climate control fan will not operate faster than {{approximately}} 50% power. Mercedes updated the <b>regulator</b> {{to improve its}} reliability, but the redesigned <b>regulator</b> requires the installation of a new blower motor—about $1,000 in parts. The old-style <b>regulator,</b> which {{is compatible with the}} existing blower motor, is no longer manufactured. The blower motor <b>regulator</b> may be replaced with the much less expensive W140 S-class blower <b>regulator,</b> provided that the E-class wiring harness is re-attached to the S-class <b>regulator.</b>|$|R

50|$|There is {{controversy}} over {{the invention of the}} first single hose <b>regulator.</b> The invention was motivated by an effort to bypass Aqua-Lung's patent on the double hose <b>regulator.</b> This patent involved the return of exhaust gas to the <b>regulator</b> to reduce the differential pressure and therefore reduce work of breathing. The single hose <b>regulator</b> accomplishes this by relocating a portion of the <b>regulator</b> to the point of exhaust, rather than routing the exhaust back to the <b>regulator.</b>|$|R
5|$|The core {{allegation}} of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, {{and he called}} on those Senators to help him resist <b>regulators.</b> The <b>regulators</b> backed off, to later disastrous consequences.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} has been widely adopted, particularly within Australia. Several other <b>regulators</b> have similar approaches. It is also described as the enforcement pyramid by some <b>regulators</b> although enforcement {{is only one of}} the compliance strategies implicit in the model.|$|E

2500|$|Many power {{supplies}} use {{more than one}} regulating method in series. For example, the output from a switching <b>regulator</b> can be further regulated by a linear <b>regulator.</b> The switching <b>regulator</b> accepts {{a wide range of}} input voltages and efficiently generates a (somewhat noisy) voltage slightly above the ultimately desired output. That is followed by a linear <b>regulator</b> that generates exactly the desired voltage and eliminates nearly all the noise generated by the switching <b>regulator.</b> Other designs may use an SCR <b>regulator</b> as the [...] "pre-regulator", followed by another type of <b>regulator.</b> An efficient way of creating a variable-voltage, accurate output power supply is to combine a multi-tapped transformer with an adjustable linear post-regulator.|$|R

5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual <b>regulators</b> {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage <b>regulators,</b> each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
