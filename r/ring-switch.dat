40|$|Flagellum {{formation}} in Caulobacter crescentus requires ca. 50 flagellar genes, {{most of which}} belong {{to one of three}} classes (II, III, or IV). Epistasis experiments suggest that flagellar gene expression is coordinated with flagellum biosynthesis by two assembly checkpoints. Completion of the M/S <b>ring-switch</b> complex is required for the transition from class II to class III gene expression, and completion of the basal body-hook structure is required for the transition from class III to class IV gene expression. In studies focused on regulation of the class IV flagellin genes, we have examined fljK and fljL expression in a large number of flagellar mutants by using transcription and translation fusions to lacZ, nuclease S 1 assays, and measurements of protein stability. The fljK-lacZ and fljL-lacZ transcription fusions were expressed in all class III flagellar mutants, although these strains do not make detectable 25 - or 27 -kDa flagellins. The finding that the fljK-lacZ translation fusion was not expressed in the same collection of class III mutants confirmed that fljK is regulated posttranscriptionally. The requirement of multiple class III genes for expression of the fljK-lacZ fusion suggests that completion of the basal body-hook is an assembly checkpoint for the posttranscriptional regulation of this flagellin gene. Deletion analysis within the 5 ' untranslated region of fljK identified a sequence between + 24 and + 38 required for regulation of the fljK-lacZ fusion by class III genes, which implicates an imperfect 14 -bp direct repeat in the posttranscriptional regulation of fljK. Our results show that fljL is also regulated posttranscriptionally by class III and unclassified flagellar genes, apparently by a mechanism different from the one regulating fljK...|$|E
40|$|BGV-style {{homomorphic}} encryption schemes over polynomial rings, rely {{for their}} security on rings of very large dimension. This large dimension is needed {{because of the}} large modulus-to-noise ratio in the key-switching matrices that are used for the top few levels of the evaluated circuit. However, larger noise (and hence smaller modulus-to-noise ratio) is used in lower levels of the circuit, so from a security standpoint it is permissible to switch to lower-dimension rings, thus speeding up the homomorphic operations for the lower levels of the circuit. However, implementing such <b>ring-switching</b> is nontrivial, since these schemes rely on the ring algebraic structure for their homomorphic properties. A basic <b>ring-switching</b> operation was used by Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan, over polynomial rings of the form Z[X]/(X 2 n + 1), in the context of bootstrapping. In this work we generalize and extend this technique to work over any cyclotomic ring and show how it can be used not only for bootstrapping but also during the computation itself (in conjunction with the “packed ciphertext ” techniques of Gentry, Halevi and Smart.) Note: A later version of this work, with a substantially different transformation, appears in SCN 2012...|$|R

40|$|The ATPase {{cycle of}} GroE chaperonins has been {{examined}} by transient kinetics to dissect partial reactions in complexes where GroEL is asymmetrically loaded with nucleotides. The occupation of one heptameric ring by ADP does not inhibit the loading {{of the other}} with ATP nor does it prevent the consequent structural rearrangement to the "open" state. However, ADP binding completely inhibits ATP hydrolysis in the asymmetric complex, i. e. ATP cannot by hydrolysed when ADP is bound to the other ring. This non-competitive inhibition of the ATPase by ADP {{is consistent with a}} <b>ring-switching,</b> or "two-stroke", mechanism of the type: ATP:GroEL [...] > ADP:GroEL [...] > ADP:GroEL:ATP [...] > GroEL:ATP [...] > GroEL:ADP, i. e. with respect to the GroEL rings, ATP turns over in an alternating fashion. When the ATP-stabilized, "open" state is challenged with hexokinase and glucose, to quench the free ATP, the open state relaxes slowly (0. 44 s- 1) back to the apo (or closed) conformation. This rate, however, is three times faster than the hydrolytic step, showing that bound ATP is not committed to hydrolysis. When GroES is bound to the GroEL:ATP complex and the system is quenched in the same way, approximately half of the bound ATP undergoes hydrolysis on the chaperonin complex showing that the co-protein increases the degree of commitment. Thus, non-competitive inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, combined with the ability of the co-protein to block ligand exchange between rings has the effect of imposing a reciprocating cycle of reactions with ATP hydrolysing, and GroES binding, on each of the GroEL rings in turn. Taken together, these data imply that the dominant, productive steady state reaction in vivo is: GroEL:ATP:GroES [...] > GroEL:ADP:GroES [...] > ATP:GroEL:ADP:GroES [...] > ATP:GroEL:ADP [...] > GroES:ATP:GroEL:ADP [...] > GroES:ATP:GroEL for a hemi-cycle, and that significant inhibi tion of hydrolysis may arise through the formation of a dead-end ADP:GroEL:ATP:GroES complex...|$|R
