5000|$|Mendel's {{findings}} allowed scientists such as Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane {{to predict}} the expression of traits {{on the basis of}} mathematical probabilities. An important aspect of Mendel's success can be traced to his decision to start his crosses only with plants he demonstrated were true-breeding. He also only measured absolute (binary) characteristics, such as color, shape, and position of the seeds, rather than quantitatively variable characteristics. He expressed his results numerically and subjected them to statistical analysis. His method of data analysis and his large sample size gave credibility to his data. He also had the foresight to follow several successive generations (F2, F3) of pea plants and record their variations. Finally, he performed [...] "test crosses" [...] (backcrossing descendants of the initial hybridization to the initial true-breeding lines) to reveal the presence and proportions of <b>recessive</b> <b>characters.</b> Without his diligence and careful attention to procedure and detail, Mendel's work would have had a much smaller impact on the world of genetics.|$|R
40|$|Results: I do, however, contend that, if so much {{speciation}} occurs, it must {{result from}} a process of natural selection, whereby it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a group and reduce their breeding {{with the rest of}} the population, leading to a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups &#x 201 c;budding&#x 201 d; from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise passively as a consequence of drift in isolated populations, but under the selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Most documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, many <b>recessive</b> <b>characters</b> identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity. |$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between three non-nodulation mutants (nod 49, nod 772 and nod 139) and a supernodulation mutant (nts 382) of soybean was studied by analysing the progeny from crosses between these mutants. Previously {{it had been}} shown that the non-nodulation mutants arose from single mutation events and that nod 49 and nod 772 are allelic, whereas nod 139 represents another gene required for nodulation. Analysis of progeny from crosses between nts 382 and the wild type showed that this mutant also arose from a single mutation. Complementation tests demonstrated that the mutation responsible for supernodulation in nts 382 is not allelic to either of these non-nodulation characters, and that it segregates independently. Progeny were identified that were homozygous for both supernodulation and non-nodulation, and these plants were incapable of nodulation. Thus, non-nodulation is epistatic over supernodulation and this is {{discussed in terms of}} the developmental blockage in the two mutant types. The identification and confirmation of these double mutants of the supernodulation and non-nodulation mutations are described.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Our {{study of}} genetic {{homozygosity}} degree includes {{an analysis of}} the presence, distribution and individual combination of 15 selected genetically controlled morphophysiological traits in the sample of patients with spinal dysraphia (N= 35) and in the control-healthy group (N= 50). OBJECTIVE Assuming that spinal dysraphia is a genetically controlled disease, we made a hypothesis that an increased homozygosity level, as well as the changed variability among patients, could be a population-genetic parameter for the prediction of the illness. METHOD Taking into consideration our experience, as well as the experience of numerous scientists who studied the nature of the inheritance of monoand oligo-genically controlled qualitative traits, we applied a methodology to estimate the proportion of such homozygously <b>recessive</b> <b>characters</b> (HRC-test,). RESULTS This population-genetic study did not only show a statistically significant difference of the mean values of genetic homozygosity (SD 4. 8 ± 0. 3; control 3. 5 ± 0. 3), but of the differences in the type of distribution too, as well as the differences in the presence of certain individual combinations of such traits. CONCLUSION Due to the fact that those genes which control such qualitative recessive traits are distributed in different human chromosomes, being their visible markers, this could indicate that degrees of genetic homozygosity are ostensibly greater in a sample of patients with spinal dysraphia compared to the control group of individuals...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{learning}} study that employed variation theory to enhance a domain-specific generic-capability pedigree analysis of Hong Kong secondary five students so as to help them develop their capability to solve pedigree problems. Pedigree analysis is a study of inheritance in genetics, which includes the deduction of dominant and <b>recessive</b> <b>characters.</b> The literature and local examination reports suggested that solving pedigree problems is difficult for students, as the process of deduction demands conceptual understanding and use of scientific language. Three biology teachers participated in this learning study using variation theory. Teachers shifted the focus of lesson observation from teaching performance to student learning, to how students deduced the dominant character from pedigree problems, which was the object of learning. To explore the effectiveness of such teaching and learning to solve pedigree problems through different patterns of variation, two cycles of learning study were conducted in two senior biology classes. Results showed that students were more able to deduce the dominant character with relevant genetic principles by experiencing the variations. Both conceptual understanding and scientific language are critical aspects of solving pedigree problems. This study also suggests that explanatory scientific writing needs to {{be broken down into}} different components and then differentiated patterns of variation designed to let students discern those components and their relationships; in that way their writing can be ‘scaffolded’ in a stepwise manner rather than giving them the whole writing framework at once. However, the identification of critical features and patterns of variation and their relevance to the object of learning should be considered carefully and explored further. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Speciation {{corresponds}} to the progressive establishment of reproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral stock. Since Darwin {{did not believe that}} reproductive barriers could be selected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a process of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by most evolutionary biologists today. Results I do, however, contend that, if so much speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be conditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other words, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce preferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding {{with the rest of the}} ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small inbreeding groups "budding" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding. Reproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of divergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the direct selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many <b>recessive</b> <b>characters</b> identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation, with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited genomic diversity. Conclusions Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to gains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of speciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the advantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that could ultimately only lead to extinction.

40|$|In mammals, the DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt 1) {{faithfully}} copies {{the pattern}} of cytosine methylation at CpG sites to the newly synthesized strand, and this is essential for epigenetic inheritance.

Therefore, the <b>recessive</b> <b>character</b> of the mutations excludes the affected components from a regulatory role in postmeiotic maintenance or modification of epigenetic states. Here we show, however, that depletion of A. thaliana MET 1, a homolog of mammalian Dnmt 1 (ref. 8), results in immense epigenetic diversification of gametes.

40|$|Background: Blood group {{serology}} plays a {{vital role}} in transfusion medicine. The Bombay (Oh) phenotype is characterized by the absence of A, B, and H antigens on red cells and occurs rarely, especially in tribal populations of India. Aims and Objectives: This is a field-based random population study in the Bhuyan tribal community. The study reports three cases of the rare Bombay (Oh) phenotype {{for the first time in}} the Bhuyan tribe of Sundargarh district in North-Western Orissa. Materials and Methods: Taking informed consent, red blood cells of 836 Bhuyan subjects were tested with three antisera, i. e., anti-A, anti-B, and anti-H (lectin) for forward reaction. Agglutinations of plasma with A, B, and O (H) red cells (reverse reaction) were also tested for the presence or absence of antibodies in the serum. Specialized tests like absorption-elution, titration of naturally occurring antibodies at different temperatures, inhibition of anti-H by O saliva secretor, and determination of secretor status were performed. Results: Three cases of a rare blood group, Bombay (Oh) phenotype, (2 out of 244 Khandayat Bhuyan and 1 out of 379 Paudi Bhuyan from Hemgiri and Lahunipara blocks, respectively) in the Bhuyan tribe of Sundargarh district in North-Western Orissa were detected, giving an incidence of 1 in 122 in Khandayat Bhuyan and 1 in 379 in Paudi Bhuyan, with an average of 1 in 278 among the Bhuyan tribal population. This incidence is high in comparison to earlier studies reported from India.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that merosin, a laminin variant, is deficient in a proportion of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy. Merosin is a heterotrimer composed of the &alpha; 2, &beta; 1, and &gamma; 1 subunits, and further {{studies have shown that}} it is the &alpha; 2 subunit that is deficient in these patients. Because the &alpha; 2 subunit is also expressed in S-merosin, found in Schwann cells, we have investigated whether peripheral nerve function is also affected in these patients. Motor nerve conduction velocities and sensory distal latencies were examined in 25 cases of congenital muscular dystrophy and the results corre-lated with the merosin expression in their muscle biopsies. All but two of the 10 merosin-deficient cases had reduced motor nerve conduction, whereas all the merosin-positive cases had normal results. Analysis of the biopsies of these two cases showed that they produced merosin in reduced amounts, in contrast to all other merosin-deficient patients that pro-duced no or only traces of merosin. Sensory nerve studies showed no difference between the two groups. These results indicate that a peripheral demyelinating neuropathy is a feature of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy.

Different (dominant / recessive) genes control each accession for Ct, C 50, and C 0.

40|$|One of the {{pleiotropic}} phenotypes of mutations affecting DNA gyrase {{activity in}} Salmonella typhimurium is the constitutive deattenuation of the histidine operon. In the present work, we isolated and characterized a suppressor mutation which restores his attenuation {{in the presence}} of a defective gyrase. Such a suppressor, initially named sgdA 1 (for suppressor gyrase deficiency), was found to correct additional phenotypes associated with defective gyrase function. These include the aberrant nucleoid partitioning of a gyrB mutant and the conditional lethality of a gyrA mutation. Furthermore, the sgdA 1 mutation was found to confer low-level resistance to nalidixic acid. The last phenotype permitted isolation of a number of additional sgdA mutants. Genetic analysis established the <b>recessive</b> <b>character</b> of these alleles as well as the position of the sgdA locus at 57 U on the Salmonella genetic map. All of the sgdA mutants result from the same molecular event: a deletion removing three of the four tandemly repeated copies of argV, the gene which specifies tRNA(2 Arg), the major arginine isoacceptor tRNA. These findings, combined with the observation of some Sgd-like phenotypes in a tRNA modification mutant (hisT mutant), lead us to propose that protein synthesis contributes, directly or indirectly, to the pathology of gyrase alterations in growing bacteria. We discuss plausible mechanisms which may be responsible for these effects...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} experiments, seven {{lines of}} valine-resistant plants were regenerated from protoplast-derived haploid tobacco mesophyll cells {{which had been}} UV mutagenized and submitted to selection by toxic concentrations of valine. In this study we described the transmission of valine-resistance to progeny and a preliminary phenotypical and biochemical characterization of the resistant plants. —Two types were thus distinguished among the seven mutant lines. Valine-resistance of the mutants of the first type (three lines) was transmitted as a single Mendelian dominant character (Vr 1), whereas valine-resistance of the second type (four lines) was transmitted as a digenic <b>recessive</b> <b>character</b> (vr 2 and vr 3). Allelism tests revealed that the four recessive mutant lines yielded resistant progeny when intercrossed and, therefore, bear recessive mutant alleles at the same two unlinked loci. —When cultured at a density of 100 cell/ml, protoplast-derived cells of mutants of the first type had {{a low level of}} resistance to valine, whereas protoplast-derived cells of mutants of the second type displayed a high level of resistance to valine and to other amino acids. —According to the results of 14 C-labelled amino acid uptake experiments, the amino acid resistance of mutants of the second type, but not valine-resistance of the first type, could be accounted for by reduced uptake of several amino acids. Possible uses of valine-resistance as a marker in plant cell genetics are discussed...|$|E
