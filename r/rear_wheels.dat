5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{different}} sizes. Instead of a spare wheel, a roadside repair kit with a 12 volt electric compressor (plugs into cigarette lighter) {{and a bottle}} of repair fluid is located under the cushion of the rear passenger seat.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E

5000|$|One {{variation}} {{is to have}} a 29" [...] front wheel and a 26" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> (commonly called a [...] "96er"). Using the smaller <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> allows shorter and quicker handling frames, more options for rear suspension designs and lighter bicycle weight. Another {{variation is}} to have a 26" [...] front wheel with a 29" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> (commonly called a [...] "69er" [...] though Trek introduced a [...] "69er" [...] in 2007 with a 29" [...] front wheel and a 26" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel).</b>|$|R
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E

5|$|Razer's next {{appearance}} {{came in a}} Robot Wars Christmas special {{called the}} Southern Annihilator. Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through immobilisation or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its full height and refuse to lower. With its <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{steering mechanism}}. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front wheel steering type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable lateral guiding performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering type vehicle. <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM. Simulated and an experimental data show {{the advantages of the}} proposed SSM...|$|R

5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|On any {{bike with}} only <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|R
50|$|A tadpole {{tricycle}} has {{two front}} <b>wheels</b> and one <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering is sometimes used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry {{is similar to}} a regular tricycle operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added).|$|R
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{steering}} {{tends to}} be unstable because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under steer). <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning vanes to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E

25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, as the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became smaller and smaller, {{with more of the}} rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> became less effective.
