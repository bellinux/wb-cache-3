40|$|Military commanders require {{situational}} awareness to support real-time decis ion-making. To obtain information on possibly hostile entities {{in an area}} of interest, surveillance systems, which receive information from sensors such as <b>radars,</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and other sources, are often used. One of the objectives of surveillance systems that track aircraft is the formation of a Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), that represents a coherent resolution of information. Correlation is the process by which sensor measurements and other information are combined to keep the SIAP up-to-date in real time. A correlator, which is the software implementation of a correlation methodology, must resolve ambiguities and conflicting information to provide an operationally useful synthesis of surveillance data. Possible ambiguities include missed tracks, extra tracks, or position and velocity errors. The metrics developed in this thesis are designed for use in evaluating the performance of air surveillance systems, of which correlators are an integral part. Maneuvering or closely spaced aircraft pose difficult issues for air surveillance systems. These are addressed by the performance metrics. Using scripted test scenarios in a modeling and simulation environment, comparisons of correlators can be made using nonparametric statistical methods. An experiment constructed in this manner can be used to support acquisition decision-making. US Army (USA) autho...|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, the OSI {{made the}} first {{significant}} attempt to measure {{the power of a}} <b>radar</b> for <b>intelligence</b> gathering, known as the Quality ELINT program.

50|$|The Pirinçlik {{sensor system}} {{consisted}} of two radio frequency (RF) mechanical radar systems providing <b>radar</b> <b>intelligence,</b> space surveillance, and missile warning data to multiple users. Observations from Diyarbakır were normally the first radar reports of new Russian satellite launches from Kapustin Yar {{in the early days}} of satellite tracking; see Project Space Track. The site operated both a detection radar (AN/FPS-17) and a mechanical tracking radar (AN/FPS-79). Although limited by their mechanical technology, Pirinçlik's two radars gave the advantage of tracking two objects simultaneously in real time. Its location close to the southern Soviet Union made it the only ground sensor capable of tracking actual deorbits of Soviet space hardware. In addition, the Pirinçlik radar was the only 24-hour-per-day eastern hemisphere deep-space sensor.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 June 2012, a Turkish F-4 {{fighter jet}} {{was shot down}} by Syrian {{government}} forces. Both pilots were killed. Syria stated that it had shot the fighter down using anti-aircraft artillery {{near the village of}} Om al-Tuyour, while it was flying over Syrian territorial waters one kilometre away from land. Turkey's foreign minister stated the jet was shot down in international airspace after accidentally entering Syrian airspace, while it was on a training flight to test Turkey's radar capabilities. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed retaliation, saying: [...] "The rules of engagement of the Turkish Armed Forces have changed ... Turkey will support Syrian people in every way until they get rid of the bloody dictator and his gang." [...] Ankara acknowledged that the jet had flown over Syria for a short time, but said such temporary overflights were common, had not led to an attack before, and alleged that Syrian helicopters had violated Turkish airspace five times without being attacked and that a second, search-and-rescue jet had been fired at. Assad later expressed regret over the incident. In August 2012, reports appeared in some Turkish newspapers claiming that the Turkish General Staff had deliberately misinformed the Turkish government about the fighter's location when it was shot down. The reports said that a NATO command post at Izmir and a British base in Cyprus had confirmed that the fighter was shot down inside Syrian waters and that <b>radar</b> <b>intelligence</b> from U.S. forces had disproved any [...] "accidentally entered Syrian waters" [...] flightpath error. The General Staff denied the claims.|$|E
40|$|Emitter {{identification}} {{has been}} widely recognized as one crucial issue for communication, electronic reconnaissance, and <b>radar</b> <b>intelligence</b> analysis. However, the measurements of emitter signal parameters typically {{take the form of}} uncertain intervals rather than precise values. In addition, the measurements are generally accumulated dynamically and continuously. As a result, one imminent task has become how to carry out discriminant analysis of interval-valued parameters incrementally for emitter identification. Existing machine learning approaches for interval-valued data analysis are unfit for this purpose as they generally assume a uniform distribution and are usually restricted to static data analysis. To address the above problems, we bring forward an incremental discriminant analysis method on interval-valued parameters (IDAIP) for emitter identification. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-life data sets have validated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of new {{technology}} in wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) and full-motion video (FMV), there is a capability to exploit the imagery {{in conjunction with other}} information sources for improving confidence in detection, tracking, and identification (DTI) of dismounts. Image exploitation, along with other <b>radar</b> and <b>intelligence</b> information can aid decision support and situation awareness. Many advantages and limitations exist in dismount tracking analysis using WAMI/FMV; however, through layered management of sensing resources, there are future capabilities to explore that would increase dismount DTI accuracy, confidence, and timeliness. A layered sensing approach enables commandlevel strategic, operational, and tactical analysis of dismounts to combine multiple sensors and databases, to validate DTI information, as well as to enhance reporting results. In this paper, we discuss WAMI/FMV, compile a list of issues and challenges of exploiting the data for WAMI, and provide examples from recently reported results. Our aim is to provide a discussion to ensure that nominated combatants are detected, the sensed information is validated across multiple perspectives, the reported confidence values achieve positive combatant versus non- combatant detection, and the related situational awareness attributes including behavior analysis, spatial-temporal relations, and cueing are provided in a timely and reliable manner to stakeholders...|$|R

A year later Shabana Khan (Taapsee Pannu) a college student who is also a Judo fighter is being followed by Indian agency as a potential recruit. One of Shabana's friends, Jai (Taher Shabbir Mithaiwala) who likes Shabana, and always tries to hit on her, asks her on a date a day before his birthday, she agrees to go with him on the date and there he confesses his love for her. During the date he asks her about her past, and Shabana tells him that she had been kept in a juvenile detention institution for killing her abusive father who used to physically assault her mother. During their bike ride home Shabana is a victim of eve teasing from a group of four drunk men in a Jeep, with the exchange turning into a physical altercation resulting in Jai getting killed and the assailants running away. Soon after, Shabana receives a call from an unknown number asking if she wants to avenge her lover's death. The unknown caller agrees to help her terminate the killer in exchange for Shabana joining a secret agency. Shabana agrees to this and accordingly receives information on the killer's whereabouts, and the agents aid her in killing them. Shabana then goes to Goa, to the same hotel where the main culprit who killed Jai was staying. As instructed, Shabana enters his room killing him and later escapes with the help of Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar). The unknown caller is then revealed to be Manoj Bajpayee.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} in collaboration with Signal Processing (SP) Devices Sweden AB. SP Devices provides digital signal processing solutions for the enhancement of analogue to digital conversion (ADC). Their ADCs facilitate the development of products for Communications, Radio base stations, <b>Radar,</b> Signals <b>intelligence</b> and Test & Measurement. The ADQ series digitizers, from SP Devices, are portable high performance digitizers which incorporate one or more analog inputs, an on-board double data rate (DDR 2) memory and USB or PXI Express interface. DDR 2 refers {{to the ability of}} a computer bus to transfer data on both the rising and falling edges of a clock signal. The ADCaptureLab software is a graphical user interface used to control this digitizer. ADCaptureLab, designed in the C/C++ programming language, is an easy-to-use standalone program which allows for configuration and operation of all ADQ series digitizers from SP Devices. The use of the LabView program from National Instruments forms the backbone of this thesis. LabVIEW (short for Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench) is a platform and development environment for a visual programming language from National Instruments. The topic of this thesis was to reproduce the ADCaptureLab user interface using LabView instead of C/C++. The graphical user interface (GUI) developed in LabView should be able to communicate with and control the processing of the ADQ 214 digitizer (the digitizer model provided to us) {{in the same way as}} the ADCaptureLab. This would involve not only the data capturing and visualization but also digitizer configurations, monitoring of the device and ADQ functions and the analyses of acquired signal and FFT. In order to implement the configuration settings we developed functions for trigger settings (conditions at which a trigger will occur), Analogue Front End settings (AC/DC coupling), clock settings (sets the clock source), data type settings (set sample format), gain and offset setting (sets amplitude gain and mean value), pre-trigger settings (size of pre-trigger buffer), trigger hold off settings (number of samples to wait for acquiring data after trigger), data acquisition length settings (Length of the acquired signal), continuous and single batch data acquisition, FFT transformation, save, load, and “clear plots” control (resets graph indicators). The functioning of our device may be monitored through the “Status window” (displays connection status of the ADQ device), “Devices window” (displays product information about the ADQ device), “Device monitor window” (returns the status of ADQ-API functions used) and the “Device information window” (returns information related to the revision of the ADQ device). Analyzing the acquired data and its corresponding FFT is made simple with the “Signal Properties” window (displays analyzed data), “Mark Harmonics” control (marks harmonics in the FFT) and the “Mark Signal Props” control (marks the fundamental tone and highest distortion in the FFT). Our LabVIEW GUI efficiently incorporates the features described above. In addition to being able to communicate instructions to the ADQ 214 device we are able to monitor its condition and analyze any output. This result serves to show that it is possible to develop a program such as ADCaptureLab in LabVIEW. HASSAN GILANI # : + 46736742637 RAISUL BHUIYAN # :+ 4676259697...|$|R
