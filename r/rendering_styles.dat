50|$|Artistic {{rendering}} is {{the application}} of visual art styles to rendering. For photorealistic <b>rendering</b> <b>styles,</b> {{the emphasis is on}} accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, composition, or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive <b>rendering</b> <b>styles,</b> visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen art medium and level of abstraction in abstract art. In computer graphics, interpretive <b>rendering</b> <b>styles</b> are known as non-photorealistic <b>rendering</b> <b>styles,</b> but may be used to simplify technical illustrations. <b>Rendering</b> <b>styles</b> that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as hyperrealistic <b>rendering</b> <b>styles.</b>|$|E

50|$|Keen Software House's {{technological}} know-how and proprietary VRAGE game engine {{has allowed}} the company to create games that leverage elements of science into the gameplay. The studio's first game, Miner Wars 2081, focused on an open world with destructible terrain, while the second game, Space Engineers, presents volumetric physics as gameplay in a space-based environment focused on engineering, construction, and maintenance of space ships and stations. The company's proprietary VRAGE game engine powers both the titles, and is currently in iteration 2.0. Additionally, they have created a separate team charged with development of Medieval Engineers - utilitizing similar <b>rendering</b> <b>styles,</b> while adding in weight and block based destruction / deformation with physics based calculations set in medieval times.

In this paper we present a visually compelling and informative cartoon <b>rendering</b> <b>style</b> for liquid animations. Our style is inspired by animations such as Futurama, 1 The Little Mermaid, 2 and Bambi 2. We take as input a liquid surface obtained from a three-dimensional physically based liquid simulation system and output animations that evoke a cartoon style and convey liquid movement. Our method is based on four cues that emphasize properties of the liquid’s shape and motion. We use bold outlines to emphasize depth discontinuities, patches of constant color to highlight near-silhouettes and areas of thinness, and, optionally place temporally coherent oriented textures on the liquid surface to help convey motion.

40|$|By {{integrating}} stylized rendering with {{an efficient}} multiresolution image representation, we enable {{the user to}} control how compression affects the aesthetic appearance of an image. Adopting a point-based rendering approach to progressive image transmission and compression, we represent an image by a sequence of color values. To best approximate the image at progressive levels of detail, a novel, adaptive farthest point sampling algorithm balances global coverage with local precision. Without storing any spatial information apart from the aspect ratio, the spatial position of each color value is inferred from the preceding members of the sampling sequence. Keeping track of the spatial influence of each sample on the rendition, a progressively generated discrete Voronoi diagram forms the common foundation for our sampling and rendering framework. This framework allows us to extend traditional photorealistic methods of image reconstruction by scattered data interpolation to encompass non-photorealistic rendering. It supports {{a wide variety of}} artistic <b>rendering</b> <b>styles</b> based on geometric subdivision or parametric procedural textures.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel volume illustration technique for regularly sampled volume datasets. The {{fundamental difference between}} previous volume illustration algorithms and ours is that our results are shape-aware, as they depend {{not only on the}} <b>rendering</b> <b>styles,</b> but also the shape styles. We propose a new data structure that is derived from the input volume and consists of a distance volume and a segmentation volume. The distance volume is used to reconstruct a continuous field around the object boundary, facilitating smooth illustrations of boundaries and silhouettes. The segmentation volume allows us to abstract or remove distracting details and noise, and apply different <b>rendering</b> <b>styles</b> to different objects and components. We also demonstrate how to modify the shape of illustrated objects using a new 2 D curve analogy technique. This provides an interactive method for learning shape variations from 2 D hand-painted illustrations by drawing several lines. Our experiments on several volume datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve visually appealing and shape-aware illustrations. The feedback from medical illustrators is quite encouraging.
