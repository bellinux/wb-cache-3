On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with {{high pressure water}} jets, damage to the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E

It had to be blasted through a granite spur of the Moelwyn mountain. The tunnel plant included stone crushing and grading equipment, which produced track ballast and other aggregates from the spoil for use on the railway. Before it opened to rail traffic, the new tunnel had to be lined throughout its length with liquid cement <b>reinforced</b> with <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> in a process called 'shotcreting'.|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the beams {{incorporating}} reinforced mortar forms had almost the same stiffness as the control beam upto its cracking load after which they were much stiffer than the control beam.

30|$|Taken together, {{the tests}} {{described}} in this report highlight {{a number of important}} construction details and potential construction errors which may appear inconsequential to a building contractor, but which may have a profound impact on the structural fire response and integrity of a building during fire. Examples of this include integrity of fire stopping during large deformations, lapping of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh,</b> anchorage of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> over shear studs on protected perimeter beams, use of deformed versus smooth bars for reinforcement (potentially leading to strain localization and tensile failure of deformed steel bars during fire), proper anchorage and grouting of hollowcore slabs, use of specific types of bolted steel connections to promote connection ductility and rotational capacity during fire, quality, uniformity, and robustness of structural fire protection materials (either passive or intumescent), and so on. Serious unknowns continue to surround many, if not all, of these issues, and {{there is a need for}} testing to support the development of best practice guidance which can be used to provide quality assurance programs on construction sites of so-called ‘fire engineered’ buildings.|$|R

30|$|The main {{conclusions}} {{from this study}} demonstrated that using cellular secondary beams to support a composite slab does not jeopardise the tensile membrane action that develops in such a slab in a fire situation. Maximum <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> temperatures in the slab were less than 375 °C, suggesting less than 5 % strength loss. As an aside, {{it is noteworthy that}} despite using various tools (e.g. the Ozone program (Cadorin et al. 2001) and the predicted parametric fire curve specified in BS EN 1991 - 1 - 2 (CEN 2002)) to predict anticipated compartment temperatures, the actual fire was more severe than predicted.|$|R

30|$|The beams {{reinforced}} with welded wire mesh achieved better cracking performance than those {{reinforced with}} X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> {{regardless of the}} number of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>steel</b> layers and the type of core material. From the results in Tables  2 and 3, the ratio of the first cracking load of the welded wire mesh beams to that of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> beams was 1.12, 1.33, 1.4, 1.2, 1.19 for (WSC/ESC), (WDC/EDC), (WSB/ESB), (WSS/ESS), and (WSR/ESR) respectively. The better performance of the beams reinforced with welded wire mesh could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of <b>steel</b> <b>meshes</b> which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> as explained in Eqs.

The tunnel Bôrik has been designed such that it complies withthe requirements set for a motorway tunnel with two tunnel tubes, each for one-way motorway traffic. The Project is part of D 1 Motorway in Slovak republic, connecting Bratislava - Žilina - Prešov – Košice. Tunnel Borik is part of Motorway D 1 Mengusovce-Janovce and is direct link to motorway section D 1 Važec – Mengusovce. The support classes describe the use of tunnel primary and secondary lining structural elements, on which depends the wholeWorks’ stability. The primary lining constructed includes circumferentially and radially projecting beams in which the reinforcing barsare embedded, whereby a lining having a reinforcing structure can be constructed in a simple and economical mannerand in a shortened construction period.

30|$|The test beams {{were divided}} into eleven groups and each group {{contained}} three identical specimens. Group number 1 is the control group in which the beams were cast using ordinary formwork. The beams in this group were reinforced with 2 ϕ 12  mm {{high tensile strength steel}} bars at the tension side and 2 ϕ 12  mm high tensile strength steel bars at the compression side as well as shear reinforcement (stirrups) of Ø 8  mm at 200  mm spacing. The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two high tensile strength steel bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only. Neither reinforcing bars at the compression side nor stirrups were used in these groups. Two types of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> were used to reinforce the U-shaped forms namely; welded wire mesh and X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> Single or double layers of the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> were used as shown in Table  1. In the design of the test specimen it was assured that the total percentage of <b>steel</b> reinforcement (<b>reinforcing</b> bars and <b>steel</b> <b>mesh)</b> did not exceed the maximum percentage allowed by the design code. This is an important issue that should be observed by the designers at the practical application stage. Shear connection between the reinforced mortar form and the core for groups 5 and 10 was provided by fixing bolts through the sides and bottom of the forms while {{for the rest of the}} groups bonding agent was applied on the inner surface of the forms before casting the core.|$|R

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Unreinforced Masonry (URM) structures have been proved by many big earthquakes in the past, {{due to their}} low seismic capacity. Most URM buildings are built {{with little or no}} consideration of seismic loading, and these are not capable of resisting the expected seismic ground motion, which caused damage and collapse of the buildings and have been the major cause of human and economic losses during the past earthquakes. There are many kinds of retrofitting materials and methods have been developed and used to strengthen the URM houses, such as Fiber <b>Reinforced</b> Polymers (FRP), <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> cage, surface treatment using Shotcrete, post-tensioning using rubber tires, etc. However, they are relatively expensive and not available {{in many parts of the}} world, which is of prime importance in the third world countries. Therefore, we propose to use a natural fiber called Abaca fiber, which is a locally available and inexpensive material with high tensile strength. In this paper, tensile test of Abaca fiber has been investigated. Based on the results obtained from the tests, it can be concluded that Abaca fibers have high potential for retrofitting material of URM houses in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{cracking}} {{control of}} plain concrete slabs on soil foundation requires {{the execution of}} joints with mechanisms of load transfer between adjacent panels. These joints increase the construction costs and, often, {{are the source of}} local damage and loss of service performance. Slabs <b>reinforced</b> with <b>steel</b> wire <b>mesh</b> have been used in order to increase the load carrying capacity and to enhance the cracking control. However, the use of this conventional reinforcement increases the costs, mainly due to labor time spent on the arrangement and positioning of the reinforcement. Fiber reinforced concrete is a recent material well fitted for applications in industrial floors on soil foundation. The cost of fibers is compensated by a faster construction process and a {{reduction in the number of}} expansion joints. The fatigue, impact and flexural strength are significantly improved when steel fibers are added to the concrete mix. The work developed aims to contribute to the on going research effort to clarify the behavior of fiber reinforced concrete slabs on soil foundation. For this purpose, an experimental and numerical investigation were carried out. The present article deals basically with the experimental work developed, describing the tests performed and discussing the main results obtained.
