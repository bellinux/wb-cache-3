At lower speeds an aircraft may have a worse glide ratio {{but it will also}} have a lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink.</b> A low airspeed also improves its ability to turn tightly in centre of the rising air where the rate of ascent is greatest. A sink rate of approximately 1.0 m/s is the most that a practical hang glider or paraglider could have before it would limit the occasions that a climb was possible to only when there was strongly rising air. Gliders (sailplanes) have minimum sink rates of between 0.4 and 0.6 m/s depending on the class. Aircraft such as airliners may have a better glide ratio than a hang glider, but would rarely be able to thermal because of their much higher forward speed and their much higher sink rate. (Note that the Boeing 767 in the Gimli Glider incident achieved a glide ratio of only 12:1.) ...|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{versions}} of the MacCready Ring are built into glide computers that will give audible warnings to the pilot to speed up or slow down. Similar facilities can also be built into a PDA. The computer is connected to sensors that detect the aircraft's airspeed and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink.</b> If linked to a GPS, and using a computed or manual estimate of the windspeed, the glide computer can also calculate the speed and altitude necessary to glide to a particular destination. This glide {{is known as the}} final glide because no further lift should be necessary to reach the goal. During this glide, speed to fly information is needed to ensure that the remaining height is used efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Pilots {{sometimes}} fly at the aircraft's best L/D by precisely controlling airspeed and smoothly {{operating the}} controls to reduce drag. However {{the strength of}} the likely next lift, minimising the time spent in strongly sinking air and {{the strength of the}} wind also affects the optimal speed to fly. Pilots fly faster to get quickly through sinking air, and when heading into wind to optimise the glide angle relative to the ground. To achieve higher speed across country, gliders (sailplanes) are often loaded with water ballast to increase the airspeed and so reach the next area of lift sooner. This has little effect on the glide angle since the increases in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink</b> and in the airspeed remain in proportion and thus the heavier aircraft achieves optimal L/D at a higher airspeed. If the areas of lift are strong on the day, the benefits of ballast outweigh the slower rate of climb.|$|E
50|$|Some gliders {{not only}} use flaps when landing, {{but also in}} flight to {{optimize}} the camber of the wing for the chosen speed. When thermalling, flaps may be partially extended to reduce the stalling speed so that the glider can be flown more slowly and thereby reduce the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink,</b> which lets the glider use the rising air of the thermal more efficiently, and to turn in a smaller circle to make best use of {{the core of the}} thermal. At higher speeds a negative flap setting is used to reduce the nose-down pitching moment. This reduces the balancing load required on the horizontal stabilizer, which in turn reduces the trim drag associated with keeping the glider in longitudinal trim. Negative flap may also be used during the initial stage of an aerotow launch {{and at the end of}} the landing run in order to maintain better control by the ailerons.|$|E

40|$|Variable {{influence}} of ice melting on water column stabilization causes a large variation in {{timing of the}} spring phytoplankton bloom in the central Barents Sea. During two cruises in April 1986 and May-June 1987 situations were encountered that ranged from early bloom stage in Atlantic water not influenced by ice to late bloom stage in meltwater regions. In the present paper we examine the reproduction of Ca/anus finmarchirns (Gunnerus) {{against the background of}} this large natural variation in the temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton food, with emphasis on the vertical distribution of spawning females, eggs, and nauplii. The vertical distribution of the females indicated a shift from shallow spawning at the early bloom stations to deeper spawning in the pycnocline region at the late bloom stations. The females were generally concentrated in the layers with high concentrations of phytoplankton. The vertical distribution of eggs at the bloom and late bloom stations showed the same pattern as chlorophyll, either uniformly distributed in the upper mixed layer or concentrated as a sharp maximum in the region of the pycnocline and the deep chlorophyll maximum. The distribution of nauplii corresponded closely to the distribution of the eggs at these stations, suggesting little or no <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the eggs and hatching of the nauplii at depths with a rich food supply. The eggs at the ea rly bloom stations had a deeper distribution, although spawning apparently took place in the shallow part of the water column. This suggests a high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> the eggs. Nauplii hatching from them probably encountered low food concentrations at great depths. The success of early spawning is probably limited through this. The indicated high sinking rate at the ea rly bloom stations in contrast to the low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> at the bloom and late bloom stations could reflect a difference in egg density owing to different feeding conditions. Increased water viscosity caused by mucus from phytoplankton could also have contributed to the lower sinking rate at high phytoplankton concentrations.

The results showed that with a forward velocity of 120 knots, pilots could reliably distinguish between a sink rate of 0. 5 m/sec (1. 7 ft/sec) and 0. 9 m/sec (2. 9 ft/sec). The results also showed that the absolute <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink</b> did not significantly affect the perception of sink rate.

A one-box model of methane was employed to determine what the lifetime of methane would need to be each year if emissions were held constant. The primary loss mechanism for methane is the same for carbon monoxide: reactions with hydroxyl radicals. If there was a change in the sink for methane, it’s very likely that this would be due to a change in the concentration of hydroxyl. It was shown that the corresponding change in carbon monoxide concentrations would be insignificant compared to the variability of the observations.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the rate in which sink node isolation occur in order to improve the scalability of wireless sensor networks. It can be noted that while most previous works investigate scalability in terms of total energy consumption or the rate of node’s death in the WSN. In this work, we consider the scalability in terms of the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink</b> node isolation with respect to the WSN deployment size. The aim of power-aware routing algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to solve the key issue of prolonging the lifetime of resource-constrained ad-hoc sensor nodes. Contemporary WSN routing algorithm designs have severe limitations on their scalability; that is, large-scale deployments of WSNs result in relatively shorter lifetimes, as compared to small-scale deployments, primarily owing to rapid sink node isolation caused by the quick battery exhaustion of nodes that are close to the sink. This paper analyzes the scalability limitations of conventional routing algorithms and compares them to the recently proposed Improved MultI-layer routiNg (IMIN). IMIN will be mathematically analyzed to show the relationship between network size and routing algorithm scalability. Additionally, through extensive simulations, it will be deduced that IMIN scales considerably better in terms of network connectivity...|$|E
30|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that the progressive Cenozoic cooling of the global climate resulted from a long-term decrease in atmospheric CO 2, details on how carbon cycle affects CO 2 and a clearer distinction of the involved time scales have not been fully resolved. Because of the relatively small size of the atmospheric reservoir, minimal imbalances between CO 2 sources and sinks cause rapid fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 levels and global mean temperatures (Brady and Gislason 1997; Kent and Muttoni 2013). The {{results of the present}} study suggest ~[*] 76 % of the Plio-Pleistocene climate variance could be driven by non-orbital carbon cycle. On time scales longer than one million years, atmospheric CO 2 levels are primarily controlled by the balance between the rate of volcanic and metamorphic sources from the Earth’s interior and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sink</b> through the chemical weathering of silicate minerals and through the burial of organic carbon (Walker and Hays 1981; Berner et al. 1983; Raymo and Ruddiman 1992; Brady and Gislason 1997; Schrag et al. 2002; Hansen and Sato 2012). Plate tectonics may affect the primary inputs of atmospheric CO 2 through mantle outgassing at seafloor spreading ridges, volcanoes, and the metamorphism of carbonate rocks along subduction zones (Van Der Meer et al. 2014). Long-term sinks for CO 2 are controlled by the burial of organic matter and by the weathering of silicate rocks to form carbonates (Raymo and Ruddiman 1992; Berner and Kothavala 2001; Schrag et al. 2002; Van Der Meer et al. 2014). The weathering of silicate rocks is a chemical process whereby CO 2 consumption is buffered by the temperature dependence on the weathering rate, preventing the so-called “ice catastrophe” when temperatures fall (Walker and Hays 1981). As the atmospheric CO 2 concentration rises, the temperature and precipitation increase. They thereby enhance chemical weathering and atmospheric CO 2 depletion, preventing “greenhouse” disasters on geological timescales. Chemical weathering is also affected by changes in continental land area and paleoaltitude distribution (Berner et al. 1983; Schrag et al. 2002). The alteration of surficial marine basalts at low temperatures (<[*] 40  °C) is another potentially important sink for atmospheric CO 2 over geologic time (Brady and Gislason 1997). The numerical modeling of the carbon cycle by Berner et al. (1983) suggests that changes in volcanic outgassing over the last 100 million years were the primary cause of the transition between the greenhouse climates of the Cretaceous and the ice ages of the Plio-Pleistocene. Their results indicate that the CO 2 content in the atmosphere is highly sensitive to changes in the seafloor spreading rate and continental land area. A tropical concentration of continental area may lead to a more efficient burial of organic carbon through increased tropical river discharge and the chemical weathering of silicate rocks (Schrag et al. 2002). By affecting CO 2 volcanic degassing, metamorphic-magmatic decarbonation and changes in the continental land area available for chemical weathering, plate tectonics is considered the main long-term controlling factor of the global climate (Berner et al. 1983; Van Der Meer et al. 2014). However, it is a matter of debate as to which main mechanism can adjust the balance between the CO 2 source through geotectonic volcanic degassing and the CO 2 sink by the chemical weathering of silicate rocks. Some studies show conflicting results regarding the role of the seafloor spreading rate, which is believed to be the major control of CO 2 degassing (Berner et al. 1983; Raymo and Ruddiman 1992). In fact, according to Rowley (2002), the seafloor spreading rate remained relatively constant over the past 180  Myr, while Cogné and Humler (2006) indicate a general increasing trend in the last 50  Myr. These results are discordant with the observed cooling trend of the Cenozoic climate. Recently, a study of carbon-cycle evolution indicated that increasing physical erosion in response to widespread mountain building is the most prominent driver of carbon cycling over the past 100  Myr (Li and Elderfield 2013). Raymo and Ruddiman (1992) proposed that the uplift of the Tibetan plateau was an important driving force behind the Cenozoic long-term cooling by atmospheric CO 2 consumption due to the increase of the chemical weathering of silicate rocks. However, the Cenozoic long-term shift in Earth’s climatic state could be really related to regional transient differences in volcanic emissions by plate tectonic activity, which were particularly high during, e.g., the Late Paleocene and Early Eocene epochs (North Atlantic rifting and India-Asian northward migration) (Raymo and Ruddiman 1992; Zachos et al. 2001; Mosar et al. 2002; Zachos et al. 2008; Le Breton et al. 2012). From this viewpoint, a recent study on the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic system shows a multiple collision model in which a continent-continent collision began around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (34  Myr) (Aitchison et al. 2007), promoting the Early Oligocene glaciation (Zachos et al. 2001). Corroborating this hypothesis, the North Atlantic seafloor spreading rate (NASSR) exhibits a clear decreasing trend from high values in the Early Eocene (55 – 50 Myr) to a very low rate for most of the Oligocene (Mosar et al. 2002; Le Breton et al. 2012). On the other hand, recent studies seem to converge towards a significant 250 – 200 -Myr period variation of the seafloor spreading rate (Becker et al. 2009; Coltice et al. 2013). Becker et al. (2009) proposed a spreading rate long-term slowdown since 140  Myr with minor cycles superimposed over time, such as a relative increase at ~[*] 50  Myr and a minimum at ~[*] 32  Myr. Even the timing of the global average spreading rate (GASR) calculated by Conrad and Lithgow-Bertelloni (2007) appears to support the hypothesis of a direct geotectonic “forcing” to the long-term composition of atmospheric GHGs. On a more detailed timescale, a study in the North Atlantic shows the consistency of the NASSR relative maximum at ~[*] 15  Myr and the MMCO (Merkouriev and DeMets 2014). The correlation of the NASSR minimum at approximately 1.2 – 1.0  Myr (the lowest value in the last 20  Myr) and the CO 2 proxy minimum at 0.9 – 0.7  Myr (Fig.  14 a), which correlate to the strong LT-LR 04 cooling at the end of subtrend-IV, seems plausible. Indeed, the contribution of the important negative forcing created by aerosols (Hansen et al. 2005) emitted into the atmosphere during phases of explosive volcanic paroxysm in the circum-Pacific (Jicha et al. 2009) must also be taken in account. In fact, hundreds of explosive eruptions occurred during an extremely vigorous period of circum-Pacific volcanism beginning in the Late Eocene, which likely led to the production of sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere and net cooling. The feedback mechanism related to the enormous supply of ash that fertilized the Pacific Ocean waters might have caused algal growth and CO 2 uptake and thereby contributed to Oligocene glaciation at approximately 34  Myr (Jicha et al. 2009). It is interesting to observe how the Plio-Pleistocene in the circum-Pacific was a period of intense explosive volcanic activity characterized by three activity peaks at approximately 4.8, 2.8, and 1.5  Myr (Jicha et al. 2009). We cannot exclude that these events contributed in part to the three most pronounced segments of δ 18 O enrichment highlighted in the LT-LR 04 record (subtrend-I, subtrend-II, and subtrend-IV), culminating in the ONHG, INHG, and MIS- 16 events, respectively. Moreover, the Late Pleistocene was a period of quiescence of the circum-Pacific explosive activity, which may have contributed to the mid-term CO 2 increment and δ 18 O impoverishment that occurred at approximately 400 – 300  kyr, a possible cause of the MBO. A further contribution to the global emission of CH 4 and CO 2 may also come from the thermogenic cracking of organic carbon-rich sediments in large igneous provinces (LIPs), which are associated with geotectonic spreading areas or subduction zones (Svensen et al. 2004). Finally, another climate-controlling factor is oceanic paleocirculation. The “Panama Hypothesis” states that the gradual closure of the Panama seaway, between 13 and 2.6  Myr led to a decreased mixing of the Atlantic and Pacific water masses and a strengthening of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, increased temperatures and precipitation in Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, and culminated with the INHG during the Pliocene, at approximately 3.2 – 2.7  Myr (Bartoli et al. 2005; Lunt et al. 2008). However, Lunt et al. (2008), using a more sophisticated general circulation model (GCM), demonstrated that the ice volume difference between the “closed” and “open” seaway model configurations is small and concluded that it was not a major forcing mechanism. This view accommodates δ 18 O and SST components- 8 - 11 of inter-tropical semi-precessional origin related to the oceanic heat transport towards high latitudes (Hagelberg et al. 1994; Berger et al. 2006), which contributes very little to the total variance of the paleoclimatic response (~[*] 0.6 – 0.5 %). In summary, the geotectonic forcing appears a plausible hypothesis to explain the long-term changes in atmosphere composition (GHGs and volcanic aerosols) through direct (CO 2 outgassing and explosive volcanism) and indirect (orography and erosion, paleogeographic configuration, oceanic paleocirculation, and ocean fertilization) control by plate tectonics.|$|E

Phytoplankton chlorophyll α levels {{in the water column}} under the ice were low until December but increased in January (> 2 mg・m^). Changes in sedimentation <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> particles showed that large ice algal aggregates which were the major component during the ice algal bloom detached from the undersurface of the ice and sank down to the sea floor. On the contrary, during the phytoplankton bloom, solitary diatoms, chain-forming diatoms and small algal aggregates constituted a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>sinking</b> particles. Sedimentation fluxes of fecal pellets of herbivorous zooplankton including diatoms decreased during the ice algal bloom. The microalgae have a high probability of reaching the bottom during the summer growing season and become and important food for benthic organisms...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: This study {{presents}} an evaluation between IAQX 1. 0 f and Fluent 6. 3. 26 in modeling of NOx dispersion in an indoor residential environment. Modeling predictions are compared with sampling results. Materials and Methods: Aresidential building with about 84 m 2 area is modeled. In IAQX 1. 0 f {{the building is}} divided into five zones. Emission factors and absorption <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>sinks</b> is estimated with US. EPA suggested factors. On the other hand, In the Fluent 6. 3. 26 model, the building was divided into 1777 cells, and the openings are defined by the boundary conditions of the inflow. In this model, pollution sources were simulated by boundary conditions of the mass inflow. Results:Compared to IAQX 1. 0 f, Fluent 6. 3. 26 showed higher estimation of the concentrations in the zones of 1, 2 and 3. In comparison with the measurements, both models had underestimated results. Conclusion: The results of Fluent 6. 3. 26 were closer to the sampling results in the zones...|$|R
3000|$|The {{number of}} network coder nodes is an {{important}} parameter in the asynchronous duty cycle with network-coding MAC (ADCNC-MAC) protocol; it will reduce the decoding <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Sink</b> {{if the number of}} network coder nodes is too big. To ensure proper decoding of the network-coded packets at the Sink, not more than 50  % of network coder nodes in the network-coding layer are needed [19]. Algorithm 1 represents the core operations of the selection of network coder nodes. C [...]...|$|R
