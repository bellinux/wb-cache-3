50|$|The {{method of}} {{surveying}} a field or other {{parcel of land}} with Gunter's chain is to first determine corners and other significant locations, and then to measure the distance between them, taking two points at a time. The surveyor is assisted by a chainman. A <b>ranging</b> <b>rod</b> (usually a prominently coloured wooden pole) {{is placed in the}} ground at the destination point. Starting at the originating point the chain is laid out towards the <b>ranging</b> <b>rod,</b> and the surveyor then directs the chainman to make the chain perfectly straight and pointing directly at the <b>ranging</b> <b>rod.</b> A pin is put in the ground at the forward end of the chain, and the chain is moved forward so that its hind end is at that point, and the chain is extended again towards the destination point. This process is called ranging, or in the US, chaining; it is repeated until the destination rod is reached, when the surveyor notes how many full lengths (chains) have been laid, and he can then directly read how many links (one-hundredth parts of the chain) are in the distance being measured.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>ranging</b> <b>rod</b> is a {{surveying}} instrument used for marking {{the position of}} stations and for sightings of those stations {{as well as for}} ranging straight lines. Initially these were made of light, thin and straight bamboo or of well seasoned wood such as teak, pine or deodar. They were shod with iron at the bottom and surmounted with a flag about 25 cm square in size. [...] Nowadays they are made of metallic materials only. The rods are usually 3 cm in diameter and 2 m or 3 m long, painted alternatively either red and white or black and white in lengths of 20 cm (i.e. one link length of metric chain). These colours are used so that the rod can be properly sited in case of long distance or bad weather. Ranging rods of greater length, i.e., 4 m to 6 m, are called ranging poles and are used in case of very long survey lines. Another type of <b>ranging</b> <b>rod</b> is known as an offset rod, which has no flag at the top. It is used for measuring small offsets from the survey line when the work is of an ordinary nature.|$|E

40|$|Rod and cone photoreceptors support vision across large light {{intensity}} <b>ranges.</b> <b>Rods,</b> active under dim illumination, {{are thought to}} saturate at higher (photopic) irradiances. The extent of rod saturation is not well defined; some studies report rod activity well into the photopic range. Using electrophysiological recordings from retina and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of cone-deficient and visually intact mice, we describe stimulus and physiological factors that influence photopic rod-driven responses. We find that rod contrast sensitivity is initially strongly reduced at high irradiances, but progressively recovers to allow responses to moderate contrast stimuli. Surprisingly, rods recover faster at higher light levels. A model of rod phototransduction suggests that phototransduction gain adjustments and bleaching adaptation underlie rod recovery. Consistently, exogenous chromophore reduces rod responses at bright background. Thus, bleaching adaptation renders mouse rods responsive to modest contrast at any irradiance. Paradoxically, raising irradiance across the photopic range increases the robustness of rod responses...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRod photoreceptors {{contribute}} to vision over an ∼ 6 -log-unit range of light intensities. The wide dynamic <b>range</b> of <b>rod</b> vision {{is thought to}} depend upon light intensity-dependent switching between two parallel pathways linking rods to ganglion cells: a rod→rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway that operates at dim backgrounds and a rod→cone→cone bipolar cell pathway that operates at brighter backgrounds. We evaluated this conventional model of rod vision by recording rod-mediated light responses from ganglion and AII amacrine cells and by recording RB-mediated synaptic currents from AII amacrine cells in mouse retina. Contrary to the conventional model, {{we found that the}} RB pathway functioned at backgrounds sufficient to activate the rod→cone pathway. As background light intensity increased, the RB’s role changed from encoding the absorption of single photons to encoding contrast modulations around mean luminance. This transition is explained by the intrinsic dynamics of transmission from RB synapses...|$|R

40|$|Dense {{suspensions}} of self-propelled rod-like particles {{exhibit a}} fascinating variety of non-equilibrium phenomena. By means of computer simulations of a minimal model for rigid self-propelled colloidal rods with variable shape we explore the generic diagram of emerging states {{over a large}} <b>range</b> of <b>rod</b> densities and aspect ratios. The dynamics is studied using a simple numerical scheme for the overdamped noiseless frictional dynamics of a many-body system in which steric forces are dominant over hydrodynamic ones. The different emergent states are identified by various characteristic correlation functions and suitable order parameter fields. At low density and aspect ratio, a disordered phase with no coherent motion precedes a highly-cooperative swarming state at large aspect ratio. Conversely, at high densities weakly anisometric particles show a distinct jamming transition whereas slender particles form dynamic laning patterns. In between {{there is a large}} window corresponding to strongly vortical, turbulent flow. The different dynamical states should be verifiable in systems of swimming bacteria and artificial rod-like micro-swimmers. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

Among them is visual arrestin responsible for quenching photoactivated rhodopsin, which moves into photoreceptor outer segments during illumi-nation. Here, {{for the first}} time, we determined the light dependency of arrestin translocation, which revealed two key features of this phenomenon. First, arrestin translocation is triggeredwhen the light intensity approaches a critical threshold corresponding to theupper limits of the normal <b>range</b> of <b>rod</b> responsiveness. Second, the amount of arrestin entering rod outer segments under these conditions is superstoichiometric {{to the amount of}} photoactivated rhodopsin, exceeding it by at least 30 -fold.

Finally, we demonstrated that the total amount of arrestin in the rod cell is nearly 10 -fold higher than previously thought and therefore sufficient to inactivate the entire pool of rhodopsin at any level of illumination. Thus, arrestinmovement to the outer segment leads to an increase in the free arrestin concentration and thereby may serve as a powerful mechanism of light adaptation.
