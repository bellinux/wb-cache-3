The ballistic data of the Model 1941 mortar were analogous to the Model 1937.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{effective}} single intraoral, minimally invasive technique to reduce the enlarged tongue base in children with obstructive macroglossia. Methods: We present the anatomic dissection of fresh cadavers and a representative case series of children who under-went submucosal minimally invasive lingual excision (SMILE) with a plasma-mediated radiofrequency device (cobla-tion) under intraoral ultrasonic and endoscopic guidance. Multiple anatomic dissections determined the relative location of the hypoglossal nerve and lingual neurovascular bundle in relation to <b>removable</b> tongue <b>base</b> musculature. A pediatric case series demonstrates the straightforward SMILE technique. Results: Laboratory anatomic dissection and clinical lingual ultrasonography revealed the surgical safety borders for SMILE. The surgical safety and efficacy of SMILE is demonstrated by preoperative and postoperative clinical exami-nations and polysomnograms in children with obstructive macroglossia (such as Beckwith-Wiedemann and Down syn-dromes and tongue vascular malformation). Coblation submucosally removes excessive tongue base tissue through a small anterior tongue incision. SMILE was performed without excessive pain, bleeding, edema, infection, or tongue dysfunction. Conclusions: SMILE is an effective novel operation that incorporates coblation with ultrasonography and endoscopic guidance for children who need tongue base reduction. Anatomic dissection and clinical cases demonstrate the potential for aggressive yet relatively safe tissue removal by this minimally invasive technique. SMILE also has significant poten-tial for adults with obstructive sleep apnea due to a large tongue base.

40|$|Introduction: In {{the era of}} implant {{supported}} restorations, conventional {{complete denture}} (CD) for isolated edentulous maxilla still remains {{the first choice of}} treatment despite being its frequent mechanical failures. Statement of Problem: Edentulous maxillary arch restored with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) based CDs when opposed by natural and/or restored dentition is biomechanically and functionally a compromised rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: Seven patients (4 males, 3 females) in the age range of 55 – 75 years were treated for their frequent fracture of the single maxillary denture. They were asked to rate their prosthodontic experience on a scale of 1 – 10. They were further inquired about the awareness of their clinical condition and knowledge on the alternative treatment options available to them, number of different dentists they have been treated by and frequency of their re-visits to the dental office after being edentulous. Results: <b>Removable</b> PMMA <b>based</b> CD in maxilla was the first choice of treatment for all the restorative dentists who treated these patients. No attempt was ever made to treat the opposing dentition in any of the seven patients. Despite being under regular prosthodontic care for fabrication and repairs by as many as 23 dentists, none of the patients was aware of their clinical situation and the alternative treatment options available. Conclusion: It is imperative that the restorative dentist be aware of the perils of such inter-arch relationships. Appropriate treatment done on time may avert a situation where the oral conditions become incompatible for the longevity of treatment done even with the aid of dental implants...|$|R
40|$|This work {{confirms}} a multifactorial {{effect on}} stone formation {{processes in the}} oral cavity of persons who use removable dentures, including an important role of macro- and micronutrients, namely, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and zinc. The study of these elements was conducted in oral fluid and dental deposits and <b>removable</b> denture <b>bases.</b> Correlations between the level of oral hygiene and contents of chemical elements in oral fluid of people with removable dentures were found. With the increase in Ca / Mg, Ca / P, Ca / P / Mg ratios, the risk of stone formation was still observed in patients with “good” and “satisfactory” integral index of oral hygiene. The tendency {{to the formation of}} dental deposits is caused by the redistribution of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and their correlations, as well as zinc ions content in the different environments of the oral cavity in people with removable dentures. On the basis of correlation connection between the concentration of magnesium and zinc ions in oral fluid in people who use removable dentures constructions, and values of integral index of oral hygiene (r = 0. 53, r = 0. 72), we can claim the existence of inhibition mechanisms in stone formation processes in the mouth. With the simultaneous correlation of Ca / Mg ≥ 11, Ca / P ≥ 0. 5 and Ca / P / Mg ≥ 11 / 19 / 1 in oral fluid in people who use removable dentures constructions, a high probability of deposits formation both on the teeth in the mouth and on the <b>bases</b> of <b>removable</b> dentures exists...|$|R

The analysis result reveals that the force on the fulcrum point is bigger than the mastication force on the free end saddle, or the force on the fulcrum point is equal to the sum of the force of the saddle and the force on the retention point. The force on the fulcrum point may cause trauma to the periodontal tissue of the abutment tooth.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for removing time-frequency components, found by a standard Gabor transform, of a “real-world” sound while causing no audible {{difference to the}} original sound after resynthesis. Thus this representation is made sparser. The selection of <b>removable</b> components is <b>based</b> on a simple model of simultaneous masking in the auditory system. Important goals were the applicability to any realworld music and speech sound, integrating mutual masking effects between time-frequency components, coping with the time-frequency spread of such an operation, and computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm first determines an estimation of the masked threshold within an analysis window. The masked threshold function is then shifted in level by an amount determined experimentally, and all components falling below this function (the irrelevance threshold) are removed. This shift gives a conservative {{way to deal with}} uncertainty effects resulting from removing time-frequency components and with inaccuracies in the masking model. The removal of components is described as an adaptive Gabor multiplier. Thirty-six normal hearing subjects participated in an experiment to determine the maximum shift value for which they could not discriminate the irrelevance filtered signal from the original signal. On average across the test stimuli, 36 percent of the time-frequency components fell below the irrelevance threshold...|$|R
