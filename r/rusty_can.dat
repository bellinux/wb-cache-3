50|$|Virginia 'Rusty' Dickinson Evacuated from Britain at age 7 as a timid and shy child, 12-year-old Rusty {{returns as}} a {{confident}} and very American teenager. During her evacuation {{she stayed in}} Connecticut with the lively Omsk family, who encouraged her talents and belief in herself, drawing {{her out of her}} shell. Rusty loves bright colours, arts and music- she has especially talent at woodwork and stencil crafts which she was taught by 'Aunt' Hannah Omsk. Initially unhappy on her return to England, Rusty finds friends in Beth & Beattie Langley and refuses to alter her character in order to fit in with the hidebound English girls. <b>Rusty</b> <b>can</b> be considered brave, outspoken, creative and passionate.|$|E
50|$|The trains all {{gather to}} argue whether Rusty {{should be allowed}} to take Poppa's place in the final (The Rap). It is {{eventually}} decided that <b>Rusty</b> <b>can</b> race instead of runner-up Bobo. Greaseball, having dumped Dinah, invites Pearl to switch sides and race with him, to which Pearl agrees. Dinah worries that she will be the subject of ridicule due to her newly single state, yet vows that she will never forgive Greaseball (U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D.). Belle, Buffy and Ashley persuade her to cheer up and try to get her man back by being more active, aggressive and manipulative. (Rolling Stock (Reprise)). Shortly thereafter Electra invites Dinah to race with him, and she accepts, hoping to make Greaseball jealous. C.B., who has agreed to race with Rusty in the final, meets Electra and admits to causing all the major train crashes in recent history (C.B.). He agrees to fix the race so that Electra wins.|$|E
5000|$|Rusty Cartwright (Jacob Zachar) is a {{freshman}} at Cyprus-Rhodes University and {{in an effort to}} shed his nerdy image, goes through Greek recruitment to join a fraternity. His older sister Casey (Spencer Grammer) is {{an active member of the}} Zeta Beta Zeta sorority (the top sorority on campus), and is dating Omega Chi Delta (the top fraternity on campus) active Evan Chambers (Jake McDorman), who is wealthy and popular because of his father's company, Chambers International. Evan is the Pledge Educator of Omega Chi and offers Rusty a bid during rush. But Rusty declines after he spots Evan cheating on Casey with the Senator's daughter (and Zeta Beta Zeta pledge), Rebecca Logan (Dilshad Vadsaria). Rusty later accepts a bid from Kappa Tau Gamma by the fun and laid-back Cappie (Scott Michael Foster), Casey's ex-boyfriend and Evan's enemy. Additionally, Rusty's religious Baptist roommate, Dale (Clark Duke), is concerned by Rusty's involvement with the Greeks, but later accepts Rusty's new lifestyle, even befriending Rusty's gay friend Calvin (Paul James), an Omega Chi legacy and pledge. After Casey finds out about Evan and Rebecca, Frannie (Tiffany Dupont), ZBZ President and Casey's [...] "big sister", convinces Casey to stay with Evan. Casey sleeps with her ex, Cappie, to get revenge on Evan, but it was just a [...] "one time thing". Rusty and Jen K. (Jessica Rose), a ZBZ pledge, begin dating after they help the Kappa Taus save Vesuvius. Despite all the cheating and tension, Evan lavalieres Casey (gives her his Greek letters). Ashleigh (Amber Stevens), Casey's best friend and fellow ZBZ member, ends her long-distance relationship with boyfriend, Travis, and she attempts to move on to Calvin, who she finds out is gay. He gets accidentally outed by Ashleigh to all of Omega Chi, but Evan encourages him to stay in the fraternity. During the season, Calvin and Heath, a Kappa Tau, have an on-and-off relationship. When Frannie finds out she won't be graduating, she runs for Omega Chi sweetheart again, against Casey. Meanwhile, Cappie and Rebecca begin a flirtatious relationship after doing a psychology experiment together. A large scandal for the Greeks erupts after Jen K. writes a newspaper article based on the scandals and controversies of the Greeks and gets them in trouble with Dean Bowman, forcing the university to lay down strict rules and monitoring on the Greeks. Since Jen K. was a ZBZ pledge, the article centers on the Zeta Beta Zeta sorority and ZBZ National Board interferes and forces Frannie to step down as President and has Casey take her place as interim President. In retaliation, Frannie then tells Evan that the only reason Casey decided to stay with him after he cheated was because of his reputation. As a result, Evan and Casey break up. Rusty and Jen K. also break up because <b>Rusty</b> <b>can</b> no longer trust her.|$|E

5000|$|Behind Mr. Sneelock's {{ramshackle}} store, there's {{an empty}} lot. Little Morris McGurk {{is convinced that}} if he could just clear out the <b>rusty</b> <b>cans,</b> the dead tree, and the old cars, nothing would prevent him from using the lot for the amazing, world-beating, Circus McGurkus. The more elaborate Morris' dreams about the circus become, the more they depend on the sleepy-looking and innocent Sneelock, who stands outside his ramshackle store sucking on a pipe, oblivious to the fate that awaits him in the depths of Morris's imagination. He doesn't yet know that he'll have to dispense 500 gallons of lemonade, be lassoed by a Wily Walloo, wrestle a Grizzly-Ghastly, and ski down a slope dotted with giant cacti.

5000|$|The Miss Belvedere {{was lifted}} from the vault and transported to the Tulsa Convention Center where it was {{publicly}} unveiled on June 15, 2007. Vehicle customizer Boyd Coddington and his team were on hand and had volunteered to start the car; however that proved impossible due to the car's condition. While items buried with the vehicle in their own protective vault emerged unscathed, anything buried unprotected in the vehicle was heavily damaged or had deteriorated completely. Among the items recovered from the trunk were <b>rusty</b> <b>cans</b> from a case of Schlitz beer and the five gallon container of gasoline which was at one time full and {{was intended to be}} used to start the car in 2007 if gasoline was no longer the fuel of choice for motor vehicles.

Roper's meadows, being no longer in fear of floods, were now to be slashed out into parallelograms of untidy road, and built upon with rows of working-class cottages. The roads came,--horribly; the houses followed. They seemed to rise in the night. People moved into them as soon as the roofs were on, mostly workmen and their young wives, and already in a year some of these raw houses stood empty again from defaulting tenants, with windows broken and wood-work warping and rotting.

The sale was held outside, and when George arrived upon the scene during the afternoon a row of light wagons and buggies stood behind the rickety shack, near which was an unsightly pile of broken crockery, discarded clothes and <b>rusty</b> provision <b>cans.</b> It was characteristic of Langside that he had not taken the trouble to carry them as far as the neighboring bluff. In front of the bluff, horses were picketed; along the side ran a strip of black soil, sprinkled with the fresh blades of wheat; and all round the rest of the wide circle the prairie stretched away under cloudless sunshine, flecked with brightest green.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} {{vertebrates}} {{that live in}} communities together utilize a dominance hierarchy to establish order, and {{studies have shown that}} some species of invertebrates do the same thing. It is now known that the dominance hierarchy is an important aspect of a crayfish’s biology and behavior. Crayfish in general tend to form dominance hierarchies with the other members of their population in a particular environment. The largest male will generally demonstrate the most dominance over the others by being the most aggressive, and picking fights with the other, smaller crayfish. The crayfish that wins the most fights is placed {{at the top of the}} hierarchy with the other members generally ranking in descending order based on size and sex. Studies have suggested that the largest determining factor in the formation of dominance hierarchies is size rather than sex. That means that female <b>rusty</b> crayfish <b>can</b> rank higher in the dominance hierarchy than male rusty crayfish if they are larger than them.|$|R
5000|$|CBC news {{states that}} winter cyclists {{may choose to}} not use {{multi-speed}} bikes with derailleurs: [...] "a single-speed bike...means fewer moving parts and it's less likely to freeze up" [...] in icy conditions. According to the OBLP, bikes with an internal gear hub, {{in which all the}} gears are enclosed in a case (as opposed to being exposed to the elements) will [...] "keep gears clean and ice/salt free". On bikes used for winter biking in urban environments, the road salt may cause the chain to become <b>rusty,</b> which <b>can</b> cause problems with its functioning (e.g., links seizing up or chain links rusting through). To avoid chain problems, some winter bikers use a belt-driven bicycle, which uses a rubber belt similar to those used as timing belts in automobile engines. Steel components in bikes can be rust-damaged, including steel frames and metal brake cables and shifter cables; for this reason, some winter bikers use bikes made of non-steel materials, such as aluminium.|$|R

5000|$|The reverse was {{the case}} on the Soviet side. There was an {{overwhelming}} surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: [...] "You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad." [...] Stalin was feted as {{the hero of the}} hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. In recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1945. A colossal monument called The Motherland Calls was erected in 1967 on Mamayev Kurgan, the hill overlooking the city where bones and <b>rusty</b> metal splinters <b>can</b> still be found.

The instinctive attraction and fascination {{in reaction to the}} sight of a Ruddy Duck in breeding condition is perhaps as hard to understand as a teenager 2 ̆ 7 s compulsive reverence to some rock star. The Ruddy Duck has a football player 2 ̆ 7 s neck that is at least half again too large for its body, a dumpy body that is both shaped and colored like a partly flattened and <b>rusty</b> tin <b>can,</b> and an array of spiky, often partly missing, broken or disheveled tail feathers that seem to be haphazardly inserted vertically into its rump. A pair of satanic feathered horns rise periodically from the top of its oversized head, which is mostly white except for a black cap that is pulled down gangster-like to eye level. The whole scene is topped off by an over-sized bill that is an unbelievable cerulean blue, as if some color-blind artist had mistaken blue for gray on his palette...|$|R
50|$|The larger {{size and}} {{aggressive}} nature of rusty crayfish {{that have been}} introduced to {{a body of water}} makes it harder for them to be preyed upon by native species of fish, which are not accustomed to crayfish fighting them back. Instead of running away like the native crayfish species do when they come in contact with a predator, the rusty crayfish will take an attack stance with its claws raised above its head, which will generally scare away most predatory fish. Additionally, adult <b>rusty</b> crayfish <b>can</b> be too large for some fish to consume. Because the rusty crayfish are able to avoid predators fairly well, their population in these new aquatic ecosystems was able to grow extremely quickly and within twenty years the rusty crayfish population had exploded and become an invasive species in the Northern United States and parts of Canada. Because these rusty crayfish populations have basically taken over the natives species' habitats and forced them out of their homes, many populations of native crayfish have experienced drastic decline over the past fifty years and the rusty crayfish has become the dominant species in much of the Midwestern United States.|$|R
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. <b>Rusty</b> nail holes <b>can</b> be seen in the lower border and {{across the top of the}} picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|R
50|$|Charlie and Frank's bizarre {{relationship}} is often mocked {{by the rest}} of The Gang, particularly the pair's shared embrace of filthy living conditions. Their apartment appears to be a single room in which they sleep on an old couch bed, cook meals on the radiator or a hot plate and urinate in coffee cans. The alley outside the apartment is crowded with dozens of meowing stray cats after dark, likely the result of Frank and Charlie's nightly consumption of canned cat food (followed by a can of beer and a huff of glue fumes) to get to sleep. They claim this ritual allows them to sleep through the noise of so many stray cats, while everyone else blames the noise on the piles of empty cat-food cans and an open window. The apartment is littered with garbage, dirty dishes and a layer of filth. In one episode, Frank is seen using a steak knife to cut his toenails. He cuts himself almost immediately and Charlie attempts to cover the wound with garbage off the floor. Frank stayed with Charlie originally as a temporary means to hide both himself and his assets from his gold-digging wife. However, he quickly came to love Charlie's life of squalid misery and the two now share virtually everything - from a <b>rusty</b> coffee <b>can</b> used as a toilet to cardboard boxes full of pennies, which millionaire Frank keeps for unspecified purposes.|$|R
