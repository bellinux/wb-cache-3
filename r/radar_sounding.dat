Deep <b>radar</b> <b>soundings</b> {{as part of}} the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US-ITASE) {{traverses}} in West Antarctica {{have revealed}} a bright internal reflector that we have imaged throughout widespread locations across the ice sheet. The layer is seen in traverses emanating from Byrd Station in four directions and has been traced continuously for distances of 535 km toward the Weddell Sea drainage, 500 km toward South Pole, 150 km toward the Executive Committee Range and 160 km toward Kamb Ice Stream (former Ice Stream C). The approximate area encompassed by the layer identified in these studies is 250 000 km 2. If the layer identification can also be extended to Siple Dome where we have additional <b>radar</b> <b>soundings</b> (Jacobel and others, 2000), the approximate area covered would increase by 50 %. In many locations echo strength from the layer rivals the bed echo in amplitude even though it generally lies at a depth greater than half the ice thickness. At Byrd Station, where the layer depth is 1260 m, an age of � 17. 5 kyr BP has been assigned based on the Blunier and Brook (2001) chronology. Hammer and others (1997) note that the acidity at this depth is> 20 times the amplitude of any other part of the core. The depiction of this strong and widespread dated isochrone provides a unique time marker for much of the ice in West Antarctica.

50|$|A {{significant}} amount of surface hydrogen has been observed globally by the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer and Gamma Ray Spectrometer. This hydrogen {{is thought to be}} incorporated into the molecular structure of ice, and through stoichiometric calculations the observed fluxes have been converted into concentrations of water ice in the upper meter of the Martian surface. This process has revealed that ice is both widespread and abundant on the modern surface. Below 60 degrees of latitude, ice is concentrated in several regional patches, particularly around the Elysium volcanoes, Terra Sabaea, and northwest of Terra Sirenum, and exists in concentrations up to 18% ice in the subsurface. Above 60 degrees latitude, ice is highly abundant. Polewards on 70 degrees of latitude, ice concentrations exceed 25% almost everywhere, and approach 100% at the poles. More recently, the SHARAD and MARSIS <b>radar</b> <b>sounding</b> instruments have begun to be able to confirm whether individual surface features are ice rich. Due to the known instability of ice at current Martian surface conditions, it is thought that almost all of this ice must be covered by a veneer of rocky or dusty material.|$|E
40|$|International audienceComplex {{interactions}} between katabatic winds and the cryosphere {{may lead to}} the formation of sedimentation waves at the surface of ice sheets. These have been first described and named snow megadunes in Antarctica. Here we use topographic data, optical images, subsurface <b>radar</b> <b>soundings</b> and spectroscopic data acquired by Mars orbiters, to show that the surface of the Martian North Polar Cap displays two superimposed sets of sedimentation waves with differing wavelengths. These sedimentation waves have similarities with Antarctic snow megadunes regarding their surface morphology, texture, grain size asymmetry, and internal stratigraphic architecture. Both sets of Martian sedimentation waves present young ice and occasional sastrugi fields, indicative of net accumulation, on their shallow-dipping upwind sides, their tops and the intervening troughs. Old layers of dusty ice, indicative of net ablation, are exhumed on the steep-dipping downwind sides of the larger waves. Smooth surfaces of coarse-grained ice, indicative of reduced accumulation associated with sublimation metamorphism, cover the steep-dipping downwind sides of the smaller waves. These surface characteristics and the internal stratigraphy revealed by <b>radar</b> <b>soundings</b> are consistent with the interpretation that both sets of Martian sedimentation waves grow and migrate upwind in response to the development of periodic accumulation/ablation patterns controlled by katabatic winds. The recognition of these sedimentation waves provides the basis {{for the development of a}} common model of ice/wind interaction at the surface of Martian and terrestrial glaciers. Martian smaller waves, characterized by reduced net accumulation on their downwind sides, are analogous to Antarctic snow megadunes that have been described so far. A terrestrial equivalent remains to be discovered for the larger Martian waves, characterized by net ablation on their downwind sides. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

50|$|The {{origin and}} age of the hemispheric {{dichotomy}} are still debated. Hypotheses of origin generally fall into two categories: one, the dichotomy was produced by a mega-impact event or several large impacts early in the planet’s history (exogenic theories) or two, the dichotomy was produced by crustal thinning in the northern hemisphere by mantle convection, overturning, or other chemical and thermal processes in the planet’s interior (endogenic theories). One endogenic model proposes an early episode of plate tectonics producing a thinner crust in the north, similar to what is occurring at spreading plate boundaries on Earth. Whatever its origin, the Martian dichotomy appears to be extremely old. A new theory based on the Southern Polar Giant Impact and validated by the discovery of twelve hemispherical alignments shows that exogenic theories appear to be stronger than endogenic theories and that Mars never had plate tectonics that could modify the dichotomy. Laser altimeter and <b>radar</b> <b>sounding</b> data from orbiting spacecraft have identified {{a large number of}} basin-sized structures previously hidden in visual images. Called quasi-circular depressions (QCDs), these features likely represent derelict impact craters from the period of heavy bombardment that are now covered by a veneer of younger deposits. Crater counting studies of QCDs suggest that the underlying surface in the northern hemisphere is at least as old as the oldest exposed crust in the southern highlands. The ancient age of the dichotomy places a significant constraint on theories of its origin.|$|E

In recent years, radar sys-tems have been developed to detect back-scattered signals from irregularities in the ionospheric plasma. These newer radars can operate at frequencies much greater than the local plasma frequency, because they involve scattering processes only. Furthermore, these scatter (coherent and incoherent) radars yield information on a range of ionospheric param-eters and can observe over a wide area...|$|R

The results of the <b>radar</b> <b>soundings</b> are in general in good agreement with surface mass balance data derived from firn-core studies.
