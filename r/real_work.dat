25|$|Bell's father, grandfather, {{and brother}} {{had all been}} {{associated}} with work on elocution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his <b>real</b> <b>work</b> as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.|$|E
25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no <b>real</b> <b>work</b> for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|It is by {{no means}} simple to sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further {{complicated}} by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about one or another fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. Two online examples are the Italian-language website La Biblioteca di Uqbar, which treats Tlön itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam's entirely imaginary History of the Land Called Uqbar was a <b>real</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

Other interim bodies include a number of standing commissions which study and draft policy proposals for consideration and report back to General Convention. Each standing commission consists of three bishops, three priests or deacons, and six laypersons.

25|$|Because the Soviet Sloika test used dry lithium-6 deuteride {{eight months}} before the first U.S. test to use it (Castle Bravo, March 1, 1954), it was {{sometimes}} claimed that the USSR won the H-bomb race, even though the United States tested and developed the first hydrogen bomb: the Ivy Mike H-bomb test. The 1952 U.S. Ivy Mike test used cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel in the secondary, and employed the D-D fusion reaction. However, the first Soviet test to use a radiation-imploded secondary, the essential feature of a true H-bomb, was on November 23, 1955, three years after Ivy Mike. In fact, <b>real</b> <b>work</b> on the implosion scheme in the Soviet Union only commenced {{in the very early}} part of 1953, several months after the successful testing of Sloika.|$|E

25|$|<b>Real</b> <b>work</b> on axial-flow engines {{started in}} the late 1930s, in several efforts that all started {{at about the same}} time. In England, Hayne Constant reached an {{agreement}} with the steam turbine company Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) in 1937, starting their turboprop effort based on the Griffith design in 1938. In 1940, after the successful run of Whittle's centrifugal-flow design, their effort was re-designed as a pure jet, the Metrovick F.2. In Germany, von Ohain had produced several working centrifugal engines, some of which had flown including the world's first jet aircraft (He 178), but development efforts had moved on to Junkers (Jumo 004) and BMW (BMW 003), which used axial-flow designs in the world's first jet fighter (Messerschmitt Me 262) and jet bomber (Arado Ar 234). In the United States, both Lockheed and General Electric were awarded contracts in 1941 to develop axial-flow engines, the former a pure jet, the latter a turboprop. Northrop also started their own project to develop a turboprop, which the US Navy eventually contracted in 1943. Westinghouse also entered the race in 1942, their project proving to be the only successful one of the US efforts, later becoming the J30.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, on April 30, 1936, Carothers {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences, a very high honor. Carothers was the first {{industrial}} organic chemist to receive this honor. Yet by June 1936, in spite of this honor which validated his contributions to science, Carothers could not shake the depression that prevented him from working. In early June he was admitted involuntarily to the Philadelphia Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital, a prestigious mental hospital, where his psychiatrist was Dr. Kenneth Appel. One month later he was given permission to leave the institute to go hiking in the Tyrolean Alps with friends. The plan was for him to day hike with Dr. Roger Adams and Dr. John Flack for two weeks. After they left, he stayed on, hiking by himself, without sending word to anyone, even his wife. On September 14, he suddenly appeared at her desk at the Experimental Station. From that point on Carothers was not expected to perform any <b>real</b> <b>work</b> at the Experimental Station. He would often go in and visit. He began living in Whiskey Acres again, after his wife had agreed with Dr. Appel that she was not strong enough to watch over Carothers.|$|E
25|$|Regarding Wave {{appeared}} in January 1970, a stylistic departure offering poems {{that were more}} emotional, metaphoric, and lyrical. From the late 1960s, the content of Snyder's poetry increasingly {{had to do with}} family, friends, and community. He continued to publish poetry throughout the 1970s, much of it reflecting his re-immersion in life on the American continent and his involvement in the back-to-the-land movement in the Sierra foothills. His 1974 book Turtle Island, titled after a Native American name for the North American continent, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also influenced numerous West Coast Generation X writers, including Alex Steffen, Bruce Barcott and Mark Morford. His 1983 book Axe Handles, won an American Book Award. Snyder wrote numerous essays setting forth his views on poetry, culture, social experimentation, and the environment. Many of these were collected in Earth House Hold (1969), The Old Ways (1977), The <b>Real</b> <b>Work</b> (1980), The Practice of the Wild (1990), A Place in Space (1995), and The Gary Snyder Reader (1999). In 1979, Snyder published He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth, based on his Reed thesis. Snyder's journals from his travel in India in the mid-1960s {{appeared in}} 1983 under the title Passage Through India. In these, his wide-ranging interests in cultures, natural history, religions, social critique, contemporary America, and hands-on aspects of rural life, as well as his ideas on literature, were given full-blown articulation.|$|E

Production delays prevented any <b>real</b> <b>work</b> from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Her {{arguments}} were rebutted in a rejoinder by Collon (2007), noting {{in particular that}} the whole relief was created in one unit, i.e. there is no possibility that a modern figure or parts of one might {{have been added to}} an antique background; she also reviewed the iconographic links to provenanced pieces. In concluding Collon states: [...] " [...] believed that, with time, a forgery would look worse and worse, whereas a genuine object would grow better and better. [...] Over the years [...] has indeed grown better and better, and more and more interesting. For me she is a <b>real</b> <b>work</b> of art of the Old Babylonian period." ...|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{said of his}} {{involvement}} in public affairs, [...] "I make politics my recreation." [...] He devoted {{most of his time}} to a law practice which according to Hobart's legislative biography was highly profitable. [...] He was rarely seen in a courtroom; his official biography for the 1896 campaign admitted that [...] "he has actually appeared in court a smaller number of times than, perhaps, any lawyer in Passaic County". [...] Hobart's <b>real</b> <b>work</b> was in advising corporations how to accomplish their aims, yet remain within the law. [...] He also had a lucrative business acting as court-appointed receiver of bankrupt railroads. [...] Hobart reorganized them, and restored them to fiscal health. [...] He often invested heavily in them; his success made him wealthy. [...] In addition to the railroads for which he acted as receiver, he {{served as president of the}} Paterson Railway Company, which ran the city's streetcars, and as a board member for other railroads.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{began to}} study music, and was allowed to help Timothy clerk at the store the elder Davenport {{purchased}} when he first moved to Silverton. Timothy required Homer to milk the cows, but otherwise Homer was to [...] "study faces and draw." [...] He was well-liked by the villagers, but they considered him shiftless—they did not consider drawing to be <b>real</b> <b>work.</b> He exhibited a love of animals, especially fast horses and fighting cocks. [...] Davenport later wrote that his fascination with Arabian horses was reawakened in his adolescent years with his admiration of {{a picture of an}} Arabian-type horse found on an empty can of horse liniment. He carefully cleaned the can and kept it as his [...] "only piece of artistic furniture" [...] for many years until forced to leave it behind when he moved to San Francisco. [...] He also played in the community band in his formative years, and with that group young Davenport once traveled as far as Portland.|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the <b>real</b> <b>work</b> began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|It {{was assumed}} by many that Steinbeck had kept a journal {{during the trip}} and that the book was merely an {{amalgamation}} of his log and Ricketts' taxonomic list; but the two authors revealed that the journal was Ricketts'. Although Steinbeck had added to it during the journey, he had done the <b>real</b> <b>work</b> of editing it after they returned. The log was based on what Ricketts called the Verbatim Transcript, {{an account of the}} trip he had compiled from the various notes he kept during the trip. Much of the final narrative was little changed from Ricketts' notes; Steinbeck shifted from the first person singular to the first person plural and gave some of Ricketts' drier prose a poetic twist, but many of the scenes remained almost unchanged from the daily journal. The suggestion by Steinbeck's editor, Pascal Covici, that the title page should state that Steinbeck was the author and add that the appendices were by Ricketts met with blunt opposition from Steinbeck: [...] "I not only disapprove of your plan — I forbid it". Steinbeck also drew upon the journal of Tony Berry, mostly to confirm dates and times.|$|E
