Annual precipitation during the 30 -year period shows an increasing trend over most regions of China, with decreasing trends in potential evapotranspiration and aridity/humidity index.

40|$|This article, taking MODIS-EVI as an index, {{analyzes}} the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of vegetation {{in the southern}} Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR) and explains its cause by ARCGIS and SPSS. The result shows that the <b>regional</b> <b>difference</b> of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is remarkable with apparent topographical effect, especially for longitudinal ranges. As to temporal heterogeneity, because {{of the existence of}} certain time difference of the monsoon air affecting the study area, in addition to the obvious <b>regional</b> <b>difference</b> in spatial distribution of EVI, this kind of <b>regional</b> <b>difference</b> is significantly correlated in location with macro-landforms, especially the case of Ailao Mountain and Wuliang Mountain. As to spatial heterogeneity, by taking Ailao Moutain as a rough divide, because of the alternation of high mountains and gorges in the northwest of the study area, precipitation variance almost follows a sine curve from west to east with the mountain and gorge terrain, and hence EVI changes rapidly; while EVI changes insignificantly in the east of the study area because its terrain becomes rather gentle. The effect of longitudinal mountains on the reallocating of heat and moisture factors is the main cause for EVI <b>regional</b> <b>difference.</b> Especially, the effect of Ailao and Wuliang mountains on rainfall interception in rainy seasons and cold wave block in dry seasons is even more obvious. By counting statistical data of points at altitudes between 1400 and 1500 m in a cross-section, the annual mean precipitations in five sub-areas are 1244. 67, 1081. 44, 1111. 41, 1033, and 807. 11 mm respectively in rainy seasons, while the annual mean minimum temperatures are 7. 93, 7. 46, 7. 28, 8. 44, and 9. 16 degrees C respectively in dry seasons...|$|R

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, <b>regional</b> <b>differences</b> began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
