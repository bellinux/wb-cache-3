3000|$|A {{stereoscopic}} visual attention- (SVA-) based <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> allocation optimization {{scheme is}} {{proposed to improve}} the compression efficiency of MVC. We proposed a bottom-up SVA model to simulate the visual attention mechanisms of the human visual system with stereoscopic perception. This model adopts multiple low level perceptual stimuli, including color, intensity, orientation, motion, depth, and depth contrast. Then the semantic region-of-interest (ROI) is extracted based on the saliency maps of SVA. The proposed model is not only able to efficiently simulate stereoscopic visual attention of human eyes, but also can reduce noise in each stimulus channel. Based on the extracted semantic ROIs, a <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> allocation optimization scheme is also proposed for high compression efficiency by exploiting visual redundancies. Experimental results on MVC showed that the proposed bit allocation algorithm can achieve over [...]...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Stereoscopic Visual Attention-(SVA-) based <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> {{allocation}} for improving MVC coding efficiency. We firstly present {{a framework of}} MVC in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose an SVA model to simulate visual attention mechanism of HVS. And then, SVA-based bit allocation optimization algorithm is proposed for MVC in Section 4. Section 5 presents the regional selective image quality metrics which are adopted in the coding performance evaluation. In Section 6, SVA-based ROI extraction and multiview video coding experiments are performed and evaluated with various multiview video test sequences. Finally, Section 7 gives conclusions.|$|R

The MVC-HBP prediction structure is adopted for MVC simulation. Eight views and GOP Length are 15, fast motion/disparity estimation is enabled, and search range is 64. There are three kinds of picture in the MVC-HBP prediction structure: intracoded picture (I-picture), interpredicted picture (P-picture), and hierarchical bidirectional predicted picture (B-picture). In the coding experiment, all B- and P-pictures are coded with <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> allocation optimization and I-pictures are coded with original MVC scheme without bit allocation optimization. The bQP is set as 12, 17, 22, 27, or 32, and the QPs of background and ROI are set according to (16) and obtain optimal [...]...|$|R
30|$|Recently, depth video coding {{has become}} an active {{research}} area. High compression ratio, high virtual view quality, and low computational complexity are the targets of depth video coding. Cheung et al. [6] proposed depth map compression technique based on sparse representation. Lei et al. [7] improved the depth video coding performance by utilizing the depth-texture and motion similarities. Liu et al. [8] presented two depth compression techniques, the trilateral filter and sparse dyadic mode. Kang et al. [9] designed an adaptive geometry-based intra-prediction scheme for depth video coding. Oh et al. [10] proposed a depth boundary reconstruction filter to code the depth video. Zhang et al. [11] proposed <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> allocation and rate distortion (RD) optimization algorithms for multi-view depth video coding using the imbalance bitrate allocation for different regions. Shao et al. [12] proposed a depth video coding algorithm based on distortion analysis. Standardization of MVD coding was also investigated by the MPEG and ITU-T/ISO/IEC Joint Collaborative Team on 3 D Video Coding Extension Development (JCT- 3 V) [13]. The standard for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) has been completed by ISO and ITU. However, the 3 D extension framework for HEVC (3 D-HEVC) remains under development.|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} of video poses constraints on information capacity. Region-of-Interest (ROI) video coding provides higher {{quality in the}} ROI, but poorer quality in the background (BKGRND), for a given total bitrate (TBR). Researchers, including the authors, have also proposed more graceful quality management methods, using what is referred to here as an Extended-Region-of-Interest (EROI). We consider three levels of losslessness – mathematical, diagnostic, and perceptual, {{with the goal of}} associating them with the above-mentioned regions. We describe work in progress aimed at optimizing an elastic expert system based on the above methodology, with telehealth video as its anchor. The optimizations are threefold – user, perceptual, and network oriented, and are incorporated in the rate control algorithm. We propose a rate control method where, unlike conventional methods, bit allocation is shifted from the frame level to individual regions within the frame. Thereafter, the abovementioned criteria are used to determine <b>regional</b> <b>bit</b> allocation. Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) results show, as expected, that the proposed scheme achieves higher ROI-EROI quality than the verification model VM 8 of MPEG 4. This is illustrated with four examples of pediatrics video. The value and design of the proposed methodology is being corroborated by subjective testing involving medical experts. We are independently researching another standing issue in the telehealth application, that of low complexity segmentation and tracking of the ROI-EROI boundaries. 1...|$|R

40|$|As India {{prepares to}} launch {{broadcast}} television {{services for the}} new millennium, broadcasting is evolving from more than delivering television programs to providing a rich and comprehensive entertainment and information experience for the viewer. The selection of technology for the upcoming conversion from analog to digital broadcasting will govern {{to a large extent}} how well-prepared broadcasters are to provide the services of the future. This paper looks at recent technological advancements which assist the preparedness for interactivity. Efficient allocation of bandwidth in a multichannel digital television service provides the resources for a wider variety of services. Variable Bit Rate video encoding is seen to be an important means of grooming video for statistical multiplexing, whilst third generation statistical multiplexing technologies enable bandwidth savings of over 40 percent. Open loop operation of encoding systems allows statistical multiplexing of remote sources, greatly simplifying the provision of a balanced network of national and <b>regional</b> transmissions. Available <b>Bit</b> Rate (or opportunistic data) capacity is a byproduct of statistical multiplexing, and provides a transmission medium for data broadcasting, including IP-based data services to enable interactivity. Together, these technologies pave the road for the introduction of interactive television to fully exploit the benefits of the conversion to digital...|$|R

Consequently, states have resorted to bilateral investment treaties (<b>BITs),</b> <b>regional</b> trade and international investment agreements (IIAs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) to supplement and complement the regime of protection for foreign investors. In the absence of an international investment court, states hosting foreign investment or investor states have opted for investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS). This mechanism has brought about its own challenges to the international law of foreign investment due to inconsistency in the application and interpretation of the key principles of international investment law by such arbitration tribunals, and further, there is no appellate mechanism to bring about some cohesion and consistency in jurisprudence. Therefore, there are various proposals mooted by scholars to address these challenges and they range from tweaks to BITs and IIAs, the creation of an appellate mechanism and the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to proposals for reform of ISDS only. After assessing the merits and demerits of such proposals, this study goes further, arguing {{for the creation of a}} World Investment Organisation (WIO) with a standing mechanism for settlement of investment disputes in order to ensure legal certainty, predictability and the promotion of the flow of foreign investment in a sustainable and responsible manner...|$|R
