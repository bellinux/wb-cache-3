Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope <b>ratio</b> <b>analysis</b> of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The traffic volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The traffic volume decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal traffic volume variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT <b>ratio</b> <b>analysis</b> does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} statement analysis generally involves common size analysis, <b>ratio</b> <b>analysis</b> (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis. [...] This permits the valuation analyst {{to compare the}} subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's {{financial statement}}s in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends. [...] How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.|$|E
