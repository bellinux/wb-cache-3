5000|$|It {{includes}} an integrated swingarm, which houses a centrifugally controlled Continuously variable transmission (CVT) using a rubber belt sometimes called a VDP. At {{the rear of}} the swingarm, a centrifugal clutch connects the transmission to a simple integral gear-reduction unit. There is no clutch of any kind between the CVT and the crankshaft; it is engaged via a centrifugal clutch at the <b>rear</b> <b>pulley</b> in the same fashion as Vespa Grande, Bravo and variated Ciao model, as well as Honda Camino/Hobbit scooters/mopeds. An electric starter, backup kick-starter, and rear brake hardware is also housed in the swingarm. There are variants known as the [...] "short case" [...] (10" [...] rear wheel, 729, 735 or 742mm belt) and [...] "long case" [...] (12" [...] or 13" [...] wheel, 835 or 842mm belt). Final gearing ratio can be as low as 13/40, or as high as 18/36 (more commonly available as aftermarket items).|$|E
5000|$|Front and <b>rear</b> <b>pulleys</b> or {{sprockets}} must be well aligned {{to avoid}} excessive friction and wear. A chain is more flexible in this respect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a spin-on paper oil filter. Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow <b>rear</b> crankshaft <b>pulley,</b> although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake valve port which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|R
50|$|A single-speed bicycle is {{generally}} cheaper, lighter, and mechanically simpler than its multi-geared equivalent. Without derailleurs or other gearing systems, {{there are fewer}} parts on the bicycle that require maintenance, making this type of cycle useful for city commuting in all weather. The drivetrain efficiency of a single-speed can be greater than today's typical multi-geared bicycles. A straight chainline, lack of chain drag from <b>rear</b> derailleur jockey <b>pulleys,</b> and lack of chainrings, ramps and pins all improve efficiency. As a single rear cog takes less space than the typical seven to ten cogs present on most multi-geared rear cassettes, rear wheels can be built {{with little or no}} dish.|$|R
50|$|Since the CJ-2A was {{primarily}} intended for farming, ranching, and industrial applications, {{a wide variety}} of extras were available such as: rear seat, center rear-view mirror(Stock CJ-2As came with only a driver side mirror), front passenger seat (Stock CJ-2As only came with a driver seat), canvas top, front PTO, <b>rear</b> PTO, belt <b>pulley</b> drive, capstan winch, governor, rear hydraulic lift, snow plow, welder, generator, mower, disc, front bumper weight, heavy-duty springs, dual vacuum windshield wipers (stock CJ-2As were equipped with a manual wiper on the passenger side and a vacuum wiper on the driver side), dual taillights (Stock CJ-2As had a taillight on the driver side and a reflector on the passenger side), hot-climate radiator, driveshaft guards, heater, side steps, and radiator brush guard.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{a simple}} Ford-based racing team, they {{introduced}} the first [...] "Steeda GT" [...] in 1998. The Steeda GT was a low-production car with mostly handling and braking upgrades, including [...] "Steeda Ultralite" [...] wheels, which were {{nothing more than}} repackaged Konig Villains. A cold-air kit, underdrive <b>pulleys,</b> <b>rear</b> wing, [...] "Sidewinder" [...] custom side stripes, and some minor computer tuning added slightly over $5500 to the price of a Standard Mustang GT. [...] In 2000, prior to the introduction of the Q400, the Steeda GT was given the front splitter, which helped keep the newer New Edge Mustangs planted on the ground, and became a popular aftermarket addition. This remained the only offering from Steeda through the 2002 model year.|$|R
