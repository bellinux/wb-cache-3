The ISOSIV unit produces Lead Free Petrol by the Molecular Sieve Technology, which separates Octane rich MS components from feed naphtha. The Hydrotreater Unit (HDT) enables the Refinery to produce High Speed Diesel of very low sulphur and cetane number conforming to BIS specifications. The HDT also produces ATF, Superior Kerosene Oil with high smoke point and low sulphur.

50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as <b>reduced</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that real oil prices are determined in part by refinery capacity, non-linearities in supply conditions, and/or expectations and that observed changes in these variables can account for the rise in prices between 2004 and 2006.

Environmental degradation, loss of means of livelihood, unemployment, poverty, loss of lives and general underdevelopment characterized the region. These formidable odds that threaten {{the survival of the}} Niger Delta people triggered off various shades of interminable violent agitations by militants that involved hostage taking and attacks on oil installations.

Because {{even a small}} fraction of bond splitting can lead to a significant improvement of the flow properties of heavy oil, the cleavage of some C–R (R=S, N, and O) bonds favors <b>reducing</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity eventually with the quality slightly upgraded after oxidation. In addition, when many heavy oil molecules split into fragments, the total number of rings is reduced and some of saturated fragments will release light components, leading to an increase in the content of saturates and aromatics. In general, the changes of heavy oil compositions and molecular structures are responsible for viscosity reduction and quality improvement. The changes of elemental contents after catalytic oxidation over the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 are more obvious than that over the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, which means that the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 is superior to the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 for splitting heavy oil molecules.|$|R

Therefore, it has become necessary to find and devise methods of processing a renewable raw material for conversion into transportation fuel. Some countries are manufacturing ethanol from sugarcane or cereal grains and blending it with petrol to <b>reduce</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> imports. This entails diverting agriculturally productive land for the production of fuel. An alternative is to use inedible plant biomass as raw material. Although plant biomass is mostly cellulose, it is covered and occluded by hemicelluloses and lignin. This greatly limits the access of microbial cellulases required to depolymerize cellulose and release glucose for production of alcohol by yeast-mediated fermentation. A possible solution may be based on the reactions that take place in the rumen of herbivores. These animals have symbiotic bacteria which have multienzyme particles called cellulosomes attached onto their surface. The cellulosomes tear down the ingested plant material into soluble compounds from which the host animal makes milk and meat. Genetic engineering techniques offer the possibility of enhancing the biodegradative action of cellulosomes by reconstituting cellulosomes with potent enzymes from different microbial species.

40|$|At {{specific}} temperature and pressure conditions, hydrates can sometimes plug production pipelines. It {{has been shown}} that some oils contain natural inhibiting compounds (NICs) that prevent hydrate plug formation even though the pressure and temperature are within the hydrate formation conditions. Thus, the hydrate plugging tendency is influenced by the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> composition. The mechanisms by which deposition of hydrates occur in a petroleum production system are also likely to be related to pipeline surface properties, e. g. pipeline material, surface free energy and roughness. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop an understanding of the deposition of hydrates on the pipeline wall. Most of the work in this thesis deals with contact angle measurements that determine the wettability of various solids. Different materials and oil compositions have been tested including both model <b>oil</b> systems and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> systems. Micromechanical force experiments have been used to determine the adhesion force between hydrates and solids with different amounts of petroleum acids present in the oil phase.

It may seem as if hydrate deposition will not occur unless free water is present.

In the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> environment, it was shown that the erosion contribution (Ke) was generally higher than that for corrosion suggesting that corrosion was <b>reduced</b> in <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> The results are interpreted in terms of the effect of the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> environment in modifying the impact properties of the particles therefore providing surprising resistance to particle impacts in nominally aggressive corrosion environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to study the influence of SARA (saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes) fraction on fouling tendencies for four different types of sweet <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> obtained from a local Malaysian refinery. In view of the great need to improve the energy efficiency of the refining processes and to <b>reduce</b> maintenance cost, <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> fouling {{has been the subject of}} intense research in recent years. A combination of ASTM D 3279 and an in-house method using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was established for SARA quantification. The components were then related to the Colloidal Instability Index (CII), ratios of resins to asphaltenes (R:A), calculated from the SARA values and related to the Solubility Number, S BN for each of <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> These parameters can be used to mitigate <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> fouling. A good correlation between CII and S BN was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} polluting {{emissions}} {{and the need}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> dependency had led to the search for alternative solutions also in aeronautics. One of them is represented by solar powered aircrafts, which show both the advantages of solar energy, clean and renewable, and the unmanned vehicle’s benefits. As a consequence this kind of plane presents specific features which need to develop particular techniques to realize them. This work of thesis is part of a project whose aim is the production of a solar powered aircraft with unlimited autonomy and the research is in particular connected with the design and tests of the low Reynolds number airfoil family. The first chapter will introduce how solar energy can be used to propel a plane and which the advantages show by an aircraft without pilot are. The second chapter will illustrate the theoretical background of an aerodynamic body and which parameters influence it, taking into account especially the Reynolds number. The third chapter will explain the procedure and the software used to design and to analyze different airfoil configurations for the solar aircraft. In chapter four, five, six and seven the computational and experimental results obtained for the current airfoil of the prototype and for its modifications respectively in the lower surface, in the leading edge and in the trailing edge, will show and analyze. Moreover the eighth chapter will investigate the effect of a combination of these modifications. The last chapter will summarize all results and the best configuration of the airfoil will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the physicochemical, thermo-oxidative and nutritional characteristics of crude and refined buriti <b>oil.</b> <b>Crude</b> and refined <b>oil</b> samples were evaluated for viscosity, relative density, refraction, acidity, free fatty acids, peroxide and iodine, lipid oxidation degree by UV-Vis, thermogravimetry, calorimetry, in vitro antioxidant capacity, vitamin A content and fatty acids profile. The refining process decreased the free fatty acids percentage and acidity, peroxide and iodine indexes, with greater thermal-oxidative stability, which is critical for its use in cooking food. However, its antioxidant capacity, vitamin A and unsaturated fatty acids contents were <b>reduced</b> compared to <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, it is suggested to optimize the refining process to minimize nutritional losses in buriti oil, which due to its characteristics, can be considered a functional food...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this paper was to analyze the effect of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price as a {{determinant}} on performance of supply chain systems in the petroleum industries in Kenya. Supply chain is a dynamic process and involves the constant flow of information, materials, and funds across multiple functional areas both within and between chain members. Members in the chain need to cooperate with their business partners in order to meet customer’s needs and to maximize their profit by <b>reducing</b> cost of <b>crude</b> <b>oil.</b> However, it is a very difficult task in managing the multiple collaborations in a supply chain {{because there are so many}} firms involved in the supply chain operations with its own resources processes also requires real-time operation and decision making across different tasks, functional areas, and organizational boundaries in order to deal with problems and uncertainties. The strategic move of focus for mass customization, quick response, and high-quality service cannot be achieved without more complex cooperation and dynamic structure of supply chains. Index Terms- Cost of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price, and Performance of supply chain I...|$|R
50|$|During the {{significant}} oil price rise through 2007, a theme among several industry observers {{was that the}} price rise was only partially due to a limit in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> availability (peak oil). For example, an article by Jad Mouawad cited an unusual number of fires and other outages among U.S. refineries {{in the summer of}} 2007 which disrupted supply. However, a lack of refining capacity would only seem to explain high gasoline prices not high <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices. Indeed, if the refineries were unable to process available <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> then there should be a <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> glut that would <b>reduce</b> <b>crude</b> prices on international <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> markets. Then again, sharp changes in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices can also be due to stock market volatility and fear over the security of future supplies, or, on the other hand, an anticipation by investors of a rise in the value of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> once refining capacity picks up again.|$|R
