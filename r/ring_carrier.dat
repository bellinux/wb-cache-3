40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} roller planetary traction drive was developed. It comprises a sun roller, three planetary rollers, an outer <b>ring,</b> a stationary <b>carrier</b> and an input shaft. The sun roller is hollow, and is connected through three logarithmic spiral profiles to the input shaft. As the input shaft rotates {{relative to the}} sun roller, a wedging action takes place between the input shaft and the sun roller; this makes the sun roller generate {{a certain amount of}} elastic deformation, so an appreciable amount of contact load is generated between the sun roller and the planetary roller. The greater the input torque is, the stronger the strength of the wedging action and the greater the contact load, and vice versa; so this configuration is self-actuating. Here, as {{cylindrical roller}}s are used in the planetary traction-drive configuration, the spin motion as would present in the case that the tapered rollers were used will not occur. Meanwhile, as a logarithmic spiral is used in the profile connection, the distribution of contact stress between the two connected surfaces will be uniform. This reduces the concentration of contact stress of the connected surfaces, and prolongs the life of the contact fatigue of the contacting surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating mandrel while a guide holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} braider while 144 strands of material traverse around a <b>carrier</b> <b>ring.</b> As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 carriers holding the fibers travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to interlock fibers. An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the braider introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the braider is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the interlocking of fibers.

30|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox typically consists of some key components: a sun gear, planet gear, <b>ring</b> gear, <b>carrier,</b> and bearing, and faults may occur in these components owing to fatigue or tough working conditions. According to a condition-monitoring report on wind turbines, a gearbox failure {{is the leading}} contributor to all wind turbine failures [3]. A vibration-based method was proven {{to be one of}} the most popular techniques in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, and it has been determined that certain changes to the vibration signals can be seen when a fault occurs, e.g., crack or spalling [4 – 6]. The commonly used vibration signal processing methods can be divided into three categories: time domain methods, frequency domain methods, and time–frequency domain methods. Time domain methods refer to the analysis of a signal with respect to time, and are relatively easy and direct compared to both frequency and time–frequency domain methods. Statistical indicators, the time synchronous averaging (TSA) method, and an autoregressive (AR) model are typically used in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery [4, 7 – 9]. Frequency domain methods refer to an analysis of the signals with respect to the frequency, and a periodic signal in the time domain can be converted into a frequency component through a Fourier transformation. In this way, researchers can identify the difference between the spectrum of a normal vibration signal and a fault vibration signal with commonly used methods that include a spectrum-based analysis, resonance demodulation technique, and cepstrum analysis [10 – 12]. In contrast, time–frequency domain methods are used to study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, allowing both the constituent frequency components and their time variation features to be revealed and analyzed. Researchers have developed various time–frequency domain methods including a short-time Fourier transformation, Wigner–Ville distribution, continuous wavelet transform, and Hilbert-Huang transformation [13 – 16]. Although vibration-based methods have been successfully used in the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of rotating machinery, the appearance of faults in the analysis results has to be identified artificially, e.g., the identification of a fault characteristic frequency in the spectrum, the determination of a filter sub-band in a demodulation analysis, or the determination of a wavelet type, all of which require considerable of experience and expertise [17 – 19]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some intelligent techniques that can automatically determine the health conditions of a {{planetary gearbox}}.|$|R

We analyzed all centromere regions to identify the junction between the unique chromosome arm and the pericentromeric repeats. A molecular-ruler clone panel for each chromosome arm was developed and used {{for the design of}} a custom oligonucleotide array. Of 27 nonsatellited SMCs analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), seven (approximately 26 %) were shown to be unique sequence negative. Of the 20 unique-sequence-positive SMCs, the average unique DNA content was approximately 6. 5 Mb (range 0. 3 – 22. 2 Mb) and 33 known genes (range 0 – 149). Of the 14 informative nonacrocentric SMCs, five (approximately 36 %) contained unique DNA from both the p and q arms, whereas nine (approximately 64 %) contained unique DNA from only one arm. The latter cases are consistent with ring-chromosome formation by centromere misdivision, as first described by McClintock in maize. In one case, a r(4) containing approximately 4. 4 Mb of unique DNA from 4 p was also present in the proband's mother. However, FISH revealed a cryptic deletion in one chromosome 4 and reduced alpha satellite in the del(4) and r(4), indicating that the mother was a balanced <b>ring</b> and deletion <b>carrier.</b> Our data, and recent reports in the literature, suggest that this “McClintock mechanism” of small-ring formation might be the predominant mechanism of origin.

To achieve this goal, additional upgrade measures will be accomplished in several UNILAC sections: LEBT [1], HSI-RFQ [2] and Alvarez main linac (power supplies for the 168 focusing quadrupoles) [3], and high current beam diagnostics [4]. Status of Components In 2008 planning and fabrication for the HSI-RFQ upgrade and commissioning for the Alvarez power supply upgrade have taken place. HSI-RFQ Upgrade The HSI-RFQ will be upgraded with new electrodes, based on a new particle dynamics design [2]. This design, with larger aperture and higher voltage (155 kV instead of 125 kV at Uranium level), provides for a larger acceptance, keeping the max. surface peak field lower than the old design (< 320 kV/cm). The new input radial matcher (IRM) design allows radial beam matching without emittance growth in the matching section. Assuming an input beam current of 25 mA U 4 + (assuming 280 mm mrad transversal emittance), a transmission of 80. 6 % can be expected.

30|$|In a real {{braiding}} process, {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming <b>ring</b> and the <b>carriers.</b> This position depends on parameters such as take-up speed, yarn fineness and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction.

In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the braiding machine and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real braiding machine take-up speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real braiding process. Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each yarn end to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual braiding process was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the braiding process, the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the braiding machine used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|R
