40|$|This article {{introduces}} a maximum entropy-based estimation methodology {{that can be}} used both to represent the uncertainty of a partial-incomplete economic data generation process and to consider the direct influence of learning from <b>repeated</b> <b>samples.</b> Then, a composite cross-entropy estimator, incorporating information from a subpopulation based on a small sample and from a population with a larger sample size, is derived. The proposed estimator is employed to estimate the local area expenditure shares of a sub population of Italian households using a system of censored demand equations.

25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, {{and if he is}} always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by <b>repeated</b> <b>sampling</b> of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E

For example, Ripley defines most probabilistic modeling as stochastic simulation, with Monte Carlo being reserved for Monte Carlo integration and Monte Carlo statistical tests.

40|$|Selection of canola (Brassica napus L.) for {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{composition}} is {{often based on}} single seeds or small seed lots, but information is lacking on variation among <b>repeated</b> <b>samples.</b> Variation in FA composition was measured among <b>repeated</b> <b>samples</b> of B. napus seeds by gas chromatography on oil extracted by cold solvents, from a selfed doubled-haploid line (Monty- 028 DH), and an open-pollinated B. napus cv. Surpass 501 TT. The variation in FA composition among <b>repeated</b> <b>samples</b> of 1, 3, 5, and 10 whole seeds was compared with the equivalent weight of ground seeds or Soxhlet-extracted oil. The standard deviation of oleic acid for whole seeds of Monty- 028 DH decreased from 2. 12 % (single-seed samples) to 0. 12 % (groups of 10 seeds), but was constant across an equivalent range in weight of ground seed (0. 15 %) and in volume of Soxhlet-extracted oil (0. 05 %). A single-seed sample {{is not sufficient to}} separate two B. napus genotypes differing in mean oleic acid content of 60 % and 70 % at the 95 % confidence interval, based on the sampling variance measured in these experiments.

50|$|One {{interpretation}} of frequentist inference (or classical inference) {{is that it}} is applicable only in terms of frequency probability; that is, in terms of <b>repeated</b> <b>sampling</b> from a population. However, the approach of Neyman develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or <b>repeated</b> <b>sampling</b> interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.|$|E
