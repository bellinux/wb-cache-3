500|$|The phase {{velocity}} {{is important in}} determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented {{in terms of a}} refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the {{phase velocity}}vp in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In exotic materials like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and <b>re-radiation</b> delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light [...] "slowing" [...] in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a [...] "complete standstill" [...] by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge.

2500|$|Partially {{based on}} the {{calculations}} of Darwin, an important criticism was given by Henri Poincaré in 1908. He concluded that the attraction is proportional to , where S is earth's molecular surface area, v is the velocity of the particles, and ρ is {{the density of the}} medium. Following Laplace, he argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for S is at the most a ten-millionth of the Earth's surface. Now, drag (i.e. the resistance of the medium) is proportional to Sρv and therefore the ratio of drag to attraction is inversely proportional to Sv. To reduce drag, Poincaré calculated a lower limit for v = 24 · 1017 times the speed of light. So there are lower limits for Sv and v, and an upper limit for S and with those values one can calculate the produced heat, which is proportional to Sρv3. The calculation shows that earth's temperature would rise by 1026 degrees per second. Poincaré noticed, [...] "that the earth could not long stand such a regime." [...] Poincaré also analyzed some wave models (Tommasina and Lorentz), remarking that they suffered the same problems as the particle models. To reduce drag, superluminal wave velocities were necessary, and they would still be subject to the heating problem. After describing a similar <b>re-radiation</b> model like Thomson, he concluded: [...] "Such are the complicated hypotheses to which we are led when we seek to make Le Sage's theory tenable".|$|E

Nine male participants (26. 0 ± 4. 7 years) took part in three experimental sessions where they were exposed to radiation from a hot black panel heated to 100 °C; direct simulated solar radiation of 600 Wm and the combined simulated solar radiation and black panel radiation. Exposures were for 30 min, during which subjective responses and mean skin temperatures were recorded. The results showed that, at a surface temperature of 100 °C (close to maximum in practice), radiation from the flat black panel provided thermal discomfort but that this was relatively small when compared with the effects of direct solar radiation. It was concluded that <b>re-radiation,</b> from a dashboard in a vehicle, for example, will not have a major direct influence on thermal comfort and that existing models of thermal comfort do not require a specific modification.
