MÉTODOS: Foram analisados 43 coelhos hipercolesterolêmicos, brancos, da raça New Zealand, e o total de 86 artérias ilíacas submetidas a lesão por balão de angioplastia. Divididos em três grupos: dois (GI) irradiados com as doses de 15 Gy (n= 14) e 60 Gy (n= 36) e um grupo controle (n= 36). Foram {{realizadas}} avaliação histológica morfométrica e análise histológica qualitativa para análise tecidual. RESULTADOS: Foram observadas uma redução significativa da neoproliferação intimal (NPI) no GI 15 Gy (p OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} designed to evaluate vascular morphological and morphometric changes induced by brachytherapy with samarium- 153 (Sm- 153) at high doses in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. METHODS: Forty-three New Zealand White hypercholesterolemic rabbits were analyzed, and the total of 86 iliac arteries underwent balloon angioplasty injury. The rabbits were divided into three different groups: two irradiation groups (IG) assigned to 15 Gy (n= 14) and 60 Gy (n= 36) irradiation doses, respectively, and a control group (n = 36). Histomorphometric and qualitative histological analyses were performed for tissue evaluation. RESULTS: Significant reductions were found in neointimal proliferation (NIP) (p< 0. 0001), media area (MA) (p< 0. 0001) and percent stenosis (p< 0. 0001) in the 15 -Gy IG, compared to the other groups. The 60 -Gy IG had the higher rate of NIP, increase in media and vessel areas (VA) and percent stenosis. The 60 -Gy IG also showed the greatest number of xanthomatous cells (60 -Gy IG: 86. 11 % and 15 -Gy IG: 14. 29 %, p< 0. 0001) and the highest amount of hyaline amorphous tissue (60 -Gy IG: 58. 33 % and 15 -Gy IG: 0 %, p= 0. 0001) and vascular proliferation (60 -Gy IG: 30. 56 % and 15 -Gy IG: 0 %, p= 0. 0221). No statistically significant differences were found among groups concerning other tissue analyses. CONCLUSION: The high-dose irradiation of 60 Gy resulted in intense cell proliferation considered vascular <b>radiolesion,</b> unlike the 15 -Gy dose, which was associated with an excellent inhibition of neointimal proliferation...|$|E

40|$|Systematic human {{pathological}} {{background to}} brain tumor radiosurgery explaining biological and pathophysiological effects of focused irradiation barely exists. The {{goal of this}} study was to explore histopathological changes evoked by single high-dose irradiation in a set of different brain tumors following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Light microscopy revealed that GKRS evokes degenerative and proliferative pathological changes in the parenchyma, stroma and vessels of the irradiated tumors. Three main histological types of gamma <b>radiolesions,</b> that is acute, subacute and chronic variants of tissue reactions were recognized in different neoplasms irrespective of their ontogenetic nature. Acute type gamma <b>radiolesions</b> were characterized mainly with necrotic changes and appeared either early or in a delayed time interval. Subacute type gamma <b>radiolesions</b> expressed resorptive activity also with early or delayed chronology. Chronic type lesions showed a reparative tendency but presented only at the delayed stage. These changes seem to follow each other consecutively. There was no significant relation between morphological characteristics of the generated tissue reaction and the time interval elapsed after GKRS. This relative time and environment autonomy of the developed pathological lesions with similar histological picture in different neoplasms suggests either a vascular mechanism or/and a genetically directed origin presumably induced by the ionizing energy of high-dose irradiation.

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that stem cells contribute to the restoration of tissue vascularization and organ function. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the presence of adipose-derived adult stem cells left in their natural scaffold in the purified lipoaspirate and to assess the clinical effectiveness of lipoaspirate transplantation in the treatment of radiation side effects. Methods: This study was designed beginning with surgical procedures in 2002 and envisaging a continuous patient follow-up to 31 months. Twenty consecutive patients undergoing therapy for side effects of radiation treatment with severe symptoms or irreversible function damage (LENT-SOMA scale grade 3 and 4) were enrolled. Purified autologous lipoaspirates (60 to 120 cc) taken from a healthy donor site were administered by repeated low-invasive computer-assisted injection. Therapy outcomes were assessed by symptoms classification according to the LENT-SOMA scale, cytofluorimetric characterization, and ultrastructural evaluation of targeted tissue. Results: In the isolated stromal vascular fraction of 2 cc of human lipoaspirate, cells with mesenchymal stem cell physical properties and immunophenotype were in average 1. 07 0. 5 percent (n 4), with a clonogenic fraction of 0. 139 percent. At least 1. 02103 colony-forming units 9 ̆ 6 fibroblast were present in each lipoaspirate. Ultrastructure of target tissue systematically exhibited progressive regeneration, including neovessel formation and improved hydration. Clinical outcomes led to a systematic improvement or remission of symptoms in all evaluated patients, including otherwise untreatable patients exhibiting initial irreversible functional damage. Conclusions: This surgical procedure is a low-invasive therapeutic approach for resolving the late side effects of radiotherapy. According to the proposed hypothesis of the ischemic nature of <b>radiolesions,</b> treatment with lipoaspirate transplantation ispotentially extendedtoother formsofmicroangiopathie...|$|R
40|$|A {{synopsis}} {{of the available}} data on the radiosensitivity of female germ cells is provided, the reader being referred to recent comprehensive reviews for detailed information. The effects of ionizing radiations are considered in terms of age; germ cell stage and follicular development; type, quality, and physical factors of the exposure; and criterion chosen to assess the effect (cell killing, reproductive capacity, genetic effects, etc.). A number of conclusions are drawn which might have a bearing on studies in which the effects of chemicals and drugs on mammalian species are assessed. Ionizing radiations include those produced by the decay of radioisotopes (a, p, and y-rays; neutrons, etc.) and those produced artificially (x-rays). The primary lesion caused by these radiations derives from an ionization-either within a cell or in the environment surrounding the cell-which may re-sult in damage {{to a variety of}} cellular organelles (1 - 4). <b>Radiolesions</b> may occur within the nucleus or cytoplasm of the cell and a proportion of the changes will be repaired: however, the most im-portant consequence of radiation damage is break-age of the chromosomes which can result in the death of the cell, or genetic changes (5 - 7). The extensive and complex literature on the ef-fects of ionizing radiations on the mammalian ovary {{has been the subject of}} many review articles (3, 6 - 9), and hence only the major conclusions will be restated here. It should be stressed at the outset, however, that radiation effects vary considerably between species, and indeed between strains within one species, and thus great care must be taken if results are to be extrapolated from one experimen-tal mammal to another. Physical factors at the time of exposure have a profound effect on the response of cells to irradiation (e. g., dose rate, quality and type of radiation used, acute or fractionated expo...|$|R
