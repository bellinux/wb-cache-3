5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> a tooth.

Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the tooth and is thickest {{at the root}} apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is {{to serve as a}} medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
