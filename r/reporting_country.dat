40|$|Abstract Background The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are {{required}} to develop and report a national inventory of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In the Asia region, "Workshops on Greenhouse Gas Inventories in Asia (WGIA) " have been organised annually since 2003 under {{the support of the}} government of Japan. WGIAs promote information exchange in the region to support countries' efforts {{to improve the quality of}} greenhouse gas inventories. This paper reports the major outcomes of the WGIAs and discusses the key aspects of information exchange in the region for the improvement of inventories. Results The major outcomes of WGIAs intended to help countries improve GHG inventories, can be summarised as follows: (1) identification of common issues and possible solutions by sector, (2) <b>reporting</b> <b>country</b> inventory practices, and (3) verification of the UNFCCC reporting requirements. Conclusion The workshops provided the opportunity for countries to share common issues and constraints pertinent to GHG inventories and to exchange information regarding possible solutions for those issues based on their own experience. The relevance of information exchange is determined due to emission sources, emitting mechanisms from sources, and technologies used. Information exchange about emission sources that are unique to Asia, like those of the agriculture sector, contributes significantly to the accumulation of knowledge at the regional and global levels. Enabling countries to verify their national circumstances with the reporting requirements under UNFCCC is also an essential part of the WGIA information exchange activities. </p...|$|E

Countries report LLIN distribution {{data to the}} WHO annually. For this analysis, these data {{were used to assess}} policy and practice in implementing these recommendations and to compare the numbers of LLINs available through ANC and EPI services with the numbers of women and children attending these services. MethodsFor each <b>reporting</b> <b>country</b> in sub-Saharan Africa, the presence of a reported policy for LLIN distribution through ANC and EPI was reviewed. Prior to inclusion in the analysis the completeness of data was assessed in terms of the numbers of LLINs distributed through all channels (campaigns, EPI, ANC, other). For each country with adequate data, the numbers of LLINs reportedly distributed by national programmes to ANC was compared to the number of women reportedly attending ANC at least once; the ratio between these two numbers was used as an indicator of LLIN availability at ANC services. The same calculations were repeated for LLINs distributed through EPI to produce the corresponding LLIN availability through this distribution channel. ResultsAmong 48 malaria-endemic countries in Africa, 33 malaria programmes reported adopting policies of ANC-based continuous distribution of LLINs, and 25 reported adopting policies of EPI-based distribution.

The two projects are related in some ways and unrelated in others. The introduction and background are two common sections. All other sections of this report are project-specific. The project-specific sections are divided into “Part 1 ” and “Part 2. ” Part 1 relates to the country risk reporting project done in New York, whereas Part 2 relates to the project completed in London, regarding foreign exchange spot credit limit consolidation. i The main goal of this project was to improve risk reporting and technology at Lehman Brothers for both country and credit risk.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) database contains data {{on the value of}} merchandise exports and imports between each country and all its trading partners. Total bilateral and multilateral exports and imports are aggregated at national or regional group level. For each <b>reporting</b> <b>country</b> or group, all the trading partners are listed. The corresponding monetary values of total imports and total exports are then provided as time series for each country/trading partner pair. All exports are valued free on board (f. o. b.). Imports are usually reported cost including insurance and freight (c. i. f.), although a small number of countries report imports f. o. b. Along with data from reporting countries, estimates are provided by partner countries for non-reporting countries or for those that are slow to report. The period for which data are available varies from country to country, but most countries data extend from the 1980 s to the present. The Direction of Trade pre- 1980 data is found in the DOTS Historical database which runs from 1948 to 1980. There can be inconsistencies between exports to a partner and the partner's recorded imports from a particular country, i. e. the exports from Country A to B do not always equal the imports of Country B from A. This is due to the different ways countries report their trade, i. e. differences in classification concepts and detail, time of recording, valuation, and coverage, as well as processing errors. This database was first provided by UK Data Service in December 2003. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IMF Direction of Trade Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.

The same calculations were repeated for LLINs distributed through EPI to produce the corresponding LLIN availability through this distribution channel. Among 48 malaria-endemic countries in Africa, 33 malaria programmes reported adopting policies of ANCbased continuous distribution of LLINs, and 25 reported adopting policies of EPI-based distribution. Over a 3 -year period through 2012, distribution through ANC accounted for 9 % of LLINs distributed, and LLINs distributed through EPI accounted for 4 %. The LLIN availability ratios achieved were 55 % through ANC and 34 % through EPI. For 38 country programmes reporting on LLIN distribution, data to calculate LLIN availability through ANC and EPI was avail able for 17 and 16, respectively. These continuous LLIN distribution channels appear to be under-utilized, especially EPI-based distri bution. However, quality data from more countries are needed for consistent and reliable programme performance monitoring. A greater focus on routine data collection, monitoring and reporting on LLINs distributed through both ANC and EPI can provide insight into both strengths and weaknesses of continuous distribution, and improve the effectiveness of these delivery channel...|$|E

Porwal and Sharma (1991) conducted a study on public and private sector companies in India and concluded that private sector companies made lesser disclosure as compared to public sector companies. Raman (2006) analysed the extent and nature of social reporting of top 50 companies in India by studying how top management perceives CSR and CSR report. It was found the community involvement is a key component in the social reporting and more {{emphasis is placed on}} development of human resource. Chaudhri and Wang (2007) examined CSR disclosure of top 100 IT companies in India and found that CSR disclosure was considerably low and companies {{have not been able to}} leverage in terms of style of communicating CSR on to their websites. The quantity of CSR disclosure too is a question of concern. Murthy (2008) examined the annual reports of top 16 IT companies in India using content analysis and concluded that community development activities were the most common disclosure practices, then followed by environmental activities in the CSR reporting. Sustainability reporting in India is still in nascent stage and corporate sector is yet to fully recognize the relevance of CSR reporting for building a corporate reputation in a highly transparent market environment (Ghosh 2015). Ghosh (2017) also conducted empirical study on CSR reporting of select companies from 2009 to 2014 and analysed the CSR reporting practices for pre and CSR reporting mandate onset period. It was found that average CSR activities disclosure has increased in social reporting but still few companies publish a sustainability report separately. Jain & Winner (2016) examined CSR/ sustainability report of 200 largest public and private sector companies in India and concluded that standard CSR/sustainability reporting is still low but shows positive signs of reforms. Kumar & Kidwai (2018) conducted research on CSR disclosure of top 100 ET (2014) companies. It was found that only eight companies showed high transparency in their CSR disclosure and the companies focus heavily on social initiatives and human resource oriented activities in their disclosure. According to KPMG (2017) India has emerged as the top CSR <b>reporting</b> <b>country</b> along with Japan and Malaysia in Asia. CSR reporting by the companies has seen an improvement following the implementation of CSR rule of Indian Companies Act 2013.

40|$|The {{results of}} this survey and the {{available}} surveillance data indicate that there is ongoing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella, especially among certain high-risk populations. This suggests that {{the effectiveness of the}} antenatal screening practice – despite of considerable breaths – can be optimised. Factors that compromise effectiveness include low screening coverage, limited access to antenatal care services, and limited access to testing for several subpopulations. While the case rates of MTCT of HIV and congenital syphilis are below the WHO global targets for the elimination in the EU/EEA (< 50 cases per 100 000 live births), antenatal care coverage and testing still needs to be scaled up in several countries, with increased attention to be given to improving access to antenatal screening for vulnerable groups. Few countries collect data robust enough for a comprehensive evaluation of antenatal screening programme effectiveness, and even fewer countries make the results of such evaluations publically available. It would therefore be helpful to develop a set of process and outcome indicators to guide countries in the monitoring and evaluation of antenatal screening programme effectiveness. Several national surveillance systems in EU/EEA countries do not currently identify and record all MTCT cases in people born in the <b>reporting</b> <b>country.</b> Recording these cases is essential for the informative value of national screening programmes. In addition, the notification of congenital syphilis cases is not mandatory in some countries. Enhanced surveillance of MTCT cases with comprehensive collection of information about the mother and the child would improve the assessment of the incidence of MTCT and would provide valuable information on risk factors. This information could then be used to inform national policies and would probably lead to scaled-up antenatal screening for the most-at-risk subpopulations. Ongoing mother-to-child transmission particularly affects certain vulnerable groups that are not adequately reached by, or do not have access to, testing services and prevention interventions that are available to the majority of the population. Member States should consider targeted interventions for such populations at risk, based on an assessment of disease epidemiology and risk profile. ECDC is currently developing an evidence-based guidance to strengthen antenatal screening among vulnerable groups. The guidance will answer two central questions: a) What are the decisive elements of national programmes for antenatal infection screening with regard to their effectiveness and b) how can vulnerable groups be reached to increase the uptake of prenatal care in order to prevent or reduce mother-to-child transmission of infectious diseases...|$|E

Background: The HIV {{burden is}} {{increasing}} in older {{adults in the}} European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). We investigated factors associated with HIV diagnosis in older adults in the 31 EU/EEA countries during a 12 year period. Methods: In this analysis of surveillance data, we compared data from older people (aged ≥ 50 years) with those from younger people (aged 15 – 49 years). We extracted new HIV diagnoses reported to the European Surveillance System between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2015, and stratified them by age, sex, migration status, transmission route, and CD 4 cell count. We defined late diagnosis as CD 4 count of less than 350 cells per μL at diagnosis and diagnosis with advanced HIV disease as less than 200 cells per μL. We compared the two age groups with the χ² test for difference, and used linear regression analysis to assess temporal trends. Findings: During the study period 54 102 new HIV diagnoses were reported in older adults. The average notification rate of new diagnoses was 2 · 6 per 100 000 population across the whole 12 year period, which significantly increased over time (annual average change [AAC] 2 · 1 %, 95 % CI 1 · 1 – 3 · 1; p= 0 · 0009). Notification rates for new HIV diagnoses in older adults increased significantly in 16 countries in 2004 – 15, clustering {{in central and eastern}} EU/EEA countries. In 2015, compared with younger adults, older individuals were more likely to originate from the <b>reporting</b> <b>country,</b> to have acquired HIV via heterosexual contact, and to present late (p< 0 · 0001 for all comparisons). HIV diagnoses increased significantly over time among older men (AAC 2 · 2 %, 95 % CI 1 · 2 – 3 · 3; p= 0 · 0006), women (1 · 3 %, 0 · 2 – 2 · 4; p= 0 · 025), {{men who have sex with}} men (5 · 8 %, 4 · 3 – 7 · 5; p< 0 · 0001), and injecting drug users (7 · 4 %, 4 · 8 – 10 · 2; p< 0 · 0001). Interpretation: Our findings suggest that there is a compelling need to deliver more targeted testing interventions for older adults and the general adult population, such as by increasing awareness among health-care workers and expanding opportunities for provider-initiated and indicator-condition-guided testing programmes.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{response}} to new psychoactive substances within the European Union (EU), the Council Decision 2005 / 387 /JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances (hereafter 'the Council Decision') established a mechanism for the rapid exchange of information on substances that may pose public health and social threats, including the involvement of organised crime. This provides a legal basis for {{the institutions of the}} EU and the Member States to monitor all new narcotic and psychotropic substances that appear on the European drug scene. Where necessary, the Council Decision also provides for an assessment of the risks associated with these new substances, so that control measures deriving from Member States' obligations to the United Nations drug control conventions (1) can also be applied to new psychoactive substances. Under Article 4 of the Council Decision, the EMCDDA and Europol, in close collaboration with their respective expert networks, the Reitox National Focal Points and Europol National Units, are assigned a central role in detecting, notifying and monitoring new psychoactive substances. The information exchange element of the Council Decision has been implemented by the EMCDDA and Europol as the European Union Early Warning System on New Psychoactive Substances (hereafter ‘Early Warning System'). In addition, where necessary, and in cooperation with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the EMCDDA and Europol may collect, analyse and present information on a new psychoactive substance {{in the form of a}} Joint Report (Article 5). This report provides evidence to the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on the need to request a risk assessment on a new psychoactive substance. Such a risk assessment examines the health and social risks posed by a new substance including: the use of, manufacture of, and, traffic in, a new psychoactive substance; the involvement of organised crime; and, the possible consequences of control measures. In order to conduct the risk assessment, the EMCDDA convenes a special meeting under the auspices of its Scientific Committee, extended with additional experts as necessary (Article 6). To ensure transparency in the implementation of the Council Decision, Article 10 stipulates that: 'The EMCDDA and Europol shall report annually to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the implementation of this Decision. The report will take into account all aspects required for an assessment of the efficacy and achievements of the system created by this Decision. The report shall, in particular, include experience relating to coordination between the system set out in this Decision and the Pharmacovigilance system'. ’ In compliance with Article 10, the EMCDDA and Europol herewith present the eighth such annual report which covers the period 1 January to 31 December 2013. The report outlines the results of the implementation, describes key issues arising from accumulated experiences, and also serves as a monitoring tool. In order to facilitate the reading of the report, the reader is referred to the full text of the Council Decision (2). The report is written as a standalone document. Annex provides the list of new psychoactive substances notified for the first time in 2013. This includes the systematic chemical name, the <b>reporting</b> <b>country,</b> and date of notification for each substance. Further information on these substances is available from the EMCDDA and Europol...|$|E
