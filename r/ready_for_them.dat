25|$|Trearne House {{had been}} built about 1870, almost on the 'footprint' of an older mansion house. Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick lived for some time in Burnhouse Manor until their new house was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> By 1877 Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick {{were living in the}} new Trearne. Jenny Kerr was {{probably}} the last person born at Trearne Lodge; her mother was living there with her parents when her father was a Lieutenant in the Glasgow Highlanders, and was fighting in France during the first World War. Over Hessilhead was on the Trearne Estate along with Hessilhead, Townend of Hessilhead and an estate saw mill with its water wheel driven by the Dusk Water. During WW2 Trearne House was used by the army, following which it became Gresham House Boarding School. The school had a cook, a matron and five or six teachers up. There would be about thirty boys in the private boarding school, many of whom had parents who worked abroad.|$|E
25|$|When Dee and Willow go to London, Sonya tells Toadie {{to follow}} them. She starts to feel ill and Mark stays over with her. Nell tells Toadie that Mark is {{in bed with}} Sonya, {{resulting}} in an argument during a video chat. Toadie fails to close the chat window properly and Sonya sees him having sex with Dee. Mark then reveals that Dee is actually a woman named Andrea Somers, and Willow is not Toadie's daughter. Sonya's contractions begin and she is rushed to the hospital, where she has a miscarriage. When Toadie returns home, Sonya tells him {{that she wants to}} separate and he moves in with the Kennedys. Sonya becomes depressed and struggles to cope with her grief. She and Mark kiss, but Sonya realises that she just wants to remain friends. Sonya breaks her sobriety and begins drinking again. When Steph realises what is going on, she offers her help. While dropping Nell off to Toadie, Sonya sees a letter from a lawyer concerning divorce proceedings. Toadie tells her his mother, Angie, contacted the lawyer. Sonya also decides to contact a lawyer, but Toadie tells her he does not want a divorce. Sonya continues to drink and she collapses at a public event. Toadie seeks full custody of Nell and Tim Collins urges her to step down as Mayor. However, when her drinking problem is reported in the press, she is sacked. Sonya turns to gambling, but loses her money. She later remembers that {{she was the one who}} crashed Amy's ute into the Erinsborough Backers' injuring Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and makes a confession to the police. She is then charged. Attempting to get her life back together, she leaves Erinsborough for rehab, but Toadie soon learns that she has checked herself out. She gives Toadie power of attorney and asks him to sell the nursery to pay Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Toadie finds Sonya in a caravan with a former drinking friend. He asks Callum to come home and talk with Sonya, who agrees to return home. Sonya and Toadie reconnect via emails. Toadie represents Sonya at her trial, where she receives 240 hours community service. Sonya tells Toadie that she is not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to get back together. Sonya thinks that Toadie is beginning a relationship with Amy, but Toadie tells her that he isn't, after which Sonya and Toadie see a relationship counsellor.|$|E

Tumminia states that Norman had [...] "no public distress" [...] over {{the failure of}} her prediction. Despite the negative publicity from the prophecy's failure, new members were attracted to the group. After losing the wager, Norman changed the expected landing date to 2001; she taught that {{the close of the}} 20thcentury coincided with {{the beginning of a new}} cycle which would bring great benefits to humanity. Representatives of Unarius later stated that the prophecies had been misunderstood and that the Space Brothers had not visited because humanity was not yet <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> They have argued that Unarius' teachings must be understood to correctly interpret Norman's statements. Tumminia writes that they used [...] "adaptive storytelling and continuous narrative invention" [...] to explain the failure of the prophecy.|$|E

Her eldest son, Paul, said his first memory was watching her cycling away when it was snowing heavily. After she {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, Mary still carried on cycling to work, but often doubled up in pain and had trouble breathing. The day Mary was due to have a mastectomy operation, she cleaned the McCartney house and laid her two sons' school clothes out, ready for the next day. She said to Dill Mohin, her sister-in-law, [...] "Now everything's <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> in case I don't come back." [...] Mary died of an embolism on 31 October 1956, after an operation {{to stop the spread of}} breast cancer. Her last words to Dill Mohin were [...] "I would love to have seen the boys growing up." [...] Mary was buried on 3 November 1956 at Yew Tree Cemetery, Finch Lane, Liverpool.

2500|$|Sontag {{writes that}} the {{convenience}} of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and [...] "just about everything has been photographed".

[...] "In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what {{we have the right to}} observe" [...] and has changed our [...] "viewing ethics". Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Tom King, a candidate running for mayor of Birmingham, met with Connor on May 8, 1961, to pay his respects. In addition, he asked Connor to refrain from announcing support for the other leading mayoral candidate, Art Hanes, so that King's chances would be greater. At the end of the meeting, Connor noted that he was expecting the Freedom Riders to reach Birmingham the following Sunday, Mother's Day. Connor stated, [...] "We'll be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> too," [...] and King responded, [...] "I bet you will, Commissioner," [...] as he walked out.|$|E

2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when {{the clock is}} ticking and time is pressing, a player's intuition is most likely to let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

As the relationship wore on, however, Elder would later see some odd signs of the potentially deadly violent streak in Alexander, especially when commenting about the inspectors. In what had {{started out as a}} joke, the couple concocted a series of short stories; one, titled [...] "Sausage Sniffers Found Sauced", painted a description of the inspectors drowning in vats of 'secret sauce'. Soon, the tone of Alexander's words would take on a much darker tone. [...] As another former girlfriend, Charlotte Knapp, 38, who had been seeing Alexander off and on up until the time of the murders, would later testify during the murder trial, Alexander frequently used profanities to describe the inspectors and would at times have some choice words <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> or for anyone else whom he deemed as [...] "trespassers" [...] that came upon his factory.

On 10 March, the government members travelled to Moscow by night train, with most of them settling in the city's Hotel National on Okhotny Road, 300 yards from the Moscow Kremlin; here, Lenin shared a small two-room apartment with his wife and sister Maria. Soon after, Lenin, Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Cavalry Corpus of the Great Kremlin Palace, a temporary measure until the Kremlin's Senate Building was <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to move in.
