40|$|Objective of the Study The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the role of internal communication in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process. The study analysed the role of internal communication through four research questions: 1) What communication practices are connected with the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process? 2) Which organisational attributes influence the internal communication climate in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process? 3) How is management and strategic communication incorporated in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process? and 4) How does the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process influence the communication lines in the organisation? Methodology and Theoretical Framework The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy. The data consisted of eight theme interviews conducted in four companies with business professionals involved in financial forecasting process. The data collection and analysis concentrated on key themes, which emerged from existing literature. The starting point for the theoretical framework was a management steering model created by Hope, Fraser and Åkerberg (1999). The model is based on forecasts, performance reviews and strategy evaluation that are carried out on a rolling basis. The theoretical framework consists of four core elements: internal communication practices, organisational context, strategic planning and management approach. Findings and Conclusions The findings of the study show that efficient internal communication is one of the prerequisites of a well-designed <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process. Internal communication in general has a multifaceted role in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process. The communication practices were case-specific and unstructured among the case organisations. History, organisational structure and organisational culture were considered as the most significant organisational attributes that influence internal communication climate. Interviewees highlighted the importance of management communication especially during the implementation of the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process whereas the incorporation of strategic communication in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process was dependent on how the entire business planning process is organized in the company. As a conclusion, the key elements of functional internal communication in the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process consists of coordinated communication framework and practices, adaptable communication climate and management endorsement. Moreover, findings indicate that the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process calls for open and cooperative communication but the process itself can also spur communication across the organisation...|$|E
40|$|Current {{business}} {{atmosphere is}} considered much more dynamic and complex than before that makes traditional management accounting {{tools such as}} annual budgeting inappropriate to confront such enduring competition. According to Bescos et al. (2003), the degree of environmental uncertainty is one important contingency factor {{which can be a}} major driver of dissatisfaction with budgeting system. There are two viewpoints concerning altering the dissatisfaction with budgeting. One is better budgeting and the other is beyond budgeting. Better budgeting helps to keep annual budget and complementing annual budget with advanced managerial techniques such as <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast.</b> Nowadays in order to keep competing, companies are increasingly adopting <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> because it is more adaptive and by employing <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> they are capable of updating the forecasts and plans quickly that enables them to obtain a better position to respond to threats and opportunities. Therein, the current study aims to understand better budgeting process and to explore why and how the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> can be employed together with fixed budgets and how the use of <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> can support fixed budget in an uncertain environment. In order to deepen this study, a case study – Philips (Consumer lifestyle sector) - is applied, and its empirical findings were compared and analyzed with respect to the results found in the literature review. Finally empirical findings indicate that the objectives such as setting a goal and commitment and motivation functions that are of high importance and cannot be covered by <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> are covered by annual budgeting. It is also shown that <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> would be an adaptation of the budget to bring more flexibility and an improved level of decision-making to the process in an uncertain environment specifically when it comes to resource allocation, supply chain management, and production planning.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the implementation and daily operations of <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> in one Finnish retail trade company. Under the theme of budgeting rolling forecasting's idea {{has been known for}} decades among scholars. Nevertheless, it has not drawn much attention in management accounting studies. Only {{after the turn of the}} millennium practitioners have shown interest in <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting,</b> through which it is justifiable to claim that case studies are necessary in order to build up understanding of micro-level diffusion of <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Management control systems have been researched widely in the diffusion literature from many perspectives. These studies have been bothered by post-positive relationship to innovations, unlimited resources, technology oriented weight and over rationality. Lately research has tried to answer these challenges by pointing interest to complexity, irrationality and humanity of changes. Management accounting research has developed accounting change models, presented future landscapes and discussed the changing role of management accountant. As for budgeting, its complexity and issues have been known for ages. Different methods such as the zero-base budgeting, the balanced scorecard, the activity based budgeting and the beyond budgeting model have been developed so that among other things the information wave related turbulent business environment challenges can be answered. Rolling forecasting tries to do this by creating a flexible budgeting process, in which a defined future period will be forecasted and in which attention is pointed rather to the future than the past. The study aimed at enriching the understanding of <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> by analyzing extensive data, which included seven transcribed and six note interviews, a long period of financial data, unofficial discussions, surveys and other company inside material. Due to the contingency theory, causal relationships and diversities of matters this study strived for describing, illustrating and explaining <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> as a budgeting method and management control system. The research question could be crystallized followingly: "How does <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> function?" In the case company <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> has both changed reporting and information flow within the company as well as caused issues in producing customary services and in creating the new budgeting process. Furthermore, even after years of implementation it can be seen that rolling forecasting's role is unclear and the process itself is suffering from systematic errors. Based on the empirical observations, this research suggests additional parts to the existing accounting change models so that change situations can be handled better. This model emphasizes the balance between quality, speed and costs and also recognizes that change can lead to value destroying acts. The study confirmed also in a versatile manner that different organization levels had different conceptions and perspectives on how <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> functions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a new {{approach}} to accounting textbook budgeting material. The business environment is not stable. Change is continuous, for large and small business alike. A business must act and react to generate shareholder value. The <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> provides the necessary navigational insight. The traditional annual static budget does not. Managing a business, looking inwards and backwards and making decisions to hit the annual budget target no longer serves management in generating shareholder value. In most situations this approach to company management only leads to compromised performance. Leadership may not reach long-term shareholder wealth potential in using the traditional annual budget as a command and control device. Our research shows companies are moving to a <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> as a management navigational tool. Leadership uses the forecast to navigate continuous change in creating shareholder value. This paper demonstrates how to build leadership concepts that go along with the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast,</b> as well as the <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> process itself into the classroom and accounting textbook material.

40|$|The fixed {{annual budget}} {{process can be}} a {{cumbersome}} and static process, often failing to deliver intended benefits. Typically detached from business operations and strategic planning goals, the annual budget suffers from inherent weaknesses caused {{by a lack of}} business intelligence regarding its underlying assumptions. This weakness is well documented in existing literature and there is ample evidence of improved alternatives to static corporate financial planning. One such alternative utilizes business intelligence as an essential component in the annual budget process, along with <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasts</b> as a critical tool. Utilizing business intelligence supported, driver-based <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> can align an organization’s budget process with strategic objectives and can further the operational and financial strength of an organization, as well as maximize shareholder value. In order to fully explore this topic, this article will present a review of the conventional annual budget process {{and the manner in which}} an approach that bases financial forecasts on business intelligence drivers can align operations with strategic objectives and add value to an organization.

40|$|In {{the context}} of dynamic and {{unstable}} business environment companies tend to more flexible performance management system. Being a central element in a performance management framework, forecasting practice becomes a major concern for business organizations. The practitioners claim {{that there is a}} significant gap existing between the development and the application of forecasting activities. In this respect strong bridges are required to connect theory and practice. Through an expert interview method author investigates how forecasting activities contribute to business performance. The main purpose of this research paper is to investigate the problem statement by answering the questions concerning how planning activities have changed {{in the last few years}} and what is the current attitude and commitment to forecasting tool. Furthermore, this study explores how forecasting is integrated in the decision-making process and how it affects business decisions. Finally research investigates whether companies apply a <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast</b> as well as the reasons for and against using a rolling approach are also considered. The main findings of the research show that companies have altered their planning activities to improve forecast effectiveness, to reduce uncertainty and risks, to enable a more flexible resource allocation. Interviewed companies expressed growing interest and commitment to forecasting as an instrument of control. Moreover, results demonstrate that forecasting plays a crucial role for the business organization by facilitating business decisions and providing assumptions for business plans. Also different practices show, the more complex and larger organization is the more scrutinized and granular the forecast process should be. Regarding a <b>rolling</b> <b>forecast,</b> only two interviewed companies use this approach.

40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand how the transformation from annual budgets to <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> could be made smoother and more successful. This will be done by asking top-level managers their thoughts and expectations on the change. Finding out what benefits the managers expect will help in selling the change inside the company. Respectively, knowing what challenges are expected will help in decreasing the resistance towards the change and making the transition smoother. Research methods The study was conducted as a case study. The main method was interviews with top-level managers representing different business areas and different functions. The interviews had two parts: first a semi-structured interview, and after that a short questionnaire. In addition, access was gained to the case company’s internal materials. The theoretical framework used is based on Dannemiller and Jacob’s (1992) change formula. Results Based on the results {{of the study}}, the attitude towards the change among the interviewees is already fairly positive. The main benefits that the interviewees expect the change to bring are a better ability to react to changes in the environment, a continuous dialogue throughout the year, and transparency of information. In addition, even though the amount of work required is similar, <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasting</b> is expected to provide more useful information than annual budgeting, making its cost-benefit ratio better. With <b>rolling</b> <b>forecasts,</b> targets could also be changed more frequently, so that the targets would be on a more motivating level at all times. The two clearly biggest challenges were the confusion of how target setting and performance evaluation should be arranged, and unsuitable software and tools.

40|$|Abstract Accurate demand {{forecasting}} {{is critical}} in the semiconductor industry due to high production costs, long lead times, and high market volatility. To remain competitive, companies strive for accurate forecasts to drive their planning cycles and meet customer demand.

By using an automated resource scaling algorithm, a system implemented using cloud services can fully exploit the benefits of on-demand elasticity. A simple reactive scaling algorithm, resource scaling is triggered after some monitored metric has crossed a threshold, suffers from the fact that cloud computing workloads can varying widely over time and a scalable application needs time to perform the triggered scaling action. Instead, resources can be proactively requested by forecasting future resource demand values based on demand history. Obtaining accurate prediction results is crucial to the efficient operation of an automated resource scaling algorithm.
