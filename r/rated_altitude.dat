25|$|The F-2 {{introduced}} the 15mm Mauser MG 151 cannon with 200 rounds. As the harder-hitting 20mm Mauser MG 151/20 version become available, {{a number of}} F-2s were retrofitted {{with it in the}} field. About 1,230 F-2s were built between October 1940 and August 1941 by AGO, Arado, Erla, Messerschmitt Regensburg and WNF. No tropicalized version was built, although individual F-2s were retrofitted with sand filters in the field. The maximum speed of the F-1 and F-2 was 615km/h (382mph) at <b>rated</b> <b>altitude.</b>|$|E
25|$|The G-14 {{arrived in}} July 1944 at the {{invasion}} front over France. It represented {{an attempt to}} create a standard type, incorporating many changes which had been introduced during production of the G-6, and which led to a plethora of variants, plaguing decentralized mass production. The standardization attempt proved to be a failure, but overall the type offered improved combat performance, as MW 50 power boosting water injection (increasing output to 1,800PS (1,775hp, 1,324kW), the clear-view Erla Haube was now standard installation. Top speed was 568km/h (353mph) at sea level, and 665km/h (413mph) at 5km (16,400ft) altitude. A high-altitude fighter, designated G-14/AS was also produced with the DB 605ASM high-altitude engine. The ASM engine was built with a larger capacity supercharger, and had a higher <b>rated</b> <b>altitude,</b> and correspondingly the top speed of the G-14/AS was 560km/h (348mph) at sea level, and 680km/h (422mph) at 7.5km (24,600ft) altitude.|$|E

Once the trim was satisfactory I would take the Spitfire up in a full-throttle climb at 2,850rpm to the <b>rated</b> <b>altitude</b> of one or both supercharger blowers.

If all appeared satisfactory I would then put her into a dive at full power and 3,000rpm, and trim her to fly hands and feet off at [...] IAS (Indicated Air Speed). Personally, I never cleared a Spitfire unless I had carried out a few aerobatic tests to determine how good or bad she was.|$|E
2500|$|With the Bf 109G, {{a number}} of special {{versions}} were introduced to cope with special mission profiles. Here, long-range fighter-reconnaissance and high-altitude interceptors can be mentioned. The former were capable of carrying two 300L (80US gal) drop tanks, one under each wing; and the latter received pressurized cockpits for pilot comfort and GM-1 nitrous oxide [...] "boost" [...] for high altitudes. The latter system, when engaged, was capable of increasing engine output by [...] above the <b>rated</b> <b>altitude</b> to increase high-altitude performance.|$|E
2500|$|British {{expectations}} {{had been}} set by performance figures established by the unarmed and unarmored XP-39 prototype. The British production contract stated that a maximum speed of [...] +/- 4% was required at <b>rated</b> <b>altitude.</b> In acceptance testing, actual production aircraft {{were found to be}} capable of only 371mph at 14,090ft. To enable the aircraft to make the guarantee speed, a variety of drag-reduction modifications were developed by Bell. The areas of the elevator and rudder were reduced by 14.2% and 25.2% respectively. Modified fillets were installed in the tail area. The canopy glass was faired to its frame with putty. The gun access doors on the wing had been seen to bulge in flight, so they were replaced with thicker aluminum sheet. Similarly, the landing gear doors deflected open by as much as two inches at maximum speed, so a stronger linkage was installed to hold them flush. The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the exit velocity to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed. The machine gun ports were faired over, the antenna mast was removed, a single-piece engine cowling was installed and an exhaust stack fairing was added.|$|E

40|$|The {{low-energy}} {{secondary electron}} flux caused by auroral electron precipitation is examined {{using data from}} the Atmosphere Explorer C satellite. An energetic electron transport algorithm is used to compute the differential electron flux produced by measured primaries. Emissions of N 2 in the 2 P(0, 0) band at 337 nm and the VK(0, 9) band at 335 nm predicted by the model are compared with photometric observation of their combined volume emission <b>rate</b> <b>altitude</b> profile made by the visible airglow experiment. Reasonable correspondence between model and measurement is obtained. Ratios of emissions at 337 nm and 630 nm to the N 2 (+) 1 N(0, 0) band at 428 nm are also studied. It is concluded that the 337 / 428 nm ratio responds to changes in the characteristic energy of primary auroral electrons only insofar as part of the 337 nm brightness is due to N 2 VK(0, 9) emission. The 630 / 428 nm ratio, which is strongly dependent on characteristic energy, also varies significantly with changes in atomic oxygen density...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike the Merlin, the Griffon was {{designed}} {{from the outset}} to use a single-stage supercharger driven by a two-speed, hydraulically operated gearbox; the production versions, the Griffon II, III, IV, and VI series, were designed to give their maximum power at low altitudes and were mainly used by the Fleet Air Arm. The Griffon 60, 70, and 80 series featured two-stage supercharging and achieved their maximum power at low to medium altitudes. The Griffon 101, 121, and 130 series engines, collectively designated Griffon 3 SML, used a two-stage, three-speed supercharger, adding a set of [...] "Low Supercharger (L.S)" [...] gears to the already existing Medium and Full Supercharger (M.S and F.S) gears. Another modification was to increase the diameters of both impellers, thus increasing the <b>rated</b> <b>altitudes</b> at which maximum power could be generated in each gear. While the 101 continued to drive a five-blade propeller, the 121 and 130 series were designed to drive contra-rotating propellers.

40|$|The NASA Ames Research Center CAE Boeing 747300 flight {{simulator}} is used {{primarily for the}} study of human factors in aviation safety. The simulator is constantly upgraded to maintain a configuration match to a specific United Airlines aircraft and maintains the highest level of FAA certification to ensure credibility to the results of research programs. United's 747 - 400 fleet and hence the simulator are transitioning from the older Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) to the state-of-the-art Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). GPWS was an early attempt to reduce or eliminate Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). Basic GPWS alerting modes include: excessive descent rate, excessive terrain closure <b>rate,</b> <b>altitude</b> loss after takeoff, unsafe terrain clearance, excessive deviation below glideslope, advisory callouts and windshear alerting. However, since GPWS uses the radar altimeter which looks straight down, ample warning is not always provided. EGPWS retains all of the basic functions of GPWS but adds the ability to look ahead by comparing the aircraft position to an internal database and provide additional alerting and display capabilities. This paper evaluates three methods of incorporating EGPWS in the simulator and describes the implementation and architecture of the preferred option...|$|R

50|$|The gyro rate {{unit box}} used the {{measured}} target motion, range and height, to accurately determine the true {{direction of movement}} of the target, including its <b>rate</b> of <b>altitude</b> change, and passed this information to the HACS computer, which then generated the gun laying orders and the correct time fuze setting. The HACS computer could not directly use <b>rate</b> of <b>altitude</b> change information, so the GRUB would calculate the target altitude, direction and apparent speed for a short interval of time, equal to the loading cycle of the guns, {{in advance of the}} actual time and feed this to the HACS computer allowing it to generate correct gunlaying and fuze setting orders. The GRUB thus converted the HACS into a tachymetric fire control system. The GRU and the GRUB began to appear on RN ships in 1940. The GRU/GRUB could calculate target speed and direction for targets with a maximum speed of 360 knots, or 6 degrees of target motion per second and was most accurate at shorter ranges where apparent target motion was highest. GRU/GRUB was also used on The Pom-Pom Director, Mark IV, and with the Fuze Keeping Clock.|$|R
