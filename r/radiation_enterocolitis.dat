40|$|Abstract. <b>Radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> is {{a severe}} adverse event that occurs after {{radiotherapy}} for malignant abdominal tumors. In this study, the therapeutic effects of ETS-GS, a novel vitamin E derivative with antioxidative and anti‑inflammatory abilities, {{were examined in}} a rat model of <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> The <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> model was created by irradiation of male rats with a single dose of 10 Gy. ETS-GS was admin-istered subcutaneously (10 mg/kg/day) for five consecutive days from two days prior to irradiation. The animals were sacrificed three days after irradiation; following which, ileal tissue samples were analyzed for macroscopic and histological findings, presence of apoptosis, degree of oxidative stress and inflammation. In the irradiated group, severe erosion was observed in the small intestine in addition to necrosis of the mucosal layer, swelling and invasion of inflammatory cells of the submucosal layer, and shortening of the crypts. In irradiated rats that received ETS-GS, mucosal injury in the small intestine was milder {{compared with that of}} irradiated rats that received no ETS-GS. In addition, ETS-GS decreased apoptosis in the small intestine and reduced the activity of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde, which are markers for inflammation and oxidative stress. ETS‑GS with antioxidant activity has a therapeutic effect on the symptoms of <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> in a rat model...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pelvic {{irradiation}} {{has been}} a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery. Methods: From 1985 to 2009, the records {{of a total of}} 89 patients with chronic <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared. Results: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan–Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of <b>radiation</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> was much higher for the surgical group (p =  0. 031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs. 7; p =  0. 709), serum albumin level (3. 29  g/dL vs. 3. 16  g/dL; p =  0. 095), and body mass index (20. 19 vs. 19. 86; p =  0. 603). Conclusions: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients’ vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups...|$|E
40|$|Although {{radiation}} therapy plays {{important role in}} the treatment of gynecological tumors, it may cause radiation injury as a late effect. Several recent reports show that urokinase such as urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) contributes to the repair of ulcerative lesions of the colon epithelium. We studied <b>radiation</b> induced <b>enterocolitis</b> using rat animal models. Seventy-two female Wistar rats were irradiated by a single fraction dose of 36 Gy at laparotomy. Histological changes and activity of urokinase system were investigated after irradiation. Ulcers were observed in irradiated field in 12 of 19 animals (63 %) even at 60 th week after irradiation. Urokinase expressions were observed in the margins of active ulcer. Urokinase was thought to play important role in exacerbation of ulcer formation. Expression of uPA was also observed in submucosal glands. Ischaemic changes were not observed in irradiated colon despite sclerosing vasculitis. It is suggested that uPA played reciprocal roles in radiation induced enterocolitis: healing and aggravation of ulcer...|$|R
