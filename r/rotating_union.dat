5000|$|A {{rotary union}} is a union {{that allows for}} {{rotation}} of the united parts. It is thus a device that provides a seal between a stationary supply passage (such as pipe or tubing) and a rotating part (such as a drum, cylinder, or spindle) to permit the flow of a fluid into and/or out of the rotating part. Fluids typically used with rotary joints and rotating unions include various heat transfer media and fluid power media such as steam, water, thermal oil, hydraulic fluid, and coolants.A rotary union is {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>rotating</b> <b>union,</b> rotary valve, swivel union, rotorseal,rotary couplings, rotary joint, rotating joints, hydraulic coupling, pneumatic rotary union, through bore rotary union, air rotary union, electrical rotary union, or vacuum rotary union ...|$|E
5000|$|Stokvels are {{invitation}} only clubs {{of twelve}} {{or more people}} serving as <b>rotating</b> credit <b>unions</b> or saving scheme in South Africa where members contribute fixed sums of money to a central fund on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. The name “stokvel” originated from the term “stock fairs”, as the rotating cattle auctions of English settlersin the Eastern Cape during the early 19th century were known.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a small scale beam centrifuge for educational instruction is described. The centrifuge is 1. 0 m in diameter and is capable of rotating a 20 kg payload measuring 160 mm x 125 mm x 80 mm at 100 g. The centrifuge {{is equipped with a}} 4 -way electrical slip ring, dual port hydraulic <b>rotating</b> fluid <b>union,</b> onboard PC and data acquisition, digital camera and real-time wireless data communication/transfer. A pneumatic actuator has been developed for in-flight loading which can deliver a force of up to 2 kN. Details of validation tests and the learning module are also described...|$|R
50|$|Each {{state has}} {{representation}} in {{the institutions of the}} Eurasian Economic Union. Full membership gives the government of a member state one seat in the Supreme Council of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council. All major decisions are taken by consensus, although decisions taken by the Eurasian Commission require a qualified majority vote. Votes in the commission are weighted so that every country has 3 votes. The Presidency of the Supreme Council of the Eurasian Economic <b>Union</b> <b>rotates</b> between each of the member states, allowing each state one year to help direct the agenda of the EEU.|$|R
25|$|Each {{state has}} {{representation}} in {{the institutions of the}} European Union. Full membership gives the government of a member state a seat in the Council of the European Union and European Council. When decisions are not being taken by consensus, votes are weighted so that a country with a greater population has more votes within the Council than a smaller country (though the number of votes in relation to population is weighted disproportionately in favour of smaller member states). The Presidency of the Council of the European <b>Union</b> <b>rotates</b> between each of the member states, allowing each state six months to help direct the agenda of the EU.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to compare the Czech and Belgian Presidency of the European Union, especially the preparation, course and results, including factors which could have affected these two Presidencies. The {{first part of this}} thesis is theoretical and describes the basic institutional system of European <b>Union,</b> <b>rotating</b> presidency system and changes caused by Lisbon Treaty. This part also contains a chapter concerning initial situation of these countries (brief geographic characteristics, political system and position in the European Union). The second part deals directly with the Czech and Belgian Presidency. It mentions their preparation, course, results and assessment to analyse and compare their differences and common features. French written summary and French-Czech glossary are included...|$|R
2500|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the government. Federal legislative power is vested {{in both the}} government and parliament. The preamble of the constitution guarantees an Islamic inspiration in governance, a commitment to human rights, and several specific enumerated rights, democracy, [...] "a common destiny" [...] for all Comorians. Each of the islands (according to Title II of the Constitution) has {{a great amount of}} autonomy in the Union, including having their own constitutions (or Fundamental Law), president, and Parliament. The presidency and Assembly of the Union are distinct from each of the islands' governments. The presidency of the <b>Union</b> <b>rotates</b> between the islands. Mohéli holds the current presidency rotation, and so Ikililou Dhoinine is President of the Union; Grand Comore and Anjouan follow in four-year terms.|$|R
2500|$|The CNT {{is rooted}} in three basic principles: workers' {{self-management}} or autogestion, federalism and mutual aid, and considers that work conflicts must be settled between employers and employees without the action of such intermediaries as official state organisms or professional unionists. This is why the union criticizes union elections and works councils as means of control for managers, preferring workers' assemblies, union sections and direct action. Also, when possible, the CNT avoids taking legal action through the courts. Administrative positions in the <b>union</b> <b>rotate</b> and are unpaid. They prefer linear salary raises to increases that are percentage based, because the former increase equality of salaries. (That is, they prefer that all workers have their pay raised by the same absolute amount rather than the same percentage of their previous wage.) ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} major issues were {{discussed}} in the opening round of talks. One major point of discussion revolved around who would lead any reunited federation. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney was widely expected to retire at the trade union center's August 2009 convention, and Laborer's president Terence O'Sullivan and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka had been discussed as his successors. The nature of the AFL-CIO presidency {{was part of the}} leadership talks, with some unions suggesting that the presidency <b>rotate</b> among member <b>unions</b> while others hoped for a strong and vocal [...] "executive director" [...] position. The two sides agreed that any reunited labor federation should have a stronger voice in national politics as well as have a greater say in helping member unions engage in more new member organizing. The two sides also discussed whether to change the name of the AFL-CIO, or whether to adopt an entirely new organizational structure. Among other issues discussed were: How the AFL-CIO/new organization would encourage new member organizing and at what level (national or local), what a reunited labor movement's political priorities should be, what sort of relationship a reunited labor movement will have with the Democratic and Republican parties, the level of member union dues, and globalization issues. Although one news outlet reported that the 12 unions hoped to settle on a reunification agreement by April 15, 2009, no issues were resolved {{in the first round of}} talks.|$|R
40|$|Almost $ 6 {{billion in}} taxes {{paid by the}} American people have been rather ubiquitously placed {{in the hands of}} a federal subsidy program for investors in low income communities. The subsidy is in the form of a tax credit. The program is {{entitled}} the New Markets Tax Credit (“NMTC”) initiative. Under the program, the tax credit is used to lure investors to provide equity capital into low income areas, urban and/or rural (i. e. a new market for equity funding). According to my companion law review article (Florida Tax Review, Spring, 2007; The Florida Tax Review was ranked 1 st among tax journals in 2005, and 2 nd in 2007) approximately $ 2 billion of those subsidies have been co-opted by investor groups. These groups establish gentrifying projects such as venues for symphony orchestras, upscale hotel-convention center complexes, and high priced condominiums. These problematic projects are designed primarily for the financially well healed who migrate to urban low income areas, transforming low income residents to at-best incidental beneficiaries who are marginalized rather than prioritized by the subsidies. Rather than merely complain about federal government failures in its tax credit program, this article provides a self help model from the private sector - a carefully configured substrata of the African American middle class- to play a greater role in solving the urban crisis. I term that investor group “Ethnivestors”. The model rejects several types of African Americans, and identifies only one with requisite characteristics akin ethnic entrepreneurship of its prior generations and other immigrants. Those groups also faced hostility and exclusion, who nonetheless formed vertically and horizontally hyper-efficient ethnic economies, armed with <b>rotating</b> credit <b>unions</b> and most importantly a trusting nurturing role within their respective small businesses for its otherwise marginalized co-ethnics. It is past time for such a reconfigured African American middle class on its own collective volition to be part of the revitalization of the urban core cities through a revitalization of its own, fostering a reunion of sorts with low income residents of common ethnicity. Part I of this article examines the historical development of ethnic enclaves in the United States, and how ethnic entrepreneurship gave rise to an ethnic enclave economy that can provide a valuable template for a modern day Ethnivestor. I maintain the NMTC target communities are also ethnic enclaves. Part II sets forth the conceptual precepts and then the Ethnivestor model, including various characteristics and investment motivations that make an Ethnivestor well suited for a NMTC transaction. Part III is the application of economic principles to further explore whether the Ethnivestor model may lead to increased utility for the target low-income residents and the Ethnivestor in a NMTC transaction beyond that of investor groups not similarly engaged in social entrepreneurship. Finally, Part IV is the application of the theoretical model to provide concrete illustrations of how the Ethnivestor more efficiently meets the congressional purpose of assisting low income residents without marginalizing them in the process. This discussion emphasizes the importance of small business modeling that incorporates the experiences of other ethnic enclave economies. The NMTC structure and transactional scheme is also explained, followed by a discussion of how the Ethnivestor can seamlessly operate within that structure...|$|R
