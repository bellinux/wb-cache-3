Main hosts are lima beans, <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean,</b> cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, scarlet runner, kudzu vine and common P.vulgaris. Halo blight is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings. The development of the Halo blight is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20-23°C), unlike other common bacterial blights. In warm temperatures (over 24 °C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by Halo blight pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. Halo blight causes small water-soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of common blight. Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe study {{investigates the}} effect of seed {{sprouting}} on minerals, anti nutrients and pasting characteristics of flours produced from some tropical legume seeds. Samples were collected from cowpea (Vigna ungulculata); <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris), and Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and each sample was divided into two portions. A portion was sprouted while the other portion served as the control. The flours from sprouted and non-sprouted seeds were analyzed for the minerals, anti nutritional and pasting properties. The samples were found to differ significantly (p< 0. 05) in the minerals, anti nutritional composition and pasting properties of the flours. Sprouting increased the mineral contents of the flours generally the calcium content of non-sprouted <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>beans</b> (13. 8 mg/ 100 g) increased to 16. 1 mg/ 100 g in the sprouted flour.

The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize purple acid phosphatases from sweet potato tubers and soybean seeds and to establish their relationship with the only well-characterized plant purple acid phosphatase, the FeIII–ZnII-containing <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> enzyme. Metal analysis indicated the presence in the purified sweet potato enzyme of 1. 0 g-atom of iron, 0. 6 – 0. 7 g-atom of manganese, and small amounts of zinc and copper. The soybean enzyme contained 0. 8 – 0. 9 g-atom of iron, 0. 7 – 0. 8 g-atom of zinc per subunit, and small amounts of manganese, copper, and magnesium.

40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{contain a}} variety of {{bioactive}} proteins including lectins, enzyme inhibitors, hydrolytic enzymes and antifungal proteins. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate activities of selected low pH and heat-stable bioactive proteins extracted from different parts of <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> seed, seedling and pod as well as seed and root exudates. Crude <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> seed extracts inhibited growth of Alternaria alternata as well as its protease activity, but not its amylase activity. A protein with inhibitory activity against growth of A. alternata was purified from extracts of the <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons and embryonic axis. This purified bean protein was devoid of chitinase and β- 1, 3 - glucanase activities. Also, it did not inhibit porcine pancreatic α-amylase, bovine trypsin, amylase and protease of A. alternata suggesting that the antifungal activity of the protein is not related to these activities. Proteinaceous extracts of <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons induced melanin and conidia formation in mycelium of A. alternata. A protein responsible for this conidiation inducing effect was shown {{for the first time to}} be a mannose-binding lectin which is also known as PvFRIL (Phaseolus vulgaris fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 -receptor interacting lectin). An unexpected finding was that extracts of the embryonic axis stimulated rather than inhibited porcine α-amylase activity. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L in particular), co-extracted with α-amylase inhibitor from <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> seeds, was implicated as an α-amylase stimulator with the potential of greatly assisting digestion of starch. In cotyledonary extracts, amylase stimulatory activity was masked by amylase inhibitory activity that was inactivated when the extracts were boiled for 10 min. An in-gel non-denaturing electrophoretic method was used to show presence of porcine α-amylase isoinhibitors in extracts of the cotyledons and embryonic axis. All other seedling parts as well as seed and root exudates had amylase stimulatory activity. Another improved non-denaturing electrophoretic method with immobilized azoalbumin was developed for in-gel detection of isoinhibitors of bovine trypsin in seed parts. It eliminates the need for both time-consuming and labourious staining, destaining or renaturation steps used in other methods. Accumulation of most of the selected bioactive proteins during seed development in different seed parts appeared to start at 20 days after flower abscission. The activities of these proteins decreased to lower levels after 11 days of germination. Besides these observed developmental changes, under abiotic (UV-C irradiation) and biotic (seedlings co-cultured with A. alternata) stress, increased activity of some of the selected bioactive proteins were detected. In conclusion, this study has contributed to a better understanding of antifungal activity and the selected bioactive proteins in extracts of <b>red</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|E
