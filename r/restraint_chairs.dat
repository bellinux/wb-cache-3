DOD said this was done to ensure that the detainees could not induce vomiting and void the force-fed formula before digestion began. Detainees claimed that the force-feeding caused extremely painful cramps, and that they restrained for hours, even if they soiled themselves. DOD said their policy authorized restraining the detainees immobile for only 45 minutes following the end of the force-feeding.|$|E

50|$|A <b>restraint</b> <b>chair</b> {{is a type}} of {{physical}} restraint that is used to force an individual to remain seated in one place to prevent injury to themselves.

40|$|Executive Summary The use of {{full-body}} restraint devices is {{a widespread}} practice in Iowa’s county jails. Full-body restraints {{come in the form}} of <b>restraint</b> <b>chairs,</b> boards, and beds, including two such devices manufactured in Iowa. Iowa law, which refers to these as four- and fivepoint restraints, states they are only to be used when an inmate is a threat to self, others, or jail security. However, the Ombudsman found they were also used on inmates who caused minor disruptions or in response to an inmate’s verbal abuse. In some cases, the restraints were used on inmates with known mental illness who were acting out, though no attempts were made to seek medical or mental health reviews for those inmates while restrained, leading to extended use of the restraint device...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{patterns}} {{have been}} studied in 10 adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) adapted to primate <b>restraint</b> <b>chairs</b> for physiological studies. Using an automated computer-monitored liquid diet feeding system, feeding behavior was studied under 8 hour and 24 hour feeding schedules. Calorie/kg intake was significantly reduced with the 8 hour schedule (pp> 0. 10). Meal size was negatively correlated with meal frequency across monkeys, but not within monkeys. Although monkeys ingested 78 % of their voluntary intake during the light hours, {{there was no difference}} in meal size, meal duration, or rate of feeding between light and dark periods. With feeding restricted to 8 hours during the light period, meal size was positively correlated with the length of the interval preceding the meal in 4 of 6 monkeys, and meal size was also positively correlated with length of the postmeal interval in 3 of 6 monkeys. In contrast, 24 hour ad lib fed monkeys showed no relationship between premeal interval and subsequent meal size, but a positive correlation between meal size and postmeal interval in 3 of 4 monkeys. We conclude that feeding schedule or deprivation state may alter the relative roles of "hunger" and "satiety" signals in regulating food intake amounts and patterns...|$|E

40|$|Use {{of monkeys}} in {{research}} has often required {{that they be}} restrained in a <b>chair.</b> However, <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> can elicit an initial neuroendocrine stress response. Also, inactivity associated with restraint can induce muscular atrophy. We proposed that prior habituation of monkeys to <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> would attenuate these neuroendocrine responses without causing substantial muscle wasting. Four rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained and habituated to a <b>restraint</b> <b>chair</b> specifically designed for spaceflight. During the study, monkeys were placed in metabolic cages for 7 days (prerestraint, Phase I), placed in a <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> for 18 days (Phase II), {{and then returned to}} their metabolic cages for 5 days (postrestraint, Phase III). Urine was collected between 0700 - 1100 daily, and measurements of cortisol, creatinine, and electrolyte concentrations were adjusted for hourly excretion rates. Body weights of the monkeys did not change between start of the prerestraint and postrestraint phases (10. 3 +/- 0. 8 vs. 10. 3 +/- 0. 9 kg, respectively). During the 3 phases, mean excretion rate of cortisol did not change (24. 1 +/- 10. 3, 26. 7 +/- 7. 7, and 19. 3 +/- 5. 8 microg/h, respectively). Mean excretion rate of creatinine (37. 3 +/- 7. 5, 37. 5 +/- 12. 2, and 36. 9 +/- 17. 1 mg/h, respectively), Na+ (3. 3 +/- 1. 2, 3. 2 +/- 1. 2, 2. 2 +/- 1. 8 mmol/h, respectively), and K+ (5. 3 +/- 1. 8, 5. 4 +/- 1. 6, and 4. 3 +/- 2. 8 mmol/h, respectively) were also not altered. Lack of an increase in excreted urinary cortisol suggested that prior habituation to <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> attenuated neuroendocrine responses reported previously. Also, the <b>chair</b> <b>restraint</b> method used appeared to allow adequate activity, because the monkeys did not have indices of muscle wasting...|$|R
