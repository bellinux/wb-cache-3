500|$|After Crash Holly won the Hardcore {{championship}} on February 22, 2000, {{the cousins}} began feuding over the title. Holly won the Hardcore championship in a [...] "hardcore" [...] 13-man battle royal at WrestleMania 2000. He lost the title back to Crash {{the following night}} on RAW. He then sporadically challenged for both the Intercontinental and Hardcore championships the following months. Holly then missed several months of <b>ring</b> <b>time</b> due to a legitimately broken arm, suffered in a match with Kurt Angle on June 29, 2000 edition of Smackdown. After his return, later in 2000, another on-screen cousin, Molly Holly was introduced. Holly returned on the November 13, 2000 edition of raw, where Holly, Crash Holly and The Undertaker defeated Edge and Christian, and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag match. At Survivor Series, Holly faced William Regal for the WWF European Championship but lost by DQ. Holly got a rematch at the title at Armageddon but was defeated by Regal. At the 2001 Royal Rumble, Holly competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by The Undertaker. In February, Holly won the Hardcore title three more times, but each time re-lost the title moments later under the [...] "24/7 Hardcore rule." [...] Holly competed in the 2001 King Of The Ring Tournament but lost to Kurt Angle in the first round.|$|E

[...] The show was set to debut on a 77-station network, but 14 of these stations were under contract to NBC, which had the power to exercise options on the most desirable time, in cities where there was limited competition.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the modeling {{and analysis of}} a switching network access node. This {{is an area of}} importance due to forthcoming high-speed ATM backbone networks and the need totransmit data for current and future network applications. The nature of these applications must be considered when designing an access node to a switching network. A traffic arrival process for the network and characteristics of the access node are combined into an access node performance model. This model is implemented using Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Nets (DSPNs) which provides transitions with zero and deterministic <b>ring</b> <b>times,</b> as well as, exponentially distributed <b>ring</b> <b>times,</b> thus allowing the slotted behavior of the ATM interface to be captured in the model...|$|R

40|$|Petri nets {{augmented}} with timing speci cations {{gained a}} wide acceptance {{in the area}} of performance and reliability evaluation of complex systems exhibiting concurrency, synchronization, and con icts. The state space of time-extended Petri nets is mapped onto its basic underlying stochastic process, which can be shown to be Markovian under the assumption of exponentially distributed <b>ring</b> <b>times.</b> The integration of exponentially and non-exponentially distributed timing {{is still one of the}} major problems for the analysis and was rst attacked for continuous time Petri nets at the cost of structural or analytical restrictions. We propose a discrete deterministic and stochastic Petri net (DDSPN) formalism with no imposed structural or analytical restrictions where transitions can re either in zero time or according to arbitrary <b>ring</b> <b>times</b> that can be represented as the time to absorption in a nite absorbing discrete time Markov chain (DTMC). Exponentially distributed <b>ring</b> <b>times</b> are then approximated arbitrarily well by geometric distributions. Deterministic r-ing times are a special case of the geometric distribution. The underlying stochastic process of a DDSPN is then also a DTMC, from which the transient and stationary solution can be obtained by standard techniques. A comprehensive algorithm and some state space reduction techniques for the analysis of DDSPNs are presented comprising the automatic detection of con icts and confusions, which removes a major obstacle for the analysis of discrete time models...|$|R

5000|$|The {{scan rate}} must be slow, {{not only because}} the {{resonance}} peaks are narrow, but also due to the high-inertia of the workpiece. There is a significant time delay, caused by this high workpiece inertia, in the response to vibration.

5000|$|When {{vibration}} is the excitation causing resonance (rather than {{a hammer}} blow as the strike of a bell), {{there is a}} time period between the beginning of vibration excitation, and the moment when full resonant amplitude is reached. During this time the amplitude is building-up or growing (the reverse of decaying), so this phenomenon is called reverse <b>ring</b> <b>time,</b> or RRT. For large metal structures that are commonly stress relieved with vibration, ring or reverse ring times (the time periods are the same, whether the amplitude is growing or decaying), can be 20 - 40 seconds or longer.
