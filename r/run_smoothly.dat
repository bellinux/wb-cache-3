5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{considered}} Operation Hump to be {{the least}} successful operation in which the Australian battalion had participated, and he criticised it as being badly conceived from the start, and mounted with too little intelligence or prior reconnaissance. Indeed, from the initial landing zone being occupied by the Viet Cong, failures in the passage of information, the heavy losses suffered by the US 1/503rd Battalion and the subsequent difficulties with casualty evacuation, the operation had not <b>run</b> <b>smoothly.</b> The Australians were vengeful for their losses and wanted to return to collect their dead; however, with 1 RAR absorbed into other operations the planned battalion attack on Hill 82 never occurred. Regardless, further operations followed in the months afterwards, with 1 RAR subsequently employed on Operation New Life in November and December, and later Operation Crimp in the Ho Bo Woods in January 1966. Operation Hump was Brumfield's last, with an old football injury forcing his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. He was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece.|$|E
5|$|Wells was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Forces Korea, in 1953. Assuming the role on 11 February, {{he led the}} Commonwealth contingent for the next twenty-one months as the Korean War {{was coming to an}} end. Like his predecessors in the position, Wells exercised administrative command only, and had no direct control over battlefield operations. Though its incumbents were considered to have performed well, the role garnered little credit for helping facilitate combat success but was a soft target for criticism when operations did not <b>run</b> <b>smoothly.</b> Wells had been sent to Korea with no instructions regarding the withdrawal of troops and—as armistice talks appeared on the verge of success—he was closely involved in liaison with the heads of Commonwealth governments regarding General Mark Clark's requests for their commitment to retain forces in the theatre for some period following the end of hostilities.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{extinction}} of the religious orders in Portugal (1834), and creation of the Liceu de Angra do Heroísmo (Lyceum of Angra do Heroísmo), the annexes and dependencies in the western wing of the convent were reused for teaching, {{under the guidance of}} Father Jerónimo Emiliano de Andrade. Classes began on October 1851, but there was still a lack of professors and adequate installations to permit the first years classes to <b>run</b> <b>smoothly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{property is}} that even if u has a discontinuity at an initial time t=t0, the temperature becomes smooth as soon as t>t0. For example, if a bar of metal has temperature 0 and another has temperature 100 and they are stuck together end to end, then very quickly the temperature {{at the point of}} connection will become 50 and the graph of the temperature will <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> from 0 to 50.|$|E
25|$|When a tonal {{answer is}} used, it is {{customary}} for the exposition to alternate subjects (S) with answers (A), however, in some fugues this order is occasionally varied: e.g., see the SAAS arrangement of Fugue No. 1 in C Major, BWV 846, from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 by J. S. Bach. A brief codetta is often heard connecting the various {{statements of the}} subject and answer. This allows the music to <b>run</b> <b>smoothly.</b> The codetta, just as {{the other parts of}} the exposition, can be used {{throughout the rest of the}} fugue.|$|E

25|$|A fugue {{begins with}} the {{exposition}} of its subject {{in one of the}} voices alone in the tonic key. After the statement of the subject, a second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed to another key (usually the dominant or subdominant), which is known as the answer. To make the music <b>run</b> <b>smoothly,</b> it may also have to be altered slightly. When the answer is an exact copy of the subject to the new key, with identical intervals to the first statement, it is classified as a real answer; if the intervals are altered to maintain the key it is a tonal answer.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of ethanol}} blends in {{conventional}} gasoline vehicles {{is restricted to}} low mixtures, as ethanol is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine and fuel system. Also, the engine has to be adjusted for a higher compression ratio as compared to a pure gasoline engine {{to take advantage of}} ethanol's higher oxygen content, thus allowing an improvement in fuel efficiency and a reduction of tailpipe emissions. The following table shows the required modifications to gasoline engines to <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> and without degrading any materials. This information is based on the modifications made by the Brazilian automotive industry {{at the beginning of the}} ethanol program in that country in the late 1970s, and reflects the experience of Volkswagen do Brasil.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot. He tried to solve the first problem by buying an engine built by the recently founded Miller company of Turin; the engine wasn't expensive and the Trentine engineer was glad to use an Italian-built piece of technology, because of his irredentist sentiments; however, the four-cylinder W engine proved quite unreliable and was apparently unable to <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> {{for more than a}} few minutes at a time. As far as the second problem was concerned, Caproni decided to have Ugo Tabacchi, a Veronese-born Trentine chaffeur who had recently joined Caproni's team, pilot the maiden flight of his aircraft. Although some licensed pilots (mostly trained on Wright aircraft) were already available in Italy, Caproni couldn't afford to hire any of them.|$|E

25|$|When {{creating}} Bullet Witch, {{the team}} were {{pleased with the}} shift to high-definition graphics, but this and the game's identity as a new intellectual property meant they were taking financial risks. The move to next-generation hardware meant the team could include more destructible environments. They used 64-bit computing at a few points to speed up data exchange and improve visual effects. The game used the NoviceX physics engine. Working with the next-generation hardware was both exhilarating and difficult, as the team wanted to create something new rather than rely on existing code resources. The team wanted players {{to be able to}} navigate large areas with few or no loading screens, but these ambitions were originally muted by the console's limited power, and it was only during the later stages of development that they started resolving the issues. Due to the console's limitations, some potential effects and touches such as breaking glass, bullet marks in surfaces like building walls, and having Alicia's feet adjust to the slope of terrain had to be left out to increase processing power for the large-scale environments. While the team had wanted to achieve 60 frames per second, the team needed to reduce the framerate to 30 per second so all the effects would <b>run</b> <b>smoothly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Josie {{initially}} gets {{herself a}} job as a barmaid at The Queen Victoria public house and she later becomes the receptionist at Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry)'s surgery. However, things do not <b>run</b> <b>smoothly</b> for her in her new post. Josie is a strict perfectionist, she also expects perfection from everyone else and she isn't adverse to telling them so either. Her strict mannerisms only seek to frighten away half the patients. She eventually manages to settle down with a lot of coaching from Dr Fonseca, however, yet more problems arise when she discovers that her employer is homosexual. Josie is a strict Christian and she feels that working for a homosexual conflicts with her religious beliefs. She goes as far as to accuse him of coercing Kim into becoming a lesbian. She continues down a path of self-righteousness, judging everyone by her own, impossibly high standards. After she discovers that her son has become involved with ex-prostitute, Nina Harris (Troy Titus Adams), she cannot condone their friendship and her aloof manner towards Nina infuriates Mick. It takes bigoted remarks by racist Jim Branning (John Bardon) to make Josie realise that she is as prejudiced in her own way as he is, but by then it is too late. Having forgotten to renew her visa, she is threatened with deportation and is forced to return to Jamaica, leaving Kim in Mick's care. She promises Kim she will return when she sorts out her visa. Her last appearance is in February 2000.|$|E
500|$|The RCN was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} escorting supply vessels transporting food and other materials {{needed to keep the}} war going. This convoy duty was critically important as German submarines or U-boats sought to starve Britain into submission by sinking supply ships. The RCN performed about 40 percent of the war's transatlantic Allied escort duty. Desmond Morton argues it was Canada's [...] "most decisive" [...] military contribution. Canada's convoy protection efforts did not always <b>run</b> <b>smoothly,</b> however. In {{the early part of the}} war, the Canadian navy lacked equipment that could detect underwater submarines as well as efficient radar for sighting ones on the surface. To make matters worse, Canada didn't have the long-range aircraft that were the most effective anti-submarine weapons.|$|E

500|$|In 1993 and 1994, Thunder Run {{was cited}} by Amusement Business as the [...] "Most Terrifying Roller Coaster" [...] on a top 10 list.

500|$|Time workers—workers {{who were}} {{paid for the}} time they spent working rather than by how much they {{individually}} produced—also received bonuses based on performance. Factory managers, {{who did not want}} these workers to lose out to their piece-rate colleagues, often manipulated output figures to ensure that they would (on paper) overfulfill their targets and therefore receive their bonuses. Typically, managers were loath to see their employees' wages fall too low, so they frequently kept quotas deliberately low, or offered ways for workers to manipulate their work outputs to achieve a higher bonus. They generally did this to ensure that their factory could <b>run</b> <b>smoothly,</b> rather than out of concern for the workers' personal welfare. The erratic and seemingly arbitrary way that quotas had been set across different industries led to a high level of uncompleted production in industries where it was more difficult to overfulfill production quotas. Managers [...] therefore tried to keep quotas deliberately low to attract workers to their factories to ensure their factories were able to meet their targets.|$|E
