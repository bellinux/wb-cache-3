50|$|Cepola is a genus {{of marine}} {{fish in the}} bandfish family Cepolidae. The name <b>red</b> <b>bandfish</b> is applied to all members of this genus, but {{particularly}} C. macrophthalma, and generally not C. australis, which {{is also known as}} the Australian bandfish.|$|E
50|$|Cepola macrophthalma is a fish of the bandfish family Cepolidae. It {{is found}} in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean from Senegal north to the British Isles. This species is known as the <b>red</b> <b>bandfish,</b> though this name is also given to other members of the genus Cepola.|$|E
5000|$|Cepola haastii is a bandfish of {{the family}} Cepolidae, found on the inner {{continental}} shelf around New Zealand. Its length is between 15 and 25 cm.

5000|$|Cepola pauciradiata is {{a species}} of bandfish in the family Cepolidae. It is found on the Atlantic coast of Africa from Mauritiana to Angola, and {{off the coast of}} the Cape Verde islands. It is found on the ocean bottom at depths from 40 to 180 m. The maximum length {{recorded}} for this species is 70.0 cm. This species is known as the <b>red</b> <b>bandfish,</b> a name given to most of {{the other members of the}} genus Cepola, especially the European species, Cepola macrophthalma.|$|E
40|$|THE DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, TOTAL BIOMASS, SEX RATIO, REPRODUCTION, CONDITION FACTOR, FEEDING, AGE, GROWTH AND MORTALITY OF <b>RED</b> <b>BANDFISH,</b> CEPOLA MACROPHTHALMA (L., 1758), WERE STUDIED USING THE OTOLITHS FROM 1113 FISH AND THE LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF 3351 FISH. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BY A 425 HP PROFESSIONAL TRAWLER, EQUIPPED WITH A 14 MM MESH - SIZE (KNOT - TO - KNOT) AT THE COD END, IN THE EUBOIKOS AND PAGASSITIKOS GULFS (WESTERN AEGEAN SEA, GREECE). SAMPLING TOOK PLACE SEASONALLY DURING SEPTEMBER 1986 - JUNE 1988 OVER A GRID OF 34 STATIONS AT DEPTHS RANGING FROM 22 TO 222 M. THE STUDY AREA WAS SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO REGIONS: REGION I (NORTH OF THE EURIPOS STRAIT: STATIONS 1 TO 24) AND REGION II (SOUTH OF THE EURIPOS STRAIT: STATIONS 25 TO 34). AGE - BASED AND LENGTH - BASED METHODS WERE USED AND COMPARED FOR THE STUDY OF GROWTH AND MORTALITY. TOTAL BIOMASS ESTIMATES WERE DERIVED FROM THE SWEPT AREA METHOD. THE <b>RED</b> <b>BANDFISH</b> COMPRISED NUMERICALLY 1. 4 % OF THE TOTAL FISH CATCH. ITS ABUNDANCE RANGED BETWEEN 0 AND 1362 INDIVIDUALS/HOUR (MEAN = 57. 7 INDIVIDUALS/HOUR, S. D. = 124. 7). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NATURAL LOGARITHM OF THE MEAN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS/HOUR, LN[N/H+ 1], AND DEPTH, D IN M, WAS FOUND TO BE DESCRIBED BY THE FOLLOWING QUADRATIC MODEL: (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} role {{of species}} can vary among populations depending on {{local and regional}} differences in diet. This is particularly true for top predators such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which exhibits a highly varied diet throughout its distribution range. Local dietary assessments are therefore critical to fully understand the role of this species within marine ecosystems, {{as well as its}} interaction with important ecosystem services such as fisheries. Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, <b>red</b> <b>bandfish</b> (Cepola macrophthalma) and European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets. Both approaches provide different insights, e. g. determination of consumed fish biomass for the management of fish stocks (SCA) or identification of important assimilated prey species to the consumer (SIA) ...|$|E
