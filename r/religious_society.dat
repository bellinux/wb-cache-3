5|$|The Daoist <b>religious</b> <b>society</b> of the Five Pecks of Rice was {{initiated}} by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. Zhang {{was raised in}} what is now Jiangsu where he studied Daoist beliefs in immortality. He moved to what is now Sichuan province and claimed to have a revelation where the deified Laozi appointed him as his earthly representative and Celestial Master. The movement spread rapidly, particularly under Zhang's sons, Zhang Heng and Zhang Lu. Instead of money, followers were asked to contribute five pecks of rice to the <b>religious</b> <b>society</b> and banned the worship of 'unclean' gods who accepted sacrificial offerings of meat. Initiated members of the group were called 'libationers', a title associated with village elders who took the first drink at feasts. The laity were told that if they obeyed the rules of the <b>religious</b> <b>society,</b> they would be rewarded with good health. Illness was thus seen as the result of violating religious rules and committing personal sins, which required confession to libationers charged with overseeing the recovery of sinners. They believed that chanting parts of the Daodejing would bring about cures for illnesses. Zhang Daoling's second successor Zhang Lu initiated a rebellion in 184 CE that allowed him to retain complete control over Ba and Hanzhong commanderies (of modern Sichuan and southern Shanxi) for three decades. He even modelled his 'charity houses' after Han postal stations, yet his establishments offered grain and meat to followers. Although Zhang Lu surrendered to Chancellor Cao Cao (155220 CE) in 215 CE, Cao was still wary of his influence over the people, so he granted Zhang and his sons fiefs to placate them.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations have been practised in Royton. The <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends were recorded as holding conventicles in Heyside in {{as early as the}} 1650s. A Baptist meeting place was erected in 1775. Congregational preachers regularly visited Royton, {{but it was not until}} 1854 that a workshop was established in the town. Primitive Methodism was established in Royton in a room in a Royley building, with its first purpose-built church being erected in 1867.|$|E
5|$|King Charles II {{granted the}} land for the Pennsylvania Colony to William Penn on March 4, 1681 as payment for a debt the crown owed his family. Penn wrote the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania before departing for the colony, which called for {{religious}} tolerance towards many groups, including the <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends and local natives. As a proprietary colony, Penn governed Pennsylvania, yet its citizens were still subject to the English crown and laws. Penn's cousin William Markham served as the first colonial deputy governor.|$|E

St Columba's United Reformed Church in Priory Street, originally built for the Presbyterians, dates from 1879. There is one mosque in York and the city also has a UK Islamic Mission Islamic centre.

5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service {{for members of}} a religious organization whose members were forbidden from participating in war of any form. This exemption effectively limited conscientious objector status {{to members of the}} historic peace churches: Mennonites (and other Anabaptist groups such as Hutterites), <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends (Quakers) and Church of the Brethren. The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E

5|$|The Puritans, who {{believed}} the Church of England {{needed to be}} purified and experienced harassment from English authority because of their beliefs, came to Massachusetts {{with the goal of}} establishing an ideal <b>religious</b> <b>society.</b> Unlike the Plymouth colony, the bay colony was founded under a royal charter in 1629. Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay elsewhere in New England. The Massachusetts Bay banished dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams due to religious and political disagreements. In 1636, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there several years later. Religious intolerance continued. Among those who objected to this later in the century were the English Quaker preachers Alice and Thomas Curwen, who were publicly flogged and imprisoned in Boston in 1676.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends, {{better known as the}} Quakers, is at Friends House, No.173 Euston Road. It was built between 1925–7 and holds the society's library dating back to 1673, including George Fox's journal covering the foundation of Pennsylvania. Euston Road School was opened at No.314 in 1934 by William Coldstream, Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers to encourage artwork in an atmosphere different to traditional art schools. The school struggled and closed by the start of World War II. It was demolished in the early 1960s; the cover shot of the Beatles' Twist and Shout EP was taken on its remains after demolition.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{range of}} {{independent}} or public schools. Many of these are for pupils between 11 and 18 years, such as King's College, Taunton and Taunton School. King's School, Bruton, was founded in 1519 and received royal foundation status around 30 years later in the reign of Edward VI. Millfield is the largest co-educational boarding school. There are also preparatory schools for younger children, such as All Hallows, and Hazlegrove Preparatory School. Chilton Cantelo School offers places both to day pupils and boarders aged 7 to 16. Other schools provide education for children {{from the age of}} 3 or 4 years through to 18, such as King Edward's School, Bath, Queen's College, Taunton and Wells Cathedral School {{which is one of the}} five established musical schools for school-age children in Britain. Some of these schools have religious affiliations, such as Monkton Combe School, Prior Park College, Sidcot School which is associated with the <b>Religious</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends, Downside School which is a Roman Catholic public school in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, situated next to the Benedictine Downside Abbey, and Kingswood School, which was founded by John Wesley in 1748 in Kingswood near Bristol, originally for the education of the sons of the itinerant ministers (clergy) of the Methodist Church.|$|E
