50|$|The bimetal bushing, {{which is}} locked into the bore of the chock, {{has a high}} tin Babbitt lining in a steel shell. Loading of the bearing is always vertical, with the load bearing section {{at the top of}} the upper bearing and at the bottom of the lower bearing. The bearing lining is {{undercut}} on the horizontal centerline (the <b>rebore)</b> so that oil entering the bearing is drawn in by the rotation and eccentricity of the journal. Oil is generally supplied to the <b>rebore</b> following the minimum film thickness, then drawn through the unloaded half of the bushing before entering the load zone, where the hydrodynamic oil film and pressure field are formed. The total oil flow is specified to optimize the cooling of the bearing. Oil flow and feed pressure are specified for each individual mill during the design phase and each mill has specific documentation defining these parameters.|$|E

5000|$|During use, the {{cylinder}} {{is subject to}} wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a <b>rebore</b> to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons. The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top compression ring of the piston, which {{can result in a}} detectable ridge. If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top compression ring to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring. For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally [...] "exercised" [...] through their full speed range to develop a tapered wear profile rather than a sharp ridge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} {{perceptions of}} principals in a leadership induction {{program in a}} large urban school district in the southeastern United States. Qualitative research procedures were used to document experiences of principals. Theoretical constructs guiding the study were professional socialization, organizational socialization, and instructional leadership. Every organization has certain procedural induction norms {{that are used to}} define success. Educational institutions are no different in having normative procedures that serve as a guide to leadership development, selection and induction programs. In Southeastern Public School District (SPSD, pseudonym), the selection process of intern principal candidates employs a practice that ranges from internal searches, resumes used to identify and narrow the pool of prospective candidates, referrals, vacancies advertised via news venues, and recruitment in other cities and states. Selection procedures include reference checks and other means of gathering information about the candidate that provide a work related history which includes the candidate’s background education, training, and experience. Structured interviews provide personal information about the candidate such as maturity, commitment, and motivation to become an administrator (Normore, 2004 a; <b>Rebore,</b> 2001). The selection process is designed by the organization to ensure the selection of the best candidate to fill the administrative vacanc...|$|E

40|$|Recruitment is a {{pressing}} issue {{for community colleges}} at this time because many faculty hired during the enrollment boom of the 1960 s are retiring (Higgins, Hawthorn, Cape, & Bell, 1994). Also, as noted by Winter and Kjorlien (2000), {{there is a need}} for experimental studies, such as the one reported here, because there are few empirical investigations about faculty recruitment in the community college literature. Commu-nity college leaders recognize that to deliver high-quality academic programs, colleges must attract capable faculty to carry out the educa-tional mission. It is the faculty who provide the credibility and leadership necessary to build educational programs. The Commission on the Future of Community Colleges (1988) recommended the continual improvement of recruitment practices designed to attract new faculty. Unfortunately, the officials responsible for recruiting and hiring new faculty do not always give staffing the attention it deserves. Gabert (1994) observed: The employment decision is one of the most important any manager makes, and too little attention is focused on it in most commu-nity colleges. Administrators and college governing boards frequently do not place sufficient emphasis on the human resources function. What they fail to realize is that all of their plans for high-quality instruction and student support services will fail unless there are high-quality instructors [...] . and other employees to implement them. (p. 377) Too often, recruitment officials underestimate the difficulty of re-cruiting competent people, and as <b>Rebore</b> (1995) stated, "it is a mistake to assume that the correct mix of people will be available to fill vacancies without making a concerted effort to find the most qualified individuals to fill specific human resource needs " (1995, p. 79). Further, recruitment i...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. More {{than before}} {{there is a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the role of the}} school principal in improving instruction and learning as illustrated by research on school effectiveness (Everard, Morris& Smith, 1990 : 88). However, a striking aspect of efforts made to improve the managerial capabilities of school principals is the neglect of the unique needs for school principals. Therefore, the Education Action Zones team found that there was indeed a high sense of awareness of the need to improve learners' performance in the Grade 12 level, through the induction of principals for effective curriculum management and leadership (Nunn, 2000 : 1) According to Duke (1991 : 271) only four of 45 principals have received formal orientation to their positions in USA. Without formal orientation principals soon begin to discover administration. So the visits by the EAZ team to the schools may contribute in improving them through inducting principals (Nunn, 2000 : 1). The Education Action Zone's intervention strategy has identified that schools have problems that they are unable to analyse. Subsequently the EAZ team was instructed to identify key problem areas that could be attended to in a short period of time through inducting principals (Thembela & Walters, 1997 : 114). Unlike several European countries, such as Sweden - and most North American jurisdictions that require formal managerial preparation for principalship prior to appointment, it is not the case in South Africa (Foster, Smith & Thurlow, 1997 : 32). The lack of appropriate induction mechanisms have had a negative impact on the schooling system as Hart and Welding, (1996 : 309) explain. Education management is both a complex and continuously changing undertaking, for this reason managers cannot be well prepared for the task "once and for all". Changing contexts, changingexpectations and new knowledge about best leadership practices all provide a warrant for considerable investment in the continuing professional development of education managers (Hallinger, 1998 : 201). Professional development through an induction strategy of education managers enables principals to create relationships with the community, the district and their colleagues. However it is an administrative responsibility that is often neglected or loosely organised in many school districts (<b>Rebore,</b> 1991 : 36). The Education Action Zones intervention strategy has identified that social contracts could be drawn up between parents and the school to enhance this relationship (Nunn, 2000 : 5). The industrial and business communities place higher priority on induction, they have recognised for many years the course and relationship of this process to employee retention and job performance whereas in the education department induction is neglected (Thembele & Walters, 1997 : 114). The induction of principals should not be neglected because a school system can recruit, select, assign, reassign and transfer personnel but until these individuals become fully adjusted to the work to be performed, they cannot be expected to give their best effort to obtain the goals of the institution (Castetter; 1990 : 260). To attain goals of the institution the principal must be able to adapt and fit in without abandoning his/her principles (Theron & Bothma, 1990 : 36). In view of the foregoing the Education Action Zone's intervention strategy of inducting principals for curriculum management - and leadership is of utmost importance. The aims of this research are to: explore the nature of the Education Action Zone's induction strategy for principals, examine the perception of principals with regard to Education Action Zone's induction strategy and develop strategies that can be used to induct principals...|$|E
40|$|Universities {{the world}} over are centres for {{academic}} pursuits as well as place where learning is sought at its maximum level. A university library, be it federal or state owned, {{is part of a}} university set up. Accordingly, it seeks to advance the functions of the institution (Kumar, 1987) by generating and transacting information in form of records for teaching, learning, research and for administration in the course of its daily activities (Akporhonor and Iwhiwhu, 2007). In other words, records are created and used in the operation of a university and its library. For a university library to function effectively and carry on with its services, there are usually one form of record or the other. Records are synonymous with human activities and have existed for centuries (Esse, 2000). Records are any recorded information, regardless of form or medium received and maintained by an agency, institution or organization, or individual in pursuance of its legal obligations or in the transaction of business of any kind (Charman, 1990). Thus records are documentary evidence of transaction made or received in pursuance of legal obligations regardless of the physical form or characteristics of the media. They are information identified by the particular functions they perform in support of business, accountability and cultural heritage. They substantiate who did what, where and when. According to Popoola (2000), what actually keeps the civil service going is any modern system of government are recorded information, which are used for planning, decision making and controlling. For any effective planning decision-making and controlling to take place, there must be timely access to records. University libraries are great producers of records, some of the very vital university libraries record include, financial, and personnel records (Asogwa, 2004). Financial records refers to all records in respect of financial matters including budget requests, actual budget allocation, statement of expenditure, shipment receipt and invoices, requisition and purchase orders, receipt of moneys received or expended. Of all the record generated in the university library, personnel records pose one of the greatest challenges. Employee or personnel records may be defined as those that contain initial application forms, results of physical examination, periodic appraisals, transfers and promotion etc. Emmerson (1984) argued that personnel records pose a particular problem because of their bulk, longevity and sensitivity. Professional literature on records management pays little or no attention at all to the subject of the management of personal records. Yet, these records occupy large area in public offices. Most archival institutions are reluctant to accession personnel records in their custody, arguing that these records occupy valuable office space, which cannot be justified (Republic of South Africa, Circular, 1963). Records and archives occupy different ends of a continuum, records become archives after they have been appraised and found worthy of permanent preservation in an institution. Odlyzko (2000) and <b>Rebore</b> (2005) see records management as the management science of controlling the quantity, qualities and costs of records and it encompasses the procedural system operations, space, equipment and staff required to administer the records. In the same vein, Kemoni and Wamukoya (2000) Venne (2001), Efunbayo (2003), Chris (2006), Ijaduola and Sotunde (2006) have posited that proper records management {{go a long way in}} enhancing effective administration of a university. Nonetheless, despite the indispensible value of records and the gargantuan amount of money spent on its creation and maintenance, proper management of records that will lead to economy and efficiency in their creation used and maintenance as well as disposition is seldom considered the top priority of the university system (Popoola, 2003). Week (1986) identified the following component as major component of records maintenance: filing system, retention and disposal and preservation. Accordingly, this study seeks to provide empirical data on how record are managed in federal and state university libraries in south-south zone of Nigeria...|$|E
