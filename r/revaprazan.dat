25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that PPIs have {{revolutionized}} the treatment of GERD, there is still room for improvement in the speed of onset of acid suppression as well as mode of action that is independent of an acidic environment and also better inhibition of the proton pump. Therefore, {{a new class of}} PPIs, potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) or acid pump antagonists (APAs), have been under development the past years and will most likely be the next generation of drugs that suppress gastric activity. These new agents can in a reversible and competitive fashion inhibit the final step in the gastric acid secretion with respect to K+ binding to the parietal cell gastric H+/K+ ATPase. That is, they block the action of the H+/K+ ATPase by binding to or near the site of the K+ channel. Since the binding is competitive and reversible these agents have the potential to achieve faster inhibition of acid secretion and longer duration of action compared to PPIs, resulting in quicker symptom relief and healing. The imidazopyridine-based compound SCH28080 was the prototype of this class, and turned out to be hepatotoxic. Newer agents that are currently in development include CS-526, linaprazan, soraprazan and <b>revaprazan</b> in which the latter have reached clinical trials. Studies remain to determine whether these or other related compounds can become useful. In June 2006, Yuhan obtained approval from the Korean FDA for the use of <b>revaprazan</b> (brand name Revanex) in the treatment of gastritis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Revaprazan</b> (trade name Revanex) is a {{drug that}} reduces gastric acid {{secretion}} which {{is used for the}} treatment of gastritis. It acts as an acid pump antagonist (potassium-competitive acid blocker). <b>Revaprazan</b> is approved for use in Korea, but is not approved in Europe or the United States.|$|E
50|$|PPIs were {{developed}} in the 1980s with omeprazole being launched in 1988. Most of these drugs are benzimidazole derivatives, related to omeprazole, but imidazopyridine derivatives such as tenatoprazole have also been developed. Potassium-competitive inhibitors such as <b>revaprazan</b> reversibly block the potassium-binding site of the proton pump, acting more quickly, but are not available in most countries.|$|E

5000|$|In this way, {{cyanamide}} behaves as a dehydration {{agent and}} thus can induce condensation reactions. Alcohols, thiols, and amines react analogously to give alkylisoureas, [...] "pseudothioureas," [...] and guanidines. The anti-ulcer drug cimetidine is generated using such reactivity. Related reactions exploit the bifunctionality of cyanamide to give heterocycles, and this latter reactivity {{is the basis of}} several pharmaceutical syntheses such as the aminopyrimidine imatinib) and agrichemicals Amitrol and hexazinone. The hair-loss treatment minoxidil and the anthelmintics albendazole, flubendazole, and mebendazole feature 2-aminoimidazole substructures derived from cyanamide. [...] Cyanamide is also used in the synthesis of other pharmaceutical drugs including tirapazamine, etravirine, <b>revaprazan,</b> and dasantafil.|$|E
50|$|Three drug {{categories}} {{have been}} used to inhibit H+/K+ ATPases. H2-receptor antagonists, like cimetidine (Tagamet), inhibit the signaling pathway that leads to activation of the ATPase. This type of inhibitor is effective in treating ulcers but does not prevent them from forming, and patients develop tolerance to them is developed after about one week, leading to a 50% reduction in effect. Proton pump inhibitors were later developed, starting with timoprazole in 1975. PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that inhibit the hydrogen potassium ATPase by binding covalently to active pumps. Current PPIs like omeprazole have a short half-life of 90 minutes. Acid pump antagonists (APAs) or potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) are a third type of inhibitor that blocks acid secretion by binding to the K+ active site. APAs provide faster inhibition than PPIs since they do not require acid activation. <b>Revaprazan</b> was the first APA used clinically in east Asia, and other APAs are being developed since they appear to provide better acid control in clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcid-related {{diseases}} (ARDs), such as peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease, {{represent a}} major health-care concern. Some major milestones {{in our understanding}} of gastric acid secretion and ARD treatment reached during the last 50 years include 1) discovery of histamine H 2 -receptors and development of H 2 -receptor antagonists, 2) identification of H+,K+-ATPase as the parietal cell proton pump and development of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and 3) identification of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as the major cause of peptic ulcers and development of effective eradication regimens. Although PPI treatments have been effective and successful, there are limitations to their efficacy and usage, i. e. short half-life, insufficient acid suppression, slow onset of action, and large variation in efficacy among patients due to CYP 2 C 19 metabolism. Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) inhibit H+,K+-ATPase in a reversible and K+-competitive manner, and exhibit almost complete inhibition of gastric acid secretion from the first dose. Many pharmaceutical companies have tried to develop P-CABs, but most of their clinical development has been discontinued due to safety concerns or a similar efficacy to PPIs. <b>Revaprazan</b> was developed in Korea and was the first P-CAB approved for sale. Vonoprazan, approved in 2014 in Japan, has a completely different chemical structure and higher pKa value compared to other P-CABs, and exhibits rapid onset of action and prolonged control of intragastric acidity. Vonoprazan is an effective treatment for ARDs that is especially effective in healing reflux esophagitis and for H. pylori eradication. P-CABs, such as vonoprazan, promise to further improve the management of ARDs...|$|E
