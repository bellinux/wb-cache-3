5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E

25|$|When the Indian Cricket Team {{toured the}} West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Colin Croft to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team {{declared}} on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management {{decided that they}} would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling.|$|E

25|$|As {{the boycott}} was relaxed (or <b>rather,</b> <b>not</b> as stringently enforced) {{starting}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many companies which previously {{stayed out of the}} Israeli market had entered it, e.g. McDonald's and Nestlé. In 1985, the ban was lifted on Ford, which had been in place since the company had opened an assembly plant in Israel, and Colgate-Palmolive, although five other companies were added to the blacklist. Toyota began selling cars in Israel in 1991, although it claimed that it had never complied with the boycott, arguing that it did not have the resources to sell cars in the country.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some games}} such as Second Life, in-game {{currency}} is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell {{the items on}} the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.|$|E
25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, or <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> as the SACA ringed off the famously long curves, {{much to the}} {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E

500|$|But this wider aim proved {{impossible}} to achieve: {{the government was}} circumspect as rehabilitating the Waffen-SS would have {{opened the door to}} claims by personnel of other SS and Nazi organisations, including SA, SD, Hitler Youth, and others—a prospect the federal government would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> have raised either domestically or internationally.

[...] The band's members were [...] "on the same page" [...] politically, sharing a liberal and progressive outlook. Mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support, but acknowledged [...] "Out of respect for the people who disagree, those discussions tend to stay in-house, just because we'd <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> let people know where the divisions lie, so people can't exploit them for their own purposes."

500|$|Harry and the Potters couple their rough-edged {{music with}} themed lyrics, which define the band {{as much as}} the costumes. The straight-forward but quirky {{presentation}} of adolescent concerns and direness in the simplest of worries gives the songs their easy likeability. They poke fun at awkward situations from the books. For example, in the song [...] "The Human Hosepipe", they sing, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't have brought up Cedric Diggory/ Because I'd <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> talk about your dead ex-boyfriends over coffee." [...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?" [...] and the song [...] "The Godfather." [...] where the gothic or mock-morbid line [...] "Why do I always think that I am going to die?" [...] is sung to an up-beat tune.|$|E
500|$|During {{his trial}} at Coventry Crown Court, Hughes {{was accused of}} driving too fast in wet {{conditions}} and was described as driving [...] "like a madman". He claimed the brakes on his car had locked, though tests showed that the brakes were in perfect working order and had technology installed to prevent the driver from losing control. When asked {{where he had been}} in the 36 hours after leaving the scene of the incident Hughes said that [...] "I would <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> say, really", though later admitted he had travelled 20 miles to Smethwick. Prosecutor Melbourne Inman QC told the court Hughes had fled the scene to dodge a breath test. On 9 August 2004, Hughes was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. Frisby said that the sentence was not long enough. Hughes lodged an appeal against the sentence, but not the conviction. In January 2005, his appeal for his sentence to be reduced was refused.|$|E

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] a fantastic and dramatic song.
