The most effective ways to keep the infestation of C. arvense at a low level were deep mouldboard ploughing {{and the use of}} a double-layer plough.

The aim {{of the current study}} is to assess some physical properties of a Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico (Rhodic Hapludox) that was chiseled after the third harvest in a sugarcane ratoon crop. The study was conducted in a commercial crop area throughout the 2011 / 2012 crop year. A randomized block experimental design was used, with five replications. The treatments consisted of five chiseling operations in sugarcane ratoon crops, namely: T 1 - single-shank <b>ripper</b> with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m; T 2 - single-shank <b>ripper</b> with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; T 3 - two-bar <b>ripper</b> with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 15 m, T 4 - two-bar <b>ripper</b> with <b>chiseling</b> to a depth of 0. 30 m; and T 5 - control group, with no chiseling.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{agricultural}} researchers carefully evaluate approaches to experimental data analysis. Agricultural experiments are typically highly complex, with many types of variables often collected at {{a wide range of}} temporal and spatial scales. Furthermore, research in the developing world is often conducted on-farm where simple and conventional experimental designs are often unsuitable. Recently, a variant of stochastic dominance called stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) has been developed and used to analyse long-term experimental data. Unlike traditional stochastic dominance approaches, SERF uses the concept of certainty equivalents (CEs) to rank a set of risk-efficient alternatives instead of finding a subset of dominated alternatives. This study evaluates the efficacy of the SERF methodology for analysing conventional and conservation tillage systems using 14 years (1990 – 2003) of economic budget data collected from 36 experimental plots at the Iowa State University Northeast Research Station near Nashua, IA, USA. Specifically, the SERF approach is used to examine which of two different tillage systems (<b>chisel</b> <b>plough</b> and no-till) on continuous corn (Zea mays) and corn/soyabean (Glycine max) rotation cropping systems are the most risk-efficient in terms of maximizing economic profitability (gross margin and net return) by crop across a range of risk aversion preferences. In addition to the SERF analysis, we also conduct an economic analysis of the tillage system alternatives using mean-standard deviation and coefficient of variation for ranking purposes. Decision criteria analysis of the economic measures alone provided somewhat contradictive and non-conclusive rankings, e. g. examination of the decision criteria results for gross margin and net return showed that different tillage system alternatives were the highest ranked depending on the criterion and the cropping system (e. g. individual or rotation). SERF analysis results for the tillage systems were also dependent on the cropping system (individual, rotation or whole-farm combined) and economic outcome of interest (gross margin or net return) but only marginally on the level of risk aversion. For the individual cropping systems (continuous corn, rotation corn and rotation soyabean), the no-till tillage and rotation soyabean system was the most preferred and the <b>chisel</b> <b>plough</b> tillage and continuous corn system the least preferred across the entire range of risk aversion for both gross margin and net return. The no-till tillage system was preferred to the <b>chisel</b> <b>plough</b> tillage system when ranking within the continuous corn and the corn-soyabean rotation cropping systems for both gross margin and net return.

Results showed that direct drilling, which had the highest seed yields of winter cereal crops every season, was the unique soil management system that lowered P. aviculare populations because of effective weed emergence reduction. The model accurately described seedling emergence in different tillage systems, although it failed in direct drilling, probably due to very low numbers of emerged seedlings. To better control this weed, direct drilling may be the best tillage option, but if this cannot be implemented, the hydrothermal time model is a practical tool that can describe the relative proportions of emergence and assist in the timing for management operations of P. aviculare in different tillage systems.

In 2001, the tillage systems and fertilization treatments were the same as in the previous year. Buck Yapeyú and Buck Poncho were tested as cultivars. In 2000, during the first stages, biomass production was higher in the Conventional Tillage (CT) treatment than in Chisel (VT). Nevertheless, at maturity, {{no significant differences were found}} in biomass or grain production between the tillage systems. There were significant effects of the fertilization treatments on all growth stages analyzed. In 2001, biomass and grain yield were lower than in the previous year. At anthesis, neither the tillage systems nor the fertilization treatments led to significant differences in biomass production. At maturity, the tillage treatments caused significant effects on biomass production, total N accumulation and yield, while the different fertilization treatments no produced any effects. Biomass production, total N accumulation and yield depended on the NO 3 availability, which was modified by rainfall amount and distribution and sowing date. <b>Chisel</b> <b>plough</b> was an effective tillage system, when N availability and sowing date were suitable. Nevertheless, when both sowing date and N availability were unfavorable, the conventional tillage produced a better response than that of the non-conventional tillage. When response for fertilization treatments was found, this was independent of the moment and dose applied. Cultivar yields did not show significant differences in each considered year...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{choice of}} {{cultivation}} system in arable agriculture exerts {{a strong influence}} not only on soil health and crop productivity {{but also on the}} wider environment. Conservation tillage using non-inversion methods conserves soil carbon, reduces erosion risk and enhances soil quality. In addition, conservation tillage has been shown to sequester more carbon within the soil than inversion tillage, reducing carbon dioxide losses to the atmosphere. Stable, well structured topsoils that develop following long-term conservation tillage lead to more energy efficient systems due to the reduced power requirements for cultivation. Long-term experiments, e. g. more than 20 years, that confirm the impact of conservation tillage over an extended period are not common. Here we evaluate the impact of different tillage methods and winter wheat straw management, either incorporated or removed, on organic matter turnover and soil quality indicators. No-till, <b>chisel</b> and mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> was carried out for 23 years on a silty clay loam soil in South West England that was not considered suitable for non-inversion tillage due to weak soil structure. In order to assess the effect of contrasting cultivation and straw disposal method on soil carbon dynamics, a range of assays were conducted, including water extractable organic carbon, hot water extractable carbohydrate, microbial biomass carbon, activity of β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase enzymes, C sequestration and the natural abundance of 13 C. Our results show that the soil organic carbon concentration in the topsoil was greater under no-till than mouldboard ploughing, while a reverse trend was observed in the lower depths. A 14 - 17 % increase in soil organic carbon was observed in the topsoil for <b>chisel</b> <b>plough</b> and no-till treatments compared to mouldboard ploughing. Water extractable organic carbon was found to constitute only 1 - 7 % of the microbial biomass carbon. Hot water extractable carbohydrate {{was one of the most}} sensitive indicators of soil quality and had a significant a negative correlation with bulk density and positive correlation with soil organic carbon microbial biomass carbon β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase. The choice of cultivation method exerted a major control on microbial and carbon dynamics. No-till and <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughing</b> maintained carbon in the soil surface horizons, which will benefit the stability of this weakly structured soil, but mouldboard ploughing distributed carbon more uniformly throughout the soil profile, particularly when straw was incorporated, hence leading to the retention of more carbon in the soil profile...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} experiment at the Experimental Station for Organic Farming Kleinhohenheim {{should determine}} effects of stubble tillage on weed density and weed communities. The treatments were stubble tillage by a <b>chisel</b> <b>plough</b> (10 cm), a modified skimmer plough (7 cm), a rotary hoe (5 cm) and a control, previous to primary tillage by a mouldboard plough in autumn. The results presented here {{refer to the}} weed density of dicotyledonous-annual plants, monocotyledonous plants and lucerne volunteers in the years 8 and 9 of the experiment, i. e. {{the first two years}} after perennial lucerne grass. There were no significant differences found between the treatments for weeds, volunteers and crop yield of winter wheat and oats. These results confirm and continue the observations of the years 1999 - 2003 in the long run. Stubble tillage had no visible effect on the density of annual weeds in a diverse, 8 -year organic crop rotation with focus on cereals if a plough was used for primary tillage...|$|R
40|$|Changes in porosity, shape, {{size and}} length of pores and {{microstructure}} in a loam soil under different types of tillage were examined. A micromorphological method {{was used to evaluate}} soil structure, characterizing porosity in soil thin sections prepared from undisturbed soil samples by means of electro-optical image analysis (Quantimet 720). Results showed that both total porosity and number of pores in topsoil were not significantly different among the plots under different types of tillage. Below the topsoil (10 – 15 cm) in the plots tilled by a disc harrow porosity decreased substantially making for a massive structure. In the 25 – 30 cm layer porosity was not significantly different in plots ploughed to a depth of 25 cm than in those ploughed to a depth of 50 cm. In the <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughed</b> plots porosity seemed to be more homogeneously distributed along the Ap horizon. Modifications in pore shape, size distribution and length and in microstructure were also observed. Surface crusts formed frequently in ploughed plots...|$|R
40|$|The 20 year {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Southern Illinois (USA) on land similar to that being removed from Conservation Reserve Programme (CRP) to evaluate the effects of conservation tillage systems on maize and soybean yields and for the maintenance and restoration of soil productivity of previously eroded soils.

The No-Till (NT) system had significantly less soil loss from erosion and maintained more SOC than the Mouldboard <b>Plough</b> (MP) and <b>Chisel</b> <b>Plough</b> (CP) tillage systems. The 10 year average maize yields were slightly higher for MP than NT and CP systems {{as a result of a}} significantly higher maize yield in the first year.
