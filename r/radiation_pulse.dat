40|$|Discussed here is {{the optical}} {{radiation}} generated by 280 mm long laboratory discharges {{and its relationship to}} the current flowing in the discharge channel. In an experiment, the optical radiation generated by the discharges was measured at wavelengths 777 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) due to O I(1), and 500 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) due to N II(19), and the broadband optical radiation between the wavelengths 400 to 1100 nm. The shape of the current waveform, which had a rise time of 0. 1 microsecond and a decay time of 5 microsecond, remained the same with increasing peak value. The experiment was conducted with peak current amplitudes in the range of 1 - 4 kA. In order to test the effect of current rise time on the optical radiation, researchers also conducted studies with a current waveform having a 5 microsecond rise time. It was observed that the peak amplitude of the optical <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> at the wavelengths mentioned above is proportional to the peak amplitude of the current flowing through the discharge channel. The rise time of the optical <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> at a given wavelength does not depend significantly on the peak amplitude of the current waveform. The rise time of the optical <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> decreases with decreasing wavelength. A slight increase in the decay time of the optical pulse, at a given wavelength, is observed with increasing peak amplitude of the current waveform. The results show that the rise time of the optical <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> increases with the increasing rise time of the current waveform. The relationship between peak current, peak optical power, and peak electrical power is studied. Also, the relationship between peak current, optical energy (400 - 1100 and 777 nm), and electrical energy is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two experiments, PegI- 41, {{conducted}} on the Los Alamos Pegasus I capacitor bank, and PegII- 25, on the Pegasus II bank, consisted of the implosions of 13 mg (nominal), 5 cm radius, 2 cm high thin cylindrical aluminum foils resulting in soft x-ray radiation pulses from the plasma thermalization on axis. The implosions were conducted in direct-drive (no intermediate switching) mode with peak currents of about 4 MA and 5 MA respectively, and implosion times of about 2. 5 {micro}s and 2. 0 {micro}s. A radiation yield of about 250 kJ was measured for PegII- 25. The purpose of these experiments {{was to examine the}} physics of the implosion and relate this physics to the production of the <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> and to provide detailed experimental data which could be compared with 2 -D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. Included in the experimental diagnostic suites were faraday rotation and dB/dt current measurements, a visible framing camera, an x-ray stripline camera, time-dependent spectroscopy, bolometers and XRD`S.

40|$|There are 3 {{errors that}} are {{associated}} with the measurement of nuclear radiations.

The interfacing of the digital processing system to a computer has been achieved through a less complex and cheap interface circuit using discrete integrated circuit (IC) chips. The interface circuit accepted parallel 8 -bit data which were simultaneously processed. Furthermore, the operation of the digital processing section involved only digital addition and subtraction of the parallel 8 -bit data. This approach has removed the need for complex digital operations requiring the use of digital signal processor chips, microprocessors and other complex and expensive devices as in commercial digital pulse processing systems...|$|E

40|$|A simple junior-level electrodynamics {{problem is}} used to {{illustrate}} the interference between a source-free standing plane wave and a wave generated by a pulse in a current sheet. Depending upon the relative phases between the standing wave and the current pulse and also upon the relative magnitudes, we can find quite different patterns of emitted energy and momentum. If the source gives a large <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> so that the source-free plane wave can be neglected, then the radiation spreads out symmetrically {{on either side of}} the current sheet. However, if the radiation sheet gives a pulse with fields comparable to those of the standing wave, then we can find a single <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> moving to the right while the current sheet recoils to the left, or the situation with the directions reversed. The example is a crude illustration of particle-like behavior arising from conventional classical electromagnetic behavior in the presence of source-free radiation.

40|$|Understanding x-ray {{radiation}} damage {{is a crucial}} issue for both medical applications of x rays and x-ray free-electron-laser (XFEL) science aimed at molecular imaging. Decrypting the charge and fragmentation dynamics of nucleobases, the smallest units of a macro-biomolecule, contributes to a bottom-up understanding of the damage via cascades of phenomena following x-ray exposure. We investigate experimentally and by numerical simulations the ultrafast radiation damage induced on a nucleobase analogue (5 -iodouracil) by an ultrashort (10  fs) high-intensity <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> generated by XFEL at SPring- 8 Angstrom Compact free electron Laser (SACLA). The present study elucidates a plausible underlying radiosensitizing mechanism of 5 -iodouracil. This mechanism is independent of the exact composition of 5 -iodouracil and thus relevant to other such radiosensitizers. Furthermore, we found that despite a rapid increase of the net molecular charge {{in the presence of}} iodine, and of the ultrafast release of hydrogen, the other atoms are almost frozen within the 10 -fs duration of the exposure. This validates single-shot molecular imaging as a consistent approach, provided the <b>radiation</b> <b>pulse</b> used is brief enough...|$|E
