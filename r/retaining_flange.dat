40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop tools for {{understanding}} the influence of crystal quality and crystal mounting on harmonic-generation efficiency at high irradiance. Measuring the homogeneity of crystals interferometrically, making detailed physics calculations of conversion efficiency, performing finite- element modeling of mounted crystals, and designing a new optical metrology tool were key elements in obtaining that understanding. For this work, we used the following frequency-tripling scheme: type I second- harmonic generation followed by type II sum-frequency mixing of the residual fundamental and the second harmonic light. The doubler was potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), and the tripler was deuterated KDP (KD*P). With this scheme, near-infrared light (1053 nm) can be frequency tripled (to 351 nm) at high efficiency (theoretically > 90 %) for high irradiance (> 3 GW/cm&sup 2;). Spatial variations in the birefringence of the large crystals studied here (37 to 41 cm square by about 1 cm thick) imply that the ideal phase-matching orientation of the crystal {{with respect to the}} incident laser beam varies across the crystal. We have shown that phase-measuring interferometry can be used to measure these spatial variations. We observed transmitted wavefront differences between orthogonally polarized interferograms of {lambda}/ 50 to {lambda}/ 100, which correspond to index variations of order 10 - 6. On some plates that we measured, the standard deviation of angular errors is 22 - 23 µrad; this corresponds to a 1 % reduction in efficiency. Because these conversion crystals are relatively thin, their surfaces are not flat (deviate by k 2. 5 urn from flat). A crystal is mounted against a precision-machined surface that supports the crystal on four edges. This mounting surface is not flat either (deviates by + 2. 5 µm from flat). A <b>retaining</b> <b>flange</b> presses a compliant element against the crystal. The load thus applied near the edges of the crystal surface holds it in place. We performed detailed finite-element modeling to predict the resulting shape of the mounted crystal. The prediction agreed with measurements of mounted crystals. We computed the physics of the frequency-conversion process to better quantify the effects on efficiency of variation in the crystal� s axis, changes {{in the shape of the}} crystal, and mounting-induced stress. We were able to accurately predict the frequency-conversion performance of 37 -cm square crystals on Beamlet, a one-beam scientific prototype of the NIF laser architecture, using interferometric measurements of the mounted crystals and the model. In a 2 {omega} measurement campaign, the model predicted 64. 9 % conversion efficiency; 64. 1 % was observed. When detuned by 640 µrad, the model and measurement agreement is even better (both were 10. 4 %). Finally, we completed the design and initial testing of a new optical metrology tool to measure the spatial variation of frequency conversion. This system employs a high-power subaperture beam from a commercial laser oscillator and rod amplifier. The beam interrogates the crystal� s aperture by moving the crystal horizontally on a translation stage and translating the laser beam vertically on an optical periscope. Precision alignment is maintained by means of a full-aperture reference mirror, a precision-machined surface on the crystal mount, and autocollimators (the goal for angular errors is 10 µrad). The autocollimators track the mounting angle of the crystal and the direction of the laser beam with respect to the reference mirror. The conversion efficiency can be directly measured by recording l{omega}, 2 {omega}, 3 {omega} energy levels during the scan and by rocking (i. e., tilting) the crystal mount over an angular range...|$|E
50|$|For the Retaining Ring connection, {{a groove}} will be {{machined}} onto the pipe end {{to hold the}} retaining ring. The retaining ring is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to fix the flange. For the assembly, the <b>retaining</b> ring <b>flange</b> has to be put onto the machined pipe end. The retaining ring has to be widened for getting it on the pipe end to snap into the before machined groove. The inside contour of the <b>retaining</b> ring <b>flange</b> will cover the retaining ring from the outside.|$|R
50|$|The special inside contour of the <b>retaining</b> ring <b>flange</b> {{covers the}} <b>retaining</b> ring, which is {{installed}} onto the machined pipe end. A form-closed connection {{results from the}} tightening of the flange, which will be sealed by bonded seal or pipe seal carrier on the face side.|$|R
50|$|The {{general design}} of voice {{prosthesis}} is quite consistent, {{even though there}} are unique characteristics. A voice prosthesis has <b>retaining</b> <b>flanges</b> at each end, the ‘tracheal flange’ and ‘esophageal flange’. Those flanges can vary in size and rigidity, e.g. indwelling prostheses have larger and more rigid flanges for stability and facilitate long-term placement. The flange near the food pipe (esophageal flange) is more rigid than the tracheal flange, near the windpipe. The one-way valve can be molded in one piece with the prosthesis and is often supported by a fluoroplastic valve seat (a colored ring that is tightly secured into the shaft of the prosthesis, adding rigidity and which is radiopaque). All voice prostheses have a safety strap, which is cut off in indwelling devices after the prosthesis is put in place; in non-indwelling devices the strap is not removed and is taped to the neck. A voice prosthesis has a one-way valve near the esophageal flange that enables pulmonary air to pass into the esophagus and pharynx for sound production and prevents content from the food pipe, such as liquids or saliva, from entering the trachea.|$|R
5000|$|Edge cubies {{in their}} normal {{position}} are <b>retained</b> by the <b>flanges</b> of neighboring square pieces. Corner cubies are retained by {{a trio of}} short circular flanges {{at the ends of}} the interior sliding pieces. When a face is rotated, those short <b>flanges</b> temporarily <b>retain</b> edge cubies, particularly when the face is rotated about 1/8 of a turn (roughly 45 degrees). As well, the corner cubies are temporarily retained by the curved flanges on the neighboring square pieces.During a rotation, flanges [...] "change roles" [...] as cubies travel along their circular paths.|$|R
25|$|As a plateway, the Middlebere Plateway {{differed}} from the edge railway that eventually became the norm, in that the <b>flanges</b> <b>retaining</b> the truck wheels on the line were on the rails (plates) {{rather than on the}} wheels. The plates were three feet long, L-shaped and made of cast iron, weighing 40lb. They were supported on stone sleepers weighing 60-70lb; the ends of the plates were held down by nails driven into wooden plugs inserted into holes in the sleepers. The gauge is generally quoted as being about 3 feet 9 inches, although some recent archeological investigations suggest it may have been as narrow as 3 feet 6 inches.|$|R
5000|$|A {{full-floating axle}} shaft does not carry the vehicle's weight; it serves only to {{transmit}} torque from the differential to the wheels. It [...] "floats" [...] inside an assembly {{that carries the}} vehicle's weight. Thus the only stress it must endure is torque (not lateral bending force). Full-floating axle shafts are <b>retained</b> by a <b>flange</b> bolted to the hub, while the hub and bearings are retained on the spindle by a large nut. In contrast, a semi-floating design carries {{the weight of the}} vehicle on the axle shaft itself; there is a single bearing {{at the end of the}} axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through.|$|R
