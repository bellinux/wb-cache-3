30|$|These {{findings}} hold {{despite the}} fact that the most progressive states did on average tend to have larger tax declines than the most regressive states. However, there are also some notable counterexamples. For example, Florida and Nevada suffered among the largest reductions in state tax revenues, both in absolute and percentage terms, despite highly <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>systems.</b> These states were subject to high tax-base volatility at the top, due to very unequal income distributions and high capital gains receipts. Though the lack of an income tax in both of these states insulated them from the direct effects of declines in capital-gains income, this volatility-reducing effect was outweighed by the decline in tourism and construction-related consumption taxes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} optimal nonlinear {{labor income}} taxation {{in an economy}} with union wage setting and endogenous hours of work. The government is assumed to act in accordance with a utilitarian objective function. The main purpose of the paper is to study the determinants of tax progression and, in particular, to relate tax progression to the choice of work hours. We show how the optimal degree of tax progression depends on the incentives underlying the choice of work hours, {{as well as on}} whether or not the government can monitor the wage rate via tax policy. If the wage rate is chosen by the union member with median seniority, in which case the wage rate will be fixed under certain conditions, the marginal tax rate is unambiguously positive and the tax structure unambiguously progressive. If, on the other hand, the union acts according to the utilitarian framework, we can no longer in general rule out <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>systems.</b> We also show that the tax system {{is more likely to be}} progressive if the individual union members freely choose their hours of work conditional on the wage rate, than if the union is able to directly affect the hours of work per employee.

40|$|Several {{countries}} have recently abolished or significantly reduced their taxes on bequests. Bequest taxes, {{on the other}} hand, {{were among the first}} to be introduced when modern systems of taxation were developed at the end of the nineteenth century. We propose an explanation for these facts which is based on a dynamic political economy model linking inequality, voting and redistribution. In an early stage, when voting is restricted and wealth is very unequally distributed, no bequest tax is imposed in a political equilibrium. Next, with democratization, taxation on bequests is introduced and gradu-ally expanded. In a final stage, the dynamics of the economic system induce a reduction of wealth concentration, which is further accelerated by the re-distributive impact of the bequest tax. The resulting political equilibrium will therefore support a reduced incidence, and eventually a phasing out, of the bequest tax. Our theory matches the observed evolution of bequest taxation in modern democracies, but can also explain how countries charac-terized by extreme degrees of inequality developed over time <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> with a low incidence of wealth and bequest taxes. Moreover, the theory offers an explanation for the drastic differences currently observed between the tax systems of modern industrial democracies and those of un-derdeveloped countries, with the latter showing much less reliance on wealth and bequest, and progressive taxation in general. More generally, we con-tribute to the understanding of how the institutions of taxation have evolved in conjunction with economic fundamentals...|$|E

We analyze these issues paying {{special attention to the}} political constraints faced by governments in raising funds to repay the debt. In doing so, we make progress towards understanding the political economy of sovereign defaults. We perform our analysis by introducing in a standard DSGE model with endogenous sovereign default risk, two novel features: (i) in-come and tax heterogeneity across households; and (ii) a restriction that the government can only access the resources needed to repay the debt if a su ¢ cient proportion of the population votes in favor of the proposed scal program.
