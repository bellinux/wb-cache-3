50|$|They {{are often}} {{rectangular}} {{but can also}} be cylindrical. They usually have a screen to show information such as voltage, power, and resistance of the coil. To adjust the settings, the user presses buttons or rotates a dial to turn the power up or down. Some of these devices include additional settings through their menu system such as: atomizer <b>resistance</b> <b>meter,</b> remaining battery voltage, puff counter, and power-off or lock. The power source is the biggest component of an e-cigarette, which is frequently a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Smaller devices contain smaller batteries and are easier to carry but typically require more repeated recharging. Some e-cigarettes use a long lasting rechargeable battery, a non-rechargeable battery or a replaceable battery that is either rechargeable or non-rechargeable for power. Some companies offer portable chargeable cases to recharge e-cigarettes. Nickel-cadmium (NiCad), nickel metal-hydride (NiMh), lithium ion (Li-ion), alkaline and lithium polymer (Li-poly), and lithium manganese (LiMn) batteries {{have been used for}} the e-cigarettes power source.|$|E
50|$|Batteries {{that are}} part of a system, such as {{computer}} batteries, can have their properties checked and logged in operation to assist in determining remaining charge. A real battery can be modeled as an ideal battery with a specified EMF, in series with an internal resistance. As a battery discharges, the EMF may drop or the internal resistance increase; in many cases the EMF remains more or less constant during most of the discharge, with the voltage drop across the internal resistance determining the voltage supplied. Determining the charge remaining in many battery types not connected to a system that monitors battery use is not reliably possible with a voltmeter. In battery types where EMF remains approximately constant during discharge, but resistance increases, voltage across battery terminals is not a good indicator of capacity. A meter such as an equivalent series <b>resistance</b> <b>meter</b> (ESR meter) normally used for measuring the ESR of electrolytic capacitors can be used to evaluate internal resistance. ESR meters fitted with protective diodes cannot be used, a battery will simply destroy the diodes and damage itself. An ESR meter known not to have diode protection will give a reading of internal resistance for a rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery of any size down to the smallest button cells which gives an indication of the state of charge. To use it, measurements on fully charged and fully discharged batteries of the same type can be used to determine resistances associated with those states.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic (EM) {{conductivity}} instruments have {{a response}} that {{is comparable to}} that of <b>resistance</b> <b>meters</b> (conductivity is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a magnetic field underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features. Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than <b>resistance</b> <b>meters</b> to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to <b>resistance</b> <b>meters.</b> Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments. Unlike <b>resistance</b> instruments, conductivity <b>meters</b> respond strongly to metal. This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest. Some EM conductivity instruments are also capable of measuring magnetic susceptibility, a property that is becoming increasingly important in archaeological studies.|$|R

Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see Electrical resistivity tomography). Further applications include the measurement of the electrical resistivity of concrete to determinate the corrosion potential in concrete structures.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{controlling}} robotized laser metal wire deposition on-line by electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>metering</b> is proposed. The concept of measuring the combined {{resistance of the}} wire and the weld pool is introduced and evaluated for automatic control purposes. Droplet formation, detachment of the wire from the weld pool and stubbing {{can be hard to}} avoid during processing due to the sensitive process and short reaction times needed for making on-line adjustments. The implemented system shows a possible route for automatic control of the process wherein such problems can be avoided automatically. The method proves to successfully adjust the distance between the tool and the workpiece through controlling the robot height position, thus increasing stability of the laser metal wire deposition process.

50|$|Linear <b>resistance</b> <b>meters,</b> {{also called}} laminar flow meters, measure very low flows {{at which the}} {{measured}} differential pressure is linearly proportional to the flow and to the fluid viscosity. Such flow is called viscous drag flow or laminar flow, {{as opposed to the}} turbulent flow measured by orifice plates, Venturis and other meters mentioned in this section, and is characterized by Reynolds numbers below 2000. The primary flow element may consist of a single long capillary tube, a bundle of such tubes, or a long porous plug; such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher, more easily measured differentials. These flow meters are particularly sensitive to temperature changes affecting the fluid viscosity and the diameter of the flow element, {{as can be seen in}} the governing Hagen-Poiseuille equation.|$|R

40|$|A lack of {{information}} exists regarding acceptable levels of moisture content for gypsum-based sheathing products and on the consequences of exposure to moisture in terms of mechanical properties {{and the integrity of}} the wall assemblies. A complementary need is the assessment of a method to measure moisture content of these products using hand-held electric <b>resistance</b> <b>meters.</b> Previous work examined the relationship between moisture content and mechanical properties of gypsum sheathing (i. e., gypsum wallboard intended for use as exterior sheathing on buildings). Gypsum wallboard is typically specified to conform to ASTM C 1177 or C 1396 performance criteria, and it was the particular interest of this study to determine whether moisture content affects this performance (and if so, to determine the moisture content at which the product no longer meets the ASTM criteria). Specific properties examined included: • adhesion or delamination of facer material (either glass-fibre mats, treated paper or untreated paper) • ability of the sheathing to resist fastener pull-out • flexural strength of the sheathing, for seismic considerations and as a common index of overall mechanical integrity • water absorption The study also determined whether hand-held electric <b>resistance</b> <b>meters</b> are suitable for measuring moisture content are reasonably accurate, or if some new apparatus or protocol is required. This paper discusses Phase II of this project, which examined the possibility of rehabilitating gypsum sheathing that had been wetted and subsequently dried out. The above mechanical properties were assessed for three subsets of the specimen group: • one subset was tested before wetting to predetermined moisture-content levels; • after wetting to predetermined moisture-content levels, half the remaining samples were tested; and • the remaining samples were oven-dried, and then tested to determine the same mechanical properties The focus of this paper is on whether the re-dried samples regain the original level of mechanical properties that were exhibited by the first set of samples...|$|R
