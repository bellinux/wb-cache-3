Within the scope of this the influence of these episodes on drainage area of the Jenínský brook will be quantified, more specifically sub-drainage area J 2. The thesis describes not only the circle of water in the nature, specification of rain drainage events origin, but also the very factors which influence the water drainage and the loss of nutrients caused by the drainage. Furthermore, the basic nutrients which appear the most often and in the biggest quantities in our waters are described, these being nitrogen and phosphor and last but not least what is described here is the total loss of nutrients in water during rain drainage events. The description of a drainage area itself and a water intake profile J 2 follows. The water intake profile J 2 was the source for processing the results. The results were processed by several computational methods, which were compared {{to each other in the}} end. The loss during 5 extreme rain events was calculated and so was their percentage representation in the total annual losses and the consecutive evaluation of the results...|$|E

40|$|Index words: {{overland}} flow, catchment scale, system identification, ensemble simulations. This study presents {{new techniques}} to identify scale-dependent overland flow models and use these for ensemble-based predictions. The techniques are developed {{on the basis}} of overland flow, <b>rain,</b> <b>discharge,</b> soil, vegetation and terrain observations that were collected over a three year period in two tropical catchments. The merits of the identification technique are its robustness with regard to unknown errors, the ability to adjust model resolution in response to data availability, and to interpret the entities of the identified model structures physically. Compared to a static regression model and a dynamic distributed model the predictive performance of the scale-dependent overland flow models is good, especially when using model ensembles. Further analysis of the scale-dependent models shows that rainfall largely determines overland flow when modelled at coarse resolutions, whereas soil moisture drives overland flow when defined at fine resolutions. Interestingly, the number of model parameters remains constant over the different resolutions. The use of the scale-dependent models for predictive purposes is demonstrated by applying Tikhonov regularization for recursive state as well as parameter estimation...|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{possible}} relationship between seasonal variations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and diatom biomass. In order {{to determine whether a}} relationship exists, the effect of other parameters on these seasonal variations was also studied. This was accomplished to prevent the risk of finding a spurious relationship between SSC and diatom biomass. This approach resulted in a literature study and the analysis of data. The literature study was necessary to provide the theoretical background, the data analysis was used for the quantification of the identified relationships. The literature survey showed that SSC variations do not affect diatom biomass in the Western Scheldt. Turbidity, caused by both SSC and organic matter, is too high throughout the year for diatoms to be active during inundation of the flats. Diatom, which are in fact algae, depend on the availability of light for their growth. The role of diatoms on SSC variations is an indirect one. Diatoms do not influence deposition of sediment, but they do play a role in stabilising fresh deposits. When this occurs on a large scale during a period of time, then suspended particles are constantly removed from the water column. A relation scheme was proposed in which all identified parameters and their relationships were summarised. Among the parameters that {{play a role in the}} seasonal variation of SSC and diatom biomass are wind, <b>rain,</b> <b>discharge</b> and biological activity. The flats play a role through seasonal changes in accretion and erosion of fine grained sediment. The interaction between SSC and diatoms takes place at the flats. Data acquisition and analysis was used to investigate the contribution of the various parameters to SSC and diatom biomass variations. It showed that wind is an important parameter, probably through the influence on hydrodynamic conditions. This was a result of the analysis of both short term, high frequency measurements and long term, low frequency measurements. The performed regression analyses explained only part of the SSC and diatom biomass variations. This indicates that the parameters on which no information was selected play a role. Also the fact that the analyses were performed on the scale of the entire estuary might contribute. Some indications for this assumption were provided in the analysis of spatial variations of SSC, discharge and chlorophyll a. Future research should aim at combining spatial and temporal scales and the use of other types of data and analysis techniques. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian meshless method applied {{successfully}} {{in the field of}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Meshless methods have proven to give good results in problems involving free-surface flows. This technique can deal with complex geometries and flow discontinuities, but the serial implementation of most SPH codes makes almost impossible to face real-engineering problems. During the past years SPH codes have evolved using new powerful hardware like GPUs (Graphic Processing Units). DualSPHysics was developed to take advantage of GPU computing without losing the accuracy and reliability of previous SPH code, SPHysics, implemented in FORTRAN. This step forward opens a whole new range of applications but also presents a lot of new challenges. The aim of this work is to show the research carried out to adapt DualSPHysics to solve new complex engineering applications. The goal of this manuscript is to present the implementations carried out in the code and how DualSPHysics is a tool that can facilitate the design-job in various fields. Three different applications in the fields of coastal and civil engineering are presented in this work. The first one analyses a case of coastal protection. Climate change is forcing to reevaluate old coastal defences and to improve the design of new ones. DualSPHysics is used to study wave propagation and wave-structure interaction. The code is validated with analytical and experimental data showing reliability, accuracy and efficiency. This validation proves that the method is suitable to reproduce free-surface phenomena such as breaking waves, and fluid-structure interaction. The capabilities of DualSPHysics to reproduce wave-structure interaction are shown where wave heights and forces exerted onto objects of the coast are numerically computed. The case of study mimics a realistic promenade including the urban furniture with dimensions and geometries close to the real ones. The second study presents the implementation of moorings for floating structures. Each year more energy devices are placed in the sea to take advantage of unexploited resources like oil & gas, wind farms, WECs (Wave Energy Converters) - Most of these off-shore structures are moored to the sea bed because of the wave conditions. A new set of equations is implemented in DualSPHysics to cover the behaviour of moored floating bodies. Validation is provided for both floating bodies and moored lines showing good agreement with experiments and numerical data. Two different working cases are presented to show the capabilities of the code. The last application is related with civil engineering. The research focuses on how roads can experience runoff problems due to the intense <b>rain</b> <b>discharge</b> associated to severe storms. Two advanced tools are combined to analyse runoff phenomena in real terrains. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) photogrammetry is used to obtain the geometry of the case and DualSPHysics model is applied to compute the trajectory of the water interacting with the complex geometry. The effectiveness of protective measures to palliate flood effects is also analysed. The amount of water arriving to the road is measured for different scenarios. The performance of the protective measure, a ditch, is observed to decrease when its depth is reduced. Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad | Ref. BIA 2012 - 38676 -C 03 - 0...|$|E

Metal concentrations measured within the Seine SS during rain events, allowed us to establish that the observable immediate impact of Clichy overflows is only 5 % of what it could be. The general principle demonstrated through this work is that most SS originating from CSO's rapidly settle once they reach the river. These polluted particles greatly contribute to the SS chronic pollution downstream Paris during dry weather, through a slow resuspension mechanism of the deposited sediments...|$|R
40|$|La {{production}} en ascospores d’apothécies de Sclerotinia trifoliorum est évaluée quotidiennement au laboratoire sous diverses conditions. Elle dépend de l’âge et du diamètre des apothécies. Elle est maximale pour des apothécies de 7 à 12 j. La sporulation moyenne, durant leur vie entière, d’apothécies de 4 à 5 mm de diamètre est de 1, 4 x 106 ascospores. La température optimale est de 15 °C, les apothécies demeurant alors sporulantes pendant 18 à 20 j. À 5 °C et 10 °C, la sporulation est plus faible, mais les apothécies demeurent fonctionnelles plus d’un mois. À 25 °C, elles meurent en quelques jours. La sporulation est meilleure à la lumière qu’à l’obscurité. Des apothécies séparées de leurs sclérotes et mises en conditions d’HR satisfaisantes conservent un fonctionnement normal. Soumises au climat naturel, les apothécies projettent leurs ascospores de fin octobre à début décembre, comme l’indiquent des piégeages réalisés avec un capteur par aspiration. La sporulation est la plus forte par temps doux et très humide. Elle est faible en conditions anticycloniques. La projection des ascospores est presque nulle la nuit. Elle débute vers 10 h, est maximale vers 15 - 16 h et cesse vers 19 h. Outre leur intérêt pour une meilleure production d’ascospores utilisables en contaminations artificielles, ces observations précisent les facteurs agissant sur le développement de la sclérotiniose des légumineuses fourragères. Sclerotia of Sclerotinia trifoliorum {{produced in}} the laboratory were placed under favourable conditions for capogenesis at varying temperatures in the light or in the dark. Ascospores discharged by apothecia were counted {{on a daily basis}} throughout the life cycle of the apothecia, ie 18 - 20 d at 15 °C. The quantity of spores collected depended on the diameter and age of the apothecia. The greatest discharge was generally when apothecia were 7 - 12 d old (fig 1). The mean number of ascospores collected from apothecia over the entire life cycle was 1. 4 x 106 from apothecia 4 - 5 mm in diameter and 4. 7 x 106 for apothecia 7 mm in diameter. Temperature directly affected sporulation. Spore discharge was abundant at 25 °C, but lasted only a few hours and the apothecia died within a few days. At 5 - 10 °C discharge was weak, but lasted over 1 month. At 20 and in particular at 15 °C, discharge was optimal, with sporulation continuing for a mean of 3 weeks (fig 2). Light was more conducive to sporulation than dark. Apothecia that had become detached from their stipes maintained normal sporulation and responded to temperature {{in the same way as}} apothecia attached to sclerotia. However, they survived for a somewhat shorter period (fig 3). Sclerotia {{produced in the}} laboratory then subjected to natural climatic conditions in the soil from the beginning of September began to produce apothecia in mid-October. Ascospores that were discharged were collected with a vacuum spore trap (fig 4). In 1987 and 1988, ascospore discharge was studied from the end of October to the beginning of December, ie the period during which the apothecia remained alive. During that time constantly wet soil resulted in normal functioning of the apothecia. Spore discharge was maximal when the weather was mild (10 - 15 °C) and very humid (ie, fog, drizzle or <b>rain).</b> <b>Discharge</b> was slight under anticyclonic conditions when the nights were cold and afternoons sunny. Slight frost did not inhibit further sporulation once conditions became favourable again (fig 5). Ascospore discharge was almost non-existent at night, especially when temperatures were low. Discharge usually began about 10. 00 h, was maximum between 15. 00 and 16. 00 h and ceased at about 19. 00 h (table I and fig 6). This periodicity was related to temperature. The present study has resulted in an enhanced yield of ascospores from apothecia produced in the laboratory for artificial inoculation of red clover in screening for resistance. It has also better defined some important epidemiological factors affecting crown rot of forage legumes...|$|E

It is also available at: [URL] management of storm water is of paramount importance in urban development, and drainage design is usually governed by planning constraints.

The hydrochemistry of manganese and iron in the supply chain infrastructure was strongly positively correlated with ammonia, and aluminium correlated with nitrate concentrations.

40|$|In urban areas, when heavy <b>rains</b> occur, the <b>discharge</b> {{capacity}} of sewers is usually unable {{to transport the}} effective rainfall reaching the streets. When the runoff flow rate exceeds the {{capacity of}} the storm sewer system, the excess flow is conveyed through the street network as overland flow. A dual model is proposed for modeling the system as a double network, formed by an upper network of open channels (street gutters) and a lower network of closed conduits (sewer pipes). What is new in this model is its capacity {{to take into account the}} hydrodynamic relationship between the flows in the upper and lower networks. The model is applied to computing the response of a real monitored basin; the historical flow rates measured during a first rainfall event are used to calibrate the model, which is then validated using the simulation of two other measured events...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a site-specific flash-flood forecasting system for the Western Region, which is capable of flood forecasting using radar precipitation input. This effort is the result of a collaboration between the researchers at the University of Arizona (UA), the hydrometeorologists at the NWS, and the scientists of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS). The hypothesis tested is: “A site-specific model for the Western Region (Western slopes of the Rocky Mountains down to the Pacific Ocean) providing specific hydrologic flash flood forecasts has the potential to improve forecast services of the NWS, leading to reduced loss of life and property. ” I. A Background for the present study: I. A. 1 Flash-flood importance Flash floods are defined as those that occur within six hours of the causative event (i. e., time between <b>rain</b> event and <b>discharge</b> peak) (NWS, 2002).

40|$|International audienceWe analyse {{temporal}} {{variations of}} gravity measured in southern Taiwan since November 2006 at 10 sites using absolute gravimeters and, since November 2008, at 70 sites using a relative gravimeter. We describe and apply methods {{to interpret the}} gravity changes in terms of local hydrological processes and vertical ground motions. The effect of land water is computed from local rainfall data and a model of <b>rain</b> accumulation and <b>discharge</b> in the ground. The effect of the vertical motions of the ground is estimated using time-series of permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) stations and the theoretical gravity to height ratio of − 2 μGal cm− 1. Unexpectedly, Morakot typhoon (2009 August), the strongest typhoon in Taiwan in 50 yr, {{was responsible for the}} highest gravity changes. Morakot triggered numerous large landslides and debris flow deposits. Their thicknesses are estimated from the gravity changes (up to ∼ 280 μGal) along with field observations and satellite images...|$|R
40|$|Contaminant {{concentrations}} in aquatic systems are seldom constant. Erratic inputs such as industrial <b>discharges,</b> <b>rain</b> water flushing, and random spills may cause concentrations to increase rapidly. Environmental processes may contribute through the dispersive actions of tides and currents, adsorptive losses to or release from resuspended sediments, and contaminant losses due to photo-degradation and volatilization. Despite such variability in contaminant concentrations, environmental guidelines {{are derived from}} toxicity test data using continuous exposure, where contaminant concentrations {{at the beginning of}} the exposure are assumed to remain relatively constant over the test duration. Responses of organisms exposed to fluctuating contaminant concentrations may differ from those exposed continuously to contaminants, even for equal contaminant loads. The current knowledge gap regarding the differing responses of organisms to contaminants from continuous and pulsed exposures is impeding decision making processes of both regulatory bodies and discharging industries. We have investigated the effects of continuous and pulsed copper exposure on the growth of the copper-sensitive microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum as an indicator of ecosystem health...|$|R
40|$|Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cities in Vietnam; it is the largest city and the economic centre of the country. Currently HCMC is facing two main problems: frequent flooding of the city and salt intrusion in the Dong Thap Muoi region. Most floods are the result of monthly high tides that hinder the <b>discharge</b> of <b>rain</b> and river <b>discharge</b> water. Floods as a result of solely high river discharge or storm surge are less probable. It is expected that the flood problem will increase in the future due to urban and industrial developments in low lying areas, climate change and land subsidence. A possible solution for, or contribution in solving, these problems is controlling the in- and outflow in the estuary mouth to a feasible extent with a barrier downstream of HCMC. In this study the feasibility of different barrier options is determined and compared using a simple multi criteria analysis, taken the main interest of five stakeholders into account.

40|$|This {{investigation}} aims {{to study}} the propagation of meteorological uncertainty within a cascade modelling approach to flood prediction. The methodology was comprised of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, a distributed rainfall–runoff model and a 2 -D hydrodynamic model. The uncertainty evaluation was carried out at the meteorological and hydrological levels of the model chain, which enabled the investigation of how errors that originated in the rainfall prediction interact at a catchment level and propagate to an estimated inundation area and depth. For this, a hindcast scenario is utilised removing non-behavioural ensemble members at each stage, based on the fit with observed data. At the hydrodynamic level, an uncertainty assessment was not incorporated; instead, the model was setup following guidelines for the best possible representation of the case study. The selected extreme event corresponds to a flood {{that took place in}} the southeast of Mexico during November 2009, for which field data (e. g. <b>rain</b> gauges; <b>discharge)</b> and satellite imagery were available. Uncertainty in the meteorological model was estimated by means of a multi-physics ensemble technique, which is designed to represent errors from our limited knowledge of the processes generating precipitation. In the hydrological model, a multi-response validation was implemented through the definition of six sets of plausible parameters from past flood events. Precipitation fields from the meteorological model were employed as input in a distributed hydrological model, and resulting flood hydrographs were used as forcing conditions in the 2 -D hydrodynamic model. The evolution of skill within the model cascade shows a complex aggregation of errors between models, suggesting that in valley-filling events hydro-meteorological uncertainty has a larger effect on inundation depths than that observed in estimated flood inundation extents...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuously}} running hydrological {{energy balance}} model {{was used to}} analyse the influence of different snow covers on the formation of large floods within glacierized catchments. Model outputs from three different catchments in the Austrian Alps with glacierizations ranging from 30 to 39 % were statistically interpreted to cover {{a wide range of}} possible combinations of areal snow cover distribution and mean snow water equivalent (SWE m) and to define initialisation values for extreme runoff scenarios. These model states consider snow conditions between less than 10 % snow coverage up to almost complete snow coverage, with different snow depths represented by minimum, mean or maximum levels of SWE m. For the utilization of extreme runoffs, these snow cover states were combined with design storm input data. An analysis of the resulting flood hydrographs showed that the maximum runoff values occur with minimal snow cover conditions. With increasing snow coverage and SWE m, flow magnitudes tend to decrease while the relevant precipitation time increases significantly. The influence of topographical catchment features, snow cover and SWE m on the simulated scenario discharge is discussed. The contribution of the different runoff components to the modelled peak flows confirms the assumption that floods in glacierized catchments are a combination of directly <b>discharging</b> <b>rain</b> and ice melt...|$|R

Along with monitoring, corresponding {{action to be taken}} within time limit is also important. To achieve this objective timely information about it is required. In this paper a Zigbee based system is proposed for disaster monitoring and management. Paper talks about wireless monitoring of water levels of group of dams and due to drastic change in water level in any river/lake, when to open the gate of which dam and upto which limit. It is decided with the help of sensory data collected from different nodes, placed over an area. The system comprises three parts, sensor nodes, local control room and centre control room. The monitoring is done with the help of data collected from sensor nodes(comprising water level sensor and <b>rain</b> sensor) and <b>discharge</b> sensors are used to control the opening of gates upto certain limit. All the decisions are taken through centre control room, by giving commands to different local control rooms after observing conditions of all areas.
