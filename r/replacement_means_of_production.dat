40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the new method for {{representing}} Fixed Capital suits better than the standard one to the main object of Sraffa’s price theory, centered in proving the role performed by market prices and distributive variables in the reproduction of economic sys-tem as a whole. The new method leads to market prices, along with distributive variables, fulfilling the main equation that materializes the reproduction of economic system. Whereas the Torrens rule additionally requires for the same purpose that the successive book values of fixed capital stock used to produce each commodity being previously as-certained. The referred reproduction of economic system consists of the following tasks: i) <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> consumed <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for obtaining gross output of the economy; and ii) distribution of net product between different categories of income (profits and wages).

50|$|Collectivist anarchism (also {{known as}} anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary {{doctrine}} that advocates {{the abolition of}} the state and private ownership <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Instead, it envisions the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the collectivization <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.|$|R
50|$|However, {{production}} {{not only}} involves labor, but also certain <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor: tools, materials, {{power plants and}} so on. These <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor—also known as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production—are often the product of another labor process as well. So the labor process inevitably involves these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that already enter the process {{with a certain amount}} of value. Labor also requires other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> resulting from another labor process, LTV treats the magnitude of value <b>of</b> these produced <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> as constant throughout the labor process. Due to the constancy of their value, these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.|$|R

For the collectivization <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production.

50|$|Ownership <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{and control}} over the surplus product {{generated}} by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different economic systems (or modes <b>of</b> <b>production).</b> Capitalism is defined as private ownership {{and control over}} the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> where the surplus product becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. By contrast, socialism is defined as public ownership <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> so that the surplus product accrues to society at large.|$|R

50|$|According to Marxism, {{capitalism}} {{is a system}} based on the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie. This exploitation takes place as follows: the workers, who own no <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> their own, must use the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that are property of others in order to produce, and, consequently, earn their living. Instead <b>of</b> hiring those <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> they themselves get hired by capitalists and work for them, producing goods or services. These goods or services become {{the property of the}} capitalist, who sells them at the market.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{issue in the}} current debates over Marx’s value theory (in the IWGVT, on OPEL, in journal articles, etc.) is precisely what was Marx’s assumption regarding the determination of constant capital, in the case when the labor-time required to produce the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> changes. The most-commonly held interpretation of this issue, and my own interpretation, has been that Marx assumed that constant capital {{is determined by the}} "current reproduction costs " <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> in the sense that if the labor-time required to produce the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> changes anytime between the initial investment of capital and the eventual recovery of this capital through the sale of commodities, then the value of the existing constant capital would also change in order to reflect the current reproduction costs <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> In recent years, the TSS interpretation has presented a different view of the determination of constant capital- or rather at least two different views. John Ernst (1982) and Alan Freeman (1995) have argued that the value of constant capital is determined by the actual historical costs <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> so that the value of constant capital in existence is not affected by a change in the value <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> Andrew Kliman has presented a more complicated interpretation- that the stock of constant capital is determined by the historical costs <b>of</b> the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> but the flow of constant capital i...|$|R
