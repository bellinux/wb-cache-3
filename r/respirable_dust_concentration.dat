40|$|Coal roadway {{driving is}} an {{important}} part of the underground mining system, and very common in Chinese coal mines. However, the high concentration of respirable dust produced in the blasting operation poses a great hazard to miners’ health as well as the underground environment. In this paper, based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, the gas–solid two-phase flow model of particle movement is established to study the respirable dust distribution in blasting driving face. The results show that there is an obvious vortex region in which airflow velocity is lower than that close to the roadway wall and driving face. After blasting, respirable dust in the front of the dust group jet from the driving face cannot be discharged timely, with the result that its concentration is higher than the critical value until it is expelled from the roadway, whereas <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> at the back of the dust group is gradually diluted and exhibits an alternate thin dense phase distribution. Meanwhile, <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> in the breathing zone is relatively higher than that at the top and bottom of roadway. The accuracy of numerical simulation results is verified by field measurements. The research results are helpful for further understanding the evolution of respirable dust distribution after blasting, and are good for providing guidance for efficient controlling of respirable dust and improving the working environment for underground miners...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, total and <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> of wet {{shotcrete}} are {{much lower than}} that of dry shotcrete obviously. Therefore, the application of wet shotcrete technology in mine support will be of great importance to decrease dust and improve supporting intensity. In China, shotcrete support of roadways is in the period from the “dry shotcrete” to “wet shotcrete”. However, the pipe blockage caused by the large resistance often occurs and affects the development of wet shotcrete. Hence, it is imperative to study the rheological behavior and on-way resistance in order to ensure the safety and effectiveness of wet shotcrete pipage.|$|E

The author described {{the application of a}} custom-made tool-mounted local exhaust ventilation (LEV) system attached to a hand-held disk grinder, and by laboratory experiments assessed its effectiveness at dust control. The effectiveness of the LEV for dust control was assessed by determining the <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> around the grinding wheel during metal surface grinding with and without the use of the LEV.

40|$|A {{cooperative}} research effort was established between the Tilden Mining Company LC, the United Steelworkers of America, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to lower <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> levels in an iron ore grinding and concentrator plant. This cooperative effort involved three field studies to evaluate different techniques to lower <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> levels. The {{greatest impact on}} lowering <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> throughout this facility was achieved through ventilation changes. The most significant improvement was realized by changing the ventilation profile throughout the entire facility. The ventilation to this grinding and concentrator facility was provided by approximately 40 roof fans operating in either the intake or exhaust mode. The operation of these fans was significantly changed {{in an attempt to}} pro-vide more of a directional flow pattern throughout the facility, as well as to more closely balance the intake and exhaust air volume. This change accounted for a 31 pct reduction in <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> levels in the primary grinding area of the mill. Another successful modification was to improve the sealing of a reclaim tunnel to the outside and by barricading the access point from the reclaim tunnel to the concentrator plant. This minimized the dust liberated in the conveyor tunnels from traveling through the reclaim tunnel and into the plant.

40|$|Underground {{coal mining}} {{companies}} that operate continuous miner sections often {{apply to the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for approval to take extended cuts to depths of up to 40 ft {{as a means of}} improving productivity. Historically, MSHA has granted approval of this practice if the mine has successfully demonstrated the ability to control the roof, methane, and <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> while extracting these extended cuts. A key component for controlling dust generated by continuous miners in 40 -ft cuts has been the utilization of flooded-bed scrubbers. These fan-powered scrubbers pull dust-laden air from the mining face and remove <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> particles by passing the collected air through a wetted filter panel. The filtered air is then discharged back into the mine atmosphere. To effectively use scrubbers in faces that employ exhaust ventilation, the return ventilation curtain or tubing should be located outby the scrubber discharge on the continuous miner, which results in a setback distance from the face of approximately 40 ft. Over the last several years, MSHA has emphasized that mines demonstrate effective dust control before granting approvals for taking extended cuts with extended curtain setbacks. Each mine operator must successfully demonstrate control of workers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 dust exposures in standard 20 -ft cuts before MSHA considers approving extended cuts.

The overburden removal process is extremely dusty and can cause excessive exposure to <b>respirable</b> <b>dust,</b> especially crystalline silica. After equipment is used for years, many components of the enclosure deteriorate and its effectiveness is greatly reduced. This report discusses a cooperative research study performed on an Ingersoll Rand DM 45 E surface drill, retrofitted with a new Sigma pressurization and filtration system. <b>Respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> were substantially reduced from 0. 64 mg/m 3 during pre-testing to 0. 05 mg/m 3 during post-testing with the new system, representing a 92 % reduction in dust levels in the drill cab. This new system {{appears to be a}} very well-built and sturdy device, well-suited for the mining industry...|$|R
40|$|Eight former {{workers from}} a {{microwave}} popcorn packaging plant {{were reported to}} have severe obstructive lung disease consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans. Investigations into res-piratory exposures at this plant were done during August through November of 2000. Samples were collected to assess airborne particulate concentrations, particle size distributions, endotoxins, oxides of nitrogen, organic gases and vapors, and other analytes. Bulk corn and flavoring components were also analyzed for endotoxins and culturable bacteria and fungi. Workers in the microwave production areas of the plant were exposed to particulates and a range of organic vapors from flavorings. The particles were comprised largely of salt and oil/grease particles. <b>Respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (area plu...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To measure {{particulate}} matter (PM) exposure {{of people involved}} in domestic work (i. e. housework by a resident, not paid work) in urban and rural Nepal, with exposure to biomass smoke in the rural areas, and to examine the performance of photometric devices in collecting these data. This paper details {{the results of these}} measurements and derives calibration factors for two photometric devices compared to gravimetric measures. METHODS: Between April 2006 and February 2007, <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> and PM(2. 5) levels were measured over a 24 -h period in 490 households in a range of urban and rural settings in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal. Sampling was carried out by photometric and gravimetric methods with the co-located gravimetric data used to derive a calibration factor for the photometric devices. RESULTS: The time-weighted average (TWA) (24 h) <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> levels measured by gravimetric sampler ranged from 13 to 2600 microg m(- 3) in the rural settings and 3 to 110 microg m(- 3) in the urban settings. The co-located photometric and gravimetric devices indicate that the SidePak Personal Aerosol Monitor device required a calibration factor of 0. 48 and 0. 51 for rural and urban data, respectively, whereas the DustTrak device required a factor of 0. 31 and 0. 35 for rural and urban settings to correct for the particle size and density of the biomass smoke. The photometric devices provide time history data on PM concentration levels and generally indicate two distinct peaks around a morning and early evening cooking time. CONCLUSIONS: Those involved in domestic work in rural Nepal are exposed to average <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> of approximately 1400 microg m(- 3). Converted to an 8 -h TWA, this equates to more than the current UK limit for <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> (4000 microg m(- 3)). Homemakers, primarily women, spend a large proportion of their lives indoors in these high <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and these exposures are likely to produce respiratory illness. Exposure can be controlled by the use of different fuel types and/or the use of flued stoves...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of three, portable, real-time dust monitors was investigated inside a calm air dust chamber {{for a range}} of industrial dusts and two sizes of aluminium oxide dust. The instru-ments tested were the Split 2 (SKC Ltd), Microdust Pro (Casella Ltd) and DataRam (Thermo Electron Ltd), which sampled either passively or actively by connecting a manufacturer-supplied, size-selective adaptor and an air sampling pump to the inlet of the monitor. Two size-selective adaptors were tested with the Split 2 : the GS- 3 cyclone adaptor and the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) inlet with porous foam inserts. Similarly, two size-selective adaptors were tested with the Microdust Pro: the Higgins–Dewell cyclone adaptor and the con-ical inhalable sampler (CIS) adaptor with porous foam inserts. The DataRam was tested with a GK 2. 05 cyclone adaptor since there was no porous foam adaptor available. The instruments’ responses were compared with the reference dust samplers: Casella Higgins–Dewell cyclone for the respirable fraction and IOM sampler for the inhalable fraction. The response of the dust monitors was found to be linear with <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> when operated either pas-sively or actively using the cyclone size-selective inlets. Their responses were, however, lower when operated actively with the cyclone adaptors compared to the passive operation and lowe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dust {{is one of}} the {{significant}} factors which cause occupational respiratory diseases ‎among workers. ‎Objective: The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the dust concentration, its silica ‎percentage and comparison with standard. ‎Method: This cross-sectional study was carried out at one of iron-stone ores in Southern ‎Khorasan province. Air dust sampling was done using the NIOSH 7500 method and personal ‎sampling pump with the cyclone in 52 stations in different situations of the mine. Total and ‎respirable dust was determined by gravimetrical method. 5 bulk samples were taken for the ‎determination of silica. Bulk samples determined with X-ray method and compared with ‎standard. ‎Result: Highest <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> was measured in the extraction section (10. 6 ‎mg/m 3) and the lowest in the administration (4. 02 mg/m 3). Also, highest total dust concentration ‎was measured in the crusher section (94. 3 ‎‏ ‏mg/m 3) and the lowest in the administration (16. 6 ‎mg/m 3). Average percentage of silica in the mine was 15. 5 %. Either measured respirable and total ‎dust concentration was several times higher than standard concentration. ‎Conclusion: Percentage of total and respirable dust in all parts of the mine according to the silica ‎percentage was higher than the standard limit. Therefore, it’s required to reduce or eliminate ‎workers exposure to silica by using engineering controls, administrative and personal protective ‎measures. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{experimental}} setup {{was developed}} to expose pigs to dust and airborne endotoxins in an environmental chamber, at levels liable to be encountered in pig farm buildings. The following parameters were evaluated in a chamber containing two pigs of 10 kg body-weight: inhalable and respirable dust gravimetric concentrations were measured using area samplers and expressed as mg/m 3. The <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> was also measured using a "TM digital microP respirable dust-measuring instrument', which {{has been shown to}} give similar results to the gravimetric method. The endotoxin concentration was evaluated using the Limulus-assay and expressed as ng/m 3 of air containing the inhalable or respirable dust or as ng/mg of inhalable and respirable dust. Feed flour dust was introduced into the chamber to obtain different concentrations of inhalable and respirable dust ranging from 3. 62 to 76. 66 mg/m 3 and from 0. 24 to 1. 40 mg/m 3, respectively. The endotoxin concentration was modulated by mixing the feed flour with Escherichia coli endotoxins before blowing it into the chamber. The endotoxin concentrations in the air containing inhalable or respirable dust ranged from 28. 9 to 270. 0 ng/m 3 and from 2. 22 to 36. 38 ng/m 3, respectively, depending on the amount of endotoxins added to the dust. Data were also obtained in a piggery. The experimental setup detailed in this paper could be used to study the significance of air contaminants in the development of pig respiratory diseases.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with steady increases in production levels, longwall operators have applied greater quantities of ventilating air and spray water {{in an effort}} to control <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> and/or methane. Air velocities greater than 7. 6 mls (1500 fpm) have been measured on longwall faces. Operators have expressed concern over the potential entrainment of <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> at these high velocities. The greatest likelihood for entraining dust into the high velocity airstream may occur as shields are advanced allowing relatively dry particles to fall from the shield canopy directly into the airstream. Laboratory tests to simulate dust liberation during shield movement were conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH at velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 8. 2 m/s (400 to 1600 fpm). Airborne dust samples were obtained with personal impactors to quantify the size distribution and <b>concentration</b> of the <b>dust</b> entrained at the various air velocities. Statistically significant increases in both total and <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured as test air velocities were increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} in the air of total and of respirable (less than 7 microns equivalent diameter) dust were measured in 142 workrooms of 17 Northern Ireland flax spinning mills using a hexhlet air sampler. Neither the distribution of total nor of <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (mg. / 100 m. 3 air) measured in each of four large workrooms conformed to the normal (or Gaussian) distribution, but it is shown that the logarithms (to the base 10) of these concentrations are normally distributed. In order to make valid statistical comparisons between the dustiness of {{the different types of}} room, mean log. concentrations are therefore used. The mean log. concentrations of total and of <b>respirable</b> <b>dust,</b> and the 95 % confidence limits derived from these, were calculated for each room surveyed. For total and <b>respirable</b> <b>dust</b> the ranges ofmean log. concentrations followed in brackets by the respective antilogs. (mg. / 100 m. 3 air) were as follows...|$|R
