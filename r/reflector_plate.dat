40|$|The use of radar in {{automotive}} {{applications such}} as adaptive cruise control is limited to detecting target vehicles {{directly in front of}} the host vehicle. Vehicles around a curve on a highway and cross traffic vehicles at an intersection cannot be detected by current radar systems. This is primarily due to the limited beam width angle of the radar. The first part of this report examines and evaluates the novel concept of using passive roadside reflectors (PRRs) to increase the utility of the radar system. PRRs on the shoulder and the median of a road are designed that would enable the radar system to pick up cross traffic at highway intersections. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that this concept could be effectively used for cross traffic distance measurement. A limitation of this technology is that cross traffic cannot be detected when the radar equipped vehicle is very close to the intersection due to the lateral offset of the radar from the location of the PRR. However, the system is still valuable for providing future warning of cross traffic at rural intersections. A number of options are explored for the use of PRRs to improve radar measurements on highway curves.

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} {{computational model}} {{was developed to}} predict Top Load and Side Load performance of oval containers. The performance of oval and other non round containers {{is dependent on the}} thickness distribution achieved during blow molding. Simulating blow molding and performance of containers using Virtual PrototypingTM Software and feeding the input for Finite Element Analysis provides an accurate mechanism to predict container performance. A 2402. generic oval container with aspect ratio of 1. 58 was simulated for empty and filled top load performance. A critical part of blow molding oval containers is the ability to achieve a more uniform thickness profile along the circumference of the container at any given height. This is achieved by using preferential heating where the infra-red heating ovens have special slotted <b>reflector</b> <b>plates</b> that allow the preform to be heated differently 90 " apart. For the 2402. oval container with a high aspect ratio it was observed that the use of preferential heating is necessary to achieve uniform thickness distribution in the range of 0. 3 mm- 0. 4 mm. A non preferentially heated preform resulted in container thickness being 0. 4 - 0. 6 mm in a concentrated region adjoining the minor axis. The preferentially heated performs resulted in containers having better empty and filled Top load. The side grip load was the only performance characteristic that was higher for the non preferentially heated containers but that works only in a small region and the non uniformity of thickness makes the container not aesthetically pleasing and would not be acceptable in a production process due to inconsistency in material distribution...|$|R

The influence of the design parameters on the radiation characteristics are assessed using an analytical method and the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method for corner reflector antennas which are electrically small to medium sized antennas is developed in detail. The important subject of the Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) is studied including a study of Mur ABC and Perfectly Matched Layers. It is shown that both methods reduce the reflections from the boundaries sufficient so that the far-field radiation pattern can be computed accurately. An analytical solution to compute the far-field radiation pattern for infinite comer reflector antennas is derived and used to understand the radiation mechanisms. Based on those results, the FDTD method is used to conduct a parametric study on finite sized comer reflector antennas. Experimental antennas have been built and measured in order to verify the computational predictions. Very good agreement is reported The novel idea of a variable beam-width comer reflector antenna is developed and practical designs of such an antenna are presented. The principle is to design the comer reflector antenna such that the beam-width of the antenna can be precisely modified. Data on the gain and beam-width are presented.

40|$|The {{performance}} of an ultrasound reactor chamber {{relies on the}} sound pressure level achieved throughout the system. The active volume of a high frequency ultrasound chamber can {{be determined by the}} sound pressure penetration and distribution provided by the transducers. This work evaluated the sound pressure levels and uniformity achieved in water by selected commercial scale high frequency plate transducers without and with reflector plates. Sound pressure produced by ultrasonic plate transducers vertically operating at frequencies of 400 kHz (120 W) and 2 MHz (128 W) was characterized with hydrophones in a 2 m long chamber and their effective operating distance across the chamber's vertical cross section was determined. The 2 MHz transducer produced the highest pressure amplitude near the transducer surface, with a sharp decline of approximately 40 % of the sound pressure occurring in the range between 55 and 155 mm from the transducer. The placement of a <b>reflector</b> <b>plate</b> 500 mm {{from the surface of the}} transducer was shown to improve the sound pressure uniformity of 2 MHz ultrasound. Ultrasound at 400 kHz was found to penetrate the fluid up to 2 m without significant losses. Furthermore, 400 kHz ultrasound generated a more uniform sound pressure distribution regardless of the presence or absence of a <b>reflector</b> <b>plate.</b> The choice of the transducer distance to the opposite reactor wall therefore depends on the transducer plate frequency selected. Based on pressure measurements in water, large scale 400 kHz reactor designs can consider larger transducer distance to opposite wall and larger active cross-section, and therefore can reach higher volumes than when using 2 MHz transducer plates...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{velocity}} and time-of-flight (TOF) imaging that uses back surface reflections to gage volumetric material quality is highly suited for quantitative characterization of microstructural gradients including those due to pore fraction, density, fiber fraction, and chemical composition variations. However, a weakness of conventional pulse echo ultrasonic {{velocity and}} TOF imaging {{is that the}} image shows the effects of thickness as well as microstructural variations, unless the part is uniformly thick.

We have performed a series of measurements of incident shock wave velocities and overpressures followed by quantification of impulse values (integral of pressure in time domain) for four different end plate configurations (0. 625, 2, 4 inches, and an open end). Shock wave characteristics were monitored by high response rate pressure sensors allocated in six positions along the length of 6 meters long 229 mm square cross section shock tube. Tests were performed at three shock wave intensities, which was controlled by varying the Mylar membrane thickness (0. 02, 0. 04 and 0. 06 inch). The end <b>reflector</b> <b>plate</b> installed at the exit of the shock tube allows precise control over the intensity of reflected waves penetrating into the shock tube. At the optimized distance of the tube to end plate gap the secondary waves were entirely eliminated from the test section, which was confirmed by pressure sensor at T 4 location.

Diffusion of driver gas (helium) inside the shock tube was responsible for velocity increase of reflected shock waves.

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel {{building}} façade integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) collector {{was designed to}} produce both electricity and hot water. Based on the shortcomings of concepts presented in the literature, a simple robust façade integrated collector using flat <b>plate</b> <b>reflectors</b> was developed, modelled and tested both experimentally and theoretically. In developing the BIPVT collector, an optical study comparing façade integrated collectors incorporated with parabolic and flat <b>plate</b> <b>reflectors</b> was carried out using a non-imaging ray tracing analysis and experiments. It concluded that, flat <b>plate</b> <b>reflectors</b> rather than parabolic reflectors for façade applications offer significant potential. It was shown that flat reflectors avoid uneven illumination profiles and hence the need for special photovoltaic absorber materials. Subsequently a generalised expression for the concentration ratio of the proposed collector was determined. Furthermore, the absence of natural convection heat transfer relationships for façade integrated solar concentrators was realized. To address this, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was carried out to deduce a relationship, and this was validated by an experimental test rig. The relationship showed that the heat transfer, expressed in terms on the Nusselt number, {{is strongly dependent on}} the Rayleigh number and the aspect ratio (A/H), and can be expressed in the form Nu=a Rab (A/H) c. Having characterised the heat loss, ways of improving the thermal transport properties of the heat transfer media were examined. For this study multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluids were examined. It was found that these impaired the turbulent forced convection heat transfer coefficient, needed more pumping power compared to water and would not be suitable for use in a BIPVT collector. Finally, a conceptual collector was designed and analysed using a one-dimensional thermal network. This numerical model was coupled with the generalised geometric relationship for the concentration ratio and was validated with an outdoor experiment. Using the model, a number of parameters affecting the collector performance were identified. It was found that when the thermal conductance between the silicon cells and thermal absorber was doubled, the combined efficiency of the collector was improved by 10 %. Increasing the flow rate of the working fluid only marginally improved the efficiency; however, increasing the number of cooling channels across the absorber improved it significantly, due to increasing fin efficiency. It was also found that, the power generated by the collectors was strongly dependant on the reflectance of the reflectors. In summary, the results show the potential opportunity for concentrating BIPVT collectors in façade applications...|$|R
