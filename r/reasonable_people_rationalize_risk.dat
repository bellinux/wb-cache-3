40|$|A methodological flaw {{may have}} led {{one of the central}} literatures in social {{psychology}} to spuriously conclude that <b>people</b> <b>rationalize</b> past choices, by failing to appreciate that those choices reflect people’s preferences. Cognitive dissonance {{is one of the most}} influential theories in social psychology, and its oldest experiential realization is choice-induced dissonance. Since 1956, dissonance theorists have claimed that <b>people</b> <b>rationalize</b> past choices by devaluing rejected alternatives and upgrading chosen ones, an effect known as the spreading of preferences. Here, I show that every study which has tested this suffers from a fundamental methodological flaw. Specifically, these studies (and the free-choice methodology they employ) implicitly assume that before choices are made, a subject’s preferences can be measured perfectly, i. e. with infinite precision, and under-appreciate that a subject’s choices reflect their preferences. Because of this, existing methods will mistakenly identify cognitive dissonance when there is none. This problem survives all controls present in the literature, including control groups, high and low dissonance conditions...|$|R

50|$|Rationalization {{encourages}} irrational or unacceptable behavior, motives, or {{feelings and}} often involves ad hoc hypothesizing. This process ranges from fully conscious (e.g. {{to present an}} external defense against ridicule from others) to mostly unconscious (e.g. to create a block against internal feelings of guilt or shame). <b>People</b> <b>rationalize</b> for various reasons—sometimes when {{we think we know}} ourselves better than we do. Rationalization may differentiate the original deterministic explanation of the behavior or feeling in question.|$|R
40|$|Under which {{circumstances}} is {{the state}} morally allowed to enact and uphold laws {{by the use of}} force against its citizens? This is the problem of legitimacy. In this thesis I develop and defend a theory of legitimacy based on reciprocity. The fundamental idea is that we should aim to establish a state which can be accepted by all <b>reasonable</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Reasonable</b> <b>people</b> are those who abide by the idea of reciprocity. I defend this theory, which I call the reciprocal theory of legitimacy, against rivalling theories, and argue that <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> can hold incompatible ideas about legitimacy. This means that we should not expect any state to be accepted by all <b>reasonable</b> <b>people,</b> and thus to be fully legitimate. The implications of this conclusion have not been fully explored in previous work. Drawing on a distinction proposed by A. John Simmons, I claim that while the state may not be legitimate, it may still be justified, since it is better for existing states to continue to function, rather than to cease to exist. This means that the fact that the state cannot be legitimate does not mean that the state should be abolished. Instead, I argue that we should aim to maximise legitimacy by identifying and removing particularly pressing causes of illegitimacy. In the final chapter, I identify some areas where political action may increase legitimacy: public reason, political participation, welfare, and trust.

40|$|Much of {{contemporary}} mainstream political philosophy operates {{under the assumption}} that if <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> deliberate about matters of basic justice in the right conditions, agreement will emerge. This assumption implies that although <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> will likely disagree about private matters concerning the nature of the good life, they will nonetheless agree about public matters of justice. I reject this assumption, and in this dissertation I argue that <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> are likely to experience deep and persistent disagreements about matters of basic justice. I concede that there are some domains of justice where broad agreement has been achieved in modern democratic societies, namely those concerning the scope and content of civil and political liberties. However, {{when it comes to the}} scope and content of economic liberties, there is little agreement to be had. This is because <b>reasonable</b> <b>people</b> can be committed to radically different premises about matters of basic justice as well as the fact that basic agreed-upon concepts can be interpreted and interconnected in significantly different ways. Even in ideal theory, then, where we restrict ourselves to idealized <b>reasonable</b> <b>people,</b> rational consensus is not a feasible goal on certain core matters of justice. From here, I turn to the realm of non-ideal deliberation about justice and explore the difficult problem of rational political ignorance. I further discuss the effects of the Internet on non-ideal political deliberation, and I look at the ways in which online deliberation can fuel normal cognitive biases and deepen political polarization. I argue that matters of economic justice are characterized by both moral pluralism and epistemic complexity, both of which tend to be downplayed within the deliberative enclaves that proliferate on the Internet. How are we to deal with these problems of political disagreement and polarization? To help answer this question, I turn to the tradition of American pragmatism, and especially the writings of William James, to suggest a re-orientation of political philosophy away from the assumption of rational consensus and toward a more humble, but more constructive, vision in which the philosopher attempts to fashion new ideals that might help overcome currently entrenched disagreements...|$|R

Using unique population and survey data on deductible choice in Dutch universal health insurance, {{we find that}} risk preferences are a dominant factor in decision aking. In fact, our results indicate that risk preferences are both statistically and quantitatively more significant in explaining deductible choice behavior than risk type. This finding contrasts with classical expected utility theory, as it implies risk neutrality over small stakes. More recently developed reference-dependent utility models, however, can <b>rationalize</b> <b>risk</b> aversion over small stakes, on account of loss aversion and narrow framing. consumer preferences; insurance; deductible; decision making; loss aversion...|$|R

Sometimes, they may realize the shortcomings of their views, but they continue defending those views and arguing against their opponents just to save face. Finally, if the opponents argue too strongly, reactance may set in and group members become even more committed to the position.|$|R
