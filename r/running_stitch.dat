500|$|Pattern {{books for}} {{geometric}} embroidery and needlelace {{were published in}} Germany {{as early as the}} 1520s. These featured the stepped, angular patterns characteristic of early blackwork, ultimately deriving from medieval Islamic Egypt. [...] These patterns, seen in the portraits of Hans Holbein the Younger, were worked over counted threads in a double <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> (later called Holbein stitch by English embroiderers).|$|E
2500|$|To create free-motion machine embroidery, the {{embroiderer}} {{runs the}} machine and skillfully moves tightly hooped fabric under the needle to create a design. The [...] "feed dogs" [...] or machine teeth are lowered or covered, and the embroiderer moves the fabric manually. The embroiderer develops the embroidery manually, using the machine's settings for <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> and fancier built-in stitches. In this way, the stitches form an image {{on a piece of}} fabric. An embroiderer can produce a filled-in effect by sewing many parallel rows of straight stitching. [...] A machine's zigzag stitch can create thicker lines within a design or be used to create a border. Many quilters and fabric artists use a process called thread drawing (or thread painting) to create embellishments on their projects or to create textile art.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Running</b> <b>stitches</b> {{are used}} in hand-sewing and {{tailoring}} to sew basic seams, in hand patchwork to assemble pieces, and in quilting to hold the fabric layers and batting or wadding in place. [...] Loosely spaced rows of short <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> are used to support padded satin stitch.|$|R

2500|$|Hand {{quilting}} is {{the process}} of using a needle and thread to sew a <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up. A third option is called [...] "loading the needle" [...] and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The kayak (qayaq sg qayak dual qayat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qayar ~ [...] qay'ar sg qay'ag dual qay'at ~ [...] qass'it pl in Cup'ig; from qai- [...] "surface; top")) {{is small}} narrow closed skin-covered boat and {{was first used}} by the native {{speakers}} of the Eskimo–Aleut languages. The Yup'ik used kayaks for seal hunting, fishing, and general transportation. The Yup'ik people considered a kayak the owner's most prized possession. Traditionally, a kayak was a Yup'ik hunter’s most prized possession and a symbol of manhood. It is fast and maneuverable, seaworthy, light, and strong. Kayak is made of driftwood from the beach, covered with {{the skin of a}} sea mammal, and sewn with sinew from another animal. Yup'ik kayaks are known from the earliest ethnographic reports, but there are currently no surviving full-size Yup'ik kayaks from the pre-contact period. The Yup'ik Norton Sound/Hooper Bay kayaks consisted of 5-6 young seal skins stretched for the covering. The Yup'ik style of seams contains a <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> partially piercing the skin on top and an overlapping stitch on the inside with a grass insert. Caninermiut style Yup'ik kayak used in the Kwigillingok and Kipnuk regions and there are teeth marks in the wood of the circular hatch opening, made by the builders as they bent and curved the driftwood into shape.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and most}} basic stitch found in kanthas is the <b>running</b> <b>stitch.</b> The predominant {{form of this}} stitch is called the phor or kantha stitch. The other forms of stitches used are the Chatai or pattern darning, Kaitya or bending stitch, weave <b>running</b> <b>stitch,</b> darning stitch, Jessore stitch (a variation of darning stitch), threaded <b>running</b> <b>stitch,</b> Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia (Holbein) stitches. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the Kasmiri stitch and the arrowhead stitch. Stitches like the herringbone stitch, satin stitch, backstitch and cross-stitch are occasionally used.|$|E

50|$|The <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> or {{straight}} stitch is {{the basic}} stitch in hand-sewing and embroidery, on which all other forms of sewing are based. The stitch is worked by passing the needle {{in and out of}} the fabric. Running stitches may be of varying length, but typically more thread is visible on the top of the sewing than on the underside. So, a <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> runs through the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Darning {{stitches}} {{are closely}} spaced parallel rows of <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> used to fill or reinforce worn areas of a textile, or as decoration.|$|R

50|$|Holbein or double-running {{stitches}} have {{a second}} row of <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> worked in a reverse direction in between the stitches of the first pass, to make a solid line of stitching.|$|R

50|$|Sashiko {{embroidery}} {{was used}} to strengthen the homespun clothes of olden times. Worn out clothes were pieced together to make new garments by using simple <b>running</b> <b>stitches.</b> These clothes increased their strength with this durable embroidery.|$|R
5000|$|In simple gathering, {{parallel}} rows of <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> are sewn {{along one}} {{edge of the}} fabric to be gathered. The stitching threads are then pulled or [...] "drawn up" [...] so that the fabric forms small folds along the threads.|$|R
50|$|The <b>running</b> <b>stitch</b> kantha {{is truly}} the {{indigenous}} kantha. They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further divided into motif or scenic kanthas.|$|E

5000|$|The lace is {{worked on}} fabric which is {{stretched}} tightly in a frame. The pattern is {{drawn on the}} fabric and the threads which go to-and-fro across the circular motif are either taken through <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> worked along the pattern lines or stitched directly through the fabric. When finished, the motifs are released by either cutting the <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> or cutting away the backing fabric. While single motifs can be worked like this, it is more usual to work the whole item as one piece - the pattern for the complete mat or collar is drawn on the fabric and the wheels are linked together as the radial threads are laid down.|$|R
50|$|Traditional hand smocking {{begins with}} marking smocking dots in a grid {{pattern on the}} wrong side of the fabric and {{gathering}} it with temporary <b>running</b> <b>stitches.</b> These stitches are anchored on each end in a manner that facilitates later removal and are analogous to basting stitches. Then a row of cable stitching stabilizes the top and bottom of the working area.|$|R
5000|$|Holbein stitch {{is usually}} worked on an even-weave fabric where the threads {{can be counted}} to ensure perfect {{regularity}} and is worked in two stages.

2500|$|Underlay: A {{stabilizing}} {{pattern of}} embroidery which, if used, precedes {{the main body}} of satin or fill stitching. It consists of one or a combination of <b>running</b> <b>stitches</b> for centering, edging, paralleling, or zigzagging the design area. [...] A money and time saving technique is to use, instead of a large amount of embroidery thread for underlay, a fancy specialty stitch saver patch material that simulates underlay.|$|R

Traditional embroidery using pattern darning is found in Africa, Japan, Northern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Mexico and Peru.|$|R
