30|$|All {{perfusion}} {{analysis methods}} {{have in common}} that they require “free-of-motion-artefact” data to maintain spatial fidelity. Be it from breathing or patient movement during data acquisition: when tissue contours mismatch from volume to volume and temporal analysis is performed without motion correction, perfusion values might be significantly influenced by non-perfusion-related density changes and no longer reflect vascular physiology alone [30]. In fact, patients were excluded from analysis in several studies to avoid incorrect perfusion results [12, 13]. With exception for assessment of cerebral perfusion, motion correction {{has been identified as}} an important factor to ensure reliable perfusion measurements [15, 16].

30|$|Concerning wagons, the {{question}} is whether development will be incremental or if it is possible to make a system change (see Table 1). An incremental change means successively higher axle loads, wider gauge, higher payload, better and more silent brakes and some electronic equipment. A system change will include electro-pneumatic brakes, disc brakes (from cast brakes) and full electronic control (from pneumatic) of wagons and load, and automatic central couplers (from screw couplers). Automatic couplers are the most critical component, not only to make shunting and marshalling safer and cheaper, but also because this will make it easier to operate longer trains. However, to introduce <b>automatic</b> <b>couples</b> it must be supported by a thorough cost-benefit analysis.|$|R
