40|$|The {{dependence}} of radiation-induced charge neutralization RICN {{has been studied}} in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor MOSFET dosimeters.

The established models for threshold voltage change have been considered and indicate a related nonlinear trend for neutralization cross section N as a function of oxide field.

For this, simple visual cryptography is very in secure. In this current work we have proposed a method where we done the encryption in several level.

40|$|Complex social {{structure}} in eusocial insects can involve worker morphological and behavioural differentiation. Neuroanatomical variation may underscore worker division of labour, but the regulatory mechanisms of size-based task specialization in polymorphic species are unknown. The Australian weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, exhibits worker polyphenism: larger major workers aggressively defend arboreal territories, whereas smaller minors nurse brood. Here, we demonstrate that octopamine (OA) modulates worker size-related aggression in O. smaragdina. We {{found that the}} brains of majors had significantly higher titres of OA than those of minors and that OA was positively and specifically correlated with the frequency of aggressive responses to non-nestmates, {{a key component of}} territorial defence. Pharmacological manipulations that effectively switched OA action in major and minor worker brains <b>reversed</b> <b>levels</b> of aggression characteristic of each worker size class. Results suggest that altering OA action is sufficient to produce differences in aggression characteristic of size-related social roles. Neuromodulators therefore may generate variation in responsiveness to task-related stimuli associated with worker size differentiation and collateral behavioural specializations, a significant component of division of labour in complex social systems. 9 page(s...|$|R
