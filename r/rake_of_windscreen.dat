50|$|There {{was some}} {{variability}} in the height {{and shape of the}} side windows, and the style <b>of</b> <b>windscreen.</b> One common design <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> was square-cornered, tapered in towards the top and curved around to the sides. Another was a two-piece flat windscreen with radiused outer corners. A third design used was a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top.|$|R
50|$|Side Rake {{along with}} back rake {{controls}} the chip flow and partly counteracts {{the resistance of}} the work to the movement of the cutter and can be optimized to suit the particular material being cut. Brass for example requires a back and side <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 0 degrees while aluminum uses a back <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 35 degrees and a side <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 15 degrees.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, windscreen models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm & 10 mm). Then each windscreen model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned windscreen was investigated. It was observed that the area of crack and the peak value of headform acceleration are determined by the critical fracture stress and 50 MPa fracture stress of glass best predicts the headform acceleration level and the cracks <b>of</b> <b>windscreen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{power source}} <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper is motor, {{which is the}} core of the entire wiper system and is very high quality requirements. The wiper motor {{installed}} on the front windshield and worm gears are generally made of one mechanical part. The four-bar linkage of windshield wiper of automobile is driven by motor through worm gears. The method of simulated annealing is a technique that has attracted significant attention as suitable for optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where a desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. The simulated annealing algorithm with penalty strategy is adopted to solve the optimal model <b>of</b> <b>windscreen</b> wiper mechanism, thus motion accuracy of wiper mechanism is greatly increased, and the searching number is greatly decreased...|$|R
