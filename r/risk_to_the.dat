Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the National Federation of the Blind.|$|E

Today many of these channels are managed by the Witham First, Third and Fourth District Internal Drainage Boards and Upper Witham Internal Drainage Board. These four internal drainage boards reduce the flood <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounding properties, land and environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great Barrier Reef is specifically identified as being at <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effects of global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size of the tsunami that followed.|$|E

5|$|Louise Arbour {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's tactic of publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, a head of state, indicted and arrested.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children {{are more susceptible to}} develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> severe consequences that may arise as a result of being infected with E. coli.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. This {{is no longer possible}} since the space shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System, to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission.|$|E

5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E
5|$|The English {{plan for}} 1673 centred on first {{achieving}} naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining {{the rank of}} General and Vice Admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided that the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships undermanned. The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of Texel in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the marginal Dutch victory. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E
