40|$|Today {{the market}} of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineering</b> (air {{conditioning}} technology, refrigerators) is dominated from compression refrigerators. However, {{the focus of}} the present development, are adsorption refrigerators based on devices implementing a higher effectiveness and an environmental compliance with rising efforts for reduction of pollution compared to compression refrigerators. The central module of adsorption refrigerators is the adsorber, were the evaporation and the condensation of the cooling solvent takes place. This paper deals with an adsorber characterized by an open porous supporting structure. This structure comprises high heat conductivity. It is coated with a normally poor heat conducting adsorbent layer. Suitable supporting structures for adsorbers are aluminuim sponges with a high specific surface and a high permeability for fluids and gases. On this basis a new generation of innovative adsorber elements can be developed.

40|$|Pulse tube {{refrigerators}} are latest technical {{instrument in}} the field of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineering.</b> So they are preferred over other types of cryocooler like Stirling and Gifford-McMahon coolers because of no moving parts in the cooler making the cooler widely useful for various purposes. Other ordinary refrigerators use vapor compression cycle but pulse tube utilizes oscillatory expansion and compression of gas present inside it. Pulse tube cryocooler has long life compared to other refrigerators, high reliability and low vibration because of no solid piston moving. These coolers have vast applications like semiconductor manufacture and its endless use in military for the cooling of the infrared sensors. They are also used for the cooling of astronomical detectors. They are also used for pre coolers of dilution refrigerators. They are used in space application also. In this work study of Stirling type OPT cryocooler is considered for CFD analysis using fluent present in ANSYS 15 workbench. 2 D axis-symmetric geometry is created and used for CFD analysis. The simulations represent a fully-coupled system operating in steady periodic mode, with a trapezoidal pressure profile. Nothing is assumed rather than ideal gas and no gravity effect. The boundary conditions applied on this model are a oscillating pressure of trapezoid profile created using user defined function (UDF), thermal boundary conditions like adiabatic and known heat flux at the cold end heat exchanger. The purpose is to study the Orifice Pulse tube cryocooler(OPTR) using CFD fluent analysis. Where dimensions of components of OPTR are taken from YP Banjare thesis[1] for values of optimum result.

One analysis assumes no load or adiabatic cold-end heat exchanger (CHX); other assumes isothermal or known cooling heat load. Each analysis was started with initial conditions, and carried on until steady periodic conditions are attained. The unsteady CFD model successfully predicts OPTR performance through solving an ideal gas equation and heat transfer. The result is discussed in Result and Discussion section...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{applications}} of cryogenic systems have expanded {{over the past}} 50 years into many areas of our lives. During this time, {{the impact of the}} common features of Cryogenic Fluid Dynamics, CryoFD, on the economic design of these cryogenic systems, has grown out of a long series of experimental studies carried out by teams of postgraduate students at Southampton University. These studies have sought to understand the heat transfer and convective behavior of cryogenic liquids and vapors, but they have only skimmed over the many findings made, on the strong convective motions of fluids at low temperatures. The convection takes place in temperature gradients up to 10, 000 K per meter, and density gradients of 1000 % per meter and more, with rapid temperature and spatially dependent changes in physical properties like viscosity and surface tension, making software development and empirical correlations almost impossible to achieve. These temperature and density gradients are far larger than those met in other convecting systems at ambient temperatures, and there is little similarity. The paper will discuss the likely impact of CryoFD on future cryogenic systems, and hopefully inspire further research to support and expand the use of existing findings, and to improve the economy of present-day systems even more effectively. Particular examples to be mentioned include the following. Doubling the cooling power of cryo-coolers by a simple use of CryoFD. Reducing the boil-off rate of liquid helium stored at the South Pole, such that liquid helium availability is now all-the-year-round. Helping to develop the 15 kA current leads for the LHC superconducting magnets at CERN, with much reduced refrigeration loads. Improving the heat transfer capability of boiling heat transfer surfaces by 10 to 100 fold. This paper is an edited text of an invited plenary presentation at ICEC 25 /ICMC 2014 by Professor Scurlock on the occasion of his being presented with the ICEC Mendelssohn Award for his many contributions to Cryogenics. As long ago as 1992, he first proposed in his “History and Origins of Cryogenics” that the temperature range for Cryogenics should be extended up to the ice-point at 273 K. This paper expands on this proposal with the implicit assumption that Cryogenic Fluid Dynamics can provide a universal basis for modelling heat transfer and convective fluid behaviour of all fluids, at all temperatures, below the ice-point at 273 K; or below 250 K if you wish to exclude <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineering.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Boiling {{processes}} {{are widely used}} in technical applications. The chemical industry, power plant technology, and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineering</b> {{are just a few}} examples. Intensive research on pool boiling processes has been undertaken for decades. Nevertheless, the physical phenomena are still not sufficiently understood. This is mainly caused by the large number of influencing factors and the wide range of length and time scales boiling processes act on. Especially through the research on small length scales {{a better understanding of the}} underlying physical phenomena should be achieved. The subject of the present thesis is the experimental investigation of boiling processes with single bubbles and bubble interactions. In a further step, the reliability of the results obtained for a few interacting bubbles is tested on a technical length scale. Within the framework of this thesis an experimental setup is designed and fabricated. By use of optical measurement methods (black/white and infrared) the shape of the bubbles and the temperature close to the heater surface are measured simultaneously. Within the experimental setup and method emphasis is put on the validity of the obtained data (especially the infrared measurements). The test setup is based on a thin stainless steel foil used as a Joule heater. The working fluid is FC- 72. Almost all experiments are performed at subatmospheric pressure. In this thesis general results for boiling experiments with single bubbles, for example concerning the departure diameter and frequency, are presented. It is observed that for single bubbles a thin liquid layer can remain underneath a bubble after nucleation. By comparing bubble growth with and without this layer a first statement of the validity of the contact line and microlayer model is achieved. Experiments with bubbles coalescing show a clear dependency of the coalescence frequency on the system pressure, partly following a probability distribution. In comparison of a case with and without bubble coalescence an increased heat transfer is found for the coalescence case. This effect is mainly caused by hydrodynamic phenomena and sometimes also by the formation of residual droplets inside large bubbles. It is shown that the effects observed for the coalescence of two bubbles is not transferable to global boiling processes. With the help of a Monte-Carlo simulation these phenomena can be explained by different coalescence behavior. The experimental results furthermore give a possible explanation for the deviations between experimental and analytic bubble departure diameters due to the dynamic effects during bubble nucleation...|$|E
40|$|National audienceGas {{hydrates}} are ice-like {{compounds in}} which gas molecules, mostly light hydrocarbons, acid gases (CO 2, H 2 S), N 2, or H 2, are entrapped into polyhedral cavities formed by hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Those compounds {{have long been}} studied in relation with flow assurance and safety issues in {{the oil and gas}} industry, where their occurrence is a risk that must be controlled and, possibly, avoided. More recently, industrial applications of gas hydrates were proposed in various fields, such as gas storage and transport, gas separation, water purification, or <b>refrigeration</b> <b>engineering.</b> The potential development of such technologies is regarded as promising, due to the low cost, environmental inocuity and total reusability of the main reactant involved, namely water. This prospect has sparked a new demand for measurement and modelling of the properties of these structures. Thermodynamic and thermo physical properties, as well as formation kinetics of gas hydrates are of particular interest for the design, economical assessment, and up scaling of hydrate-based processes. Pressure-controlled DSC has been used extensively to characterize different types of hydrates (1 - 5). Accurate methods were developed for that purpose (6) and applied to a variety of gas + water + additives systems (1 - 5, 7, 8). The numerous data acquired have been used to develop rigorous thermodynamic models (9 - 11) that are capable of predicting thermodynamic limits of stability and dissociation enthalpies of those structures, thus providing useful tools for future process design.
