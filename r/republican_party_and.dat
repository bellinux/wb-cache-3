5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around Liz's former boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), becoming a local celebrity when he saves somebody's life at a subway station. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{is looking for}} a celebrity to be the face of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) meets one of his idols, Bucky Bright (Tim Conway).|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{served the}} {{remainder}} of Paull's unexpired term, and was nominated by both Democratic <b>and</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>parties</b> <b>and</b> reelected for another eight-year term without opposition in November 1900.|$|R

5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party)</b> <b>and</b> cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased {{with the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> its financial supporters, {{he also wanted}} to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he {{believed to be a}} critical event in the country's history. Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{sought and}} gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} deeply divided between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the ARF was {{not part}} of but had a {{cooperation}} agreement in place with the governing coalition, which consisted of two parties in the government coalition, the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> Prosperous Armenia Party. The Country of Law party was {{also a member of the}} governing coalition until it pulled out in May 2006. With 16 of the 131 seats in the National Assembly of Armenia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is the major socialist party in Armenia and the third-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Jason Chaffetz {{initially}} {{declared his}} candidacy to challenge McCarthy, and Bill Flores declared his candidacy after McCarthy withdrew, but both dropped out later {{to express their}} support for Paul Ryan, who entered the race after being widely viewed as a potential frontrunner. Daniel Webster of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party were also declared candidates. Ryan won the rescheduled caucus vote on October 28, and was elected Speaker of the House the next day, with 236 votes to Pelosi's 184 and Webster's 9. Three votes went to undeclared candidates.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect was}} to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants to the <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>and</b> promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>and</b> faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> {{promoted}} civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.|$|E

5|$|Gillibrand's special {{election}} victory in 2010 {{gave her the}} right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, Gillibrand faced challenger Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> Conservative Party lines. Gillibrand was endorsed by The New York Times and the Democrat and Chronicle. She won the election with 72.2% of the vote, the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history, better than Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.|$|E
5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war. Since the late 20th century, his reputation has undergone a slow reassessment. Many Civil War historians now consider him among the war's most gifted tactical commanders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Sargsyan {{tightened}} {{his grip on}} the Armed Forces, establishing himself as a virtual strongman. After strongly supporting Ter-Petrosyan to retain power, he forced the president out of office in 1998 due to his support for concessions in the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement negotiations, and helped Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan to be elected president. With their relations deteriorated, Sargsyan merged the influential war veterans group Yerkrapah into the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> joined forces with Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan. In the May 1999 elections, their reform-minded alliance secured a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Sargsyan became prime minister, emerging as the de facto decision-maker in Armenia with effective control of the military and the legislature.|$|E

5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit the <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> <b>and</b> to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{graduated}} from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in 1858 with a bachelor's degree, and studied {{for two years}} at the Western Theological seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary). In 1861, he was appointed professor of mathematics at Western College (now Leander Clark College), a United Brethren-affiliated college in Shueyville, Iowa, and taught there for one year. The United Brethren, a pietist church that arose first among Pennsylvania Germans during the Great Awakening, {{was one of the}} earliest churches in the United States to embrace abolitionism. By Thompson's time, they had also joined the fight for the prohibition of alcohol, though most did so from within the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> did not join the small single-issue Prohibition Party.|$|E

The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the Slovak National Party, the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German Freedom party. In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> <b>and</b> the United Russia party.|$|E
