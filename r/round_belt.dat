5000|$|The MG 34 {{could use}} both magazine-fed and belt-fed 7.92 mm ammunition. Belts were {{supplied}} in a fixed length of 50 rounds, {{but could be}} linked up to make longer belts for sustained firing. A 250-round belt was also issued to machine guns installed in fixed emplacements such as bunkers. Ammunition boxes contained 250 rounds in five belts that were linked to make one continuous 100 <b>round</b> <b>belt</b> and one 150 <b>round</b> <b>belt.</b> The assault drums held a 50-round belt, or a 75-round [...] "double drum" [...] magazine {{could be used by}} replacing the top cover with one made specially for that purpose. A gun configured to use the 75-round magazine could not be returned to belt-feed mode without changing the top cover again. All magazine-feed MG 34s had been withdrawn from infantry use by 1941, with some remaining in use on armoured personnel carriers.|$|E
50|$|The Navy Board {{found that}} Bailey had brought an {{insufficient}} number of ammunition belts for a thorough reliability and endurance test, {{and because of}} this, they refused to officially take the weapon under consideration. They did allow Bailey to fire off as many rounds as he desired for unofficial consideration, however. The ammunition belts that Bailey had provided held 100 rounds each, and a second belt could not be loaded after a burst of fire had been initiated. The sustained rate of fire was therefore found to be inadequate for Naval requirements. Bailey did manage to demonstrate a very high rate of fire, firing off a complete 100 <b>round</b> <b>belt</b> in 6 seconds for an official firing rate of 1,000 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>Round</b> <b>belts</b> are a {{circular}} cross section belt designed {{to run in}} a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, <b>round</b> <b>belts</b> are for use in relatively low torque situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane). Early sewing machines utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.|$|R
5000|$|The Bergmann MG 15 was the World War I {{production}} {{version of}} 1915 (MG 15 n.A.) {{light machine gun}} developed by Germany. It used 100/200 <b>round</b> <b>belts</b> and utilized a bipod, which allowed the weapon to mount on a surface for more accurate firing.|$|R

500|$|In German use, 72 {{rounds of}} 37mm {{ammunition}} were carried. These were stored in 6-round boxes: {{three on the}} hull side wall, eight in the turret overhang and one ready box above the gun on the turret roof. For the machine gun, 1,800 <b>rounds</b> of <b>belted</b> 7.92mm ammunition were carried. The machine gun ammunition was in 100 <b>round</b> <b>belts,</b> stored three to a box. In Czech service, the LT vz. 35 carried 78 rounds (24 AP, 54 HE) and 2,700 rounds of machine gun ammunition, the difference being removed {{to make room for}} the fourth crewmember in German service. The German command tank version (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) exchanged some ammunition - exactly how much isn't known - for another radio set and a gyrocompass. It could be recognized by the prominent [...] "clothesline" [...] radio antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|R
5000|$|The lMG 08 and LMG 08/15 guns {{would always}} be used on {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, as fixed forward-aimed synchronized firing ordnance initially in single mounts for Germany's 1915-16 era Fokker Eindecker and Halberstadt D.II [...] "scout" [...] single-seat fighters, and by 1916 in dual mounts, first appearing on the mass-produced examples of Robert Thelen's Albatros D.I and D.II fighters in late 1916, and singly on German [...] "C-class" [...] armed two-seat observation aircraft for synchronized forward-firing armament. The usual ammunition load for fighters was for longer, 500 <b>round</b> <b>belts,</b> one for each gun.|$|R
5000|$|The KDA is license-built in Poland by Huta Stalowa Wola. It is a gas-operated weapon with a dual {{belt feed}} mechanism, {{driven by a}} laterally-mounted gas piston {{operating}} rod. The air-cooled, fluted barrel has a variable rifling twist and {{is equipped with a}} muzzle device that relays muzzle velocities to the fire control computer. The left and right cannons are not interchangeable since their feed systems require a different mounting configuration for each gun. The cannon fires the 35x228 mm round with several types of ammunition, including Ahead [...] "smart" [...] rounds (which have a programmable fuse and directional payload ejection capability, allowing engagement of missiles and other very small targets) and subcaliber FAPDS. The HE ammunition is stored in a magazine {{at the base of the}} turret basket and has a capacity for 2x210 <b>rounds.</b> <b>Belts</b> with armour-piercing ammunition (20 <b>rounds</b> per <b>belt)</b> are carried in large magazines on the turret exterior. The turret and gun drive systems are electrical.|$|R
50|$|A coaxial 7.62 mm PKT {{machine gun}} is mounted {{to the right}} of the main {{armament}} for which the BMP-1 carries 2,000 <b>rounds</b> in <b>belts</b> of 250. They are stowed in two boxes under the main gun. The machine gun has a rate of fire of around 800 rounds a minute.|$|R
5000|$|British {{cartridges}} included [...] "Ball", [...] "Armour-Piercing", [...] "Tracer", and [...] "Incendiary". Blanks and a Drill round {{were also}} available for instruction purposes. The Drill round was an aluminium bullet fixed in a chromium-plated case which had three deep lengthwise recesses painted red to identify it. Ammunition was supplied in belted form with 225 <b>rounds</b> per <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the field, {{the weapon}} could operate in {{offensive}} or defensive applications. The offensive model, with a mobile soldier, used a drum magazine that could hold either 50 or 75 rounds of ammunition. In a stationary defensive role, {{the gun was}} mounted on a bipod or tripod and fed by an ammunition belt. Belts were carried in boxes of five. Each <b>belt</b> contained 50 <b>rounds.</b> <b>Belt</b> lengths could be linked for sustained fire. During sustained fire, barrels {{would have to be}} changed at intervals due to the heat generated by the rapid rate of fire. If the barrels were not changed properly, the weapon would misfire. Changing barrels was a rapid process for the trained operator and involved disengaging a latch and swinging the receiver to the right for the insertion of a new barrel. Accordingly, stationary defensive positions required more than one operator.|$|R

50|$|One {{failure mode}} is gradual wear to the tooth shape, which may {{eventually}} lead to slippage over <b>rounded</b> teeth. The <b>belt</b> often continues to work, but the relative timing between shafts changes.|$|R
50|$|He boxed as a lightweight. On 24 April 1897, at the Ecelsior Hall, Bethnal Green, he beat Tom Ireland to win Harry Wright's 'All England' 9st 8lbs (134lbs) silver {{championship}} belt competition, {{over six}} rounds. It was his second bout of the night, having earlier beaten Jerry Donoghue in a semi-final, with a knockout {{in the third}} <b>round.</b> The <b>belt's</b> value was quoted {{at the time as}} £40.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick, father; strap the <b>belt</b> <b>round</b> you. See {{that it is}} secure. We have to {{be lifted}} into the air if necessary. Hold together. It will be easier for Rupert to lift us to the airship." ...|$|R
50|$|The AGS-30 is fed {{from special}} belt drums that hold 30 linked <b>rounds.</b> Loaded <b>belt</b> drum weights about 14 kg. Interestingly, spade grips are {{installed}} on a gun cradle integral to the tripod, instead of to the gun body; the trigger {{is located on the}} right spade grip, making firing more controlled and comfortable. The AGS-30 can only fire in full automatic modes. Standard sighting equipment is a 2.7X magnification PAG-17 optical sight.|$|R

60|$|By {{that time}} the cargo-chain had been hooked to the broad canvas <b>belt</b> <b>round</b> the pony's body, the kalashes sprang off {{simultaneously}} in all directions, rolling over each other, and the worthy serang, making a dash behind the winch, turned the steam on.|$|R
50|$|The canvas-belt {{feed system}} {{was the same}} as on Maxim M1910 guns, except the {{standard}} belt capacity was reduced to 100 <b>rounds.</b> The 100-round <b>belts</b> were usually carried in separate drum-type containers, inspired from the MG 08/15. The barrel rifling was 4 right-turns in 240 mm.|$|R

50|$|For the B230 engines 1993, piston cooling, oil {{squirting}} jets {{were added}} to help alleviate piston slap problems on the turbo motors. Another modification was to go from a square toothed timing belt set up to a <b>round</b> toothed timing <b>belt</b> setup which made for quieter belt running.|$|R
50|$|FV432s {{in service}} with {{infantry}} battalions {{are equipped with}} a pintle-mounted L7 GPMG (if not fitted with the Peak Engineering turret). Vehicles with the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and Royal Signals were originally fitted with the L4A4 variant of the Bren light machine gun, but they now use the GPMG. When equipped with the GPMG, the vehicle carries 1,600 <b>rounds</b> of <b>belted</b> 7.62mm ammunition; when carrying the Bren LMG, the vehicle carried 1,400 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition (50 magazines, each holding 28 rounds). There are two three-barrel smoke dischargers at the front.|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} passed <b>round</b> the <b>belt</b> of trees, {{the company of}} {{recruits}} became visible, consisting of the able-bodied inhabitants of the hamlets thereabout, more or less known to Bob and Anne. They were assembled on the green plot outside the churchyard-gate, dressed in their common clothes, and the sergeant who had been putting them through their drill {{was the man who}} nailed up the proclamation. He was now engaged in untying a canvas money-bag, from which he drew forth a handful of shillings, giving one to each man in payment for his attendance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{features}} of his designs were trees and water. Characteristic designs included serpentine lakes with their ends concealed in woodland, single trees and clumps {{of trees in}} parkland with tree <b>belts</b> <b>round</b> the boundary. He created flower gardens adjacent to the house at Sandon Hall, anticipating the later work of Humphry Repton.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fouled, I guess," [...] said Harve, tugging. Before {{he pulled}} up he {{fastened}} the <b>belt</b> <b>round</b> him, and with deep delight heard {{the tip of the}} sheath click on the thwart. [...] "Concern the thing!" [...] he cried. [...] "She acts as though she were on strawberry-bottom. It's all sand here, ain't it'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{the best}} bit of new stuff that I've seen since Jem Belcher fought his first fight with Paddington Jones at Wormwood Scrubbs {{four years ago}} last April," [...] said Berkeley Craven.

50|$|The light welterweight O'Connor came up {{a weight}} class for this fight {{and beat the}} undefeated New England welterweight champ in a hard-fought bout that lasted 10 <b>rounds.</b> (the {{championship}} <b>belt</b> and title {{was not on the}} line for this fight because any defense would have to be fought at 147 pounds). Danny O'Connor won by majority decision.|$|R
5000|$|Islamic {{scholars}} {{cited the}} Pact of Umar in which Christians supposedly took {{an obligation to}} [...] "always dress {{in the same way}} wherever we may be, and… bind the zunar <b>belt</b> <b>round</b> our waists". Al-Nawawi required dhimmis to wear a piece of yellow cloth and a belt, as well as a metallic ring, inside public baths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lassiter!" [...] Jane whispered, as {{she gazed}} {{from him to}} the black, cold guns. Without them he {{appeared}} shorn of strength, defenseless, a smaller man. Was she Delilah? Swiftly, conscious of only one motive--refusal to see this man called craven by his enemies--she rose, and with blundering fingers buckled the <b>belt</b> <b>round</b> his waist where it belonged.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} of LAURON was finished in 2004. The mechanical robustness was improved, {{for example the}} <b>round</b> cord <b>belt</b> connecting the joints with the motors were replaced by gear belts. Beside, a new head with 2 degrees of freedom was added. The central body was now made of light-weight carbon fiber. LAURON IV weights 27 kg including its accumulators and can reach a maximum walking speed of up to 0.22 m/s. Furthermore, the used NiMH accumulators can supply LAURON with energy for up to 60 minutes. The current version of the fourth LAURON generation is LAURON IVc. The LAURON IV won the Faulhaber University Project Award in 2011.|$|R
