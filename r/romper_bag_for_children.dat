40|$|<b>Bags</b> <b>for</b> students, {{especially}} <b>for</b> preschool-aged <b>children</b> have {{an important}} role as learn- ing media in education. A!ractive and innovative bag designs are highly required to make them acceptable and favourable <b>for</b> <b>children.</b> This research uses a quantitative method. Design and development of educational <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> preschool-aged <b>children</b> were conducted through early stages of reserach (mind mapping) and concept development (determining identiﬁcation needs). The concept of development process began with the dissemination of 30 questionnaires to preschool-aged children to identify the consumers’ need <b>for</b> the <b>bags.</b> From the development process, there were three primary needs and 14 target speciﬁcations which were then linked to 8 matrices in the chart of matrix need. The results of the research in edu- cational <b>bag</b> designs <b>for</b> preschool-aged <b>children</b> is implemented based on matrix need.   Keywords: bags, product design, innovation, primary needs, target speciﬁcation, matrix nee...|$|R
30|$|Lastly, in Biswas, Infirri, Hagman, and Berglin’s article, “An assistive {{sleeping}} <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> {{with autism}} spectrum disorder,” the authors successfully designed a wearable, therapeutic device possessing smart textile-based sensors and actuators to treat sleeping disorders among autistic children. A {{prototype of the}} designed sleeping bag, integrated with a pressure sensor, a few weighted compartments, and a vibration actuator, was built to detect the awakening stage of the user, and to provide soothing vibratory motions {{in the form of}} wearable technology while maintaining the required comfort level for everyday use. Their study well demonstrates how the functionality of a traditional textile based product can be improved by design adaptation for wearable technology. The authors encourage the integration of readily available electronic and computing devices within common textile platforms to administer advanced solutions in the functional product design and development process.|$|R
30|$|Another way {{consumers}} develop positive emotions {{is through}} interpersonal relations (Tesser and Campbell 1982). According to Franze (2017), brands gain success when their business models emphasize a collective feeling of “us” or “we,” rather than you or me. A growing trend shows that people enjoy helping others, a phenomenon called warm glow (Aknin et al. 2013). Warm glow {{can result from}} volunteering, donating, or spending money on others. In the study of Dunn et al. (2014), regardless of a country’s economic level, consumers report they experience greater levels of happiness from prosocial spending than from self-purchases. For example, respondents who buy a gift <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> a sick <b>child</b> report being significantly happier than do those who purchase the same gift <b>bag</b> <b>for</b> themselves.|$|R

5000|$|In many {{healthcare}} facilities, large disposable blue bags (often with drawstrings) {{are commonly}} used to collect soiled linens. Some are printed with the words [...] "Soiled Linens" [...] and [...] "Ropa Sucias" [...] on them. (These bags fall {{in line with the}} color scheme of waste bags in the healthcare industry: red <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> biohazard/infectious waste, yellow <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> either chemo therapy waste or infectious soiled linens, and blue <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> soiled linens).|$|R
5000|$|These <b>bags</b> {{were used}} <b>for</b> various purposes. Often {{they were used}} for {{transporting}} goods while on migration. They also served as storage containers {{to be used in}} the tent or yurt. There are also specialized bags such as <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying mirrors, <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying the Qur'an, <b>bags</b> <b>for</b> carrying tent stakes and more. Often the bags are known by specific names based on the function they served. Some common bag names are [...] "cuval" [...] (camel bag), [...] "khorjin" [...] (double-sided donkey bags) and [...] "mafrash" [...] (bedding bag) to name just a few.|$|R

This is a moot point, though, with Jaime's {{adjusted}} studs taken into account. Jaime {{is forced to}} cut every piece he installs down to fit. His mistake in the spray foam was using the can right-side up instead of upside-down.|$|R
