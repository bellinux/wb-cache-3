5000|$|U.S. and Israeli reports {{also found}} that the MiG-23's Head-Up Display (HUD) doubles as a <b>radarscope,</b> {{allowing}} the pilot to keep his eyes focused at infinity while operating his radar. This allowed the Soviets to omit the separate <b>radarscope</b> from the MiG-23. This feature was carried over into the MiG-29, though in that aircraft, a cathode ray tube (CRT) is carried on the upper right corner to double as a <b>radarscope.</b> Western opinions about this [...] "head-up radarscope" [...] are mixed. The Israelis were impressed, but an American F-16 pilot criticized it as [...] "sticking a transparent map in front of the HUD" [...] and not providing a three-dimensional presentation that would accurately cue a pilot's eyes to look for a fighter as it appears in a particular direction.|$|E
50|$|The chase {{was being}} {{carried on the}} <b>radarscope</b> at the control room. Radar {{indicated}} that the UFO was staying five to ten miles ahead of the Lieutenant and his F-84. Finally Lieutenant Needham gave up his pursuit and flew back to the Military base. The object continued on and was detected by the Filter Center in Bismarck.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the private}} Piper PA-28, {{registration}} [...] piloted by Robert Carey (34), {{was on a}} southeasterly heading. It was operating under a filed visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan which indicated a cruising altitude of 3500 feet. The PA-28 was not in communication with Air Traffic Control, and was not transponder equipped, {{and there was no}} evidence it appeared as a primary radar target on the <b>radarscope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{witnesses}} who supported Samford's explanation was {{the crew of}} a B-25 bomber, which had been flying over Washington during the sightings of July 26-27. The bomber was vectored several times by National Airport over unknown targets on the airport's <b>radarscopes,</b> yet the crew could see nothing unusual. Finally, as a crew member related, [...] "the radar had a target {{which turned out to}} be the Wilson Lines steamboat trip to Mount Vernon... the radar was sure as hell picking up the steamboat." [...] Air Force Captain Harold May was in the radar center at Andrews AFB during the sightings of July 19-20. Upon hearing that National Airport's radar had picked up an unknown object heading in his direction, May stepped outside and saw [...] "a light that was changing from red to orange to green to red again...at times it dipped suddenly and appeared to lose altitude." [...] However, May eventually concluded that he was simply seeing a star that was distorted by the atmosphere, and that its [...] "movement" [...] was an illusion. At 3 a.m. on July 27, an Eastern Airlines flight over Washington was told that an unknown object was in its vicinity; the crew could see nothing unusual. When they were told that the object had moved directly behind their plane, they began a sharp turn to try to see the object, but were told by National Airport's radar center that the object had [...] "disappeared" [...] when they began their turn. At the request of the Air Force, the CAA's Technical Development and Evaluation Center did an analysis of the radar sightings. Their conclusion was that [...] "a temperature inversion had been indicated in almost every instance when the unidentified radar targets or visual objects had been reported." [...] Project Blue Book would eventually label the unknown Washington radar blips as false images caused by temperature inversion, and the visual sightings as misindentified meteors, stars, and city lights. In later years two prominent UFO skeptics, Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University, and Philip Klass, a senior editor for Aviation Week magazine, would also argue in favor of the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis. In 2002 Klass told a reporter that [...] "radar technology in 1952 wasn't sophisticated enough to filter out many ordinary objects, such as flocks of birds, weather balloons, or temperature inversions." [...] The reporter added that [...] "UFO proponents argue that even then seasoned controllers could differentiate between spurious targets and solid, metallic objects. Klass disagrees. It may be that 'we had two dumb controllers at National Airport on those nights'...Klass added that the introduction of digital filters in the 1970s led to a steep decline in UFO sightings on radar." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Coyote then {{creates an}} {{exploding}} flying saucer with a <b>radarscope</b> mechanism {{able to detect}} birds, mice, and rabbits. The disc flies to Bugs' hole, but Bugs thwarts it by putting on a chicken mask. The disguised Bugs then writes in [...] "COYOTE" [...] on the radarscope's target options and moves the dial there. The saucer speeds back to the Coyote's home, blowing up the whole mountain to smithereens.|$|E
5000|$|Luther Peak (...) is a peak 820 m high, {{standing}} 11 nmi km {{southeast of}} Mount Peacock in the Admiralty Mountains and overlooking Edisto Inlet in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was charted from <b>radarscope</b> photographs taken in March 1956 {{by members of}} U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze aboard the , and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Commander Roger W. Luther, U.S. Navy, captain of the Edisto.|$|E
50|$|In early 1969, Borman {{became a}} special advisor to Eastern Air Lines and after {{retiring}} from NASA and the U.S. Air Force in 1970 as a Colonel, {{he was made}} Senior Vice President-Operations Group at the company. In 1972, Borman {{received a phone call}} one evening informing him that Eastern Flight 401 had disappeared off the <b>radarscope</b> near Florida's Everglades. Soon, Borman himself was wading through the murky swamps, helping rescue crash victims and loading survivors into rescue helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|At 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1952, Edward Nugent, an {{air traffic}} {{controller}} at Washington National Airport (today Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), spotted seven objects on his radar. The objects were located 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of the city; no known aircraft were {{in the area and}} the objects were not following any established flight paths. Nugent's superior, Harry Barnes, a senior air-traffic controller at the airport, watched the objects on Nugent's <b>radarscope.</b> He later wrote: ...|$|E
5000|$|Late May saw {{the arrival}} of the first of the 315th Bombardment Wing, whose B-29B planes were {{equipped}} with the new AN/APQ-7 [...] "Eagle" [...] radar. The antenna for this radar was an 18-foot, wing-shaped unit mounted under the forward fuselage. The antenna swept a 60-degree arc along the flight path of the plane, and a higher frequency (X-band) signal gave a much-improved <b>radarscope</b> picture. The 315th had been trained for low-altitude, nighttime pathfinder missions. Between 26 June and 10 August, they carried out a series of fifteen strikes against oil production facilities which essentially shut down the Japanese oil industry. The B-29Bs were also stripped of much defensive gunnery, adding capacity for additional incendiary or high-explosive bombs.|$|E
50|$|Late in the 2000s {{smartphones}} {{increased in}} usage, with radar viewing applications frequently used. Particularly, <b>RadarScope</b> on the iOS platform and Pkyl3 on Android are favored. Other apps {{may be used}} as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as WiFi hotspots and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to tethering or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as mobile broadband MNVO devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile data range beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of tablet computers is expanding as of the early 2010s. 4G LTE has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s although DSLR remains heavily favored. Usage of DSLR for video capture, called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Albert M. Chop, {{the press}} {{spokesman}} for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport and, due to security concerns, denied several reporters' requests {{to photograph the}} radar screens. He then joined the radar center personnel. By this time (9:30 p.m.) the radar center was picking up unknown objects in every sector. At times the objects traveled slowly; at other times they reversed direction and moved across the <b>radarscope</b> at speeds calculated at up to 7,000 mph. At 11:30 p.m., two U.S. Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, was vectored towards the radar blips but saw nothing, despite repeated attempts. However, his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, did see four white [...] "glows" [...] and chased them. He later said that [...] "I tried {{to make contact with}} the bogies below 1,000 feet. I was at my maximum speed...I ceased chasing them because I saw no chance of overtaking them." [...] According to Albert Chop, when ground control asked Patterson [...] "if he saw anything", Patterson replied [...] "'I see them now and they're all around me. What should I do?'...And nobody answered, because we didn't know what to tell him."After midnight on July 27, Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book's liaison at the Pentagon, and Lieutenant John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. During the night, Lieutenant Holcomb received a call from the Washington National Weather Station. They told him that a slight temperature inversion was present over the city, but Holcomb felt that the inversion was not [...] "nearly strong enough to explain the 'good and solid' returns" [...] on the radarscopes. Fournet relayed that all those present in the radar room were convinced that the targets were most likely caused by solid metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but this was a common occurrence and the controllers [...] "were paying no attention to them." [...] Two more F-94s from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot saw a white light which [...] "vanished" [...] when he moved towards it. Additionally, [...] "civilian planes flying into Washington reported seeing strange glowing objects in places where the radar was getting blips." [...] As on July 20, the sightings and unknown radar returns ended at sunrise.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} undertaken to evaluate two time-based self-spacing techniques for in-trail following during terminal area approach. An electronic traffic display was {{provided in the}} weather <b>radarscope</b> location. The displayed self-spacing cues allowed the simulated aircraft to follow and to maintain spacing on another aircraft which was being vectored by air traffic control (ATC) for landing in a high-density terminal area. Separation performance data indicate the information provided on the traffic display was adequate for the test subjects to accurately follow the approach path of another aircraft without the assistance of ATC. The time-based technique with a constant-delay spacing criterion produced the most satisfactory spacing performance. Pilot comments indicate the workload associated with the self-separation task was very high and that additional spacing command information and/or aircraft autopilot functions would be desirable for operational implementational of the self-spacing task...|$|E

40|$|Hurricane Beulah {{developed}} {{near the}} island of Martinique on Sept. 7, 1967. About 36 hr after development, the hurricane came within range of the San Juan radar and was then followed by radar for about 34 hr 89 it moved westward {{to the south of}} Puerto Rico. The variations in the radar configurations of Beulah during that period revealed an interesting feature concerning the evolution of the eye. Initially, the eye consisted of a very small closed ring somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} precipitation bands. In time, a second eye ring developed just outside the initial one; the hurricane then showed a (r double eye ” similar to what has been observed occasionally in other hurricanes. Later the inner eye ring dissipated, thus completing a cycle of evolution that, to our knowledge, had not been observed before. Photographs of the <b>radarscope</b> depicting the changes are presented and discussed, and the development is compared to previously reported double eyes. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} traffic sensor noise {{on the ability}} of a pilot to perform an intrail spacing task was determined. The tests were {{conducted}} in a fixed base cockpit simulator configured as a current generation transport aircraft, with an electronic traffic display provided in the weather <b>radarscope</b> location. The true positions of the traffic were perturbed in both relative range and azimuth by random errors to simulate traffic sensor noise associated with an onboard sensor. The evaluation task involved simulated instrument approaches into a terminal area while maintaining self separation on a lead aircraft. Separation performance data and pilot subjective ratings and comments were obtained. The results of the separation data indicate that displayed traffic position errors, having standard deviation values up to 0. 3 -n. mi. range and 8 deg azimuth, had negligible effect on the spacing performance achieved by the pilots. Speed profiles of the lead aircraft, display of the lead aircraft groundspeed, and individual pilot techniques were found to significantly affect the mean spacing performance...|$|E
40|$|Noncommunicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) such {{as heart}} disease and cancer account for over half of the global mortality burden, and are {{the leading cause of death}} in every region of the world except Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, they remain off the analytical <b>radarscope</b> in political science. This silence has been coupled with the tendency of public health researchers to frame NCDs as apolitical [...] largely a product of an individual's risk behaviors. Such an accounting depoliticizes NCDs, as well as public health approaches to their analysis and prevention. This project's central aim is to introduce a political analysis of chronic disease, demonstrating that public health approaches to NCDs exhibit political rationality. To that end, I explore several questions. How are NCDs accounted in behavioral terms, and how are their risks constructed as apolitical in the public health discourse? Additionally, if public health is presented as a domain of neutral science, how is it that its practices increasingly display market values, including a limited role for the state, a preoccupation with cost efficiency and choice, and the cultivation of the entrepreneurial self who sees her health as a site of investment? To answer these, I employ a discursive approach, specifically Foucault's framework of government rationality, or "governmentality. " It is through the deployment of neoliberal governmentality in three spheres - knowledge, power, and subjectivity - that public health reveals itself not a neutral science, but rather one brimming with the values and logic of the private sector. I develop this argument through a critique of the discipline and practices of public health in three cases: the United States, United Kingdom, and Sweden. Despite exhibiting historically different approaches to health and social welfare, all three show a marked manifestation of neoliberal rationality in public health approaches to chronic disease. The consistency of these findings, in addition to the more general features of the public health discourse, thus allow a conclusion that public health approaches to NCDs are not value-neutral, and are indeed a political phenomenon...|$|E
