60|$|We left Frankfort at eleven, declining the {{services}} of a celebrated voiturier, called le petit Savoyard, whom François introduced, with a warm recommendation of fidelity and zeal. These men are extensively known, and carry their soubriquets, as ships do their names. The little Savoyard had just discharged a cargo of miladies, bound to England, after having had them on his charter-party eighteen months, and was now on the look-out for a <b>return</b> <b>freight.</b> As his whole equipments were four horses, the harness, and a long whip, he was very desirous of the honour of dragging my carriage a hundred leagues or so, towards any part of the earth whither it might suit my pleasure to proceed. But it is to be presumed that miladies were of full weight, for even François, who comes of a family of voituriers, and has a fellow-feeling for the craft, is obliged to admit that the cattle of le petit appear to have been overworked. This negotiation occupied an hour, and it ended by sending the passport to the post.|$|E

After the electrification of the Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway, freight traffic on the Biebermühl Railway quickly declined, as did freight traffic to Pirmasens. The service {{was carried out in}} the form of local freight trains from Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard. The gradient on the line south of Pirmasens Nord required the <b>returning</b> <b>freight</b> trains to brake shortly before leaving Pirmasens Hauptbahnhof. In addition, operations on the loading track in Steinalben required the blocking of traffic on the Schopp-Waldfischbach section.|$|R

6000|$|The stately vessel stood high {{from the}} water, for Captain Jenness's cargo was light, {{and he was}} going out chiefly for a <b>return</b> <b>freight.</b> Sharp jibs and staysails cut their white {{outlines}} keenly against the afternoon blue of the summer heaven; the topsails and courses dripped, half-furled, from the yards stretching across the yellow masts that sprang so far aloft; the hull glistened black with new paint. When Lydia mounted to the deck she found it as clean scrubbed as her aunt's kitchen floor. Her glance of admiration was not lost upon Captain Jenness. [...] "Yes, Miss Blood," [...] said he, [...] "one difference between an American ship and any other sort is dirt. I wish I could take you aboard an English vessel, so you could appreciate the Aroostook. But I guess you don't need it," [...] he added, with a proud satisfaction in his laugh. [...] "The Aroostook ain't in order yet; wait till we've been a few days at sea." [...] The captain swept the deck with a loving eye. It was spacious and handsome, with a stretch of some forty or fifty feet between the house at the stern and the forecastle, which rose considerably higher; a low bulwark was surmounted by a heavy rail supported upon turned posts painted white. Everything, in spite of the captain's boastful detraction, was in perfect trim, at least to landfolk's eyes. [...] "Now come into the cabin," [...] said the captain. He gave Lydia's traps, as he called them, in charge of a boy, while he led the way below, by a narrow stairway, warning Lydia and her grandfather to look out for their heads as they followed. [...] "There!" [...] he said, when they had safely arrived, inviting their inspection of the place with a general glance of his own.|$|E

50|$|In 1641 {{farmers in}} Drachten North and Drachten South entered into an {{agreement}} with financers from the province of Holland, the Drachten Associates. One of these moneylenders was businessman Passchier Hendriks Bolleman from The Hague. The agreement stipulated that the peat in Smallingerland was designated for the Holland industry. For transport by boat the Drachtster Compagnonsvaart canal and two side channels had to be constructed. During one year 800 workers had been digging every day. And where people spent their days, other developments followed, such as dwellings, places for storage, hostels, and businesses. Although the economic success of cutting peat was short-lived (it even led to Passchier Bolleman's financial ruin), {{it led to the}} foundation of Drachten.

40|$|The iron mines of Schefferville, at a {{latitude}} of 55 ° N., are {{the first}} mines exploited {{in one of the}} best provided iron ore regions in the World ; the geosynclinal of Labrador. Their distance from the sea (360 miles to the estuary of the St.  Lawrence) is compensated for by the richness of the ore deposits : abundant reserves, high percentage yield, {{and the quality of the}} mineral. The ore is mined in open pits ; the main difficulty is the harshness of the climate, which necessitates the interruption of operations from the end of November to the middle of April. The deposits are found in a subarctic taiga zone. It has been necessary to bring in all the workers ; mostly French Canadians, but also some foreigners. All tools and provisions have to be transported a great distance. The ore production is increasing rapidly : 2. 25 million tons in 1954, 6 million tons in 1955, and 12 million tons in 1956. It will reach 20 million tons within the next few years. The ore is transported entirely by the railroad specially built to the port of Sept-Iles, from which it reaches, either by the sea route or by the St. Lawrence, the iron-smelting region of the north-eastern United States, where the principal outlets of the Iron Ore Co. of Canada are found. The port of Sept-Iles, which had a population of 5, 573 in 1956, compared to that of 1, 866 in 1951, could very possibly see its importance increase when the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway will allow prairies grain, and possibly Pennsylvania coal, to serve as <b>return</b> <b>freight</b> for the iron ore. Close to the mines, Schefferville already has 3, 500 inhabitants and has become the largest town in Labrador. Besides its purely mining junctions there are others, in particular that of a supply centre and of a transportation terminus. Its population is becoming progressively more stable and of a more balanced composition. The camp of the first prospectors is thus transformed into a permanently populated centre, of which the legal existence was recognized on the first of August, 1955...|$|E

It gave two reasons: [...] "The stimulus to which in the first instance the rapid rise of Barrow-in-Furness has been due, is the erection of blast furnaces on that spot for the production of pig iron from the red hematite ore, belonging to the district near Barrow and Ulverston, and further north of both towns" [...] The first blast furnaces had been brought into operation at Barrow in 1859. Proximity to mines, and to Barrow harbour, and [...] "the advantage of obtaining coke and coal as <b>return</b> <b>freights</b> from the places to which hematite ore was carried" [...] had allowed [...] "extraordinary economy and consequent commercial success.":"But there was another fact still more decisive and important for the prosperity of the Barrow blast furnaces and for the prosperity of the whole mining district surrounding them, and that was the adoption of the Bessemer process. No sooner had Mr. Bessemer's great invention got into practical use than there arose an almost unlimited demand for pure hematite iron." [...] Witnesses for the Furness and Midland Joint bill reported that in 1862 over 535,000 tons of iron ore had been raised in Furness (in 1873 the market price of haematite ore was 24-30 shillings per ton) [...] and over 90,000 tons of pig iron produced in local blast furnaces.|$|R

40|$|The few {{papers that}} explore {{different}} ways to measure shipping freight dynamics have differed in their interpretation of the most suitable measure for conditional freight volatility and consequently for the most appropriate freight risk measure. Furthermore, recent empirical work in maritime studies suggests the possibility of conditional freight volatility switching between different regime states that are dynamically distinct. This paper attributes these dissimilarities in findings within maritime literature {{to the possibility of}} <b>freight</b> <b>returns</b> switching between distinctive volatility structures. Therefore, it proposes a two-state Markov-switching distinctive conditional variance model by matching the two-state conditional freight variance to the most suitable GARCH specification. This provides {{for the first time a}} distinctive empirical insight into the dynamics of tanker freight rates by explaining the dissimilarities within the maritime literature in measuring freight risk that improves our understanding of the changes in volatility dynamics of the freight supply curve. Thus, this study postulates that the dynamics of freight rates are distinct and conditional on the freight volatility regime-state that prevails at the time. Empirical findings postulate that volatilities within tanker <b>freight</b> <b>returns</b> are better modelled by a framework that is capable of capturing volatility dynamics within the tanker freight market. This study attempts to explain the dissimilarities within the maritime literature in measuring freight risk by improving our understanding of the changes in volatility dynamics of the freight supply curve...|$|R
