40|$|Agency (EPA) {{is proposing}} {{to amend the}} rule on <b>refrigerant</b> <b>recycling</b> promulgated under section 608 of the Clean Air Act to clarify how the {{requirements}} of section 608 extend to refrigerants that are used as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerants. This proposed rule would supplement a self-effectuating prohibition on venting substitute refrigerants to the atmosphere that became effective on November 15, 1995. It would also exempt certain substitute refrigerants from the prohibition {{on the basis of}} current evidence that their release does not pose a threat to the environment. In addition, EPA is proposing to change the current requirements for CFC and HCFC refrigerants to accommodate the proliferation of new refrigerants on the market and to strengthen and clarify the existing leak repair requirements for equipment containing CFC and HCFC refrigerants. This proposed rule will significantly reduce emissions of environmentally harmful refrigerants in a cost-effective manner. DATES: Written comments on the proposed rule must be received by August 10, 1998, unless a hearing is requested by June 18, 1998. If a hearing is requested, written comments must b...|$|E
40|$|The Philippines’ Clean Air Act so {{provides}} {{the control of}} gas emissions into the atmosphere. To carry out such provisions the implementing arm of the government – Department of Energy and Natural Resources Energy Management Bureau calls for different sectors of the society to join the cause. The University's share of the call in the implementation is to educate the youth and provide ample information on {{the provisions of the}} act. One important aspect of the Act is to reclaim the refrigerant right at the source prior to disposal at the Solid Waste Landfill. The school having none of such equipment, prompted the professors of the Refrigeration and Air conditioning Department to innovate equipment that would recover and recycle refrigerant so that unnecessary venting could be prevented. The study was then conducted in the aspects of acceptability and effectiveness of the innovated design and function to meet the required standards. Findings lay that the innovated <b>refrigerant</b> <b>recycling</b> machine met the technical requirements as to portability, rigidity and functionality. Though the acceptability was high {{there is a need to}} resolve issues on transportability. Also, there is a need to use a marketed (new) vacuum pump for better recovery of the refrigerant. Effectiveness on the functions were high and 88. 71 % efficient in recovering refrigerant. Based on the results, the researcher recommends that this innovative design be utilized and however need further enhancements. ...|$|E

The following data were measured: average vapor and/or liquid mass flow rates, retention of refrigerant by the equipment, recovery efficiency, transfer of contamination, mixture of different <b>refrigerants,</b> and <b>recycling</b> ability. Conclusions {{on the use of}} recovery and recycling equipment are given...|$|R
50|$|The Omega Chemical Corporation was a <b>refrigerant</b> and solvent <b>recycling</b> {{company that}} {{operated}} from 1976-1991 in Whittier, California. Due to improper waste handling and removal, {{the soil and}} groundwater beneath the property became contaminated and the area is now {{referred to as the}} Omega Chemical Superfund Site. Cleanup of the site began in 1995 with the removal of hazardous waste receptacles and a multimillion-dollar soil vaporization detoxifying system.|$|R
40|$|The use of micro- and mini-channels in heat {{exchanger}} {{has increased in}} recent decades. They contribute to increasing efficiency and reducing refrigerant charge and compactness of {{heat exchanger}}s. The {{aim of this study}} is to experimentally determine the heat transfer coefficient in mini-channels of two-phase flow processes with the low GWP refrigerant R 32 and compare it with the values provided by some of the correlations developed by other researchers. In the existing literature there are a few publications studying the refrigerant R 32. R 32 has medium flammability, classified as A 2 by ASHRAE. European air conditioning manufactures point to use R 32 instead of R 410 A. R 32 has lower global warming potential (GWP = 675) than R 410 a (GWP = 2088). Environmental improvements must also be considered. R 32 is a single component <b>refrigerant</b> so <b>recycling</b> is easier than R 410 A process; also R 32 is safer than R 410 A according to NFPA classification, although R 410 A flammability is lower than R 32 because of the addition of R 125. An installation for the study of condensation processes has been constructed at the “Technical University of Cartagena”. The more relevant results of heat transfer coefficient will be presented in this paper. The analysed data have been measured for R 32 flowing through aluminium square multiport tubes with a hydraulic diameter of 1. 17 mm and compared with R 410 A. The influence of saturation temperature (or pressure), flow velocity, and vapour quality in heat transfer coefficient have been studied. The values considered for these variables are: saturation pressure corresponding to 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 ºC; flow velocities from 100 to 700 kg/(s•m 2); vapour quality from 0. 05 to 0. 9...|$|R
