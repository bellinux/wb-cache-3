5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
25|$|The next {{portion of}} the myth {{concerns}} Horus' birth and childhood. Isis gives birth to and <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> son in secluded places, hidden from the menace of Set. The episodes in {{this phase of the}} myth concern Isis' efforts to protect her son from Set or other hostile beings, or to heal him from sickness or injury. In these episodes Isis is the epitome of maternal devotion and a powerful practitioner of healing magic.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{the human}} pyramid {{to the right}} has a {{vigorous}} vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> head to gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
25|$|Long ago, {{a drop of}} {{sunlight}} became a golden flower capable of healing illness, decay, and injury. Hundreds of years later, the flower is still used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth, until soldiers from nearby kingdom, Corona, steal it to heal their ailing queen. Shortly afterwards, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair contains the flower's healing properties, and that cutting her hair destroys its power. Gothel takes the baby and <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter's return.|$|E

The female remains motionless until she <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> head and tail to permit copulation. This species is monogamous, and the established pair will usually stay together {{as long as they}} both survive. Pair separation rates of up to 20% have been noted following poor breeding. Although the species is socially monogamous, there have been studies showing as much as 17% extra-pair paternity.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair {{away from her face}} was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in which}} she <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
500|$|Zinta next {{starred in}} Samir Karnik's Heroes (2008), a road movie about two final-year film {{students}} who, {{as a part}} of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended Anupam Kher's acting school, [...] "Actor Prepares" [...] to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress." ...|$|E

500|$|MeTV {{described}} Clair's {{parenting style}} as [...] "firm, yet loving." [...] Writing for NPR, Eric Deggans observed that Clair uses a [...] "loving-yet-sardonic" [...] approach to parenting, demonstrated by her line [...] "I {{was a beautiful}} woman once, before the children came". Considered to be the stricter of the two parents, Clair is humorous and sarcastic about the frustrations and challenges of parenting, often joking about killing or abandoning her children {{but at the same}} time making sure they do not take her exaggerated threats too seriously by demonstrating [...] "obvious loving indulgences". In the pilot, Clair responds to Theo's last minute breakfast request for scrambled eggs after she had already prepared sunny side up eggs for him by using her spatula to [...] "scramble" [...] them. According to The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women author Susan Douglas, Clair sometimes makes the mistake of alternating between stern and overindulgent too abruptly. Equally successful in their respective professions, Clair's relationship with Cliff deliberately mirrors the real-life relationship of Cosby and his wife Camille. Clair occasionally <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> voice but seldom yells or loses her temper, demonstrating calmness and a sense of humor as a [...] "remedy for the trials and tribulations of motherhood." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they {{do well in school}} and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what you two have achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left for us to go but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and <b>raises</b> <b>her</b> four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E
