500|$|In this period, Streep {{had a short}} role {{alongside}} Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close and {{her eldest}} daughter Mamie Gummer in Lajos Koltai's drama film Evening (2007), based on the 1998 novel {{of the same name}} by Susan Minot.

Like Evening, critics felt that the talent of the cast was wasted and that it suffered from slow pacing, although one critic announced that Streep positively stood out, being [...] "natural, unforced, quietly powerful", in comparison to Redford's forced performance.|$|E

Emotionally devastated by the loss of so many children, Margaret Cady fell into a depression, which kept her from being fully involved in the lives of her surviving children and left a maternal void in Stanton's childhood.|$|E
