25|$|This {{does not}} mean that banks can - even in theory - create money without limit. On the contrary, banks are {{constrained}} by capital requirements, which are arguably more important than <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> even in countries that have <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
25|$|When an {{institution}} fails to satisfy its <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{it can make}} up its deficiency with reserves borrowed from a Federal Reserve Bank or from {{an institution}} holding reserves in excess of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements.</b> Such loans are typically due in 24 hours or less.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model to {{simulate}} {{the effects of the}} interest rate and <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio on bank risk in China. The results reveal the nonlinearity embedded in the interest rate, <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio, and bank risk nexus. Both the interest rate and <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio exert a positive impact on bank risk for the low regime and a negative impact for the high regime. The interest rate performs a significant effect while the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio shows an insignificant effect on bank risk on a statistical basis for both the high and low regimes...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{there are other}} required financial ratios that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The capital requirement ratio {{is perhaps the most}} important of these other required ratios. When there are no mandatory <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the capital requirement ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of bank lending.|$|E

25|$|The {{required}} {{reserve ratio}} is sometimes {{used as a}} tool in monetary policy, influencing the country's borrowing and interest rates by changing the amount of funds available for banks to make loans with. Western central banks rarely increase the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> because it would cause immediate liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. The People's Bank of China uses changes in <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> as an inflation-fighting tool, and raised the reserve requirement ten times in 2007 and eleven times {{since the beginning of}} 2010.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> {{as a policy}} tool is mainly to control money supply in the economy. However, the changes of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> also affect banks´ interest rates. Thus, the changes will {{have an effect on}} banking optimal behaviour in maximising profits. Using the industrial organisation approach, this paper will evaluate the Indonesian banking sector in the course of designing an unconventional <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> policy that link a bank´s <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio to the bank´s loan to deposit ratio. When a bank´s loan to deposit ratio increases, the bank will have a smaller ratio of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement.</b> This incentive mechanism was implemented to accomplish Bank Indonesia´s intentions of increasing loan growth and reducing the “excess liquidity” in the Indonesian banking sector. The paper reveals that the policy is effective in boosting bank loans and consequently decreasing excess liquidity. It also suggests that the policy could provide another tool for the central bank to impact bank liquidity in order to support financial system stability. ...|$|R

25|$|Even in the United States, which retains formal (though now mostly irrelevant) <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{the notion}} of {{controlling}} the money supply by targeting the quantity of base money fell out of favor many years ago, and now the pragmatic explanation of monetary policy refers to targeting the interest rate to control the broad money supply.|$|E
25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{the role of}} the central bank grew to include {{influencing}} or managing various macroeconomic policy variables, including measures of inflation, unemployment, and the international balance of payments.

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} {{conducted}} through open market operations, loans at the discount window, {{and changes in}} the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to formally investigate the notion that the effect of changes in <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratios is different from the effect of other policy tools. This is accomplished by decomposing the monetary base into those changes caused by changes in <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratios and those caused by other monetary policy actions.

25|$|The Federal Reserve System {{can also}} {{increase}} the money supply by allowing banks to issue more loans, which is accomplished by reducing the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio.

25|$|The Bahamian {{dollar is}} pegged to the U.S. dollar on a {{one-to-one}} basis.

25|$|The actual {{increase}} in the money supply through this process may be lower, as (at each step) banks may choose to hold reserves {{in excess of the}} statutory minimum, borrowers may let some funds sit idle, and some members of the public may choose to hold cash, and there also may be delays or frictions in the lending process. Government regulations may also be used to limit the money creation process by preventing banks from giving out loans even though the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> have been fulfilled.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of private-sector expenditure in the 1990 s {{was accompanied by a}} massive and increasing foreign capital inflow. A tight economic policy, characterized by high interest rates, was implemented in order to contain the private expenditure growth. As a way of reconciling high interest rates with increasing international financial integration, a <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> on capital inflows was applied. The paper shows that private spending responds to the volume of capital inflows, and that these, in turn, respond significantly to the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement.</b> We obtain that the effect of monetary policy on domestic spending is weakened by capital inflows when the exchange rate is not free to fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates. The <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> can be used to avoid this weakening, by compensating the effects on capital inflows produced by interest rate spreads. The results also show that if the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> had been eliminated, capital inflows would have grown significantly and the excess domestic demand situation of 1997 would have been aggravated. A more effective strategy for controlling private expenditure would have needed a higher <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> and an even tighter monetary policy, or else a counter-cyclical fiscal policy that would have increased public saving in periods of private expenditure expansion. ...|$|R

25|$|By 1936, all {{the main}} {{economic}} indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high. In 1937, the American economy unexpectedly fell, lasting through most of 1938. Production declined sharply, as did profits and employment. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938. A contributing factor to the Recession of 1937 was a {{tightening of monetary policy}} by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve doubled <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> between August 1936 and May 1937 leading to a contraction in the money supply.|$|E
25|$|An institution's {{overnight}} reserves, averaged {{over some}} maintenance period, must equal or exceed its average required reserves, calculated {{over the same}} maintenance period. If this calculation is satisfied, there is no requirement that reserves be held {{at any point in}} time. Hence <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> play only a limited role in money creation in the United States. Since quantitative easing began in 2008, they have been even less important, as an enormous glut of excess reserves now exists (over the whole system, though in theory, individual banks may still run into temporary shortfalls).|$|E
25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The <b>reserve</b> <b>requirements</b> have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.|$|E

40|$|Since <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> is {{the only}} {{monetary}} policy instrument used in Montenegro, it has been subject to frequent amendments since the global crisis outbreak. The analysis of the monetary demand model showed {{that there is an}} active transmission mechanism of change in the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> rate on the deposits trend reflects on lending activity. Also, there is a significant impact of FDIs on deposits trending in the banking system, as well as the positive impact of turnover on stock exchange on the deposits and loans trend. Finally, {{it was found that the}} financial crisis has caused negative trends in loans and deposits. On the other hand, the impact of changes in the <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> on the economic activity in Montenegro could not be determined. This is primarily due to the fact that the transmission mechanism of the effect of <b>reserve</b> <b>requirement</b> on economic activity is too long to be able to estimate the model that does not allow the dynamics of the independent variables. The second reason is that industrial output index is only an indirect indicator of the economic activity...|$|R
