5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} two Quatermass serials, the rights to adapt Quatermass and the Pit for the cinema were purchased by Hammer Film Productions. Their adaptation was released with the same title as the original in 1967, directed by Roy Ward Baker and scripted by Kneale. Scottish actor Andrew Keir starred as Quatermass, the role {{for which he was}} best <b>remembered</b> <b>and</b> regarded particularly highly in comparison to the previous film Quatermass, Brian Donlevy. The film, made in colour, is regarded by many commentators as a classic of the genre for the way it blends science fiction with the supernatural. In the United States the film was retitled Five Million Years to Earth.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} Katyn {{memorials}} in the UK, {{the best known}} of which was unveiled on 18 September 1976 at Gunnersbury Cemetery in London, amid considerable controversy. During the period of the Cold War, successive British governments objected to plans by the UK's Polish community to build a major monument to commemorate the massacre. The Soviet Union did not want Katyn to be <b>remembered,</b> <b>and</b> put pressure on Britain to prevent the creation of the monument. As a result, the construction of the monument was delayed for many years. After the local community had finally secured the right to build the monument, no official government representative was present at the opening ceremony (although some politicians did attend the event unofficially).|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately <b>remembered</b> <b>and</b> correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E

25|$|In many {{countries}} the {{public switched telephone network}} {{has a single}} emergency telephone number (sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number) that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance.

Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. See List of emergency telephone numbers.|$|E

They did as the wise woman said, and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.|$|E

25|$|Rama's life is <b>remembered</b> <b>and</b> celebrated {{every year}} with {{dramatic}} plays and fireworks in autumn. This is called Ramlila, {{and the play}} follows Ramayana or more commonly the Ramcharitmanas. It is observed through thousands of Rama-related performance arts and dance events, that are staged during the festival of Navratri in India. After {{the enactment of the}} legendary war between Good and Evil, the Ramlila celebrations climax in the Dussehra (Dasara, Vijayadashami) night festivities where the giant grotesque effigies of Evil such as of demon Ravana are burnt, typically with fireworks.|$|E

Near this land was a small hut abandoned after the triumphs of its owner Manius Curius Dentatus, whose military feats and rigidly simple character were <b>remembered</b> <b>and</b> admired in the neighborhood.

25|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have developed}} {{as to the}} origin of the name of the municipality. The most <b>remembered,</b> <b>and</b> not the least disputed, comes from the romanticized legend of the English lovers Robert Machim and Ana d´Arfet. As the legend explains, the two lovers escaped from England (where their love was forbidden and condemned by the Church), suffered the tragedy of a shipwreck and died on the island that became Madeira, where later the first Portuguese explorers encountered two crosses to which they attributed to the lovers: the name appears to be a corruption of the surname Machim.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic traditions were {{initiated}} {{with the arrival}} of the Portuguese in 1510. The Almacho Dis (Souls Day) is commemorated on Nov 2, following all Saints Day (Nov. 1). On this day, the forgotten souls are <b>remembered</b> <b>and</b> spiritual charity is done though prayer for the deceased family and ancestral souls. Charity is practiced also by offering food for the poor called beggars lunch (bikareanchem jevonn) where the poor are invited for lunch, from the village and treated with dignity and respect. The invited down trodden are served as guest and usually commences with prayers for the deceased souls. Following mass on all souls day, the deceased visit the graveyard of the deceased souls and pray and also decorate their graves.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of 1943 and part of 1944 touring {{the country with the}} Earl Hines big band, which featured baritone Billy Eckstine. Vaughan was hired as a pianist, reputedly so Hines could hire her {{under the jurisdiction of the}} musicians' union (American Federation of Musicians) rather than the singers union (American Guild of Variety Artists), but after Cliff Smalls joined the band as a trombonist and pianist, Sarah's duties were limited exclusively to singing. The Earl Hines band in this period is remembered as an incubator of bebop, as it included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, saxophonist Charlie Parker (playing tenor rather the alto, for which he is <b>remembered),</b> <b>and</b> trombonist Bennie Green. Gillespie arranged for the band, although the contemporary recording ban by the musicians' union meant that no commercial recordings exist.|$|E
