5|$|During the 1980s, Lundgren had {{relationships}} with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella {{so much that}} they <b>rented</b> <b>accommodation</b> there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 2011 census there were 817 people living in the parish. 13.2% were {{children}} up the age of 15 years. 52.3% were between 16 and 64 with 34.5 being 65 and older. This is an older population than in the rest of Somerset and England and Wales in general.

5|$|The median monthly {{housing loan}} {{repayments}} in Yarralumla in 2016 were $2,700, {{compared to the}} ACT-wide figure of $2,058 and a federal average of $1,755.

The rate of home ownership in the suburb was 46.9%—much higher than the national average of 31.0%. 25.4% of the households <b>rented.</b> <b>Accommodation</b> was mostly separate houses (64.2%), although the number of residences in the suburb has been increasing through conversion of blocks to dual occupancy and other medium-density-type developments.

5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad weather {{had such a}} {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's <b>rented</b> <b>accommodation</b> at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E

25|$|Ironically however, given Ireland's new found {{economic}} prosperity, {{and consequent}} immigration, there {{is once again}} a housing shortage in the city. Increased employment {{has led to a}} rapid rise in the city's population. As a result, prices for bought and <b>rented</b> <b>accommodation</b> have risen sharply, leading to many younger Dubliners leaving the city to buy cheaper accommodation in counties Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow, while still commuting daily to Dublin. This has arguably impacted negatively on {{the quality of life in}} the city – leading to severe traffic problems, long commuting times and urban sprawl.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} pitched as [...] "somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show" [...] and was {{promoted}} as [...] "an entirely new genre of television programme".

500|$|In {{lieu of a}} workhouse some sparsely {{populated}} parishes placed homeless paupers into <b>rented</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and provided others with relief in their own homes.

40|$|Background: Vietnam has {{experienced}} a strong wave of migrants to urban and industrialized areas. This is a challenge for both local and national governments, which {{need to address the}} problems of the poor and socially marginalized, including providing housing for rural-to-urban migrants. Poor housing and the economic burden of house renting are increasingly recognized as determinants of both physical and mental health. Objectives: This paper examined the association between <b>renting</b> <b>accommodation</b> and income satisfaction and living conditions of female workers in light manufacturing industries in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-sectional study was implemented with quantitative survey of 2, 818 female workers in 10 light manufacturing factories in 3 industrial zones by a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Over 38 % of female workers had to <b>rent</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The average expense for accommodation, water and electricity accounted for 30. 1 % of renters’ income, which is 7. 2 % (CI 95 %, 5. 3 – 9. 3 %) higher than for non-renters. A higher proportion of renters than non-renters considered their income was unstable and insufficient for living costs. In addition, only 7. 2 % of renters reported that their living conditions were suitable, notably lower than non-renters (22. 4 %). Conclusion: The study showed the economic burden of <b>renting</b> <b>accommodation</b> on workers’ income satisfaction and living conditions. The findings have implications for an adequate housing access strategy for workers including the integration of housing development in the planning and development of industrial zones and factories...|$|R

40|$|Most {{international}} and local (South African) research on housing examine housing tenure in terms of static categories, - i. e. does someone own or <b>rent</b> their <b>accommodation</b> - without capturing either the dynamics of how people occupy housing or the complexities that arise when, for example, someone might <b>rent</b> <b>accommodation</b> while owning a house elsewhere. Most censuses and surveys simply ask whether the household living in a sampled house (or apartment, etc) currently rents or owns that house. I find access to housing {{to be a better}} analytical category than tenure arguing that renting and owner occupier housing are not exclusive categories, and can co-exist, and that additional categories should be identified...|$|R
