5|$|The toxins {{found in}} Galerina marginata {{are known as}} amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide {{derivatives}} composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to <b>recirculate</b> and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.|$|E

This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for MRO or hobbyist metalcutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used.

40|$|Abstract: Reactors with fixed {{biocenosis}} {{are most}} commonly applied for fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment, {{as they have}} a number of advantages over other biological purification plants. In actual practice, inefficient plants which generally operate in a single-stage mode are often used. Finer treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water with removal of organic and nitrogen-containing contaminants can be achieved by a multi-stage biological process. Comparative studies of multi-stage treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water by reactors with fixed biocenosis were conducted in order to choose the optimal process flow scheme. The study results determine optimal process flow schemes for fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment in such bioreactors as well as parameters for their operation in the course of bio-oxydation of organic contaminants and ammonium salts and denitrification. The best results were achieved when applying three-stage biological treatment of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water where the oxidizer is configured as a percolating filter and the nitrification filter and the denitrification filter are accomplished in the form of flooded bioreactors. Besides, the oxidizer and the nitrification filter are placed successively in the main water flux to be treated whereas the denitrification filter is installed in a separate zone. The obtained results allow to define reactor volumes for carrying out of nitrification and denitrification in the course of fish farm <b>recirculating</b> water treatment.

2500|$|The {{dome and}} swirler are {{the part of}} the {{combustor}} that the primary air (see Air flow paths below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use bluff body domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to <b>recirculate,</b> creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E
