5000|$|There {{are many}} double diode triode tubes, {{including}} EBC81 (6BD7), EBC91 (6AV6), the older EBC41 (identical to EBC81 but <b>Rimlock</b> (B8A) socket instead of noval), EBC33, EBC21, EBC11, EBC2, ABC 1(4 V heater). The commoner tube line-ups of an AM radio with main transformer set having a double diode-triode {{were one of}} the following: ECH11+EF11+EBC11+EL11 Y8A Base, ECH42(or 41)+EF42 (or 41)+ EBC41+ EL41 (or 42) <b>Rimlock</b> Base, ECH81+EF80(85 or 89)+ EBC81(or 91)+ EL84 (noval Socket) + rectifier and magic eye indicator (depending on the radio class and manufacturer). AC/DC sets without mains transformer would use [...] "U" [...] tubes of the same types, e.g. UCH42+UF41+UBC41+UL41+UY41 rectifier.|$|E
50|$|The 1948 ECC40 with <b>Rimlock</b> base {{can also}} {{considered}} {{a successor to}} the 6SN7 (but closer in characteristics to the ECC32). The 1946 miniature 12AU7/ECC82, with similar, but not identical, electrical characteristics to the 6SN7 and ECC32, and a filament usable on either 6.3 or 12.6V supplies, is more widely used than the 6CG7/6FQ7.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rimlock</b> (B8A) base is an 8-pin {{design with}} a pin circle {{diameter}} close to noval, {{and uses a}} nub {{on the side of}} the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by 'skirtless' versions which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, <b>rimlock</b> tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, e.g. EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and noval (B9A) base types.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} type of lock used in England and Ireland. It is of a {{basic design}} originally {{of a very}} stiff lever and a bolt with wards being the block. As wards were outdated in {{the centre of the}} key, it became normal for them to be placed {{on the sides of the}} bit. Although today these are still produced they are mostly for internal doors and are not used for high security. Older locks could be as large as 40 cm by 25 cm.Most <b>rimlocks</b> used today on exterior doors in the British Isles are nightlatches.|$|R
5000|$|The B7G (or [...] "small-button" [...] or [...] "heptal") seven-pin {{miniature}} {{tubes are}} smaller than noval, with seven pins arranged at 45-degree spacing in a 9.53 mm (3/8th inch) diameter arc, the [...] "missing" [...] pin position being used to position the tube in its socket (unlike octal, loctal and <b>rimlock</b> sockets). Examples include the 6AQ5/EL90 and 6BE6/EK90. European tubes of this type have numbers 90-99, 100-109, 190-199, 900-999. A few in 100-109 have unusual non-B7G bases (e.g., Wehrmacht base).|$|E
5000|$|A nonode {{is a type}} of {{thermionic}} valve that has nine active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a seven-grid vacuum tube, also sometimes called an enneode. An example was the EQ80/UQ80, which was used as an FM quadrature detector. It was developed during the introduction of TV and FM radio and delivered an output voltage large enough to directly drive an end pentode while still allowing for some negative feedback. As most of the grids were tied together, even an 8-pin <b>Rimlock</b> base was sufficient {{in the case of the}} EQ40.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{introduced}} in the late 1950s and was produced by Philips, Mullard, Telefunken, Valvo, and GEC among others. It is very similar electrically to the octal base EF37A and the <b>Rimlock</b> base EF40. Unlike many pentodes it was designed specifically for audio applications, low noise and low microphony being claimed advantages, although a rubber-mounted vibration-resistant base was still recommended. It has much higher stage gain than any triode, which makes it susceptible to microphony. The EF86 was used in many preamplifier designs during the last decades of vacuum tube hi-fi development. An industrial variant of the tube is known as 6267. In the former Soviet Union a variant was also produced as type 6Zh32P (Russian: 6Ж32П.) [...] EF86s were being produced in Russia in two versions under the Electro-Harmonix brand and in the Slovak Republic as JJ Electronic (formerly Tesla).|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} a simple {{rectilinear}} form, with the chancel to eastern end and the porch {{to the south of}} the western end. The addition housing the vestry is to the south-east corner. The wall framing of studs, noggings and bracing is exposed to the exterior of the building, and purposefully arranged as a decorative element which is further emphasised by its contrasting colour. The wall cladding to the interior of the framing is pit-sawn planks of cypress pine, some 250mm (10") wide, laid horizontally. The roof is steeply pitched with gable ends, and a timber bell-cote with spire at the western end. The roof is clad in hand-split hardwood shingles. The entry door from the south porch is a boarded and ledged door with a lancet head, and still furnishing its original bolt and <b>rimlock.</b> Inside, the nave has a special quality of light created by a continuous opening between the top of the walls and the roof framing, to the sides and the gable ends. The tall, narrow windows hand painted with a stipple pattern also contribute to this light. These windows have trefoil heads applied to the outside, giving them a Gothic-like shadow internally. They open by sliding along tracks {{to the inside of the}} wall. The floor is of wide raw cypress pine boards, which are hand-scrubbed clean to retain their bleached appearance. The exposed roof framing and trusses have been stained. All the major members are stop chamfered. The trusses feature twisted vertical tie rods. The chancel arch, also of lancet form, is lined with beaded board.|$|E
