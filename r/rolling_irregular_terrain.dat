This thesis will present the control basis approach as a viable solution to generating walking gaits on-line for <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain.</b> A control basis is a set of reusable feedback control laws that are task and platform independent. Different walking tasks are achieved by varying the composition functions over the same basis controllers, rather than by geometric planning of leg placements or the design of new task-specific behaviors. Hardware modifications to Thing, a four legged walking robot, are described which allow it to map local terrain features. A control basis and a control composition for walking on <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain</b> is proposed and [...] ...|$|R

30|$|We {{propose the}} leg-grope walk on fragile <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain</b> {{considering}} slippage by force distribution. In simulation, the proposed method successfully derives the torque inputs {{to distribute the}} forces appropriately considering slippage avoidance. We also conducted various robotic experiments, and show {{the effectiveness of the}} method. The robot can walk stably by probing footholds step by step. Even if the foothold collapses, the robot can keep its posture and never stumbles. Thus, we conclude that the proposed method is useful for robots to walk safely on fragile <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is concemed with an adaptive controller that compensates friction and gravity， for moving operation trave 1 ing on <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain.</b> Modeling of the friction force is essentially difficult，since {{the parameters of}} friction force are depending on the temperature，condition of f 1 oor and wheel，and reaction force from the f 1 oor that is depending on the motion of mobile manipulator. Moreover，conventional researches concerning mobile manipulators have assumed that the traveling terrain is f 1 at. However， irregularities exist even on an artificial floor in factories and buildings，and {{it is difficult to}} measure exactly the shape of the terrain. When the end-effecter of the mobile manipulator tracks desired trajectory during the mobile manipulator travels on an unknown <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain</b> with unknown friction， two kinds of compensation must be considered for mobile manipulator to achieve accurate trajectory tracking control performance. We propose an adaptive controller including a neural network that can compensate the unknown friction and unknown <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain.</b> The va 1 idity of the neuro-adaptive controller is clarified by real experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study we attempt to induce a quadruped robot to walk {{dynamically}} on <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain</b> and run on at terrain by using a nervous system model. For dynamic walking on <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain,</b> we employ a control system involving a neural oscillator network, a stretch re ex and a exor re ex. Stable dynamic walking when obstructions to swinging legs are present is {{made possible by the}} exor re ex and the crossed extension re ex. A modication of the single driving input to the neural oscillator network makes it possible for the robot to walk up a step. For running on at terrain, we combine a spring mechanism and the neural oscillator network. It became clear in this study that the matching of two oscillations by the spring-mass system and the neural oscillator network is important in order to keep jumping in a pronk gait. The present study also shows that entrainment between neural oscillators causes the running gait to change from pronk to bound. This nding renders running fairly easy to attain in a bound gait. It must be noticed that the exible and robust dynamic walking on <b>irregular</b> <b>terrain</b> and the transition of the running gait are realized by the modication of a few parameters in the neural oscillator network...|$|R
