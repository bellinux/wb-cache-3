5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E

40|$|The mechanosensitive {{channel of}} large {{conductance}} MscL from Escherichia coli has been reconstituted into sealed vesicles, {{and the effects}} of lipid structure on the flux of the fluorescent molecule calcein through the open channel have been studied. The channel was opened by reaction of the G 22 C mutant of MscL with the reagent [2 -(triethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) which introduces five positive charges within the pore constriction. Flux through the channel was small when the lipid was phosphatidylcholine, but addition of the anionic lipids phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or cardiolipin up to 50 mol % resulted in increases in the amplitudes and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> calcein. Similar effects were seen when either wild-type MscL or the G 22 C mutant was opened by osmotic pressure difference; <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> calcein were very slow in the absence of anionic lipid but increased with increasing concentrations of phosphatidylglycerol to 50 mol %. The observed partial <b>release</b> <b>of</b> trapped calcein following activation of MscL was attributed to the formation of a long-lived subconductance state of MscL following channel opening. Effects of anionic lipid were attributed to an increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the transition from closed to fully open state and to a decrease in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the transition from the fully open state to the subconductance state. Higher concentrations of anionic lipid led to a decrease in the <b>rate</b> and amplitude <b>of</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> calcein, possibly due to a decreased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> flux through the open channel.

50|$|A {{hemihydrate}} form of estradiol, estradiol hemihydrate, {{is widely}} used medically under {{a large number of}} brand names similarly to estradiol. In terms of activity and bioequivalence, estradiol and its hemihydrate are identical, with the only disparities being an approximate 1% difference in potency by weight (due to the presence of water molecules in the hemihydrate form of the substance) and a slower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> with certain formulations of the hemihydrate. This is because estradiol hemihydrate is more hydrated than anhydrous estradiol, and for this reason, is more insoluble in water in comparison, which results in slower absorption rates with specific formulations of the drug such as vaginal tablets. Estradiol hemihydrate has also been shown to result in less systemic absorption as a vaginal tablet formulation relative to other topical estradiol formulations such as vaginal creams.|$|E

An HD session is {{used in this study}} as an in vivo model for studying the influence of heparin on oxidative stress caused partially by activated peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) during a HD session. MethodsEach patient underwent HD once with and once without heparin. Oxidative stress was determined by evaluating both the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> superoxide <b>release</b> from phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) -stimulated PMNLs and plasma levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), both measured before and after the dialysis session. ResultsIn vitro, heparin reduced the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> superoxide <b>release</b> from separated PMA-stimulated PMNLs. In vivo, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> superoxide <b>release</b> from PMNLs was always increased after the dialysis session, regardless of the presence of heparin. However, in the presence of heparin, this increase was significantly smaller. The augmentation in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> superoxide <b>release</b> after the dialysis session without heparin was accompanied by a significant elevation of GSSG, reflecting a preceding oxidation of plasma glutathione. ConclusionsThe increase in both parameters, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> superoxide <b>release,</b> and the plasma GSSG concentration after HD treatment suggest that heparin in vivo alleviates the oxidative stress induced by the dialysis process. Based on our results, heparin should be the anticoagulant of choice because of its suppressant action on HD-induced oxidative stress...|$|R
