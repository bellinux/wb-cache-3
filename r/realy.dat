Felicity says Jemima is not a romantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it {{in this case because}} it is a true story and her name <b>realy</b> was Jemima. My mothers uncle was named Thomas Taylor. He was poor at that time and so the father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him. Miss Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy about her and she wanted him too. She cried almost every night after her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to sleep or she would have died. And she was so frightened he might try to come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bull-dog too that would never let go. But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that. He waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church {{in the middle of the}} week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr and her family all went because her father was an elder. My mothers uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs family. When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr didnt but set bolt uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and wispered in her ear. I dont know what he said so I cant right it but Miss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head. Perhaps some people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered at prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs father had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when he was a respektable young man though not rich. Well when they were singing the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very quitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too real quick. Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round talking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers uncle Thomas were eloping outside. And what do you suppose they eloped in. Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay. And when he went out they were gone and his slay was gone also his horse. Of course my mothers uncle Thomas didnt steal the horse. He just borroed it and sent it home the next day. But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig to follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they got married. And they lived happy together forever afterwards. Mothers uncle Thomas lived to be a very old man. He died very suddent. He felt quite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead.|$|E

40|$|Speech is {{the vocal}} conduct of sense-making {{processes}} that involve both an external receiver (the hearer) {{and the speaker}} envisaged as an internal receiver: to speak is to cause one(self) to experience the emergence of organized thinking formatted by verbal patterns. Syntax {{is defined as a}} series of operational templates to be coupled with lexical selections to form phrases, following language-specific ritual syntactic agendas such as the subjet-predicate pair. However it is possible to decide at any moment of the execution of this process to go on following the structural beaten track or to open up new ones in the form of adverbials, subordinate clauses, insertions and so on. In this respect, prosody plays a metasyntactic role: prosodic events are the signature of metasyntactic decisions in real time and they "inform" both the interpreting hearer and the speaker himself, who <b>realies</b> on the symptoms of his own action {{to keep track of the}} ongoing developments.

40|$|This {{paper was}} first {{presented}} at the Temple Law Review Symposium on Executive Power. In Reynolds v. United States, the Supreme Court shaped the state secrets privilege (the Privilege) as one akin to that against self-incrimination. In recent litigation, the government has asserted the Privilege in motions for pre-discovery dismissal, thus transforming the Privilege into a form of executive immunity. This Paper argues that courts must step in to return the Privilege to a scope more in keeping with {{its status as a}} form of evidentiary privilege. After reviewing the doctrinal origins of the Privilege, the Paper explores three types of issues implicated by the government 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of the Privilege. The government, in calling for judicial deference to executive assertions of the Privilege, often <b>realies</b> on (1) separation of powers arguments or on (2) arguments sounding in institutional competence. Courts are often swayed by such arguments and thus give relatively little consideration to the (3) conflict of interest inherent in the government 2 ̆ 7 s assertion of the Privilege and the impact of the successful invocation of the Privilege on the rights of individual litigants. The Paper then proceeds to address arguments that Congress can provide a check on executive abuse of the Privilege. The Paper argues that, assuming that Congress has constitutional authority, it lacks the will or the institutional competence to provide a proper solution to the problems raised by the Privilege. Instead, the Paper contends that, since courts created the Privilege, courts are best positioned to rein it in. The final section of the Paper provides examples drawn from case law illustrating mechanisms whereby courts can protect state secrets while also giving litigants adverse to the government their day in court...|$|R

For example, Basil accidentally walks in on Jean hugging Mr. Lloyd, and not realising that they are family he tries to keep Mrs. Lloyd from the room where he saw them embracing. He shows her the kitchen, where Manuel is sleeping off the previous night's celebration in the linen basket. Finally he lets her up to the room, only to discover Polly (a family friend of the Lloyds) is now hugging Mr. Lloyd. He again distracts the now very edgy Mrs. Lloyd by showing her another room, explaining that the Lloyds' room is not as nice. When Mrs. Lloyd enters the room, she <b>realies</b> that it {{is exactly the same}} as the one Basil showed her. As he is leaving the room, Basil hears loud moaning noises from Alan and Jean's room and Polly hurries out, dressing herself (she has been trying on a dress Jean made for her and the moaning was because Jean had been massaging Alan's shoulders).

40|$|My {{paintings}} {{emerge from}} within a context best explained {{by reference to}} Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s perspectivism. That is an intellectual attitude that deprivileges rationalism and accommodates scepticism or unknowing as an acceptable starting point From this standpoint art/language {{can be seen as}} being in a state of becoming rather than as representing a state of being. This thesis aims to demonstrate, not only by a philosophical encounter with Giorgio de Chirico 2 ̆ 7 s work: ie. his use of myth, his Nietzschean perspectivism and his enigmatic interpretation of figuration, that the most helpful context and understanding of my work can be <b>realied.</b> De Chirico 2 ̆ 7 s art, like Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy seeks in its processes to explore the possible unity of Dionysian aesthetic force with the Apollonian. Neither Nietzsche nor de Chirico considered within a post-Socratic world that this unity was realizable. Nevertheless they both share in their respective art forms a need to represent the relentless struggle to enact the disjunction of the two aesthetic forces in a secular world. The artist’s enigmatic imagery is characterized by a consideration of appearance and reality and {{it is for this reason}} that the work was selected as a model for investigating the nature of enigma. His use of seemingly straightforward, ordinary images suggests a sense of accessibility, yet at the same time they are irreducible to knowing and my own image-making was greatly expanded by investigating these concerns. I am not arguing that de Chirico was influenced by Nietzsche but instead that Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical point of view and his use of poetic language to express these views lay in discovering the qualities and substance of the Dionysian spirit As well as working within a Nietzschean world-view set out in The Birth of Tragedy, de Chirico has also drawn on the Italian unification, specifically the Risorgimento and the lineage of these political and mythical figures were endemic to his art and they interface the with his use of the Apollonian-Dionysian disunity first explored by Nietzsche. The focus of the exegesis will be to present the poetic and philosophical use made of the latter in de Chirico’s art It is anticipated that this philosophical encounter with the aesthetic, social and political world of de Chirico will, not only assist in interpreting his life 2 ̆ 7 s work anew, but will also provide a context in which my paintings of enigma might be interpreted...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} day fossil fuel availability, cost, {{security}} and the pollutant emissions resulting from its use have driven industry into looking for alternative ways of powering vehicles. The aim {{of this research is}} to synthesize/design and develop a framework of novel control architectures which can result in complex powered vehicle subsystems to perform better with reduced exogeneuous information. This research looks into the area of energy management by proposing an intelligent based system which not only looks at the beaten path of where energy comes from and how much of it to use, but it goes further by taking into consideration the world around it. By operating without GPS, it <b>realies</b> on data such as usage, average consumption, system loads and even other surrounding vehicles are considered when making the difficult decisions of where to direct the energy into, how much of it, and even when to cut systems off in benefit of others. All this is achieved in an integrated way by working within the limitations of non-fossil fuelled energy sources like fuel cells, ultracapacitors and battery banks using driver-provided information or by crafting an artificial usage profile from historicaly learnt data. By using an organic computing philosophy based on artificial intelligence this alternative approach to energy supply systems presents a different perspective beginning by accepting the fact that when hardware is set energy can be optimized only so much and takes a step further by answering {{the question of how to}} best manage it when refuelling might not be an option. The result is a situationally aware system concept that is portable to any type of electrically powered platform be it ground, aerial or marine since it operates on the fact that all operate within three dimensional space. The system´s capabilities are then verified in a virtual reality environment which can be tailored to the meet reseach needs including allowing for different altitudes, environmental temperature and humidity profiles. This VR system is coupled with a chassis dynamometer to allow for testing of real physical prototype unmanned ground vehicles where the intelligent system will benefit by learning from real platform data. The Thesis contributions and objectives are summarised next:  The control system proposed includes an awareness of the surroundings within which the vehicle is operating without relying on GPS position information.  The system proposed is portable and could be used to control other systems.  The test platform developed within the Thesis is flexible and could be used for other systems.  The control system for the fuel cell system described within the work has included an allowance for altitude and humidity. These factors would appear to be significant for such systems.  The structure of the control system and its hierarchy is novel.  The ability of the system to be applied to a UAV and as such control a ‘vehicle’ in 3 dimensions, and yet be also applied to a ground vehicle, where roll and pitch are largely a function of the ground over which it travels (so the UGV only uses a subset of the control functionality).  The mission awareness of the control structure appears to be the heart of the potential contribution to knowledge, and that this also includes the ability to create an estimated, artificial mission profile should one not be input by the operators. This learnt / adaptive input could be expanded on to highlight this aspect...|$|R

In this paper, the discrete state space recursive filters are implemented in the form of array processors. The state space description permits the straightforward application of systolic architectures of the Kung-type to realize recursive filters of both 1 D and 2 D types. We show that the recursivity inherent to the filtering algorithm introduces a latency proportional to the filter order which has a direct effect on the computation throughput of these structures. Morover, we show that the use of CTP decomposition technique together with the cylindrical-type structures reduces significantly this latency and improves the computation throughput of these arrays. The processing cells of the systolic array are designed via Switched-Capacitor techniques...|$|E
