500|$|In an interview, Khaled Hosseini explains, [...] "I {{was searching}} for English {{translations}} of poems about Kabul, {{for use in a}} scene where a character bemoans leaving his beloved city, when I found this particular verse. I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found not only the right line for the scene, but also an evocative title in the phrase 'a thousand splendid suns,' which appears in the next-to-last stanza." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} for Mashinini came when she thought about how {{clothing}} produced in her factory was being used. [...] "When I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> personally helped to make these uniforms used for the slaughter of my people ... I felt horrified", she wrote in her autobiography. She resolved that union organising would always touch on larger political issues.|$|E
2500|$|I thought I {{had made}} it up. Then, rereading The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C. S. Lewis, I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{probably}} gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the Terebinth tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Maroney was 9 years old, {{she started}} {{training}} at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa, California. In 2012, she said, [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{a dream that}} I {{wanted to go to}} the Olympics and I wanted to go as far as I could go. I thought I should probably move to a new gym and start thinking about the Olympics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrick Moore, one of {{the initial}} founders of Greenpeace, said in a 2008 {{interview}} that, [...] "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot." [...] Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, calculates that nuclear power is many times safer than {{any other form of}} power generation.|$|E
2500|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred during}} the 2009 FIA WTCC Race of France in Pau, France. A succession of first-lap accidents caused the safety car {{to be placed on}} standby, with yellow flags waving on the start-finish section of the track. The safety car driver then proceeded to drive onto the track at slow speed, without official approval, moving across the pit exit line immediately after exiting the pits, instead of confining to the inside of it until the line ended. Race leader Franz Engstler came through the kink on the start-finish straight and was unable to avoid hitting the side of the pace car. Engstler commented [...] "I saw the safety car coming out from the right and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no chance to brake... I really do not understand why he was going out of the pits".|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she answered. [...] "With them it is different. I can {{scarcely}} yet <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a brother: {{think what it}} must be to Emilie to have the man whom she loved come back from the grave. Listen!" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{secondary}} {{theme is}} the self-destructiveness of traditional Chinese society, likening it to cannibalism. [...] "I <b>have</b> only just <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been living {{all these years}} {{in a place where}} for four thousand years they have been eating human flesh." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "No, I shall not. If {{he wishes}} me to listen he must begin by humbling {{himself in the}} dust--yes, the dust, Nettie! I won't take {{anything}} short of it. <b>I</b> insist <b>that</b> he shall <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suffered." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> {{began to}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made an awkward capture; <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> under my hand one whom I dared not set free, {{and could not}} take with me. It was a most perplexing situation, and during a few seconds I well nigh lost heart because of having thus plunged my comrades into yet greater difficulties.|$|R

6000|$|Later in {{the summer}} I saw the wreck of his garden, choked with weeds. [...] "Your garden," [...] I said, [...] "is in poor shape." [...] "Garden!" [...] he said indignantly.

6000|$|... "Justly? I {{thought you}} had your doubts of that. At any rate, I had {{when it came to}} hearing the girl accusing herself {{as if she had been}} guilty of some monstrous wickedness, and I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made her feel so." ...|$|E
60|$|But I was so {{completely}} bewildered by what {{had taken place}} {{that for a moment}} I did not know what had happened. Then I gradually became wide awake, and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been entrapped on board the vessel, which was probably short of sailors.|$|E
6000|$|... "... From {{an early}} age I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{exceptional}} abilities. Only a fool underestimates his capabilities.

5000|$|Perelman {{is known}} for being very {{selective}} about his projects. [...] "I don’t {{want to spend a}} year of my life working on a film that does not resonate with me on an emotional level.

5000|$|As a {{woman in}} {{leadership}} <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> an obligation to be a voice for the marginalized and <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> the Lord has encouraged me {{to speak out against}} issues of Gender Based Violence. We are seeing alarming numbers around the world — whether it is human trafficking here in the US or the rape and abuse of women around the world, we must be willing to speak up. Isn’t that what Jesus would do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to {{establish}} a more friendly understanding between us. You are an intelligent girl and cannot fail to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken a warm interest in your friend Mary Louise Burrows.

You are able to give me this information, I am sure, and by doing so you may be instrumental in assisting your friend materially." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! are you drawing {{it all out}} again?" [...] {{he asked}} in surprise. Then I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written fifty-six instead of six.

60|$|I was {{trembling}} with excitement {{as we went}} on, believing the time for our dangerous venture to be near at hand, and I prayed most fervently that the tempest which was seemingly gathering upon us, would burst before midnight. Then came a cold chill to my heart, as I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not had time to gather the skiffs as Hiram advised, because of having been occupied with showing him the best hiding places.|$|E
60|$|At {{about ten}} o'clock {{next morning we}} topped the scantily-timbered ridge which walls in the Lame Deer Agency, and looked down upon the tents of the troops.

60|$|As to our streets, I {{find them}} cleaner {{than they used}} to be.

6000|$|... "What {{an absurd}} idea!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What a {{perfectly}} absurd idea! Besides, {{although it did}} disappear, they came up {{and told me that}} there was a man lying in the boudoir. You understand now how it all happened," [...] he went on.

60|$|Lying there I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come to {{love the}} silence, the loneliness, the serenity, even the tragedy of this valley of shadows. Death Valley was one place that could never be popular with men. It had been set apart for the hardy diggers for earthen treasure, and for the wanderers of the wastelands--men who go forth to seek and to find and to face their souls. Perhaps most of them found death. But there was a death in life. Desert {{travelers}} learned the secret that men lived {{too much in the}} world--that in silence and loneliness and desolation there was something infinite, something hidden from the crowd.|$|E

Our eyes met as she drove past and I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found my long-sought ideal. I rushed back to town and hunted up Pete Manderson at the club. Pete is a donkey but he has his ways of being useful. He told me who she was. Her name is Stephanie Gardiner; she is his cousin {{from the south and}} is visiting his mother. And, Freda, I am to dine at the Mandersons' tonight. I shall meet her." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the film}} A Man Who Was Superman, Jun {{cut off her}} {{signature}} long silky hair to play a cynical documentary producer who meets an odd, Hawaiian-shirt-clad modern-day hero who battles urban apathy and preaches the virtues of lending a hand. Of initially feeling pressured at {{the opportunity to work}} with acclaimed actor Hwang Jung-min, she said, [...] "Although luck was probably involved, I think it's destiny for an actor to 'meet' new work. On the first day I met him, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> much to learn from him, not only from his acting, but also as an individual." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He (Premiji) was {{considered}} to be a Pandit—a scholar of Jain tradition. To me it was a surprise! How could his writings be so impartial and audacious? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> developed the perception {{that it was impossible to}} find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.|$|R
