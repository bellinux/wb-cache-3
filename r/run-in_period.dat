30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{of our study}} was the timing of imaging and biopsy. Our intentions were to assess the same lesion by imaging and biopsy and to schedule FDG PET scans before biopsy. However, clinical scheduling (diagnostic biopsy preceding PET scans) and feasibility concerns (i.e., imaging of lesions near a high-contrast organ or biopsy of an inaccessible tumor) had to be accommodated. We did not find evidence that post-biopsy inflammation strongly affected SUV. For three AI patients with baseline FDG PET within 21 days after biopsy of the index lesion (6, 13, 17 days), the percent changes in SUV were − 28 %, − 7 %, and − 3 %. For the three AI patients with post-therapy FDG PET within 21 days after biopsy (3, 5, 7 days), the percent changes in SUV were − 14 %, − 47 %, and − 60 %. If post-biopsy SUV were inflated, the opposite trend (greater decrease when the baseline scan occurred post-biopsy, lesser decrease when the post-therapy scan occurred post-biopsy) would be expected. Extension of <b>run-in</b> <b>periods</b> may be considered to avoid having post-therapy scans within a healing period after the baseline biopsy.|$|R

40|$|Background: Butter {{is known}} to have a cholesterol-raising effect and, therefore, has often been {{included}} as a negative control in di-etary studies, whereas the effect of moderate butter intake has not been elucidated to our knowledge. Objective: We compared the effects of moderate butter intake, moderate olive oil intake, or a habitual diet on blood lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose, and insulin. Design: The study was a controlled, double-blinded, randomized 2 3 5 -wk crossover dietary intervention study with a 14 -d <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> during which subjects consumed their habitual diets. The study included 47 healthy men and women (mean 6 SD total cho-lesterol: 5. 22 6 0. 90 mmol/L) who substituted a part of their ha-bitual diets with 4. 5 % of energy from butter or refined olive oil. Results: Study subjects were 70 % women with a mean age and body mass index (in kg/m 2) of 40. 4 y and 23. 5, respectively. Butter intake increased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol more than did olive oil intake (P, 0. 05) and the <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> (P, 0. 005 and P, 0. 05, respectively) and increased HDL cholesterol compared with the <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> (P, 0. 05). No difference in effects was observed for triacylglycerol, hsCRP, insulin, and glucose concen-trations. The intake of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher in the butter period compared with olive oil and the <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> (P, 0. 0001). Conclusions:Moderate intake of butter resulted in increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with the effects of olive oil intake and a habitual diet (<b>run-in</b> <b>period).</b> Furthermore, mod-erate butter intake was also followed by an increase in HDL cholesterol compared with the habitual diet. We conclude that hypercholesterolemic people should keep their consumption of butter to a minimum, whereas moderate butter intake may be considered part of the diet in the normocholesterolemic pop-ulation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus, fasting {{blood glucose}} values are increased due to increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. As miglitol (BAY m- 1099), an absorbable alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, can inhibit glycogenolysis, we investigated whether 200 mg miglitol ingested at bedtime could decrease fasting blood glucose values. METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients participated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The study duration was 6 weeks: 2 weeks <b>run-in,</b> 2 test <b>periods</b> of 1 week with 2 weeks of wash-out in between. During <b>run-in</b> and wash-out <b>periods</b> placebo tablets were used. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin (FIRI), C-peptide (FCP), glucagon (FG), pyruvate and alanine were measured {{at the start of}} the study, at the end of the <b>run-in</b> and wash-out <b>periods,</b> and at the 6 th and 7 th day of each test period.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of a water-washed soy protein concentrate with a milk-protein based control on blood lipid levels in hyperlipidemic men and women. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial including 159 subjects. After a 3 -week <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> during which all subjects consumed a milk protein-based supplement, participants were randomized into one of two groups: a control group (continued milk protein) and an intervention group (soy protein) for a five-week period. Fasting venous blood draws for lipid measurement were obtained at baseline, {{towards the end of the}} <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> and at the end of the intervention. Blood isoflavone concentrations were measured at the end of the study. RESULTS: Blood lipid levels were not significantly different between groups at any point in time; and there were no significant associations between blood isoflavones and lipid levels. Significant decreases in total cholesterol (19 mg/dL), and LDL-cholesterol (11 mg/dL), were observed during the <b>run-in</b> <b>period,</b> with no further decreases in lipids during the intervention period in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that water-washed soy protein has an effect on blood lipids.

30|$|Run sum charts (Reynolds 1971; Aguirre-Torres and Reyes-López 1999) {{are also}} a pair of {{personalized}} charts, named X-bar and R charts, used to assess changes in the mean and dispersion of the process due to special causes. These charts do not use Shewhart’s control rules separately. Instead, they incorporate a simple automatic procedure in which weights previously assigned to each control chart zone are added up depending on where the data, sampled beforehand, fall. Starting at zero, weights are added for all observations {{on the same side}} of the central line of the chart. Once an observation falls on the opposite side of the central line, the sum is reset to the weight associated with the control zone where the observation fell. The latter is also done when the total sum of weights exceeds a pre-specified threshold. In such case, a special variation cause is identified at the point where the threshold was overcome. In this work, Reynolds’ (1971) weights and threshold were considered. These are: 0 for observations in Zone C, 1 for observations in Zone B, 2 for observations in Zone A, and 3 for observations beyond Zone A (control zones are represented in Fig.  2 and explained in more detail in the next section); threshold 5. Aguirre-Torres and Reyes-López (1999) demonstrated that this score system is less sensitive to small changes in dispersion and is likely to reduce the amount of false alarms. They also introduced a procedure to construct the R chart that allows using the same score system in both run sum charts. We followed the procedure to construct the charts described in detail in Aguirre-Torres and Reyes-López (1999). Both run sum charts are based on the average and range of rational subgroups which are groups of successive observations from the same patient. We selected the minimum possible rational subgroup size that these charts allow: two observations. Because the run sum procedure can only be applied when data are observed, we assessed these charts on the following scenarios: (1) only available data are used, ignoring episode-free run-in periods; (2) all data used, with missing data imputed through last value carried forward procedure and ignoring episode-free run-in periods; (3) episode-free <b>run-in</b> <b>periods</b> used to define the control zones, using mean imputation if data missing, and the run sum procedure was carried out over follow-up data (a) available, and (b) imputed using last value carried forward.

Twenty-seven healthy volunteers consumed 180 g of wheat/rye bread with or without in situ-produced AXOS (WR+ and WR-, respectively) daily for 3 wk. Consumption of WR+ corresponded to an AXOS intake of similar to 2. 14 g/d.

A theoretical value of the difference in the fuel consumption between the new and run-in vehicle is about 8 % in favor of the run-in vehicle. The European legislation does not specify after how many kilometers the vehicle stops to be considered new. This can lead to disputes when testing emissions from the new vehicle and those from the vehicle having the control software already installed.

Methods: This double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial evaluated {{the effects of}} consuming WBE at 0 (control) or 5. 0 g/day for 3 weeks in 29 healthy children (8 - 12 years). Fecal levels of microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, ammonia, moisture, and fecal pH were assessed {{at the end of}} each treatment and at the end of a 1 -week <b>run-in</b> (RI) <b>period.</b> In addition, the subjects completed questionnaires scoring distress severity of 3 surveyed GI symptoms.

40|$|Background: A Westernised lifestyle, which {{involves}} a high-energy diet and reduced physical activity, is indisputably {{linked to the}} pandemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Prevention of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes is a public health goal. Intake of fish {{has been associated with}} reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but data from randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive. Lean fish contains relatively low amount of marine omega- 3 fatty acids, and data from both animal and human studies indicate a beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Studies investigating the potential protective effect of lean- seafood in healthy subjects are warranted. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis was to elucidate how lean-seafood can modulate fasting and postprandial metabolism of lipids and glucose in healthy humans. Subjects and Methods: Healthy Caucasian subjects were recruited from the great area of Bergen. The study included two 4 -weeks experimental periods separated by a 5 -weeks washout period in a crossover design. Prior to each experimental period, the subjects followed a diet in accordance with the Norwegian dietary recommendations for 3 weeks <b>run-in</b> <b>periods.</b> Half of the group (6 men and 8 women) was randomly assigned to begin with a lean-seafood diet and the other group (4 men and 9 women) to a nonseafood diet. The lean-seafood diet consisted of lunch- and dinner meals with cod, pollack, saithe and scallops and the nonseafood diet contained skinless chicken filet, lean beef, turkey, pork, egg, milk and milk products. The protein contribution from the experimental protein sources in both diets corresponded to 60 % of total protein intake, and the remaining dietary proteins came from vegetable and cereal sources. Results: Healthy subjects had after 4 weeks lean-seafood intervention, a highly significant reduction in fasting and postprandial circulating TAG concentrations, relative to the 4 weeks nonseafood intervention. There is evidence that raised circulating TAG levels are associated with increased coronary heart disease risk. The TAG/ HDL-cholesterol ratio was decreased during the lean-seafood intervention and increased during the nonseafood intervention. The intervention did not alter fasting and postprandial serum glucose or insulin concentration. However, lean-seafood intake reduced postprandial C-peptide and lactate concentrations. Lean-seafood intake improved mitochondrial oxidative capacity as indicated by human urinary metabolomics. All results are consistent, indicating an improved preservation of insulin-sensitivity after lean-seafood consumption. Conclusion: Based on our data lean-seafood regulates fasting and postprandial lipids and glucose metabolism differently in healthy subjects after four weeks. Lean- seafood modulate fasting and postprandial lipids, and postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals in a manner that may {{have an effect on the}} long- term development of cardiovascular disease, insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes. An increased intake of lean-seafood should be encouraged as a part of a healthy diet in the prevention of CVD and T 2 D, and therefore may have a part of combating the development of these health challenges. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} study compared 6 months' {{treatment of}} 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Half were randomly allocated to treatment with chloroquine 250 mg daily, {{the other half}} dapsone 100 mg daily (50 mg/day for the first 7 days) following a one-month <b>run-in</b> assessment <b>period.</b> All patients had active or progressing disease. Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in morning stiffness, number of painful joints, pain scores, Ritchie index, and proximal interphalangeal joint size, and the chloroquine group alone in grip strength. Laboratory tests showed significant decreases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and total serum protein levels, with significant increase in serum albumin in the dapsone group, {{where there was a}} significant mean drop in haemoglobin (less than 1 g/dl) and a rise in serum bilirubin, associated with its haemolytic effect. X-ray erosion scores were not significantly affected. The clinical and laboratory responses became evident {{by the time of the}} 2 -month assessment. Criteria for clinical and laboratory improvement were defined, according to which there were 21 / 26 improvers in the chloroquine group and 12 / 29 in the dapsone group. It is concluded that although both are effective preparations, chloroquine showed a significantly higher improvement rate and was certainly better tolerated. It is the preferred treatment for patients with active or progressive disease not controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with dapsone as an alternative for patients who fail to respond to or cannot tolerate chloroquine...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective study was to define the limits below which ambulatory blood pressure (BP) does not decrease in patients with essential hypertension, when the decision to institute and intensify drug treatment is based on conventional blood pressure measurements. After a 1 month placebo <b>run-in</b> <b>period,</b> 30 patients were treated for 1 year with the converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or the calcium antagonist isradipine; dose adjustments and the decision to add hydrochlorothiazide were based on conventional blood pressure measurements in the clinic. Ambulatory blood pressure was recorded during 24 h in the <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> and after 16, 24, and 52 weeks of active therapy. The baseline ambulatory blood pressure below which pressure does, on average, not decrease during active treatment {{was defined as the}} pressure at which the regression line between the on-treatment pressure and blood pressure in the <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> intersects the line of identity. The systolic/diastolic blood pressure limits were similar for the three assessments during active treatment and averaged 128 / 88 mm Hg for daytime, 106 / 73 mm Hg for nighttime pressure, and 119 / 81 mm Hg for the whole 24 h, with upper 95 % confidence limits of 137 / 93, 115 / 78, and 127 / 86 mm Hg, respectively.

Manic and depressive episodes were defined as an ASRM score ≥  10 or a QIDS score ≥  15, respectively. An episode-free <b>run-in</b> <b>period</b> of eight consecutive weeks without an episode of either type was used to calibrate control charts. Shewhart’s rules were then applied to follow-up data.

40|$|Abstract Background Frequent {{exacerbations}} {{induce a}} high burden to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We investigated {{the course of}} exacerbations in the published COSMIC study that investigated the effects of 1 -year withdrawal of fluticasone after a 3 -month <b>run-in</b> treatment <b>period</b> with salmeterol/fluticasone in patients with COPD. Methods In 373 patients, we evaluated diary cards for symptoms, Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), and salbutamol use and assessed their course during exacerbations. Results There were 492 exacerbations in 224 patients. The level of symptoms of cough, sputum, dyspnea and nocturnal awakening steadily increased from 2 weeks prior to exacerbation, with a sharp rise during the last week. Symptoms of cough, sputum, and dyspnea reverted to baseline values at different rates (after 4, 4, and 7 weeks respectively), whereas symptoms of nocturnal awakening were still increased after eight weeks. The course of symptoms was similar around a first and second exacerbation. Increases in symptoms and salbutamol use and decreases in PEF were associated with a higher risk to develop an exacerbation, but with moderate predictive values, the areas under the receiver operating curves ranging from 0. 63 to 0. 70. Conclusions Exacerbations of COPD are associated with increased symptoms that persist for weeks and the course is very similar between a first and second exacerbation. COPD exacerbations are preceded by increased symptoms and salbutamol use and lower PEF, yet predictive values are too low to warrant daily use in clinical practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{effect of}} {{food on the}} {{cardiovascular}} safety of tamsulosin modified release (MR) capsules 0. 4 mg in elderly subjects was assessed both after single and multiple dosing. Methods: Thirty-six elderly (age {{greater than or equal}} to 60 years) male volunteers were recruited and after a single-blind, placebo <b>run-in</b> C, <b>period</b> of I day were randomised to active treatment (n = 24) or placebo (n = 12). In each group the effect of food on vital signs and orthostatic stress testing was assessed in a crossover design after a single dose (Days 1 and 8 with a 7 day wash-out) and after 14 days of multiple dosing under fasting and fed conditions. Results: Changes in vital signs and orthostatic stress responses were more pronounced in the fasted than in the fed state. A total of 86 positive orthostatic stress tests were observed of which only three were symptomatic. Forty-six of these 86 tests were considered positive because of an effect on at least two criteria. The incidence of positive tests was higher in the fasted state and was increased by tamsulosin MR compared with placebo. Conclusions: Vital signs and orthostatic stress testing are more influenced by tamsulosin 0. 4 mg MR capsules in the fasted than in the fed state. As tamsulosin MR is intended to be taken after breakfast or the first meal of the day, lack of compliance with this instruction may increase the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in elderly males.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether alterations in membrane lipids affect transmembrane cationic transport systems in erythrocytes and platelets, cationic fluxes and intracellular cationic concentrations were measured in hypercholesterolaemic patients before and during administration of an inhibitor of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methlglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. METHODS: After a 1 -month <b>run-in</b> placebo <b>period</b> on a lipid-lowering diet the patients were treated, in a double-blind manner, with either placebo (n = 25) or pravastatin (n = 25) for 6 months. Placebo or pravastatin (10 mg during the first month, 20 mg during the second month and 40 mg during the remaining 4 months) was administered once {{a day in the}} evening. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, the erythrocyte and platelet membrane cholesterol content was reduced in the patients treated with pravastatin. The intra-erythrocyte and intraplatelet Na+ concentration was reduced during pravastatin administration, whereas the activity of the erythrocyte and platelet Na(+) -K+ pump was increased. However, the intra-erythrocyte and intraplatelet K+, Mg 2 + and cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations, and water content, as well as the activities of the erythrocyte Na(+) -Li+ countertransporter and Na+,K+ cotransporter, and Na+ and K+ leakage, were not changed during pravastatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present data show that cholesterol lowering in hypercholesterolaemic patients may result in a significant decrease in erythrocyte and platelet membrane cholesterol content. These changes in membrane cholesterol are accompanied by an increase in activity of the Na(+) -K+ pump and a decrease in intra-erythrocyte and intraplatelet Na+ concentrations. status: publishe...|$|R
