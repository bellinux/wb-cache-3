5000|$|Koch's pre-war rule in East Prussia was {{characterized}} by efforts to collectivize the local agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with his critics {{inside and outside the}} Party. He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local peasants. However, through publicly funded emergency <b>relief</b> programs concentrating <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> land-improvement projects and road construction, the [...] "Erich Koch Plan" [...] for East Prussia allegedly made the province free of unemployment; on August 16, 1933 Koch reported to Hitler that unemployment had been banished entirely from East Prussia, a feat that gained admiration throughout the Reich.|$|R

5000|$|The {{by-election}} {{took place}} on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner, with a majority of only 47 votes over Hopkin. [...] Jones had made {{his opposition to the}} land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division’s farmers, many of whom shared Mond’s concern about the nationalisation proposals. In any event the Green Book had by this time been withdrawn as a full statement of Liberal land policy. Instead, Jones promoted as the main object of Liberal land policy the desire to give security of tenure to tenant farmers. Many of those reliant on the land for their livelihood seemed to prefer the less radical solution of the government of Stanley Baldwin for the <b>relief</b> of rates <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> land.|$|R

40|$|Indian {{agriculture}} {{today is}} under a large crisis. An average farmer- household’s returns from cultivation would be around one thousand rupees per month. The state {{of the vast majority}} of small and marginal farmers and agricultural labourers is even worse. An extreme form of response to this crisis is the increasing incidence of farmers’ suicides. Some estimates are provided from National Sample Survey (NSS) region wise information on returns to cultivation and on some aspects of farmers’ indebtedness based on the 33 rd schedule 59 th round survey of 2003.

25|$|The bill {{may also}} be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities. Reliefs are {{administered}} by the local authority {{and they do not}} affect the rateable value of a property.

In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority.

50|$|In {{the event}} Jones {{did not have}} to wait until the next general {{election}} as Mond accepted a peerage in 1928 and caused a by-election in Carmarthen. At the previous general election in 1924 the Conservatives had not fielded a candidate and Mond had won easily in a straight fight with Labour. However this time, they put up the barrister, Sir Courtenay Mansel, another escapee from the Liberal Party in 1926 who had been MP for Penryn and Falmouth from 1922-23 but who had local connections in Carmarthenshire and was also a Justice of the Peace there. The Labour candidate was the Welsh barrister (and future MP) Dan Hopkin. There was briefly the prospect of a four-cornered contest when the National Party of Wales announced their intention to stand a candidate but in the end they decided not to fight. The by-election took place on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner. Jones had made his opposition to the land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division’s farmers, many of whom shared Mond’s concern about the nationalisation proposals.

50|$|The boards {{have been}} {{constituted}} under the Haryana Relief of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Indebtedness</b> Act. Though the Act was enacted in 1989, the boards have been constituted {{to make the}} Act really effective. The boards have the jurisdiction to provide relief to debtors of not only a cooperative bank, cooperative society, nationalised bank or commercial bank, {{but also to the}} debtors of private creditors and money-lenders. Any debtor, who has paid more than double the principal amount, can approach the board. Section 3 (e) and 4 of the Act under which these boards were constituted provided rescheduling of the debts of farmers with regard to the repayment capacity of the debtor. Section 12 (5) provided that in case the debtor has repaid to the creditor an amount equal to or exceeding double the principal amount, or the debtor on being apprised of such findings pays an amount which makes total repayment equal to double the amount of principal, the board shall have the power to declare the debt as fully discharged.|$|R
