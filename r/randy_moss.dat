5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able to be productive as a rookie, much like receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E
5|$|Under {{head coach}} Dennis Green, the Vikings were {{perennial}} playoff contenders throughout the 1990s, but they experienced little success once {{they reached the}} postseason. In {{the first round of}} the 1998 NFL Draft, the Vikings selected wide receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> who, despite his talent, was passed by several teams, even those in need of a wide receiver, due to concerns surrounding Moss's misbehavior and multiple arrests during high school and college. Moss used this as motivation to make teams who passed on him regret their decision. That year, Moss set the NFL record for most touchdown receptions by a rookie with 17, and combined with future Hall of Fame wide receiver Cris Carter and quarterback Randall Cunningham, he formed the centerpiece of the Vikings' offensive attack, which also set an NFL record by scoring 556 points during the season. The Vikings' defense was led by future Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle and was ranked 6th overall in points allowed during the season.|$|E

5000|$|While {{attending}} Michigan State University, {{joined by}} {{his best friend}} from high school, Bill Missant, Rogers played for the Michigan State Spartans football team from 2000 to 2002. He broke numerous receiving records. Rogers still holds the school records for most touchdowns in a career with 27, breaking the record held by former Spartans wide receiver Kirk Gibson, and the school record for most receiving yards in a single game with 270. He broke <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss's</b> NCAA record of 13 consecutive games with a touchdown catch. During his 2002 junior season, he had 68 receptions for 1,351 yards and 13 touchdowns, won the Fred Biletnikoff Award and Paul Warfield Trophy as the best college wide receiver in the nation, and was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American.

25|$|After {{originally}} {{signing a}} letter of intent to play college football with Notre Dame in 1995, Moss {{took part in a}} racially charged fight at his high school that left one person hospitalized. On March 23, 1995, Moss had backed a friend in a hallway fight against a white student who had allegedly used racist comments towards <b>Randy's</b> friend. <b>Moss</b> was initially charged with a felony for kicking the student, but it was later reduced to a misdemeanor.

25|$|During {{the second}} day of the draft, the Patriots added yet another wide receiver, this time trading a fourth-round draft pick (which the Patriots {{acquired}} the day before from the San Francisco 49ers with the 49ers' 2008 first-round pick in exchange for the Patriots' original 2007 first-round pick) to the Oakland Raiders for <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> who agreed to take a pay cut of over US$6million.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2008, Moss {{announced}} {{the formation of}} <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> Motorsports, an auto racing team in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. In July 2008, Moss {{announced that he had}} bought a 50 percent share in Morgan-Dollar Motorsports, with the team's No. 46 entry switching to No. 81. However, the team was reportedly shut down in 2012, according to Truck Series reporter Ray Dunlap.|$|E
25|$|Playing in {{his first}} playoff game as a Patriot, <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> who led the NFL in {{receiving}} yards, had one reception. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady set the NFL record for completion percentage in a single game (92.9%) with 26 of 28 completions for 263yards and 3 touchdowns, while running back Laurence Maroney added 162 total yards (122 on the ground). Overall, New England gained 401yards and didn't punt the ball until 31seconds remained in the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> {{smoked a}} joint {{just prior to}} turning himself into jail. He was {{scheduled}} to finish {{the remainder of his}} 30-day sentence for misdemeanor battery while in high school. During his first week in jail, Moss was given a drug test that came back positive. He was placed in solitary confinement for a week and had 60 days attached to his 27-day sentence. Coach Bobby Bowden revoked his scholarship and Moss was dismissed from Florida State University for the failed drug test.|$|E
25|$|During the team's Week 2 matchup {{against the}} New England Patriots, after getting beaten for a deep {{touchdown}} by <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> Revis left {{the game with}} what was later revealed to be a strained hamstring. Revis would miss {{two weeks of the}} season. Revis reaggravated the hamstring following the team's matchup against the Minnesota Vikings. On October 17, 2010, Revis was activated two hours prior to kickoff against the Denver Broncos and started the game. The Jets headed into a bye week following their victory over Denver thus allowing Revis to rehab his hamstring. Revis has since declared himself to be 100 percent.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing a}} {{combined}} 122 games of starting {{experience for the}} team in Samuel, Gay, and Wilson, the Patriots added back to their secondary by signing cornerbacks Lewis Sanders and Fernando Bryant, who were both released by their former teams, {{as well as two}} unrestricted free agents – cornerback Jason Webster and safety Tank Williams. Also signed via unrestricted free agency were wide receiver Sam Aiken, linebacker Victor Hobson. and tight end Marcus Pollard. Free agents or potential free agents Tedy Bruschi, Lonie Paxton, Kelley Washington, <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> Jabar Gaffney, Ray Ventrone, Mike Wright, Wesley Britt, and Pierre Woods were all re-signed.|$|E
25|$|For 2011, Bodine {{struggled}} with consistency, as he suffered bad luck {{in most of}} the first 10 races. Sponsorship was also a constant issue for the No. 30 team, and they managed to run 10 races with limited sponsorship. However, after Kentucky, Germain was unable to send the 30 team to Iowa without a sponsor. The week before the race at Iowa, Germain partnered with <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> Motorsports to put Bodine in their 5 truck for the rest of 2011. Bodine went winless in 2011, and subsequently left Germain when the team decided to put its focus on the Sprint Cup Series.|$|E
25|$|December 29, 2007: The New England Patriots {{closed out}} their undefeated 16–0 regular season at Giants Stadium with a 38–35 {{win over the}} New York Giants {{in front of a}} record regular season crowd on 79,110. In the fourth quarter, Patriots QB Tom Brady broke Peyton Manning's NFL record of 49 TD passes set in 2004, with his NFL record 50th TD pass, a 65-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> who on the same play set the record for most touchdown receptions in a single season with 23, breaking the record held previously by Jerry Rice with 22 touchdown receptions set in 1987.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} day of the NFL Draft, the Patriots and Raiders {{discussed}} the trade several times before reaching an agreement. Bill Belichick spoke with Moss for the first time about the possibility of joining the Patriots at 2:30am Sunday morning. Moss then boarded a plane and arrived in Boston later that morning on April 29 and was required to pass a team administered physical. Once he was cleared by Patriots officials, a trade was completed that sent <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> to New England in exchange for a fourth-round selection in the 2007 NFL Draft. The draft pick had been acquired by the Patriots the previous day from the San Francisco 49ers, and the Raiders selected John Bowie.|$|E
25|$|The 2010–11 {{season was}} a step down for the Minnesota Vikings. After coming within a few plays of Super Bowl XLIV, Minnesota ended the 2010 season with a 6–10 record and a last place finish in the NFC North {{for the first time}} since 1990. During the season, the Vikings had many distractions, {{including}} trading for <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> and then waiving him only a month later, Brett Favre's NFL investigation for allegedly sending inappropriate text messages to Jets' employee Jenn Sterger while he was with the team in 2008, the Metrodome's collapse and resulting venue changes, and finally head coach Brad Childress' firing on November 22 following a 31–3 loss at the hands of the rival Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from their}} own 42-yard line after the punt, the Patriots reached the Jets' 25-yard line, where kicker Stephen Gostkowski lined up for a 42-yard field goal attempt. However, the snap was fumbled by holder Matt Cassel, and {{recovered}} by Cassel to turn the ball over on downs. The Jets responded with a 10-play, 66-yard drive, tying the game at 7–7 on a 7-yard pass from Pennington to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Several plays into the Patriots' ensuing drive, {{before and after the}} two-minute warning, wide receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> caught passes of 33- and 22-yards from quarterback Tom Brady to put the Patriots in the Jets' red zone. Brady then connected with tight end Benjamin Watson on a 5-yard touchdown pass that was reviewed by the booth but upheld, giving the Patriots a 14–7 lead going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Jets {{opened the}} season with a match-up against the Miami Dolphins. Revis, the {{established}} starter, intercepted former Jet Chad Pennington's pass in the end zone with five seconds remaining in the game to preserve the Jets' 20–14 victory. A week later, Revis held Patriots wide receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> to two catches for 22 yards. Mangini praised Revis' attention to detail and perfecting the flaws of his game. Revis was beaten by Chris Chambers for a 27-yard touchdown during the Jets' week three contest against the San Diego Chargers—he recorded two tackles in the loss to San Diego. The following week, the Jets faced the Arizona Cardinals with wide receivers Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin. He intercepted two Kurt Warner passes, one of which he returned 32 yards for a touchdown, the first of his NFL career.|$|E
25|$|The No. 5 truck {{started out}} in 2004 at Bang! Racing as the No. 42 driven by Mike Skinner. Skinner started the year with two top-fives, but his {{performance}} began to decline, and his team was sold to Davis, changing to the No. 5, starting at the Las Vegas 350. He won two poles and had a sixth-place run at the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In 2005, he won seven poles and two races, at Bristol and Richmond respectively, finishing fifth in points. In 2006, he had thirteen top-tens including a win at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and almost won the 2007 championship before suffering tire failures in the season finale. Skinner was signed to drive for TRT through the 2009 season. However, due to concerns over the economy, the team shut down the entire truck program, with Skinner taking the number 5 with him to <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> Motorsports.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{conditions}} of the trade was that <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> would have to restructure his contract for salary cap reasons. Just hours before the Moss trade was completed, New England quarterback Tom Brady converted $5.28 million of his 2007 base salary into a signing bonus that was spread out over the remaining portion of his contract so that it could free up cap room. This enabled the Patriots to absorb Moss' incoming contract under the salary cap. Moss had two years remaining on his current deal and was scheduled to earn $9.75 million in 2007 and $11.25 million in 2008. Once the Patriots had Moss on their roster, he quickly agreed to a new one-year contract to replace his old one. The new deal gave him a $500,000 signing bonus, a base salary of $2.5 million, and the ability to earn an additional $1.75 million in incentives.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Kvapil {{returned}} to a full-time ride in the Long John Silver's-sponsored Ford for Front Row Motorsports. This car changed numbers throughout the year, using either No. 34, No. 37, or No. 38, depending on each number's position in points (with the goal being to get all three cars in the Top 35 for 2011). In 2011, Kvapil {{returned to}} FRM full-time in the No. 38 car, but signed up {{to compete for the}} Camping World Truck Series championship with <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> Motorsports in their No. 5 Toyota. After 10 races, however, Kvapil was released in favor of defending Truck champion Todd Bodine, whose Germain Racing team partnered with RMM to continue running that driver for 2011. Kvapil stuck with FRM in the Cup Series, driving their No. 38 for most races, except in several late-season races, J. J. Yeley swapped rides with Kvapil several times, with the latter driving FRM's start and park No. 55.|$|E
25|$|After the interception, Jeff George led the Vikings 96 {{yards in}} eight plays, {{completing}} passes to <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> and Jake Reed for gains of 24 and 41 yards and finishing the drive with a 22-yard touchdown completion to Cris Carter, cutting the score to 14–10 5:07 {{into the second}} quarter. Later on, Rams defensive back Dexter McCleon intercepted a pass from George on the Vikings 41-yard line. But on the next play, Faulk fumbled a handoff and safety Robert Griffith recovered {{the ball on the}} 47. After that, Minnesota took the lead by driving 53 yards and scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run from fullback Leroy Hoard with 2:40 left in the half. Aided by Bruce's 22-yard reception, the Rams responded with a drive to the Minnesota 37-yard line, but a 9-yard sack by defensive lineman John Randle pushed St. Louis out of field goal range and the score remained 17–14 by halftime.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} rosters for {{the game}} were released on December 18, 2007, with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady starting for the AFC and the Green Bay Packers' Brett Favre for the NFC. However, Brett Favre withdrew due to an ankle injury. Notable Pro Bowl selections included the late Sean Taylor. The Dallas Cowboys had a record thirteen players named to the Pro Bowl roster, while five teams, including all {{four members of the}} NFC South, had no players initially named (Jeff Garcia of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was later chosen as a replacement quarterback for Brett Favre.) On February 4, 2008, Brady, Patriots receiver <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss,</b> Chargers tight end Antonio Gates, and Chargers defensive lineman Jamal Williams decided {{to pull out of the}} 2008 Pro Bowl. Brady was replaced by Cleveland Browns quarterback Derek Anderson, Moss was replaced by Cincinnati Bengals receiver Chad Johnson, Gates was replaced by Browns tight end Kellen Winslow, and Williams was replaced by Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Casey Hampton.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 2005, Vikings wide {{receiver}} <b>Randy</b> <b>Moss</b> {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for linebacker Napoleon Harris and the Raiders' first round draft pick. After struggling to a disappointing 2–5 start to the 2005 season, Vikings lost quarterback Daunte Culpepper to a season-ending knee injury. This injury was a very significant part to this Minnesota Vikings team due to the fact they also lost Moss. The dynamic duo from years earlier were now gone and a new leader would eventually emerge. The Vikings finished the 2005 season with a 9–7 record. However, this season would be more notable for off-the-field events. In October, 17 team members were part of a party of about 90 that went out on a pleasure cruise on local Lake Minnetonka. The incident erupted into scandal when media reported that a number of the players had performed sex acts and that prostitutes had been flown in. Four players were ultimately charged with misdemeanors related to the party.|$|E
