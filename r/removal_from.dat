40|$|In this study, {{effluent}} {{from the}} biological treatment of wastewater from a resin-producing factory containing recalcitrant compounds was ozonated under different conditions. Afterwards, the biodegradability of the ozonated effluent was studied under anoxic conditions. The post-ozonation {{of the industrial}} effluent was performed using {{a wide range of}} ozone doses, from 1. 8 to 29. 5 mg L− 1 min− 1. After the biological treatment of the ozonated effluent, organic carbon and nitrogen <b>removals</b> <b>from</b> 27 to 97 % and from 27 to 80 %, respectively, were achieved. The effect of the contact time was studied at a constant ozone dose of 13. 0 ± 1. 2 mg L− 1 min− 1 and contact times ranging from 30 to 180 min. In this case, organic carbon <b>removals</b> <b>from</b> 55 to 100 % and organic nitrogen <b>removals</b> <b>from</b> 41 to 77 % were obtained after biological treatment...|$|R
