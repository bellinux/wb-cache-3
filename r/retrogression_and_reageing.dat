40|$|AbstractHigh {{strength}} {{aluminium alloy}} AA 7075 (Al–Zn–Mg–Cu) is a precipitate hardenable alloy {{widely used in}} the aerospace, defense, marine and automobile industries. Use of the heat treatable aluminium alloys in all these sectors is ever-increasing owing to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and reasonably good corrosion resistance. The shortage in corrosion resistance, however, usually poses negative concern about their reliability and lifetime when they service in the variable marine environments. These alloys also exhibit low weldability due to poor solidification microstructure, porosity in fusion zone and lose their mechanical properties when they are welded by fusion welding techniques. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a reliable technique to retain {{the properties of the}} alloy as the joining takes place in the solid state. The welds are susceptible to corrosion due to the microstructural changes in the weld nugget during FSW.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum alloy 7075 is {{a useful}} {{material}} in industry due to its light weight, high strength, and resistance to general corrosion properties. The drawback of this alloy is its susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). From the previous research, {{it was found that}} <b>retrogression</b> <b>and</b> re-aging (RRA) heat treatment is able to improve the SCC resistance of this alloy. In this study, the mechanical properties and microstructure alteration due to RRA was studied. First, the tensile specimens are heat treated to T 6 and then retrogressed at 165 / 185 / 205 o C for 10 / 30 minutes followed by re-aging at 120 o C for 24 hours.

40|$|The Outer Hebrides Fault Zone (OHFZ) is a major, {{moderately}} E- to ESE-dipping long-lived reactivated {{fault zone}} which is developed in, and cross-cuts, crystalline amphibolite to granulite grade Lewisian basement gneisses, NW Scotland. A complex assemblage of different fault rocks and structures is presently exposed along the OHFZ, which reflects deformation {{at a range}} of crustal depths and metamorphic (temperature, pressure, fluid activity) conditions. Detailed field and microstructural observations have demonstrated that segments of the fault zone which display evidence of repeated reactivation {{over long periods of}} geological time (movements range from late Laxfordian / Grenvillian to Oligocene in age) are characterised by intense, localised greenschist facies <b>retrogression</b> <b>and</b> the development of sericite- and chlorite-bearing phyllonitic shear zones. In contrast, phyllonite is absent from segments of the fault zone which have not suffered extensive reactivation. These observations are consistent with phyllonitisation at mid-crustal depths having caused profound long-term mechanical weakening of the OHFZ,Two phases of <b>retrogression</b> <b>and</b> phyllonitisation have been recognised along the OHFZ:Upper greenschist facies, Late Laxfordian / Grenvillian phyllonitisation, which occurred at between 15 and 17 km depth (Lewis and Harris only), and Lower greenschist facies, Caledonian phyllonitisation, which occurred at between 8 and 9 km depth (Lewis, Harris and the Uists). Microstructural and geochemical studies of selected phyllonites from reactivated segments of the OHFZ demonstrate that greenschist facies <b>retrogression</b> <b>and</b> phyllonitisation were promoted by the influx of warm (c. 250 to 450 C), hydrous iron^ and magnesium-bearing, oxidising fluids into the fault zone. Fluid flow during upper greenschist facies phyllonitisation was focused into pre-existing bands of highly strained quartzo-feldspathic mylonite, whilst fluid flow during lower greenschist facies phyllonitisation was focused predominantly into pre-existing brittle fractures and cataclastic crush zones. Thus, the distribution and intensity of fluid flow, and hence the distribution <b>and</b> intensity of <b>retrogression</b> <b>and</b> phyllonitisation were ultimately governed by the nature of pre-existing permeability pathways through the fault zone.

The size of matrix precipitate (MPt), distance between MPts, width of precipitate-free zone (PFZ), and distance between grain boundary precipitates (GBPs) increase with the increase of creep aging time and applied stress.
