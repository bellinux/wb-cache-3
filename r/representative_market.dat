40|$|MBA - WBSKnowledge of consumers’ {{willingness-to-pay}} (WTP) {{provides a}} company with invaluable data for both pricing decisions and product development. Without an understanding of consumers’ WTP for its products, a company may not pursue an optimal pricing strategy or achieve its pricing objectives. There are theoretical and practical shortcomings associated with existing WTP models. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a model for estimating consumers’ WTP in order to facilitate determination of the optimal price for new products or relaunched products. To address some of the shortcomings of existing WTP models, multi-factorial experiments and direct survey stated preference methods were integrated in a novel WTP model. The proposed model produces predictive equations for six stated price responses, including the WTP price. To empirically establish the validity of the proposed model, the ability of the model to estimate WTP at the individual and group level was evaluated in a <b>representative</b> <b>market.</b> The cell phone handset market was chosen as a <b>representative</b> <b>market.</b> In this market, the proposed model produced statistically significant predictive equations for stated WTP at the individual, group, and subgroup level...|$|E

40|$|An {{index was}} {{developed}} to rank U. S. metropolitan areas according to overall similarities in their socio-economic characteristics to the U. S. average. This index is given {{as a solution to}} matching a representative city or market area to a target market as well as matching a group of cities which are similar to each other. The index shows stability in ranking these cities with different consumption data for similar products and proves to be a promising approach whenever the researcher must find a group of cities which are similar {{to each other and to}} the target market. Market research sometimes requires selec-tion of cities or market areas for testing new product performance, effects of changes in different market variables on product sales, effects of changes in different economic var-iables on product consumption, and so on. This type of research uses representative markets as proxies for a target market area in order to get meaningful information [Shoraka, R. ]. A relatively large sample size and repetitive market research are needed to obtain precise results; however, the larger the sample size, the greater are research costs [Ladik, et al. ]. In many cases, the cost of increasing the sample size (number of cities) is not justifiable or may be prohibitive to the small firm undertaking the analyses [Lipstien, B. ]. That is why a <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> area or city is still a practical approach in marketing research [Scott, F., Jr. ].

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} to analyze the history and current {{situation}} of hedge funds and assess their potential to destabilize financial markets. The findings of the analysis are used to validate the assumptions underlying the major regulatory changes of hedge funds in the key global economic centres after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Since their inception early last century hedge funds have gone {{through a period of}} great expansion in the sixties, followed by a decline due to large losses sustained in the early seventies. The nineties meant a real breakthrough for hedge funds as a result of which they became prominent players in the alternative investment space. As of today, there is over ten thousand hedge funds that globally manage close to 3 trillion US dollars. Compared to mutual funds and other financial institutions the volume of assets under management is still relatively small, the rate of growth over the past fifteen years has however been very significant. What is emphasized with respect to the impact of hedge funds on financial markets is the contribution to increasing the liquidity and efficiency and their role on the financial derivatives market where hedge funds are actively involved in the transfer of risk. They are at the same time subject of criticism for their purported destabilizing effect on financial markets and contribution to fluctuations in the prices of investment instruments. Although the share of hedge funds in triggering major financial crises has not been conclusively established, these investment entities were one of the targets of the wide-ranging regulatory changes following the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The dissertation first discusses the history and current situation of hedge funds and defines the term hedge fund. The following section describes the basic characteristics and principles of their functioning and reviews the regulation in the major domiciles. The final chapter is focused on the empirical analysis of the impact of hedge funds on financial markets. The inputs for this analysis include a global hedge fund index and <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> indices and data from the CFTC on positions in the 10 year US government treasury note futures. In the first step the descriptive statistics for the transformed time series are presented. The second part of the analysis focuses on lagged correlations between returns and volatility of the global hedge fund index and <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> indices. Granger causality tests are applied in the following section to determine the relationships between the returns and volatility of hedge fund and <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> indices. In the final step of the analysis Granger causality tests are used to analyze the link between the changes in positions in the 10 -year US treasury note futures held by hedge funds and the change in settlement prices of these futures with the aim to assess whether hedge funds have the capacity to move the market. In conclusion, the results of this analysis are discussed in light of the recent regulatory changes and the potential for the future growth of hedge funds is assessed...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{structure}} and correct calculation of a company’s capital value is an essential; {{theoretical and practical}} problem for corporate finance. The proportion between the company’s equity and borrowed capital determines the risk and profitability of the company and, consequently, the welfare of its owners. The most common recommendation is to evaluate the stricture of capital based on market proportions between indebtedness and equity. However, market proportions most often deviate from values obtained through analytical calculations. This means that weak efficiency of the market brings about inconsistency between the input data and the results, which are calculated from them. Second, not all companies have a <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> quotation. There is a question, then: how can we correctly evaluate capital and its market structure for individual projects and companies in general? The work presented below {{is dedicated to the}} iterative method for evaluation of fair structure of capital as suggested in (Limitovsky M. A., Minasyan V.

In this study I investigate alternative mechanisms for effectively achieving the same objectives in markets where the financial infrastructure is less developed and standard common law contracting tools are not available.

It examines the available literature and the practical experience of investors, entrepreneurs and other agents in a <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> like Colombia, to develop a new framework for analyzing the financing strategy of SMEs and presents an innovative business model for supporting their growth in developing markets based on alternative mechanisms that facilitate the combination of financial and managerial capital to stimulate growth and innovation. by Fernando Cárdenas E [...] Thesis (S.
