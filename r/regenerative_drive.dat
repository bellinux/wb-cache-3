40|$|Abstract — In recent years, power {{variations}} {{and energy}} criteria {{have been the}} main motivations for developing <b>regenerative</b> <b>drive</b> converters for elevators [1]. A more performant solution for power-smoothing can be easily found by using a supercapacitor based storage device, connected to the intermediary circuit of a Variable Speed Drive system. In this paper, power and energy considerations are made {{for the design of}} the storage tank and regarding the maximum power demand from the feeding network. For the power-conversion circuit, which is necessary to compensate the voltage variations of the supercapacitors by discharging and charging, a high efficiency converter topology is proposed which allows the bidirectionnal energy flow under soft-commutation conditions, and offers also a good flexibility for the optimal sizing of the supercapacitor voltage level. The typical behaviour of the special converter is given, together with an analyze of the advantages related to the specific application. I...|$|E

Regeneration of the central portion of sensory neurons into the spinal cord is notoriously poor in adult mammals, with low <b>regenerative</b> <b>drive</b> and an unpermissive central environment, most likely resulting in persistent loss of sensory function. A variety of strategies have been addressedto augment regeneration, including application of growth promoting factors, counteraction of inhibitory molecules, and provision of growth permissive substrates. Stem cells have been investigated in these contexts, {{as well as for}} the possibility of providing new neurons to act as a relay between the periphery and spinal cord. Here we have investigated different sources of neural stem cells for their ability to form neurons and glia after transplantation to the periphery; to project axons into the spinal cord; and to assist regeneration of surviving sensory neurons. These have been performed at two locations: the "dorsal root ganglion cavity", and the transitional zone following dorsal root avulsion. Neurons and glia were generated form mouse boundary cap neural crest stem cells and embryonic stem cell derived ventral spinal cord progenitors, and in addition to this, regeneration of sensory fibers was observed after transplantation of human fetal spinal cord derived progenitors and human embryonic stem cell derived ventral spinal cord progenitors. Further, delivery of neurotrophic factor mimetics via mesoporous silica nanoparticles proved a valuable tool for stem cell survival and differentiation. While technological advances make in vivo differentiation a realistic goal, our findings indicate that so far assisting regeneration of host sensory fibers to reconnect with the spinal cord by transplantation of stem cells is a more reliable strategy...|$|E

40|$|U. S. {{industry}} and utilities {{have been using}} ac adjustable speed drives (ASDs) for more than 50 years. ASDs utilize power electronics technology to control the flow of power to an ac motor, thereby controlling the motor?s speed and rate of energy consumption while modulating process flow through the fan or pump driven by the motor.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the energy {{management}} of belt conveyor systems (BCS) under various demandside management (DSM) programmes. The primary objective of this work is to model the energy consumption and energy related cost of operating troughed belt conveyor systems under different electricity pricing tariffs. This research is motivated by the increasing need for energy efficiency and energy cost reduction {{in the operation of}} BCS. This is as a result of technological improvements in BCS technology leading to increasingly longer belts being commissioned {{and as a result of}} rapidly rising electricity costs. An energy model derived from established industry standards is proposed for long conveyors. The newly proposed model uses a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) in order to capture the state of material on the belt. This new model describes the conveyor's power requirement using an equation with two parameters. A system identification set-up involving a recursive parameter estimating algorithm is simulated for measurements with varying degrees of noise. The results show that the proposed model estimates conveyor power and material delivered by long conveyors more accurately than the existing steady-state models. Downhill conveyors (DHCs) are important potential energy sources that can be tapped to improve the overall energy efficiency of BCSs. A generic optimisation model that is able to optimally schedule three configurations of BCS with DHC is proposed. The economic assessment of implementing dynamic braking and <b>regenerative</b> <b>drives</b> technology on downhill conveyors is undertaken with the help of the model. The assessment shows that combining <b>regenerative</b> <b>drives</b> and optimal operation of BCS with DHC generates energy savings that give attractive payback period of less than 5 years. A chance-constrained model predictive control (cc-MPC) algorithm is proposed for scheduling belt conveyor systems with uncertain material demand on the output storage. The chance-constraints are based on the modelling of material demand by a sum of known mean demand and, zero-mean and normally distributed random component. The cc-MPC algorithm is shown to produce schedules that give a smaller number and smaller magnitude of storage limit violations compared to normal MPC and chance-constrained optimal control algorithms. An equation that gives the amount of effective storage required to meet storage constraints for a given value of standard deviation is established. The optimal scheduling of BCS under the real-time pricing (RTP) tariff is considered. This study develops a methodology for establishing the economic value of price forecasting schemes for loads capable of load-shifting. This methodology is used to show that the economic benefit obtained from a forecast is highly dependent on the volatility of the electricity prices being predicted and not their mean value. The methodology is also used to illustrate why the commonly used indices mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are poor indicators of economic benefit. The proposed index using Kendall's rank correlation between the actual and predicted prices is shown to be a good indicator of economic benefit, performing far better than RSME and MAPE.

One very important problem is {{the choice of the}} correct voltage rating for fuses protecting <b>regenerative</b> DC <b>drives,</b> where many types of fault may occur, which makes fuse protection difficult.

The effect of varying the motor time constant, supply impedance, number of fuses used to clear the fault and DC machine rating on the total transient response is studied. The model of a 200 A fuse is employed in this study. Fuses in series with both the semiconductor devices (F 1) and fuses in AC lines (F 2) are considered.

Blastema cells are not derived from stem cells but behave as such, because they are slow-cycling and are thought to provide rapidly proliferating daughter cells that <b>drive</b> <b>regenerative</b> outgrowth. The molecular basis of blastema formation is not understood. Here, we show that heat-shock protein 60 (hsp 60) is required for blastema formation and maintenance. We used a chemical mutagenesis screen to identify no blastema (nbl), a zebrafish mutant with an early fin regeneration defect. Fin regeneration failed in nbl due to defective blastema formation. nbl also failed to regenerate hearts. Positional cloning and mutational analyses revealed that nbl results from a V 324 E missense mutation in hsp 60. This mutation reduced hsp 60 function in binding and refolding denatured proteins. hsp 60 expression is increased during formation of blastema cells, and dysfunction leads to mitochondrial defects and apoptosis in these cells. These data indicate that hsp 60 is required for {{the formation and}} maintenance of regenerating tissue...|$|R
40|$|Ultracapacitors are {{electrical}} energy storage devices, which offer high power density, extremely high cycling capability and mechanical robustness. Recent technology improvements enabled ultracapacitors {{to be an}} interesting option for short-term high power applications, such as in industry, automotive and traction <b>drives,</b> <b>regenerative</b> energy systems, medical and telecommunication equipment. However, ultracapacitors offer voltage value at terminals which is almost directly proportional to their state of charge and therefore greatly dependent on the operating condition. A power electronic converter is then required to utilize ultracapacitors in the mentioned applications, and reliable converter topology as well high dynamic control technique should be chosen in order to best operate the ultracapacitor storage unit. In this paper the synergetic synthesis of controllers for a bi-directional half-bridge converter is proposed. Results from both simulations and experimental tests show that the synergetic controllers have faster dynamic behavior with respect to more traditional linear controllers, thus synergetic control theory is particularly suited to synthesize the controllers of power electronic converters for Ultracapacitors.

40|$|Growth factors (GFs) are {{powerful}} signaling molecules {{with the potential}} to <b>drive</b> <b>regenerative</b> strategies, including bone repair and vascularization. However, GFs are typically delivered in soluble format at supraphysiological doses because of rapid clearance and limited therapeutic impact. These high doses have serious side effects and are expensive. Although it is well established that GF interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin control GF presentation and activity, a translation-ready approach to unlocking GF potential has not been realized. We demonstrate a simple, robust, and controlled material-based approach to enhance the activity of GFs during tissue healing. The underlying mechanism is based on spontaneous fibrillar organization of fibronectin driven by adsorption onto the polymer poly(ethyl acrylate). Fibrillar fibronectin on this polymer, but not a globular conformation obtained on control polymers, promotes synergistic presentation of integrin-binding sites and bound bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2), which enhances mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis in vitro and drives full regeneration of a nonhealing bone defect in vivo at low GF concentrations.

40|$|Regenerating tissue must {{initiate}} the signaling that <b>drives</b> <b>regenerative</b> growth, and sustain that signaling {{long enough for}} regeneration to complete. How these key signals are sustained is unclear. To gain a comprehensive view {{of the changes in}} gene expression that occur during regeneration, we performed whole-genome mRNAseq of actively regenerating tissue from damaged Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We used genetic tools to ablate the wing primordium to induce regeneration, and carried out transcriptional profiling of the regeneration blastema by fluorescently labeling and sorting the blastema cells, thus identifying differentially expressed genes. Importantly, by using genetic mutants of several of these differentially expressed genes we have confirmed that they have roles in regeneration. Using this approach, we show that high expression of the gene moladietz (mol), which encodes the Duox-maturation factor NIP, is required during regeneration to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn sustain JNK signaling during regeneration. We also show that JNK signaling upregulates mol expression, thereby activating a positive feedback signal that ensures the prolonged JNK activation required for regenerative growth. Thus, by whole-genome transcriptional profiling of regenerating tissue we have identified a positive feedback loop that regulates the extent of regenerative growth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract After {{central nervous}} system (CNS) trauma, axons have a low {{capacity}} for regeneration. Regeneration failure {{is associated with a}} muted regenerative response of the neuron itself, combined with a growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic post-injury environment. After spinal cord injury (SCI), resident and infiltrating immune cells (especially microglia/macro-phages) contribute significantly to the growth-refractorymilieu near the lesion. By targeting both the regenerative potential of the axon and the cytotoxic phenotype of microglia/macro-phages, {{we may be able to}} improve CNS repair after SCI. In this review, we discuss molecules shown to impact CNS repair by affecting both immune cells and neurons. Specifically, we provide examples of pattern recognition receptors, integrins, cytokines/chemokines, nuclear receptors and galectins that could improve CNS repair. In many cases, signaling by these molecules is complex and may have contradictory effects on recovery depending on the cell types involved or the model studied. Despite this caveat, deciphering convergent signaling pathways on immune cells (which affect axon growth indirect-ly) and neurons (direct effects on axon growth) could improve repair and recovery after SCI. Future studies must continue to consider how regenerative therapies targeting neurons impact other cells in the pathological CNS. By identifying molecules that simultaneously improve axon <b>regenerative</b> capacity and <b>drive</b> the protective, growth-promoting phenotype of immune cells, we may discover SCI therapies that act synergistically to improve CNS repair and functional recovery...|$|R
40|$|To reveal {{molecular}} determinates {{that underlie}} the intrinsic molecular pathways within neurons that support regeneration after injury, a DNA microarray study was performed on axotomized neuronal clusters that were maintained in culture and free from glial and astrocytes contamination. The microarray data indicated that post-injury regenerative sprouting requires two distinct pathways; a cell survival response to protect against pernicious secondary processes and a <b>regenerative</b> response <b>driven</b> by modulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton. From the transcriptomic data, cell cycle associated aurora B kinase (Aurkb), which was significantly up-regulated but never investigated {{in the context of}} neurons, was identified for further work. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that Aurkb is expressed extensively and cell-specifically in neurons of certain brain structures such as the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Its elevated expression in the embryonic brain cortex as compared to that of an adult implies that it may be involved in the process of brain maturation. Interestingly, the changing localization of Aurkb within developing cultured neurons and particularly its localisation outside of the nucleus at various stages of neuronal maturation further suggests that it may have direct roles neurite outgrowth. Indeed, impairing Aurkb activity in cultured neurons via different experimental approaches resulted in several key neuronal deficits. Generally, neurons with inactive Aurkb were found to have either shorter or no elaborated axons. They also possessed abnormally swollen cell bodies. Enlargement of the cell body, independent of nucleus size, was related to a substantial increase in microtubule mass within the area between the nucleus and axon hillock region. Furthermore, their expanded cell bodies are bordered by several aberrant, thin, frayed and highly disorganised neuritic processes. Next, yeast 2 hybrid identified INCENP as a binding partner of Aurkb in neurons. Subsequent phosphoproteomics studies coupled with functional analysis of protein associations have further revealed that inhibition of neuronal Aurkb affected a cluster of proteins and kinases that are major players of neuronal cytoskeleton regulation and organisation. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive study of Aurkb in the brain and neurons. Specifically, the phosphoproteomic, pharmacological and molecular knockin and knockout studies provided considerable evidence that Aurkb has key roles in neurite cytoskeleton modulation. Taken together, the work in this thesis has clearly identified a novel and alternate cell cycle independent function of Aurkb in post-mitotic neurons...|$|R

Close monitoring of such patients allows accessing their clonal dynamics, however, the early detection of events that predict monoclonal conversion and potentially the onset of leukemia are beneficial for treatment. We developed a simple mathematical model of a self-stabilizing hematopoietic stem cell population to generate a wide range of possible clonal developments, reproducing typical, experimentally and clinically observed scenarios. We use the resulting model scenarios to suggest and test a set of statistical measures that should allow for an interpretation and classification of relevant clonal dynamics. Apart from the assessment of several established diversity indices we suggest a measure that quantifies the extension to which the increase in the size of one clone is attributed to the total loss in the size of all other clones. By evaluating the change in relative clone sizes between consecutive measurements, the suggested measure, referred to as maximum relative clonal expansion (mRCE), proves to be highly sensitive in the detection of rapidly expanding cell clones prior to their dominant manifestation. This predictive potential places the mRCE as a suitable means for the early recognition of leukemogenesis especially in gene therapy patients that are closely monitored. Our model based approach illustrates how simulation studies can actively support the design and evaluation of preclinical strategies for the analysis and risk evaluation of clonal developments...|$|R

Zur Untersuchung der Energieeffizienz von Elektrofahrzeugen, wird das Antriebsbordnetz aus energietechnischer Sicht als Netzwerk mit Erzeugern und Verbrauchern betrachtet. Um sowohl unterschiedliche Fahrzeuge als auch unterschiedliche Antriebsysteme zu untersuchen, wird eine Skalierungsmethode vorgestellt, welche auch auf andere Prüfstände adaptierbar ist. Mit dem Aufbau wird der Einfluss unterschiedlicher Fahr-zyklen, Antriebssysteme, Rekuperationsleistungen und Hochvolt-Nebenverbraucher auf die Reich-weite der Fahrzeuge umfassend untersucht. Zur Untersuchung der EMV des elektrischen Antriebsstrangs wird die Power-HiL Umgebung ver-wendet, um die Störaussendung des Antriebssystems von Elektrofahrzeugen und deren Ausbreitung im Fahrzeug zu untersuchen. In den aktuellen EMV-Standards werden die leitungsgeführten Störaus-sendungen an den Antriebs- und Traktionsleitungen des Umrichters in konstanten Betriebspunkten gemessen. Diese Störungen breiten sich zudem über die Antriebswelle, die eine Schwachstelle im aktuellen Schirmkonzept darstellt, im Fahrzeug aus. Da diese Wellenströme in der aktuellen Normung nicht berücksichtigt sind, werden sie mit der Power-HiL Umgebung erstmalig untersucht. Zudem wird ein Messaufbau vorgestellt, mit dem die Störaussendung im Frequenzbereich über der Zeit während eines dynamischen Fahrzyklus untersucht werden kann. Electro {{mobility}} {{is part of}} {{the energy}} turnaround in Germany and thus one of the actual topics in technical research. The main idea is the reduction of CO 2 emissions of public and individual traffic by using electric drives for vehicle propulsion. Despite the high efficiency of the electric traction systems electric vehicles have a limited driving range of 100 - 200 km. This limitation is caused by the capacity of the propulsion batteries used. In addition energy-intensive loads like the electric air conditioning compressor and the interior heating are supplied by this battery further reducing the vehicle’s driving range. Compared to vehicles with internal combustion engine electric vehicles can recuperate energy into the battery during the braking process. Especially in inner city traffic this causes an increase of the overall driving range. However, the combination of the limited driving range and the long duration of the recharge process indicates, that the optimal usage of this energy {{is one of the main}} topics during the development process of electric vehicles. Furthermore, integrating electric traction systems in the existing vehicle electric architectures causes enormous challenges with respect to the EMC requirements. Due to this process all affected automotive EMC standards are actually adapted. Inside the power electronic components fast switching power semiconductors are used. In order to further increase the efficiency of the components the switching frequency of power semiconductors and the system’s operational voltage is increased. Beside the better efficiency of the components the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by the drive system increases. In order to provide an undisturbed operation of the 12 V- and the traction system the traction system is built up isolated and completely shielded from the vehicle’s chassis. Due to costs factors and the limited space inside the vehicle the amount realizable further countermeasures is limited. Thus the disturbances generated by and the coupling passes inside the traction system has to be considered in an early stage in the component development process. To investigate the impact of e. g. different usage scenarios on the energy efficiency and the EMI of an electric vehicle traction system a Power-HiL setup including the complete electric vehicle drive is used. Focussing on the energy efficiency investigations, the traction system is considered as an energy supply network consisting of energy sources and sinks. In order to simulate different electric vehicles and drives the Power-HiL setup is scaled, using method which can be adapted to other test setups. Using the scaled Power-HiL setup the impact of different electric <b>drives,</b> <b>regenerative</b> braking limitations, usage scenarios and the usage of energy intensive loads on the driving range of electric vehicles is comprehensively investigated. On the other hand the Power-HiL setup is used to investigate the EMI generated and the coupling paths inside an electric vehicle traction system. In the actual EMC standards the conducted emissions of a drive inverter are measured at the motor and the battery cables while the drive is operated in constant operation. However, inside the motor these conducted emissions are coupling via the bearings onto the drive’s shaft. The shaft is not shielded and represents a weak point of the actual shielding concept. As these shaft currents are not considered in the actual standard, they are comprehensively analyzed using the Power-HiL setup. Furthermore, a realistic drive scenario of an electric vehicle represents a dynamic operation of the traction system, which is not considered in the actual standards. In order to investigate the impact of a dynamic operation of the drive on the conducted emissions the Power-HiL setup is used. For analysing the emissions in dynamic operation a setup measuring the EMI in frequency domain in discrete time steps is used...|$|R
