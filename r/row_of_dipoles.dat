50|$|The driven {{elements}} are usually half-wave dipoles, fed in phase, mounted {{in a plane}} 1/4 wavelength {{in front of the}} reflector plane. The reflector wires are oriented parallel to the dipoles. The dipoles may be vertical, radiating in vertical polarization, but are most often horizontal, because horizontally polarized waves are less absorbed by earth reflections. The lowest <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>dipoles</b> are mounted more than 1/2 wavelength above the ground, to prevent ground reflections from interfering with the radiation pattern. This allows most of the radiation to be concentrated in a narrow main lobe aimed a few degrees above the horizon, which is ideal for skywave transmission. A curtain array may have a gain of 20 dB greater than a simple dipole antenna. Because of the strict phase requirements, earlier curtain arrays had a narrow bandwidth, but modern curtain arrays can be built with a bandwidth of up to 2:1, allowing them to cover several shortwave bands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{plane wave}} {{incident}} {{at an angle}} on a finite length wire produces resonant current peaks, caused by end reflections. This model aids in understanding why similar current peaks occur in arrays <b>of</b> collinear connected <b>dipoles.</b> Index Terms—Connected arrays, dipole arrays, phased arrays, wire scattering. MOMENT method studies <b>of</b> connected <b>dipole</b> arrays {{have shown that the}} connections provide a smoothing of the current distribution when the array length is several wavelengths or less and the dipoles are short. However, when the dipoles are roughly half-wave, the current on a connected array is peaked, with peaks apart. These arrays consist <b>of</b> a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> collinear <b>dipoles,</b> with adjacent collinear dipoles connected [1], [2]. To explicate this phenomenon a simple model of a plane wave incident at an arbitrary angle on a thin wire of finite length is examined...|$|R

The program also allows saving computed values, saving displayed graphs, or saving the adjusted parameters of antenna array.

50|$|The {{prototype}} had a peak-power of 1 kW, {{and used}} a pulse length of 2 to 3 μs with a 10- to 20 kHz PRF. The receiver was a super-heterodyne type using Acorn tubes and a 6 MHz IF stage. The antenna consisted <b>of</b> 4 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> 16 half-wave <b>dipoles</b> backed by a 3- by 3-meter mesh screen. The operator used a bicycle-type drive to rotate the antenna, and the elevation could be changed using a hand crank.|$|R

It mounted a large antenna consisting <b>of</b> two <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> four half-wave <b>dipoles</b> aligned horizontally, rotating on a shaft located {{at the top of}} the tower. It was found that at least five pulses needed to be returned in order for the target to become visible on the scope, so the rotation rate of the antenna was adjusted to synchronize with the pulse repetition frequency of the radar. The radio equipment was taken from the Wassermann and Freya units, and operated on a basic wavelength of 2.4 m (~125 MHz).|$|R
40|$|Conventional discrete-to-continuum {{approaches}} {{have seen their}} limitation in describing the collective behaviour of the multi-polar configurations of dislocations, which are widely observed in crystalline materials. The reason is that dislocation dipoles, which {{play an important role}} in determining the mechanical properties of crystals, often get smeared out when traditional homogenisation methods are applied. To address such difficulties, the collective behaviour <b>of</b> a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> dislocation <b>dipoles</b> is studied by using matched asymptotic techniques. The discrete-to-continuum transition is facilitated by introducing two field variables respectively describing the dislocation pair density potential and the dislocation pair width. It is found that the dislocation pair width evolves much faster than the pair density. Such hierarchy in evolution time scales enables us to describe the dislocation dynamics at the coarse-grained level by an evolution equation for the slowly varying variable (the pair density) coupled with an equilibrium equation for the fast varying variable (the pair width). The time-scale separation method adopted here paves a way for properly incorporating dipole-like (zero net Burgers vector but non-vanishing) dislocation structures, known as the statistically stored dislocations (SSDs) into macroscopic models of crystal plasticity in three dimensions. Moreover, the natural transition between different equilibrium patterns found here may also shed light on understanding the emergence of the persistent slip bands (PSBs) in fatigue metals induced by cyclic loads...|$|R
50|$|In 1943, Lorenz was {{instructed}} to adapt Hohentwiel for naval use, and soon the Hohentwiel appeared on U-boats, small surface ships, and coastal installations.There are two U-boat versions of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel used during World War II; FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U and the FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1. The U-boat versions were easier to maintain and more reliable compared with the other versions. However, the U-boat versions had several disadvantages, the smaller dimension of the antenna and {{the height of the}} antenna installation. The antenna was restricted to a smaller dimension as it had to fit within a small area on the port side of the conning tower. In addition, the reduced height of the antenna installation impaired the range. Both U-boat versions had ranges of between 8 and 10 km for naval targets and between 15 and 25 km at an altitude of 200 m. Resolution was about 3 degrees, and at short range its range accuracy was 100 m. Both U-boat versions worked at a frequency 556 MHz and had four <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> six <b>dipoles.</b> Before the U-boat could dive, the antenna needed to be retracted into a well on the conning tower. Both U-boat antenna versions were 1400 mm wide by 1000 mm in height, and total overall dimensions of the antenna frame was 1540 by 1022 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{before the}} First World War, Standard Elektrik Lorenz {{had been the}} main {{supplier}} of communication equipment for the German military and was the main rival of Telefunken. In late 1935, when Lorenz found that Runge at Telefunken was doing research in radio-based detection equipment, they started a similar activity under Gottfried Müller. A pulse-modulated set called Einheit für Abfragung (DFA - Device for Detection) was built. It used a type DS-310 tube (similar to the Acorn) operating at 70 cm (430 MHz) and about 1 kW power, it had identical transmitting and receiving antennas made with <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> half-wavelength <b>dipoles</b> backed by a reflecting screen. In early 1936, initial experiments gave reflections from large buildings at up to about 7 km. The power was doubled by using two tubes, and in mid-1936, the equipment was set up on cliffs near Kiel, and good detections of ships at 7 km and aircraft at 4 km were attained. [...] The success of this experimental set was reported to the Kriegsmarine, but they showed no interest; they were already fully engaged with GEMA for similar equipment. Also, because of extensive agreements between Lorenz and many foreign countries, the naval authorities had reservations concerning the company handling classified work. The DFA was then demonstrated to the Heer (German Army), and they contracted with Lorenz for developing Kurfürst (Elector), a system for supporting Flugzeugabwehrkanone (Flak, anti-aircraft guns).|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{we showed}} that the effect <b>of</b> <b>dipole</b> {{modifiers}} (flavonoids and styrylpyridinium dyes) on the conductance of single amphotericin B (AmB) channels in sterol-containing lipid bilayers primarily resulted from changes in the membrane dipole potential. The present study examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>dipole</b> modifiers on the AmB multi-channel activity. The addition of phloretin to cholesterol-containing membranes leads to {{a significant increase in}} the steady-state AmB-induced transmembrane current. Quercetin significantly decreases and RH 421 increases the current through ergosterol-containing bilayers. Other tested flavonoids and styrylpyridinium dyes do not affect the channel-forming activity of AmB independently on the sterol composition of the bilayers. The effects obtained in these trials may instead be attributed to the direct interaction <b>of</b> <b>dipole</b> modifiers with AmB/sterol complexes and not to the effect <b>of</b> <b>dipole</b> potential changes. The presence of double bonds in the D 7 and D 22 positions of sterol molecules, the number of conjugated double bonds and amino sugar residues in polyene molecules, and the conformation and adsorption plane <b>of</b> <b>dipole</b> modifiers are important factors impacting this interaction...|$|R
