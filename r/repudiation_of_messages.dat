40|$|With the {{emergence}} of business to business eCommerce conventional trading practices need to be adapted to the new electronic environment. One such trading practice is the call for tender (CFT) which is heavily used for trading perishable goods. A naive translation of the CFT to mediated eCommerce introduces new manipulation possibilities like identity masquerading, <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> etc. In a first step, we show how the basic CFT can be made robust against these classical security attacks. However, this approach does not eliminate fundamental economic design problems of the CFT itself. In a second step, we show how the CFT can be protected against manipulations that damage the fairness and economic efficiency of a market by {{turning it into a}} secure sealed-bid auction protocol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — All {{sorts of}} data today is getting {{digitized}} and internet among others {{is the easiest}} and a very effective source and host for sharing information. So, it becomes very important to track, protect and monitor the data and maintain its security, Secret, data integrity, authentication, robustness and ownership. And, techniques like steganography, watermarking and non <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> help us to do so. In steganography, information is hidden inside the data (like image, audio, video, text) and the data is kept secret maintained as only the sender and the receiver know how to retrace the information. Watermarking is used to hold the secret data. In this paper, a secure way of Audio- Watermarking is implemented using Distinct Wavelet Transform (Haar Wavelet) and Distinct Cosine Transform. It requires a cover file that can hide the message {{that is to be}} transmitted...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{that allows the}} delegation of signature power {{to one or more}} entities that jointly play the role of a proxy signer. This work is different from other related proxy signature schemes in that in addition to providing confidentiality protection to the proxy key, the method provides non-repudiation services to all the parties involved. In particular, it protects against <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> signature delegation by the original signer, <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> proxy signature generation by the proxy signer, and <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> receipt of the proxy signature by the signature recipient. This feature is attractive for signature delegation in agent-based paradigm in which proxy signers are mobile agents that are executed in remote untrustworthy hosts.
