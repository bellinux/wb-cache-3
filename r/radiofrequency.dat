25|$|<b>Radiofrequency</b> {{ablation}}: Monopolar <b>radiofrequency</b> thermal ablation transfers <b>radiofrequency</b> {{energy to}} the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or local anesthesia. After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size {{over a period of}} several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.|$|E

25|$|An MRI {{sequence}} {{is a particular}} setting of <b>radiofrequency</b> pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance. The T1 and T2 weighing can also be described as MRI sequences.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{endoscopic}} therapy {{have been}} used for stage 0 and I disease: endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and mucosal ablation using <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation, photodynamic therapy, Nd-YAG laser, or argon plasma coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{major medical}} centers {{are now using}} <b>radiofrequency</b> {{ablation}} of the liver tumor as a bridge while awaiting for liver transplantation. This technique has not been used universally and further investigation is warranted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiofrequency</b> Heating A {{radio wave}} {{is applied to}} the plasma, causing it to oscillate. This is {{basically}} the same concept as a microwave oven. This is also known as electron cyclotron resonance heating or Dielectric heating.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{branches}} of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT {{defined by the}} Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and <b>Radiofrequency</b> disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Removal or {{reduction}} {{of parts of}} the soft palate and {{some or all of}} the uvula, such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) or laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP). Modern variants of this procedure sometimes use <b>radiofrequency</b> waves to heat and remove tissue.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{malignancy}} {{is highest}} in the U.S. in Caucasian men over fifty years of age with {{more than five years}} of symptoms. Current recommendations include routine endoscopy and biopsy (looking for dysplastic changes). Although in the past physicians have taken a watchful waiting approach, newly published research supports consideration of intervention for Barrett's esophagus. Balloon-based <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation, invented by Ganz, Stern, and Zelickson in 1999, is a new treatment modality for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia, and {{has been the subject of}} numerous published clinical trials. The findings demonstrate <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation has an efficacy of 90% or greater with respect to complete clearance of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia with durability up to five years and a favorable safety profile.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiofrequency</b> {{ablation}} (RFA), {{which is}} conceptually analogous {{in some ways}} to surgery, uses low frequency (300kHz to 1MHz) radio wave energy to target tissue, causing coagulative necrosis. RFA achieves its effects at 40°C to 70°C unlike other electrosurgical devices which require 400°C to 600°C for efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{has worked}} out several energy {{technologies}} {{in the field of}} coal gasification, shale oil extraction, geothermal energy, advanced battery research, solar energy, and fusion energy. Main oil shale processing technologies worked out by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are LLNL HRS (hot-recycled-solid), LLNL RISE (in situ extraction technology) and LLNL <b>radiofrequency</b> technologies.|$|E
25|$|Minimaze {{procedures}} are minimally invasive {{versions of the}} original Cox maze procedure but without cardiac incisions. These procedures do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). They use laser, cryothermy, <b>radiofrequency,</b> or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins and make other required ablations to mimic the maze.|$|E
25|$|Echo {{phenomena}} {{are important}} features of coherent spectroscopy {{which have been}} used in fields other than magnetic resonance including laser spectroscopy and neutron scattering. Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by Erwin Hahn in 1950, and spin echoes are sometimes referred to as Hahn echoes. In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, <b>radiofrequency</b> radiation is most commonly used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiofrequency</b> {{ablation}} is a {{minimally invasive}} treatments for fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment {{is a potential}} option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Surgical, chemical, or <b>radiofrequency</b> sympathectomy — {{interruption}} {{of the affected}} portion of the sympathetic nervous system — {{can be used as}} a last resort in patients with impending tissue loss, edema, recurrent infection, or ischemic necrosis. However, there is little evidence that these permanent interventions alter the pain symptoms of the affected patients, and in addition to the normal risks of surgery, such as bleeding and infection, sympathectomy has several specific risks, such as adverse changes in how nerves function.|$|E
25|$|Sclerotherapy is {{one method}} (along with surgery, <b>radiofrequency</b> and laser ablation) for the {{treatment}} of spider veins, occasionally varicose veins, and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy, ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. Sclerotherapy often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities have been diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. Sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants {{has been shown to be}} effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions.|$|E
25|$|WPW {{syndrome}} is treated with either medications or <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation. It affects between 0.1 and 0.3% in the population. The {{risk of death}} in those without symptoms is about 0.5% per year in children and 0.1% per year in adults. In those without symptoms ongoing observation may be reasonable. In those with WPW complicated by atrial fibrillation, cardioversion or the medication procainamide may be used. The condition is named after Louis Wolff, John Parkinson, and Paul Dudley White who described the ECG findings in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The Ex-Maze is a {{minimally}} invasive procedure, first reported in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the beating heart. As with other procedures off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the pericardium through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a <b>radiofrequency</b> coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E
25|$|A probe {{is placed}} {{through the skin}} and into the tumor using {{real-time}} imaging of both the probe tip and the tumor by computed tomography, ultrasound, or even magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat (<b>radiofrequency</b> ablation) or cold (cryotherapy). These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation. Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5nbsp&cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation {{can be used on}} tumors that are larger.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiofrequency</b> {{ablation}} (RFA) uses high-frequency {{radio waves}} to destroy tumor by local heating. The electrodes are {{inserted into the}} liver tumor under ultrasound image guidance using percutaneous, laparoscopic or open surgical approach. It is suitable for small tumors (<5nbsp&cm). RFA has the best outcomes in patients with a solitary tumor less than 4nbsp&mm. Since it is a local treatment and has minimal effect on normal healthy tissue, it can be repeated multiple times. Survival is better for those with smaller tumors. In one study, In one series of 302 patients, the three-year survival rates for lesions >5nbsp&cm, 2.1 to 5nbsp&cm, and ≤2nbsp&cm were 59, 74, and 91 percent, respectively. A large randomized trial comparing surgical resection and RFA for small HCC showed similar 4 year survival and less morbidities for patients treated with RFA.|$|E
25|$|The fMRI concept {{builds on}} the earlier MRI {{scanning}} technology and the discovery of properties of oxygen-rich blood. MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, static magnetic field to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei {{go back to their}} original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate the positions of the nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.|$|E
25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} <b>radiofrequency.</b> This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} mention of urinary {{incontinence}} occurs in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus, the first mention of FI {{in a medical}} context is unknown. For many centuries, colonic irrigation was the only treatment available. Stoma creation was described in 1776, FI associated with rectal prolapse in 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in 1875. During the mid 20th Century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown {{to have a high}} failure rate in 1940. In 1971 Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.|$|E
25|$|Protein NMR {{utilizes}} multidimensional nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} experiments to obtain information about the protein. Ideally, each distinct nucleus in the molecule experiences a distinct electronic environment and thus has a distinct chemical shift by which it can be recognized. However, in large molecules such as proteins the number of resonances can typically be several thousand and a one-dimensional spectrum inevitably has incidental overlaps. Therefore, multidimensional experiments that correlate the frequencies of distinct nuclei are performed. The additional dimensions decrease the chance of overlap and have a larger information content, since they correlate signals from nuclei within a specific part of the molecule. Magnetization is transferred into the sample using pulses of electromagnetic (<b>radiofrequency)</b> energy and between nuclei using delays; the process is described with so-called pulse sequences. Pulse sequences allow the experimenter to investigate and select specific types of connections between nuclei. The array of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} experiments used on proteins fall in two main categories — one where magnetization is transferred through the chemical bonds, and one where the transfer is through space, irrespective of the bonding structure. The first category is used to assign the different chemical shifts to a specific nucleus, {{and the second is}} primarily used to generate the distance restraints used in the structure calculation, and in the assignment with unlabelled protein.|$|E
500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{occasionally}} used {{if there is}} pain due to anatomic extension, such as metastasis to bone. [...] Some [...] PanNETs absorb specific peptides or hormones, and these PanNETs may respond to nuclear medicine therapy with radiolabeled peptides or hormones such as iobenguane (iodine-131-MIBG). <b>Radiofrequency</b> ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and hepatic artery embolization may also be used.|$|E
500|$|As a 17-year-old at the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Soni {{finished}} 15th {{overall in}} the 100-meter breaststroke and 11th {{overall in the}} 200-meter breaststroke. The following year, at the 2005 World Championship Trials, Soni just missed {{a spot on the}} 2005 World Aquatic team after finishing third in the 200-meter breaststroke behind Tara Kirk and Kristen Caverly. Soni also placed fourth in the 100-meter breaststroke. At the 2005 Summer Universiade, Soni earned her first international medals by winning silver in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke and gold in the 4×100-meter medley relay. At the 2006 World Short Course Championships, Soni finished in 4th place in the 200-meter breaststroke. Just {{a few weeks before the}} 2006 National Championships, Soni underwent a procedure called <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation to help regulate her heartbeat. [...] Although it was not health-threatening, Soni would sometimes experience a high heart rate which sometimes interfered with her training. At the 2006 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Soni finished tenth overall in both the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment of}} WPW is {{the destruction of}} the abnormal electrical pathway by <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation. This procedure is performed by cardiac electrophysiologists. <b>Radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation is not performed in all individuals with WPW because [...] inherent risks are involved in the procedure. When performed by an experienced electrophysiologist, <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation has a high success rate. Findings from 1994 indicate success rates of as high as 95% in people treated with <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation for WPW. If <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation is successfully performed, the condition is generally considered cured. Recurrence rates are typically less than 5% after a successful ablation. The one caveat is that individuals with underlying Ebstein's anomaly may develop additional accessory pathways during progression of their disease.|$|E

2500|$|In {{young people}} with little-to-no {{structural}} heart disease where rhythm control is desired and cannot be maintained by medication or cardioversion, then <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation or cryoablation may be attempted and is preferred over years of drug therapy. Although <b>radiofrequency</b> ablation is becoming an accepted intervention in selected younger patients, there is currently a lack of evidence that ablation reduces all-cause mortality, stroke, or heart failure. There are two ongoing clinical trials (CABANA [...] and EAST [...] ) that should provide new information for assessing whether AF catheter ablation is superior to more standard therapy.|$|E

2500|$|Ablation (AF ablation) is {{a method}} that {{increasingly}} is used to treat cases of recurrent AF that are unresponsive to conventional treatments. <b>Radiofrequency</b> ablation (RFA) uses <b>radiofrequency</b> energy to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in heart tissue. Other energy sources include laser, cryothermy and high intensity ultrasound. The energy emitting probe (electrode) is placed into the heart through a catheter inserted into veins in the groin or neck. Electrodes that can detect electrical activity from inside the heart are also inserted, and the electrophysiologist uses these to [...] "map" [...] {{an area of the}} heart to locate the abnormal electrical activity before eliminating the responsible tissue.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization has {{categorized}} {{electromagnetic fields}} produced by mobile phones as [...] "possibly carcinogenic", although most {{studies have found}} no such association.

2500|$|Due to the {{reentrant}} {{nature of}} atrial flutter, {{it is often}} possible to ablate the circuit that causes atrial flutter with <b>radiofrequency</b> catheter ablation. [...] This {{is done in the}} electrophysiology lab by causing a ridge of scar tissue in the isthmus that crosses the path of the circuit that causes atrial flutter. Eliminating conduction through the isthmus prevents reentry, and if successful, prevents the recurrence of the atrial flutter.|$|E
