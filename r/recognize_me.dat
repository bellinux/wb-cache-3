5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people <b>recognize</b> <b>me,</b> it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still <b>recognize</b> <b>me</b> from that movie. It's on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also mentioned, [...] "A lot {{of people}} do <b>recognize</b> <b>me</b> now, which {{surprised}} me. I noticed it most coming through Heathrow on our tour of Europe. English people, Indians, Sri Lankans, anyone who knew cricket seemed to recognize me." ...|$|E

60|$|He fanned {{away the}} smoke of his pipe, that he might {{get a better view}} of <b>me,</b> and soon <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> with great delight.|$|R
2500|$|... "One of {{the biggest}} things that I wanted to do on this album was make people realize why {{they fell in love}} with me {{in the first place and}} then take them on a journey to where I am now musically. My ear is {{different}} but I think people will <b>recognize</b> <b>me.</b> I think you'll hear that I'm in a happy place. I miss my music. My hunger is different than the first time around".|$|E
2500|$|Kagen {{came under}} fire for a rumored comment at a November 13, 2006 White House function, after Appleton-area {{newspapers}} picked up on a story printed in an alternative paper, The Scene. According to the paper, Congressman-elect Kagen met presidential adviser Karl Rove in a bathroom and told him : [...] "You <b>recognize</b> <b>me?</b> My name's Dr. Multimillionaire and I kicked your ass." [...] The term [...] "Dr. Multimillionaire" [...] refers to the name [...] "Dr. Millionaire" [...] the Republican campaign {{used to refer to}} Kagen during the 2006 campaign. The Scene also said that the Congressman-elect thanked Vice President Cheney and President Bush for campaigning in Wisconsin for his opponent, telling them, [...] "'I couldn't have won without your help.'" [...] It is reported that he then addressed First Lady Laura Bush as Barbara, saying [...] "I learned on the campaign trail that the biggest insult you could do to another man is to call his wife by another name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad she}} didn't <b>recognize</b> <b>me.</b> Of course, I don't know her, and {{the chances are}} that I never shall, but I should hate to have any one <b>recognize</b> <b>me</b> here, or hereafter, as that young man at the {{stocking}} counter. Gad! but it's beastly that a regular life-sized man should be selling stockings to women for a living, or rather {{for a fraction of}} a living." ...|$|E
60|$|Matai Shang {{stepped forward}} and laid his hand upon my shoulder. No {{slightest}} indication that he <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> showed upon his countenance--my disguise was evidently complete.|$|R
60|$|The maid {{rose with}} {{suspicious}} alacrity. The spaniel yawned {{and looked at}} me {{out of the corner of}} his black eye. I believe that he <b>recognized</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

60|$|I don't {{think he}} <b>recognized</b> <b>me,</b> but he {{perceived}} immediately I meant attacking. He struck out at once at me a haphazard blow, and touched {{me on the}} cheek.|$|R
60|$|Among {{the prisoners}} was Yersted, {{commander}} of the submarine. He <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> from the three trips that I had taken with him during my captivity among the First Born.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shouldn't think so. For {{one thing}} I don't think he <b>recognized</b> <b>me.</b> Probably doesn't know me by sight, {{and he was}} fast asleep, too. No, I fancy I'm all right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd <b>recognize</b> <b>me,</b> if it wasn't so dark," [...] replied Gale, halting. [...] "I {{spoke to}} you a little while ago--in the saloon back there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. He didn't <b>recognize</b> <b>me</b> or {{know what}} was coming till Silvermane was on him. But he was quick, and fell sidewise. Silvermane's knee sent him sprawling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{is perhaps}} not {{astonishing}} that you don’t seem to <b>recognize</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Harding,” he said. “You {{have no idea where}} your father can have gone to?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes. You will {{understand}} what I mean when I {{tell you that}} I was Lucy Davidson. I fancied {{some of the people}} here would have <b>recognized</b> <b>me,</b> but it seems they haven’t.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In some languages, such as Spanish, restrictiveness is {{consistently}} marked; for example, in Spanish la tarea difícil means [...] "the difficult task" [...] {{in the sense}} of [...] "the task that is difficult" [...] (restrictive), whereas la difícil tarea means [...] "the difficult task" [...] {{in the sense of}} [...] "the task, which is difficult" [...] (non-restrictive). In English, restrictiveness is not marked on adjectives, but is marked on relative clauses (the difference between [...] "the man who <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> was there" [...] and [...] "the man, who <b>recognized</b> <b>me,</b> was there" [...] being one of restrictiveness).|$|R

60|$|Lys {{stood with}} a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I {{approached}} her, she half turned toward me to see who it was. When she <b>recognized</b> <b>me,</b> she immediately turned away.|$|R
60|$|I walked at once up to {{the window}} of their car and knocked at it. Delora leaned forward and <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> at once. His face, for a moment, seemed dark with anger. He let down the sash.|$|R
6000|$|LADY UTTERWORD. I {{certainly}} am Addy; and I don't think I {{can be so}} {{changed that}} you would not have <b>recognized</b> <b>me</b> if you had any real affection for me. And Papa didn't think me even worth mentioning! ...|$|R
