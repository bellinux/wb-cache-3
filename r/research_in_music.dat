25|$|Music {{psychology}} can {{shed light}} on non-psychological aspects of musicology and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. <b>Research</b> <b>in</b> <b>music</b> history can benefit from systematic study {{of the history of}} musical syntax, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. Ethnomusicology can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of music cognition in different cultures.|$|E
