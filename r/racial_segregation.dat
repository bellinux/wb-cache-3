40|$|This study merges the {{frameworks}} {{of social}} epidemiology, human ecology, and Critical Race Theory {{to examine the}} impact of <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> on <b>racial</b> disparities in cancer incidence/mortality and characteristics of the social and physical environment. County-level data on cancer incidence, cancer mortality, <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation,</b> and other characteristics of the social and physical environment are collected from nine publically-available sources. 	 Regression models identify predictors of the racial disparity in cancer incidence and cancer mortality. <b>Racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> is not a significant predictor of the racial gap in cancer incidence or the racial gap in cancer mortality after controlling for the racial gap in median household income. Racial disparity in median household income is the most significant predictor of both the racial gap in cancer incidence and the racial gap in cancer mortality. Although there is no significant relationship between <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> and the <b>racial</b> gap in cancer incidence and cancer mortality was not found, highly segregated areas do face certain forms of disadvantage in several health-protecting resources—housing, exposure to environmental pollutants, educational attainment, and economic opportunities. In order for interventions and policies to be effective in reducing racial disparities in health outcomes, the structural (i. e., foundational and fundamental) causes of these inequalities—institutional racism, <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation,</b> economic/educational inequalities—must be addressed. In addition, the methods used to "protect confidentiality" and "maintain data reliability" of publically available data sources need to be examined through the lens of Critical Race Theory to determine whether these methods are simply supporting the racialized structure and protecting the status quo. ...|$|R

40|$|Importance: Despite {{cross-sectional}} {{evidence linking}} <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> to hypertension prevalence among non-Hispanic blacks, {{it remains unclear}} how changes in exposure to neighborhood segregation {{may be associated with}} changes in blood pressure. Objective: To examine the association of changes in neighborhood-level <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 25 -year period. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational study examined longitudinal data of 2280 black participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective investigation of adults aged 18 to 30 years who underwent baseline examinations in field centers in 4 US locations from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, and then were re-examined for the next 25 years. <b>Racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> was assessed using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, a measure of SD between the neighborhood 2 ̆ 7 s racial composition (ie, percentage of black residents) and the surrounding area 2 ̆ 7 s <b>racial</b> composition. <b>Segregation</b> was categorized as high (Gi* 3 ̆e 1. 96), medium (Gi* 0 - 1. 96), and low (Gi* 3 ̆c 0).

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom is that racial diversity promotes positive race relations and reduces <b>racial</b> residential <b>segregation</b> between blacks and whites. We use data from the 1990 – 2010 decennial censuses and 2007 – 2011 ACS to test this so-called “buffering hypothesis. ” We identify cities, suburbs, and small towns that are virtually all white, all black, all Asian, all Hispanic, and everything in between.

Black-white segregation also declined most rapidly in the most racially diverse places and in places that experienced the largest recent increases in diversity.

The culture theory is predicated upon three axes of a cultural framework: philosophical rationalism versus philosophical skepticism, idealism vs. materialism and the individual as an abstract entity versus the social individual as a unit of analysis. Theories of change and spatial theory are also components of this cultural theory, and the culture theory is also applied to study developers, government, and majority population. Statistical differences are explored using dissimilarity indices and isolation indices and differences between the two ethnic groups are analyzed through Mann-Whitney U tests.
