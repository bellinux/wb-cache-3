40|$|Existing {{research}} {{across cultures}} often demonstrates that subjective well-being (SWB) {{is influenced by}} a person’s culture. Individualistic and collectivistic cultures vary in how they <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> subjective wellbeing {{as a result of}} the different values inherent in each culture. The following paper provides an overview of the many studies that show how the role of culture affects SWB. It will determine whether self-identity or group membership impacts how people <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> life satisfaction. Studies that support the individualistic side and studies that support the collectivistic side will be observed to determine if different cultural values impact how people <b>rate</b> <b>their</b> SWB. This research suggests that subjective well-being is indeed influenced by culture...|$|R

25|$|Another study {{examined}} the incorporation of music with therapeutic upper extremity exercises on pain perception in stroke victims. Over the course of eight weeks, stroke victims participated in upper extremity exercises (of the hand, wrist, and shoulder joints) in conjunction {{with one of the}} three conditions: song, karaoke accompaniment, and no music. Patients participated in each condition once, according to a randomized order, and <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> perceived pain immediately after the session. Results showed that although {{there was no significant difference}} in pain rating across the conditions, video observations revealed more positive affect and verbal responses while performing upper extremity exercises with both music and karaoke accompaniment. Nayak et al. examined the combination of music therapy with traditional stroke rehabilitation and also found that the addition of music therapy improved mood and social interaction. Participants who had suffered traumatic brain injury or stroke were placed in one of two conditions: standard rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation along with music therapy. Participants received three treatments per week for up to ten treatments. Therapists found that participants who received music therapy in conjunction with traditional methods had improved social interaction and mood.|$|E

25|$|Stereotype threat {{has been}} shown to affect {{performance}} and confidence in mathematics of both males and females. In another experiment conducted on 80 Cornell University undergraduates, participants were taught how to perform a new task in gender salient (male advantage) versus gender-neutral conditions. Participants in the gender salient condition were told, “males on average perform better on such tests.” Even though participants were given identical scores {{at the end of the}} task, women in the gender salient condition <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> ability on the task significantly lower than those in the gender-neutral condition, and even reported reduced interest in related occupations. While these two studies highlight the effect of stereotype threat on self-perception, another experiment by Rydell and colleagues found that stereotype threat can actually impair women’s ability to learn new gender-typed material. Women in the stereotype threat condition had difficulty encoding math-related information into memory and, therefore, learned fewer mathematical rules and showed poorer math performance than did controls. Stereotype threat reduced women’s, but not men’s, ability to learn abstract mathematical rules and to transfer these rules to a second, isomorphic task. The researchers concluded that negative stereotypes about women in math reduce their level of math learning, which then leads to poorer performance in negatively stereotyped domains.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E

In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a [...] "monitor" [...] or [...] "guide" [...] whom the volunteers supposedly trusted. The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety. The volunteers and monitors all remained blind to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment.|$|E
500|$|Several reporters {{reviewed}} Slipknot's headlining slot at England's Download Festival on June 13, 2009. Greg Cochrane, {{writing for}} the BBC, championed Slipknot as [...] "spectacular headliners", explaining: [...] "Flame throwers, pneumatic drum kits and mass screaming, it has it all." [...] NME said Slipknot's performance [...] "saw the Main Stage become a scene of chaos", noting how the band members [...] "roamed the stage randomly smashing the set up with baseball bats, throwing barrels around and hanging off [...] revolving drumkit." [...] Ian Strachan of The Sun <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> performance an 8 out of 10, reporting that [...] "the tunes were tight and delivered with venom." [...] He also cited a moment during [...] "Spit It Out" [...] in which Taylor got the crowd to crouch down and jump up all at once as [...] "one of the stand out moments of the festival." [...] Christa Ktorides of Clickmusic said, [...] "The sight of 70,000people sitting down on command is something we won't long forget." [...] She also described their performance as [...] "simply ferocious." [...] Metal Hammer reviewer Ted Bezer called it [...] "arguably the greatest headline performance of the Download era", adding, [...] "Slipknot absolutely destroyed 70,000people {{in a way that}} it didn’t seem was possible."

500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors {{did not have much}} to do in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E

500|$|Following their collision, Hamilton and Rosberg were {{summoned to}} the {{stewards}} after the race but neither received a penalty, as the stewards <b>rated</b> <b>their</b> crash as a racing incident, with no driver in particular to blame. It emerged that Rosberg had chosen the wrong engine mode for the start, being down on power which led to Hamilton going for a passing manoeuvre. However, Rosberg remained convinced {{that he had done}} nothing wrong, saying: [...] "I made it very clear I wasn't going to leave any space on the inside and I was very surprised he went for the gap". While Hamilton apologised to the team after the incident, he refused to accept blame for it. Opinions about the incident varied: While Mercedes's executive chairman Niki Lauda blamed Hamilton for the crash, former F1 driver Anthony Davidson said on Sky Sports F1 that Rosberg's move was [...] "very aggressive". Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart said after the race that Mercedes should fine Hamilton for the crash: [...] "Hamilton is to blame. Rosberg was allowed to protect himself. You don't go for it on the first lap." [...] Mercedes's head of motorsport Toto Wolff stressed after the race that the team would continue to let their drivers race against each other freely, a decision praised by former world champion Alain Prost. While Rosberg said after the race that he contemplated having a talk with Hamilton about the situation, Mercedes later decided that they did [...] "not need clear-the-air talks". However, it later emerged that the pair did have a conversation about the incident before the next race in Monaco, which, according to Hamilton, was marked by [...] "pure respect". It was Mercedes's first double retirement since the 2011 Australian Grand Prix, and the first time they failed to score a point since the 2012 United States Grand Prix, ending a 62-race long streak, the third longest in Formula One history.|$|E

2500|$|While it {{is thought}} that feminizing {{genitoplasty}} typically requires fewer surgeries to achieve an acceptable result and results in fewer urologic difficulties, {{there is no evidence that}} feminizing surgery results in a better psychosocial outcome.
