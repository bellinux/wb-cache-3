In 1939 the United States Coast Guard replaced the U.S. Lighthouse Service as the agency responsible for maintaining the light but a civilian light keeper remained on site until November 1973 {{and was replaced by}} the Coast Guard. Before Joseph Hindley retired, he may have been the last civilian light keeper in New England.|$|R

50|$|The plot follows Johnny, {{the protagonist}} and narrator, and his boss, McDunn, who are {{putting in a}} night's work at a remote lighthouse. The lighthouse's {{resonating}} <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> attracts a sea monster who destroys the place. This {{is in fact the}} third time the monster has visited the lighthouse: he has been attracted by the same <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> on the same night the two earlier years. McDunn attributes the monster's actions to feelings of unrequited love for the lighthouse, whose <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> sounds exactly like the wailings of the sea monster himself. The <b>fog</b> <b>horn</b> tricks the monster into thinking he has found another of his kind, one who acts as though the monster did not even exist. McDunn and Johnny turn off the <b>fog</b> <b>horn,</b> and in a rage, the monster destroys the lighthouse before retreating to the sea. The lighthouse is reconstructed with reinforced concrete and Johnny finds a new job away from the lighthouse. Years later, Johnny returns and asks McDunn if the monster ever returned; it never did. McDunn hypothesizes that the monster will continue to wait {{in the depths of the}} ocean and only emerge to look for others like it when humankind is gone from the world.|$|R
