5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's <b>Revenge</b> was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's <b>Revenge</b> was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's <b>Revenge</b> was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E

5|$|As <b>Revenge</b> was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. <b>Revenge</b> was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned <b>Revenge</b> while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take <b>Revenge</b> as a prize.|$|E

5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the <b>Revenge</b> and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the <b>Revenge.</b> Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the <b>Revenge</b> by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to Burnout 3: Takedown, titled Burnout <b>Revenge.</b> <b>Revenge</b> retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic {{out of the way and}} into opponents. With <b>Revenge,</b> Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather than just recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E

Jaws: The <b>Revenge</b> was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot.

5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the Barbadian ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled Barbadian sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the <b>Revenge.</b> After the Barbadian sloop's tackle was used to careen the <b>Revenge,</b> the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The <b>Revenge</b> was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the <b>Revenge,</b> increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
