40|$|Abstract: This study {{demonstrates}} {{the importance of}} managing the risk of <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> guarantees, which typically are applicable to most commercial PV projects. A qualitative assessment of the performance metrics has shown multiple performance parameters, which could influence the <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratio.</b> Alternative <b>performance</b> metrics, including the Temperature Corrected <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratio</b> and the Weather Corrected <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratio</b> were evaluated {{by means of a}} quantitative analysis. The Temperature– and Weather Corrected <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratios</b> have both demonstrated the capability of reducing the inter-annual and seasonal variance experienced with the conventional <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratio.</b> The respective <b>performance</b> metrics were further calculated from multiple years of meteorological data in order to construct a statistical distribution for each performance metric. The resulting probability distribution function was then used to determine the probable risk percentiles for each of the respective performance metrics and compared with the separately calculated performance metrics referring to a long-term mean data set. It was demonstrated that the long-term mean derived performance parameters did present a risk for overstating the facilities’ performance. The risk was mitigated by referring to the multi-year’s P 90 percentile instead, irrespective of which performance metric was applicable. M. Ing. (Engineering Management...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the 2 ̆ 2 total 2 ̆ 2 and inhalable dust <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> over a range of conditions to investigate whether the commonly used value of 2. 5 varies between: (1) dust type (2) IOM and Button inhalable samplers and (3) distance from the dust source. Dust concentrations were generated in a still air chamber using three dust types; sawdust, flour, and glass microbeads. The IOM, Button, and CFC samplers were used to measure concentrations at four locations increasing in distance from the source. Linear regressions in the form of [Inhalable mg m- 3] = S x [2 ̆ 2 Total 2 ̆ 2 mg m- 3] were used to calculate the appropriate <b>performance</b> <b>ratio,</b> S. The intercept of this regression was forced through the origin. Linear regression was also used to examine whether the effect of distance on S was significant and a distance factor (β 1) was calculated. The calculated <b>performance</b> <b>ratios,</b> S, differed between sawdust, flour, and glass microbeads, and were 1. 62, 2. 82, and 2. 97 respectively when comparing IOM concentration to CFC concentration. <b>Performance</b> <b>ratios</b> computed for the Button sampler for sawdust, flour, and glass microbreads were 0. 82, 1. 04, and 0. 57 respectively. <b>Performance</b> <b>ratios</b> were significantly different (p= 0. 049) between the two inhalable sampler types. The IOM/CFC <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> for all three dusts averaged 2. 47 (SD= 0. 74), whereas the Button/CFC <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> for the three dusts averaged 0. 81 (SD= 0. 24). Only the IOM/CFC <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> had a statistically significant distance factor at α= 0. 05. The authors caution against using a single <b>performance</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2. 5 for all dusts due to the large variance involved with dust sampler and dust type. Distance from the source did not significantly affect the <b>performance</b> <b>ratios</b> computed under laboratory conditions.

Finally, a rounding procedure is needed to obtain a partition. Goemans and Williamson simply choose a uniformly random hyperplane through the origin and divide the vertices according to which side of the hyperplane the corresponding vectors lie.

With the help of Dr. Raspet, Johnson made several modifications which in 1951 resulted in a better than 40 to 1 glide ratio - the first sailplane to achieve that milestone. At Dr. Raspet's suggestion, the name was changed to the RJ-5. Dick Johnson flew the RJ-5 to win the US Open Class Nationals in 1950, 51, 52 and 54, to break the World Distance Record in 1951 and to break the 100 km Triangle World Speed Record in 1952. The World Distance flight of 535 mi from Odessa, Texas to Salina, Kansas was the first glider flight to exceed 500 miles and broke the previous world record by 70 mi. This record held for 12 years, until broken by Al Parker in a Sisu 1A glider that used a more refined laminar flow airfoil.|$|E
