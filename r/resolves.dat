On September 16, messenger Paul Revere brought Congress the Suffolk <b>Resolves,</b> {{one of many}} resolutions passed in Massachusetts that promised strident resistance to the Coercive Acts.

The set W is a <b>resolving</b> set for G if distinct vertices of G have distinct codes with respect to W. The minimum cardinality of a <b>resolving</b> set for G is its dimension dim(G).

While a superset of any <b>resolving</b> set is always a <b>resolving</b> set, a proper subset of a <b>resolving</b> set {{is not necessarily a}} <b>resolving</b> set, and we are interested in determining <b>resolving</b> sets that are minimal or that are minimum (of minimal cardinality). Let Q^n denote the n-dimensional hypercube with vertex set 0, 1 ^n. In Erdös and Renyi (Erdos & Renyi, 1963) it was shown that a particular set of n vertices forms a <b>resolving</b> set for the hypercube.

5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia <b>Resolves,</b> asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The <b>Resolves</b> were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
