40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some results}} from a theoretical study of moisture and temperature conditions in cold lofts {{and the risk of}} mould growth on the <b>roof</b> <b>underlay</b> in various climates in Norway. The computational model developed for this study calculates the heat, air, and moisture balances within the loft considering parameters describing the building, building materials, outdoor climate as well as parameters influenced by the occupiers. Both stack effect and air leakage distribution are included in the model as air leakages play a key roll both for the moisture content of the indoor air and for the moisture transport {{in and out of the}} loft. In order to perform quantified parameter studies a mould growth potential is introduced. By using simplified relations between the relative rate of mould growth and temperature and relative humidity, respectively, a total mould growth potential is summarized for successive calculation periods. Traditionally cold lofts in Norway have been vented, by openings at the eaves, gables and the ridge, in order to prevent snow melting and to give the roof drying out capability. Closed lofts, without openings to the exterior, however, have several advantages like improved protection against spread of fire reduced risk of snow drifting into the loft and reduced heat loss due to reduced air flow through the roof insulation. The study shows that closed cold lofts may be constructed with low risk of mould growth. The roof however, has to be correctly designed using <b>roof</b> <b>underlay</b> with sufficiently low vapour resistance and...|$|E
40|$|The {{type and}} {{thickness}} of insulation on the topside horizontal of cold pitched roofs {{has a significant}} role in controlling air movement, energy conservation and moisture transfer reduction through the ceiling to the loft (roof void) space. To investigate its importance, a numerical model using a HAM software package on a Matlab platform with a Simulink simulation tool has been developed using insitu measurements of airflows from the dwelling space through the ceiling to the loft of three houses of different configurations and loft space. Considering typical UK <b>roof</b> <b>underlay</b> (i. e. bituminous felt and a vapour permeable underlay), insitu measurements of the 3 houses were tested using a calibrated passive sampling technique. Using the measured airflows, the effect of air movement on three types of roof insulation (i. e. fibreglass, cellulose and foam) was modelled to investigate associated energy losses and moisture transport. The thickness of the insulation materials were varied but the ceiling airtightness and eaves gap size were kept constant. These instances were considered in order to visualize the effects of the changing parameters. In addition, two different roof underlays of varying resistances were considered and compared to access the influence of the underlay, if any, on energy conservation. The comparison of these insulation materials in relation to the other parameters showed that the type of insulation material and thickness, contributes significantly to energy conservation and moisture transfer reduction through the roof and hence of the building as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the last}} 20 years in Sweden have been mild and wet {{compared}} to the 1961 - 1990 climate reference period. After a few relatively cold years in the mid- 1980 s, practically all years have been warmer than the preceding 30 years average. During the indicated period, an increase of moisture-related problems (mould growth) was observed in ventilated attics, a moisture sensitive building part. This work investigates hygrothermal performance of ventilated attics in respect to possible climate change. Hygrothermal simulations of attics were performed numerically in Matlab. Four attic constructions are investigated - a conventional attic and three alternative constructions suggested by practitioners. Simulations were done {{for the period of}} 1961 - 2100 using the weather data of RCA 3 climate model. Effects of three different emissions scenarios are considered. Hygrothermal conditions in the attic are assessed using a mould growth model. Based on the results the highest risk of mould growth was found on the north roof of the attic in Gothenburg, Sweden. Results point to increment of the moisture problems in attics in future. Different emissions scenarios do not influence the risk of mould growth inside the attic due to compensating changes in different variables. Assessing the future performance of the four attics shows that the safe solution is to ventilate the attic mechanically, though this solution inevitably requires extra use of electrical energy for running the fan. Insulating roofs of the attic can decrease the condensation on roofs, but it cannot decrease the risk of mould growth considerably, on the wooden <b>roof</b> <b>underlay...</b>|$|E
40|$|In hot climates, {{ventilated}} pitched roofs with tiled coverings {{reduce the}} heat transfer across the roof, due to the ventilated air layer between tiles and <b>roofing</b> <b>underlay,</b> which is formed by the arrangement of battens and counter-battens. This so-called Above Sheathing Ventilation (ASV), which depends on the air entering and leaving at the eaves, ridge and the gaps between the tiles, has been enhanced by increasing the roof air permeability by means of novel roof tile shapes. This study analyses the air permeability improvement of a novel tile {{and its effect on}} the heat transfer induced by an external heat source (e. g. solar radiation). A CFD model is used to simulate the fluid flow and heat transfer through the tiles, solving the steady-state incompressible fluid flow in a 3 D domain by means of the standard k-ε model. A parametric study is conducted to analyse the variation in the air flow passing through the tile and the tile temperature for different incident air flow conditions. A significant increase in flow rate is observed with the novel tile, which produces a lower temperature of the tile and of the air flowing through the tiles. This would help dissipating the excess heat in summer...|$|R

The separation of the roof covering from the roof deck protects the roof covering from resins in some sheathing materials and cushions unevenness and old nails and splinters in re-roofing applications. The underlayment also sheds water, which penetrates the roof covering from an ordinary leak, a leak from wind-driven rain or snow, wind damage to the roof covering, or ice dams. However, the application of underlays may increase the roof temperature, which {{is the leading cause of}} ageing of asphalt shingles and felt paper wrinkles when it gets wet, which (rarely) shows through asphalt shingles.

Five well-insulated pitched roofs have been constructed in a test building. The five roofs have a south-west and north-east-oriented pitch and differ in long wave emissivity of the underlay. All roofs are equipped with thermocouples and heat fluxes sensors to evaluate the thermal response of the roofs to the climatic conditions. Both summer and winter conditions have been measured. In addition to the in situ evaluation, a laboratory experiment was set-up to evaluate the {{influence of}} the emissivity of the underlay on the summer behaviour of a sloped roof under fixed boundary conditions. With thermocouples and heat flux sensors at different heights in the roof the effect of the reflective foil on the heat gain to the inside could be evaluated. The measured data are compared with a simple numerical model that accounts for the buoyancy effects in the ventilated cavity between tiles and underlay. Laboratory experiments and simulations revealed that a low emissivity of the underlay decreases the heat gain to the indoor environment, but that due to the thermal stack flow in the air cavity underneath the tiles, the advantage of a reflective foil mainly plays a role in the bottom part of the roof. In the in situ measurements it was found that workmanship, airtightness and wind and thermal stack effects are much more important and disturb the possible benefits of using a reflective underlay. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In hot climates tiled pitched roofs {{significantly}} reduce the heat transfer across the roof structure, due to the ventilated air layer between tiles and <b>roofing</b> <b>underlay</b> formed by the arrangement of battens and counter-battens supporting the tiles. This so-called Above Sheathing Ventilation (ASV) depends on the air entering and leaving at the eaves, ridge and the gaps between the tiles. With a view towards higher energy savings in space cooling, the natural and forced convection occurring in ASV could be enhanced by increasing the roof air permeability by means of novel tile shapes, as here analysed in two stages. The first stage of designing the new tile shapes was to measure the air permeability for a type of existing tile (Marseillaise style) using an experimental test rig, by monitoring the volumetric flow rate through the tiles over a range of pressure differences across the tiles. Then, a three-dimensional CFD model was implemented to replicate the full test rig geometry, and this was calibrated against the experimental data. In the next stage, the calibration was used to support the design of novel Marseillaise tile shapes, and to compare their performance against existing tiles. Finally, in order to analyse the variation in air flow under typical wind conditions for a pitched roof, a parametric study was undertaken, consisting of 72 scenarios varying wind speed, direction and angle of incidence. An increase in volumetric flow rate through the tiles {{was found to be}} related not only to an increase in the open area between tiles, but also to the design of the tile locks. By redesigning the geometry of these locks, whilst still giving consideration to their primary purpose of preventing the ingress of driving rain, it was possible to yield an improvement in air permeability of up to 100...|$|R

This is also the case for the Aso- 4 magma, as (1) amphibole, plagioclase, and Fe–Ti oxide minerals sometimes occur as crystal clots, (2) both amphiboles and some pyroxenes were in disequilibrium with the 4 I- 1 melt, (3) amphiboles and pyroxenes in the 4 I- 1 pyroclasts were crystallized in the discrete melts of different H 2 O contents and/or compositions, and (4) amphiboles not enriched in Al are common in the 4 I- 1 magma. These evidences indicate that they were incorporated into the 4 I- 1 melt from crystal mush that accumulated beneath the 4 I- 1 magma chamber. The crystal mush was formed by the accumulation of mineral phases that crystallized within the Aso- 4 magma reservoir. The accumulated crystal mush formed a thermal conduction layer {{at the base of the}} reservoir that inhibited cooling from the base. As a result, the magma reservoir cooled only from the <b>roof</b> and the <b>underlying</b> crystal mush layer had a higher temperature than the overlying magma chamber (e.g., Nishimura 2012).

We develop a numerical model of sedimentary basin evolution based on the mechanism suggested by Lobkovsky. In the course of rifting, accompanied by thinning of lower parts of the lithosphere, the <b>roof</b> of the <b>underlying</b> asthenosphere moves upward. The material of the mantle lifts and partially melts owing to the reduction of pressure. The density difference between the melt and the crystalline skeleton results in the filtration of the lighter melt and its accumulation {{in the form of}} a magmatic lens. Due to changed P-T conditions, the material of the lens undergoes the gabbro-eclogite phase transform-ation. The resultant anomalously heavy eclogite lens sinks in the surrounding material. This induces a viscous flow, changing the surface topography and forming a sedimentary basin. We construct a 2 -D numerical model describing a viscous flow induced by subsidence of a heavy body and compute changes of surface topography. To compute the flow we employ the Galerkin-spline approach, with modifications allowing for density discontinuities and time dependence of the phase transformation. We apply the model to the cases of the Illinois, Michigan and Williston basins. The computed and tectonic subsidence curves agree well for these cases. The proposed model is compatible with the seismic structure of the crust and upper mantle below these basins. The model is also consistent with gravity data.

More than 96 % of all recovered rocks are gabbroic.

Below 1235 mbsf, massive gabbronorites/oxide gabbros were drilled and they may represent the <b>roof</b> of an <b>underlying</b> magmatic unit. The focus here is on the zone where both units interact and screens, totaling 50 m, of a microstructurally distinct, olivine-rich troctolite occur. We argue that the olivine-rich troctolite is a former mantle rock which was converted to a crust-mantle transition zone dunite {{at the base of the}} upper magmatic unit. Later, as melts derived from the lower magmatic unit percolated through it, it was equilibrated to a more evolved chemistry and transformed to a fine-grained, olivine-rich troctolite. Our main arguments against a possible cumulate nature of the olivine-rich troctolite are the lack of a systematic downhole trend in compatible elements within the olivine-rich troctolite, its distinctly fine-grained microstructure, the high Cr content of cpx, and its Ni-rich olivine composition. The high NiO for a given Mg/(Mg + Fe) in the olivine-rich troctolite can be modeled by simple equilibration of relict mantle olivine with a mildly evolved melt. Evidence for the percolation of evolved melts through the olivine-rich troctolites are Ti-rich, interstitial pyroxenes and, as inclusions in Cr-spinel, highly evolved amphiboles and orthopyroxenes plus the occurrence of millimeter-scale noritic veins. The percolation by evolved melts would also be the major difference to otherwise conceptually similar rocks from the ophiolitic crust-mantle transition zone...|$|R
40|$|Greenroofs are roofs {{that grow}} plants” Greenroofs are roofs that grow plants. Just like {{conventional}} roofs they are waterproof – {{a series of}} membranes seal the building, keeping the weather out and the occupants dry. Unlike conventional roofs, the plants and growing media provide benefi ts, ranging from noise and energy insulation to storm-water mitigation and animal habitat – and they also look great! Th e ancestor of modern greenroofs is the thick Scandinavian and Irish turf or sod roof, once common because sod was inexpensive and readily available. Th e parents of modern greenroofs are roof gardens in which plants are grown either in irrigated containers or relatively deep beds (Fig. 1) to enhance aesthetics and provide passive recreational space. Some London Parks are greenroofs, for example, the Jubilee Gardens in Canary Wharf (Gedge and Kadas 2005). Roof gardens include New Zealand’s most famous greenroof, on Kawakawa’s Hundertwasser toilets (Fig. 2). Th ey are technically described as intensive greenroofs. A heavily reinforced roof supports a relatively deep substrate growing a range of plants that are not very diff erent from those found in landscaped areas. Such greenroofs require regular weeding and maintenance and are usually irrigated. Extensive greenroofs are lightweight, cover the majority of a roof, and are not usually designed to be walked on excpet during amintenance. Th eir lightness (75 to 150 kg/m 2 saturated mass) comes {{from a combination of}} a shallow (50 to 150 mm) and low density substrate – they have dry weights of 0. 5 to 0. 8 T/m 3 compared with common natural soils that weigh in at 0. 9 to 1. 3 T/m 3. Th e roofs are planted with dense, wind and drought-resistant groundcovers (< 200 mm high) and are generally not irrigated. Extensive greenroofs are therefore much cheaper than intensive greenroofs and roof gardens because additional structural support, needed to hold up the roof, is minimised and maintenance is low. Extensive greenroofs can provide the following benefi ts: • cost savings by extending the life of the <b>underlying</b> <b>roof,</b> and insulating the building.

40|$|THESIS 8606 Calderas are 1 - 100 km diameter, {{volcanic}} depressions {{that form}} primarily through m-scale to km?scale subsidence of a magma reservoir <b>roof</b> into an <b>underlying</b> magma reservoir. This study addresses several fundamental geometric and kinematic {{aspects of the}} structure of caldera volcanoes via a series of scaled physical (or analogue) modelling experiments. Results of these models are combined in detail with observations from natural calderas recorded in the literature, in order to provide as strong an element of ?ground-truthing? for the experimental results as possible. The basic experimental materials and methods are common to all the results chapters (2 - 6), and so for convenience are summarised together in Chapter 1. An exception to some extent is the experiment set described is Chapter 5; these were made with different materials and apparatus, the particulars of which are described in that chapter. Each of the results chapters is otherwise self-contained, with its own specific introduction to the problems addressed, summary of data, discussion, and conclusions. The contents of Chapters 1, 5, and 6 have been published in two peer-reviewed articles. The remaining chapters are presently unpublished, although Chapter 3 and part of Chapter 4 have been submitted for peer review, whilst the rest of Chapter 4 and a part of Chapter 2 will be submitted for publication at a later date. Given the assistance of co-authors in the preparation of manuscripts now integrated into the thesis, my contribution to the individual chapters as presented here may be summarised as: Chapter 1 : 85 %, Chapter 2 : 90 %, Chapter 3 : 75 %, Chapter 4 : 80 %, Chapter 5 : 50 %, Chapter 5 : 75 %. The structure of the thesis, the major aspects of caldera evolution investigated, and the main results are as follows: Chapter 1 : Introduction and Methodology - outlines the current understanding of caldera structure as achieved to date by previous authors and supplies the rationale for using physical models to help unravel caldera evolution. This section also summarises the insights for how these. Details of the experimental methodology employed in this study, as well as scaling considerations for the application of small-scale models to the study of large-scale deformation associated with caldera subsidence in nature, are also provided. Chapter 2 : The Geometry and Evolution of Circular Caldera Collapse Structures - details the results of experimental subsidence of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are circular in plan view. This baseline experiment set illustrates the generalised kinematic evolution of caldera subsidence. Structures resolving radial and concentric strains are documented, the latter for the first time. The control of the roof?s thickness/diameter ratio upon these structures? development is also highlighted. The kinematics of caldera ring faults, the generation of polygonal caldera outlines and the development of piecemeal-type subsidence are also discussed in light of the evidence from experiment and nature. Chapter 3 : The Caldera Collapse Continuum - systematically integrates results of simple circular collapses in Chapter 2 with those from past experimental, numerical and field studies to produce a ?state-of-the-art? synthesis of the mechanics and kinematics of caldera collapse. This synthesis sheds new light on the long-standing but poorly-defined continuum between end-member caldera collapse styles. Structural elements characteristic of each end-member are shown to reflect progressively overlapping structural sub-processes in a single collapse event. The continuum between end-member collapse styles is thus defined primarily as a progressive evolution related to increasing subsidence, although the regulatory role of roof thickness/diameter and caldera subsidence/diameter ratios in the development of structural elements of each collapse end-member is also highlighted. Chapter 4 : The Role of Magma Chamber Ellipticity in Caldera Collapse ? documents the results of experimental collapse of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are varyingly elliptical in plan view. Physical models demonstrate that an elliptical reservoir roof predictably fails first at the ends of its shorter principal axis, and show that lateral propagation (?unzipping?) patterns vary systematically with ellipticity. The models also highlight a characteristic geometric arrangement of elliptical ring structures and provide a first comprehensive view of the elliptical caldera structural architecture in 3 D. Chapters 5 & 6 : Regional tectonic influences on the evolution of caldera collapse ? outlines the results of experimental collapse of reservoir roofs that contain pre-existing mechanical anisotropies in the form of regional-tectonic faults and collapse under regional tectonic stress. Although disregarded in most previous physical and numerical models of calderas, regional faults have long been thought {{to play a major role}} in caldera development, principally through their reactivation during collapse. In Chapter 5, caldera formation in areas of orthogonal regional deformation is examined; in Chapter 6, caldera collapse in strike-slip regimes is investigated. In physical models, regional faults reactivated during collapse where they coincided with and ran parallel to the magma reservoir margins. Here, where syn-collapse strain usually tends to localise, pre-collapse faults are optimally orientated for reactivation. Contrary to inferences from some previous field studies, differential movement on pre-collapse faults was not observed in central parts of the subsiding reservoir roof. Physical models thus confirm that regional fault reactivation is an important process, and help clarify conditions favouring it. Chapter 7 : Summary of Main Conclusions and Outlook - provides a brief overview of the main findings of this thesis, notes their general implications for our understanding of calderas, and outlines some potential avenues for future work. An electronic appendix (DVD) is attached to the back of the thesis. This appendix contains photos of all experiments (in jpeg format), animations of the experiments (in MS PowerPoint files), and copies of the two published articles (in PDF format) ...|$|R
