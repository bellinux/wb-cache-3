5|$|After {{returning}} to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a <b>regimen</b> <b>of</b> spiritual training, regularly retreating {{to the mountains}} or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 {{he was asked to}} give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. After a couple of weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.|$|E
5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, {{he spent most of}} his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This <b>regimen</b> <b>of</b> constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To achieve optimal {{effect with}} {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics, regimens with frequent dosages {{have been found}} necessary. However, if compliance is negatively influenced by more frequent dosages, this might hamper {{the effect of the}} treatments. Therefore, we have studied whether the numbers of daily dosages influence the compliance with prescribed flucloxacillin regimens. Design: A prospective interview study of patients with different dosing <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> flucloxacillin. Setting: In the study, 200 patients with different dosing <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> flucloxacillin underwent structured telephone interviews in order to reveal their compliance with the medication. Of these, 13 were prescribed twice-daily doses, 163 three times daily and 24 patients four times daily regimens. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between missed doses and prescribed numbers of daily doses. There was, however, {{a significant difference in the}} number of daily doses and experiences associated with the medication. Conclusions: This study shows that patients comply well with <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> up to four daily doses of flucloxacillin, despite experiencing increasing difficulties with <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> more frequent dosages. </span...|$|R

The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug <b>regimen</b> <b>of</b> patients under the CPA.

5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a <b>regimen</b> <b>of</b> exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review {{was performed to}} study the efficacy and safety of recombinant FSH (rFSH) versus urinary FSH (uFSH) and to compare different dose <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> rFSH for ovulation induction in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Six randomized controlled trials {{were included in the}} review, according to the principles of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. Three trials compared rFSH with uFSH and three trials compared two different treatment <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> rFSH. Participants were women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS. Main outcome measures were ovulation, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy, ovarian stimulation syndrome (OSS), total gonadotrophin dose used and total duration of stimulation. Summary statistics were expressed as odds ratios. Data from the trials comparing rFSH and uFSH could be pooled. There was no evidence of a difference between rFSH and uFSH in any of the outcomes. Data from the trials comparing different dose <b>regimens</b> <b>of</b> rFSH could not be combined, and for each comparison there was insufficient evidence of a difference.

5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar <b>regimen</b> <b>of</b> drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E
