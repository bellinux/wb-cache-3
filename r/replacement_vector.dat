There is an upper {{limit on the}} amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), {{therefore}} to allow foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, phage cloning vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for lysogeny since using phage λ as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle. [...] There are two kinds of λ phage vectors - insertion vector and <b>replacement</b> <b>vector.</b> Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5-11 kb may be inserted. In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8-24 kb may be inserted.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} established that coexpression of both Cre and Flp recombinases catalyzes the exchange of sequences flanked by single loxP and FRT sites integrated into the genome at a random location. However, these studies did not explore whether such an approach {{could be used to}} modify conditional mouse alleles carrying single or multiple loxP and FRT sites. dual RMCE (dRMCE; Osterwalder et al., 2010) was recently developed as a re-engineering tool applicable to the vast numbers of mouse conditional alleles that harbor wild-type loxP and FRT sites and therefore are not compatible with conventional RMCE. The general dRMCE strategy takes advantage of the fact that most conditional alleles encode a selection cassette flanked by FRT sites, in addition to loxP sites that flank functionally relevant exons ('floxed' exons). The FRT-flanked selection cassette is in general placed outside the loxP-flanked region, which renders these alleles directly compatible with dRMCE. Simultaneous expression of Cre and Flp recombinases induces cis recombination and formation of the deleted allele, which then serves as a 'docking site' at which to insert the <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> by trans recombination. The correctly replaced locus would encode the custom modification and a different drug-selection cassette flanked by single loxP and FRT sites. dRMCE therefore appears as a very efficient tool for targeted re-engineering of thousands of mouse alleles produced by the IKMC consortium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Targeted {{mutagenesis}} of the herpesvirus genomes {{has been}} {{facilitated by the}} use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology. Such modified genomes have potential uses in understanding viral pathogenesis, gene identification and characterization, and the development of new viral vectors and vaccines. We have previously described the construction of a herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV- 2) BAC and the use of an allele replacement strategy to construct HSV- 2 recombinants. While the BAC mutagenesis procedure is a powerful method to generate HSV- 2 recombinants, particularly in the absence of selective marker in eukaryotic culture, the mutagenesis procedure is still difficult and cumbersome. Results Here we describe the incorporation of a phage lambda recombination system into an allele <b>replacement</b> <b>vector.</b> This strategy enables any DNA fragment containing the phage att L recombination sites to be efficiently inserted into the att R sites of the allele <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> using phage lambda clonase. We also describe how the incorporation of EGFP into the allele <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> can facilitate the selection of the desired cross-over recombinant BACs when the allele replacement reaction is a viral gene deletion. Finally, we incorporate the lambda phage recombination sites directly into an HSV- 2 BAC vector for direct recombination of gene cassettes using the phage lambda clonase-driven recombination reaction. Conclusion Together, these improvements to the techniques of HSV BAC mutagenesis will facilitate the construction of recombinant herpes simplex viruses and viral vectors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{targeting}} {{has been}} used to direct mutations into specific chromosomal loci in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The altered locus can be studied in vivo with chimeras and, if the mutated cells contribute to the germ line, in their offspring. Although homologous recombination is the basis for the widely used gene targeting techniques, to date, the mechanism of homologous recombination between a vector and the chromosomal target in mammalian cells is essentially unknown. Here we look at the nature of gene targeting in ES cells by comparing an insertion vector with replacement vectors that target hprt. We found that the insertion vector targeted up to ninefold more frequently than a <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> with the same length of homologous sequence. We also observed that the majority of clones targeted with replacement vectors did not recombine as predicted. Analysis of the recombinant structures showed that the external heterologous sequences were often incorporated into the target locus. This observation can be explained by either single reciprocal recombination (vector insertion) of a recircularized vector or double reciprocal recombination/gene conversion (gene replacement) of a vector concatemer. Thus, single reciprocal recombination of an insertion vector occurs 92 -fold more frequently than double reciprocal recombination of a <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> with crossover junctions on both the long and short arms...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{targeting}} {{was used}} to introduce nonselectable genetic changes into chromosomal loci in mouse embryo-derived stem cells. The nonselectable markers were linked to a selectable marker in both insertion- and replacement-type vectors, and {{the transfer of the}} two elements to the Hprt locus was assayed. When insertion vectors were used as substrates, the frequency of transfer was highly dependent upon the distance between the nonselectable marker and the double-strand break in the vector. A marker located close to the vector ends was frequently lost, suggesting that a double-strand gap repair activity is involved in <b>vector</b> integration. When <b>replacement</b> <b>vectors</b> were used, cotransfer of a selectable marker and a nonselectable marker 3 kb apart was over 50 %, suggesting that recombination between vector and target often occurs near the ends of the vector.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new system of}} chromosomal mutagenesis in order to study the functions of uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs) in wild-type Escherichia coli. Because of the operon structure of this organism, traditional methods such as insertional mutagenesis run the risk of introducing polar effects on downstream genes or creating secondary mutations elsewhere in the genome. Our system uses crossover PCR to create in-frame, tagged deletions in chromosomal DNA. These deletions are placed in the E. coli chromosome by using plasmid pKO 3, a gene <b>replacement</b> <b>vector</b> that contains a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and markers for positive and negative selection for chromosomal integration and excision. Using kanamycin resistance (Kn(r)) insertional alleles of the essential genes pepM and rpsB cloned into the <b>replacement</b> <b>vector,</b> we calibrated the system for the expected results when essential genes are deleted. Two poorly understood genes, hdeA and yjbJ, encoding highly abundant proteins were selected as targets for this approach. When the system was used to replace chromosomal hdeA with insertional alleles, we observed vastly different results that were dependent on the exact nature of the insertions. When a Kn(r) gene was inserted into hdeA at two different locations and orientations, both essential and nonessential phenotypes were seen. Using PCR-generated deletions, we were able to make in-frame deletion strains of both hdeA and yjbJ. The two genes proved to be nonessential in both rich and glucose-minimal media. In competition experiments using isogenic strains, the strain with the insertional allele of yjbJ showed growth rates {{different from those of the}} strain with the deletion allele of yjbJ. These results illustrate that in-frame, unmarked deletions are among the most reliable types of mutations available for wild-type E. coli. Because these strains are isogenic with the exception of their deleted ORFs, they may be used in competition with one another to reveal phenotypes not apparent when cultured singly...|$|E

Here, we engineered a mutated counter-selectable marker based on the B. pseudomallei PheS (the α-subunit of phenylalanyl tRNA synthase) protein and tested its effectiveness in three different Burkholderia species. The mutant PheS protein effectively killed 100 % of the bacteria in the presence of 0. 1 % p-chlorophenylalanine. We assembled the mutant pheS on several allelic <b>replacement</b> <b>vectors,</b> in addition to constructing selectable markers based on tellurite (Telr) and trimethoprim (Tpr) resistance that are excisable by flanking unique FLP recombination target (FRT) sequences.

The agnoprotein initiator codon and overlapping open reading frame thus act as strong barriers to further ribosome scanning and prevent initiation at the env AUG codon.

40|$|Mutations were {{targeted}} to the Hprt locus in murine {{embryonic stem cells}} by using sequence <b>replacement</b> <b>vectors.</b> When the vector was designed such that the mutated sequences were flanked on both sides by several kilobases of DNA homologous to the target locus, replacement of chromosomal sequences with the exogenous DNA occurred with precision. If, on the other hand, the target-homologous DNA on one arm of the vector was reduced to below 1 kb in length, the fidelity of recombination was diminished. Gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem (ES) cells (22) provides the means to introduce specific mutations into the mouse genome. Analysis of the phenotypes of mice carrying such mutations has provided insight into the biological roles {{of a number of}} genes whose functions had previously been only a matter of speculation (3, 4, 8 - 11, 13, 15 - 18, 20, 23 - 25). The first step in the gene targeting protocol is to mutate, in vitro, a cloned copy of the gene of interest. The mutated gene, carried on a targeting vector, is then introduced int...|$|R
40|$|Rare term <b>vector</b> <b>replacement</b> (RTVR) {{is a novel}} {{technique}} for dimensionality reduc-tion. In this paper, we introduce an up-dating algorithm for RTVR. It is capable of updating both the projection matrix for the reduction and the reduced corpus ma-trix directly, without having to recompute the expensive projection operation. We in-troduce an effective batch updating algo-rithm, and present performance measure-ments on {{a subset of the}} Reuters newswire corpus that show that a 12. 5 % to 50 % split of the documents into corpus and update vectors leads to a three to four fold speed-up over a complete rebuild. Thus, we have enabled optimized updating for rare term <b>vector</b> <b>replacement.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{general system}} is {{described}} that facilitates gene replacements {{such that the}} recombinant strains are not labelled with antibiotic resistance genes. The method {{is based on the}} conditional replication of derivatives of the lactococcal plasmid pWV 01, which lacks the repA gene encoding the replication initiation protein. <b>Replacement</b> <b>vectors</b> can be constructed in and isolated from gram-positive and gram-negative helper strains that provide RepA in trans. Cointegrate formation of the integration vectors with the chromosome of the target strain is selected by antibiotic resistance. Resolution of the cointegrate structure is identified in the second step of the procedure by the loss of the lacZ reporter gene present in the delivery vector. The second recombination event results either in gene replacement or in restoration of the original copy of the gene. As no antibiotic resistance marker is present in the genome of the mutant the system can be used to introduce multiple mutations in one strain. A feasibility study was performed using Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus subtilis as model organisms. The results indicate that the method should be applicable to any non-essential gene in numerous bacterial species. ...|$|R
