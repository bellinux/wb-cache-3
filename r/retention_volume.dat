This rotor rotates on its central axis (while HSCCC column rotates on its planetary axis and simultaneously rotates eccentrically about another solar axis). With less vibrations and noise, the CPC offers a typical rotation speed range from 500 to 2000 rpm. Contrary to hydrodynamic CCC, the rotation speed is not directly proportional to the <b>retention</b> <b>volume</b> ratio of the stationary phase. Like DCCC, CPC can be operated in either descending or ascending mode, where the direction is relative to the force generated by the rotor rather than gravity. A redesigned CPC column with larger chambers and channels has been named centrifugal partition extraction (CPE). In the CPE design, faster flow rates and increased column loading can be achieved.|$|E

There are many detector types available {{and they can}} be divided into two main categories. The first is concentration sensitive detectors which includes UV absorption, differential refractometer (DRI) or refractive index (RI) detectors, infrared (IR) absorption and density detectors. The second category is molecular weight sensitive detectors, which include low angle light scattering detectors (LALLS) and multi angle light scattering (MALLS). [...] The resulting chromatogram is therefore a weight distribution of the polymer as a function of <b>retention</b> <b>volume.</b> The most sensitive detector is the differential UV photometer and the most common detector is the differential refractometer (DRI).

5000|$|The CCC {{separation}} {{process can be}} thought of as occurring in three stages: mixing, settling, and separation of the two phases (although they often occur continuously). Vigorous mixing of the phases is critical in order to maximize the interfacial area between them and enhance mass transfer. The analyte will distribute between the phases according to its partition coefficient which is also called the distribution coefficient, distribution constant, or partition ratio and is represented by P, K, D, Kc, or KD. The partition coefficient for an analyte in a particular biphasic solvent system is independent of the volume of the instrument, flow rate, stationary phase <b>retention</b> <b>volume</b> ratio and the g-force required to immobilize the stationary phase. The degree of stationary phase retention is a crucial parameter. Common factors that influence stationary phase retention are flow rate, solvent composition of the biphasic solvent system, and the g-force. The stationary phase retention is represented by the stationary phase volume retention ratio (Sf) which is the volume of the stationary phase divided by the total volume of the instrument. The settling time is a property of the solvent system and the sample matrix, both of which greatly influence stationary phase retention. [...] To most process chemists, the term [...] "countercurrent" [...] implies two immiscible liquids moving in opposing directions, as typically occurs in large centrifugal extractor units. With the exception of dual flow (see below) CCC, most countercurrent chromatography modes of operation have a stationary phase and a mobile phase. Even in this situation, countercurrent flows occur within the instrument column. Several researchers have proposed renaming both CCC & CPC to liquid-liquid chromatography, but others feel the term [...] "countercurrent" [...] itself is a misnomer.|$|E

40|$|The Bavarian Danube River has {{experienced}} numerous large flood events {{in recent years}} which make flood management an urgent matter. The propagation of flood waves along the river is heavily influenced by controlled and natural flood retention. Over the past centuries, natural flood retention areas were lost due to river training, and the hydraulic characteristics of the channel-flood plain system were modified. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to understand the effect of river training on the flood retention characteristics along the Bavarian Danube. Systematic two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling shows that extreme floods are attenuated more strongly in the present state of the channel-flood plain system than they were historically. This is because the retention areas are filled later during the event, so the attenuation effect is much larger for the same magnitude of the <b>retention</b> <b>volume.</b> Natural flood retention is therefore not an effective management option for reducing extreme floods on the Bavarian Danube. Controlled flood retention measures provide a higher efficiency regarding peak attenuation to <b>retention</b> <b>volume</b> ratio.
