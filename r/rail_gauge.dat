5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One factor is that the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E

25|$|There {{are strong}} network {{effects in the}} initial choice of <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> and in gauge {{conversion}} decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works {{with one of the}} standard rail gauges.|$|E
25|$|Track {{consists}} of two parallel steel rails, anchored perpendicular to members called ties (sleepers) of timber, concrete, steel, or plastic to maintain a consistent distance apart, or <b>rail</b> <b>gauge.</b> Rail gauges are usually categorized as standard gauge (used on approximately 54.8% of the world's existing railway lines), broad gauge, and narrow gauge. In addition to the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> the tracks will be laid to conform with a Loading gauge which defines the maximum height and width for railway vehicles and their loads to ensure safe passage through bridges, tunnels and other structures.|$|E
25|$|As the Loading gauge (size of {{the train}} that can travel on a line) was not altered when the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> was widened, only Shinkansen trains {{specially}} built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.|$|E

25|$|A sleeper is a {{rectangular}} object {{on which the}} rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the rails to the track ballast and the ground underneath, and to hold the rails to the correct width apart (to maintain the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge).</b> They are generally laid transversely to the rails.|$|E
25|$|Industrial estates such as Kwinana, Welshpool and Kewdale were post-war {{additions}} {{contributing to}} the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east-west <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the Kewdale Freight Terminal was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards.|$|E

The first seven refurbished carriages entered regular service on 15 November 1999, on the Capital Connection service between Palmerston North and Wellington.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} commission came in 1882 with {{recommendations for}} future railway construction. They placed the Solør Line {{at the top}} of their priority list. In addition to it being perceived as having a good return on investment, the limited amount of funding available cautioned the commission to recommend trunk routes which would largely be futile unless completed to their intended termini. During this period there was a major controversy concerning <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> in Norway. Some lines were being built in standard gauge, others in narrow gauge. With the Kongsvinger Line being built in standard gauge, a deviating gauge in Solør with require transshipment. Pihl argued for narrow gauge, but standard gauge was ultimately chosen.|$|E
25|$|The four transit lines all use {{standard}} <b>rail</b> <b>gauge,</b> but {{are otherwise}} incompatible; trains of one line {{would have to}} be modified to run on another. Orange and Blue Line trains are similar enough that modification of some Blue Line trains for operation on the Orange Line was considered, although ultimately rejected for cost reasons. Also, some of the new Blue Line cars from Siemens Transportation were tested on the Orange Line after hours, before acceptance for revenue service on the Blue Line. There are no direct track connections between lines, except between the Red Line and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, but all except the Blue Line have little-used connections to the national rail network, which have been used for deliveries of railcars and supplies.|$|E
25|$|If narrow-gauge rails are {{designed}} with potential growth in mind, or with same standard as standard <b>gauge</b> <b>rails,</b> then the obstacles to be faced in future growth of those rail lines {{would be similar to}} other <b>rail</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R

25|$|Sir Harold Winthrop Clapp KBE (7 May 1875 – 21 October 1952) was a {{transport}} administrator who {{over the}} course of thirty years {{had a profound effect on}} Australia's railway network. In two decades as its Chairman of Commissioners, he revolutionised Victorian Railways, with unprecedented attention to customer service and innovations such as more powerful locomotives, air-conditioned carriages, and faster services culminating in the introduction of the flagship Spirit of Progress express train. Seconded to the Federal Government in World War II, he played a pivotal role in the manufacture of fighter aircraft in the defence of Australia. As Director-General of Australia's Land Transport Board, he presented a report on railway gauge standardisation that ultimately led to the eventual linking of all Australian mainland capital cities by a uniform <b>rail</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad was {{chartered}} in Ohio on February 23, 1849, {{to build}} from Columbus west via Urbana, Piqua and Greenville to the Indiana state line. On March 21, 1851, the CP was authorized {{to change the}} route west of Covington, and a more northerly alignment was chosen to meet the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad at Union City, Indiana for access to Indianapolis. The first section, from Columbus west to Plain City, opened June 6, 1853. Extensions opened to Urbana September 19 and Piqua October 16, 1854; on the latter date it changed its <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> to Ohio gauge {{to connect with the}} Indianapolis and Bellefontaine, which had also re-gauged. The rest of the line to Union City opened March 25, 1859, after some financial problems. The CP was sold at foreclosure on August 6, 1863, and reorganized October 30 as the Columbus and Indianapolis Railroad.|$|E
25|$|The Terre Haute and Richmond Rail Road was {{chartered}} in 1847 {{to build}} across Indiana via Indianapolis. On May 25, 1850, stockholders east of Indianapolis organized the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad (East of Indianapolis). On January 20, 1851, that section, from Indianapolis {{east to the}} Ohio state line, was renamed the Indiana Central Railway. On January 31, an Ohio law authorized the Dayton and Western Railroad to unite with the Indiana Central and operate jointly. The line from Indianapolis east to Greenfield opened in September 1853, and on October 8 it was completed to the state line, where it connected with the Dayton and Western. Joint operation of both lines between Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio began August 1, 1854. In 1859 the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> was changed from standard gauge to the broader Ohio gauge (4ft 10 in) to allow for direct connections with the Little Miami Railroad and Columbus and Xenia Railroad at Dayton.|$|E

25|$|The {{state-owned}} company Russian Railways (abbreviated as РЖД) operates most of rail services {{across the country}} and is crucial for the rail transport in Russia. High-speed rail services are available between Moscow and St Petersburg, between Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, and between St Petersburg and Helsinki (Finland). European Russia and the Russian Far East are connected by rail via the Trans-Siberian Railway. A train trip from Moscow to Vladivostok takes 6 days. Russia uses the 1,524mm (5ft) track gauge, which is also shared by all the former Soviet republics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, and is practically identical with the <b>rail</b> <b>gauge</b> of Finland. Trains crossing the border between Russia (Belarus, Ukraine) and EU member states (except the Baltic states and Finland) or between Russia and China, stop at special crossing points where each carriage is lifted for its bogies to be changed. Trains remain at crossing points for up to 2 hours.|$|E
