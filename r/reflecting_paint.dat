50|$|The tooling for the pressed-steel {{bodywork}} {{had during}} the war remained in Berlin with the US owned body builders Ambi Budd, and after lengthy negotiations with the Soviet military authorities was eventually released. Due to lack of available space at Ford’s Cologne plant, production of the first 1948 cars was subcontracted to Volkswagen in Wolfsburg and Karmann in Osnabrück, but in November 1948 the entire production process was taken in house by Ford. At this stage, as in 1942, only a single body style was available. The 1948 Ford Taunus was a small fast-back saloon with two rear hinged doors, and available only in “night shadow grey”, presumably <b>reflecting</b> <b>paint</b> availability {{in the aftermath of}} war.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to provide the Room comfort by means of Solar Reflective Paint (SRP) on the roof and thereby reducing the consumption of electrical energy. Solar heat diffuses through roof into the room resulting in human discomfort. Human discomfort leads to the usage of electrical energy. Valuable energy has to be conserved. Three different samples of solar reflective paint were collected and their properties were studied. The sample suitable for the research was selected. A standard roof design was selected for analysis. Using the properties of solar reflective paint and the roof design, a model was created and was analyzed by using ANSYS. The temperature of the living room was brought down considerably of about 7 Â°C by implementing the solar <b>reflecting</b> <b>paint</b> on the roof top. Power consumption can be drastically reduced by using SRP on industries as well as residential buildings. By using SRP, the usage of Air conditioning units can be minimized thereby keeping the global warming in control...|$|E

40|$|Advisor: Muir EatonFor centuries {{hunters have}} been using {{waterfowl}} decoys {{in an attempt to}} attract more birds for harvest, yet what makes a decoy effective is relatively unstudied. More recently, new paint technology has introduced decoy colors that aim to look more like real feather colors due to the addition of UVreflecting properties. This stems from research showing that birds have the ability to see UV reflectance due to a fourth type of cone cell sensitive from 300 - 410 nm (humans are blind to UV wavelengths, having only three cone cells, none sensitive to UV), and that duck feathers of many colors reflect UV light. Hence, our study aimed to investigate duck responses to decoys painted with UV <b>reflecting</b> <b>paint,</b> with the prediction that these decoys will attract more waterfowl compared to decoys painted with traditional colored paints. During fall 2008 and 2009, we collected both behavioral data, recording the number of ducks and number of flocks to come within 50 m of the two types of decoys and the total time ducks spent within 50 m of the decoys, and hunter success data, recording the number of ducks harvested using each type of decoy. We found more ducks and more flocks visited, and more total time was spent among, the UV-painted decoys, indicating an overall preference for these decoys compared to the traditionally painted decoys. However, success by hunters was similar using both types of decoys, suggesting that other factors involved with hunting may be more important than decoy appearance.

30|$|As {{a second}} stage, {{saturation}} error correction must be performed given that in industrial environments, certain {{materials such as}} metal or <b>reflecting</b> <b>paints</b> are often present and can produce saturated pixels in the range camera information. The results obtained show that this method works well as it allows the correct visualization of the amplitude image, and more importantly, it corrects values of saturated pixels of 3 D points. If these points have incorrect values, the reprojection stage would fail in these positions, as the 3 D values would be reprojected as 0, and so its 2 D information would be lost.|$|R

Surface topography greatly influences not only the mechanical and physical properties of contacting parts, but also the optical and coating properties of contacting components. The characteristics of surface topography in amplitude, spatial distribution and pattern of surface features dominate the functional applications in the field of wear, friction, lubrication, fatigue, sealing, joining, <b>reflecting,</b> <b>painting,</b> etc. Although surface roughness data from a stylus profilometer continues to be of basic importance, it does suffer from some limitations which cannot be overlooked. Some of the major limitations of using a stylus profilometer are finite tip radius, inability to record detailed information, bouncing of stylus tip and losing contact with surface, the stylus might create scratches as it passes over the surface, and long time when acquiring data. Alternatively, optical interferometry has, for a number of decades, been used to measure surface topography successfully. As a result there are many commercial interferometric instruments based on two or multi-beam interferometerss instruments available today. The goal of this thesis is to continue to work on the development of a novel method that can obtain the topography of surfaces utilizing advanced digital moire. In the version under development a grating printed on a glass plate will be utilized to generate fringes. The HoloStrain software is utilized to process the fringe pattern information. The main objective of the thesis is to apply this methodology to measuring the surface roughness of ceramics that have been modified via laser-assisted machining. This research will enable further development of the laser-assisted machining process by making it feasible to optimize the surface profile of the ceramic through changing processing parameters...|$|R
