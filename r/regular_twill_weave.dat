5000|$|The typical kilt as seen at modern Highland games {{events is}} made of <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> worsted wool. The <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> used for kilts is a [...] "2-2 type", meaning that each weft thread passes over and under two warp threads at a time. The result is a {{distinctive}} diagonal-weave pattern in the fabric which is called the twill line. This kind of <b>twill,</b> when <b>woven</b> according to a given sett or written colour pattern (see below) is called tartan. In contrast kilts worn by Irish pipers are made from solid-colour cloth, with saffron or green being {{the most widely used}} colours.|$|R

50|$|Gota is a gold {{or silver}} ribbon and lace from Lucknow, various other {{coloured}} ribbons of varying width, woven in a satin or <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> {{may also be}} referred to as gota. It is used along with kinari work. The dresses with gota work are used for special occasions or religious occasions. Gota is crafted using appliqué technique with a strip of gold or silver or various other coloured ribbons of different widths woven in a satin or <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b> It involves placing woven gold cloth onto fabrics such as georgette or bandhini to create different surface textures.|$|R
50|$|Woven wire cloth, {{typically}} {{produced from}} stainless steel, is commonly {{employed as a}} filtration medium for sieving {{in a wide range}} of industries. Most often woven with a plain <b>weave,</b> or a <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.|$|R

5000|$|Brilliantine is a lightweight, mixed-fibre fabric popular {{from the}} mid-19th century into the early 20th century. Brilliantine can be plain or <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> with a wool or mohair weft on a silk or cotton warp.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Twill</b> <b>weave</b> {{is often}} {{designated}} as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of harnesses that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of harnesses that are lowered when a filling yarn is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction [...] is read as [...] "two up, one down" [...] (the fraction for plain weave is [...]). The minimum number of harnesses needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of harnesses is three. <b>Twill</b> <b>weave</b> can be identified by its diagonal lines.|$|R

30|$|When each {{individual}} treatment group was considered, {{there was an}} interesting finding on the soil release group. The plain woven soil release fabric {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> soil release fabric (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The plain woven soil release fabric also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> soil release fabric (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between fabric type and finish was due to the presence of the soil release finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than plain weave fabrics. The soil release finish fabric was the exception to this trend. Soil release finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove soil from the fabric (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics are heavier and thicker than the plain woven fabrics it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the twill fabrics store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|R

The {{highest level of}} hydrostatic pressure achieved is 36  cm by the <b>twill</b> <b>woven</b> fabric after application of 7 % fluoropolymer finish.|$|R
50|$|Flannel, flannelette, {{and cotton}} flannel can be woven {{in either a}} <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> or plain weave. The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then bleached, dyed, or {{otherwise}} treated, and then napped a second time.|$|R
5000|$|Sheer fabrics {{are seldom}} {{made with a}} <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b> Because a <b>twill</b> surface already has {{interesting}} texture and design, printed twills (where a design is printed on the cloth) are much less common than printed plain <b>weaves.</b> When <b>twills</b> are printed, this is typically done on lightweight fabrics.|$|R

50|$|A satin fabric {{tends to}} have a high luster due to the high number of floats on the fabric. Because of this it is used in making bed sheets.

50|$|Cameline is {{described}} in textile dictionaries as a coarse medieval fabric.

50|$|Woven filters have a {{definite}} repeated pattern. Low energy cleaning {{methods such as}} shaking or reverse air allow for woven filters. Various weaving patterns such as plain <b>weave,</b> <b>twill</b> <b>weave,</b> or sateen weave, increase or decrease the amount of space between individual fibers. The size of the space affects the strength and permeability of the fabric. A tighter weave corresponds with low permeability and, therefore, more efficient capture of fine particles.|$|R
40|$|In this research, thermal {{and water}} vapor resistance, {{components}} of thermal comfort of 65 / 35 and 33 / 67 % polyester/ cotton (PES/CO) blend fabrics woven with 2 / 2 twill, matt twill, cellular and diced weaves, which {{are commonly used}} for clothing, were determined. The results indicate that both the fabric construction and the constituent fiber properties affect thermal comfort properties of clothing woven fabrics. Cellular weave, which is derivative of sateen weave and diced weave, which is compound weave, has the highest thermal resistance appropriating for cold climatic conditions. On the other hand, the 2 / 2 <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> and matt <b>twill</b> <b>weave,</b> which is derivative of sateen weave, depicted the lowest water vapor thermal resistance, making it convenient for hot climatic conditions. Besides, fabrics woven with 65 / 35 % PES/CO blend yarns have higher thermal resistance, so they are suitable for cold climatic conditions. Fabrics woven with 33 / 67 % PES/CO blend yarns have lower water vapor resistance, so they are convenient for hot climatic conditions...|$|R
