High-resolution MS was used to quantitatively identify the noncovalent binding interactions between mixtures of aminoglycosides and multiple RNA targets simultaneously. Signal overlap among RNA targets was avoided {{by the addition of}} neutral mass tags that direct each RNA target to a unique region of the spectrum. In addition to determining binding affinities, the locations of the binding sites on the RNAs were identified from a protection pattern generated by fragmenting the aminoglycoside/RNA complex. Specific complexes were observed for the prokaryotic rRNA A-site subdomain with <b>ribostamycin,</b> paromomycin, and lividomycin, whereas apramycin preferentially formed a complex with the eukaryotic subdomain.

Um vorhandene Resistenzmechanismen zu umgehen und Nebenwirkungen zu minimieren, sind gezielte Modifizierungen an den Molekülen notwendig. Eine effiziente Möglichkeit stellt die Biokombinatorik dar. Dafür ist ein detailliertes Verständnis der Biosynthesen der Aminoglycoside notwendig. Ziel dieser Arbeit war die funktionelle Charakterisierung der Glycosyltransferasen NeoM, NeoF, KanM 1 und KanM 2 sowie der Deacetylasen NeoD und KanN aus dem Neomycin- und Kanamycinbiosyntheseweg der Produzentenstämme Streptomyces (S.) fradiae und S. kanamyceticus. Erste Versuche zur biokombinatorischen Modifizierung dieser AGAs wurden durchgeführt.   #   Die homologen Enzyme NeoM und KanM 1 konnten als 2 -DOS : UDP-GlcNAc Glycosyltransferasen (N -Acetylparomaminsynthasen) identifiziert werden. Nach Optimierung der Expressionsbedingungen wurden {{in vitro}} Enzymtests durchgeführt, wobei die heterolog überproduzierten Proteine eine hohe Donorsubstratspezifität zeigten, TDP-Glc oder UDP-Glc wurden nicht umgesetzt. Eine neoM -Mutante von S. fradiae wurde erzeugt und genotypisch und biochemisch charakterisiert. Durch die in trans Komplementation mit den Genen neoM, kanM 1 und hygF konnte keine Bildung von AGAs nachgewiesen werden.   #   Die Tatsache, dass UDP-GlcNAc als einziges Substrat in den von NeoM und KanM 1 katalysierten Glycosyltransferasereaktionen umgesetzt wurde, bedingte einen nachfolgenden Deacetylierungsschritt in den jeweiligen Biosynthesen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die homologen Enzyme NeoD und KanN diese Reaktion katalysieren. Darüber hinaus wurde eine neoD -Mutante von S. fradiae erzeugt. Nach der genetischen und biochemischen Charakterisierung sollte die Mutante durch neoD und kanN komplementiert werden. Die Expression der Gene konnte nachgewiesen werden, eine Produktion von AGAs nicht.   #   Die in der Neomycinbiosynthese vorkommende Glycosyltransferase NeoF katalysiert die Bildung von 2 '''- N -Acetyl- 6 '''-hydroxyneomycin C aus <b>Ribostamycin</b> und UDPGlcNAc. Sie zeigt ebenso wie NeoM und KanM 1 eine hohe Donorsubstratspezifität. TDP-Glc oder UDP-Glc konnten nicht mit <b>Ribostamycin</b> umgesetzt werden.   #   Die Bildung von 2 '''- N -Acetyl- 6 '''-hydroxyneomycin C bedingt in der Neomycinbiosynthese einen weiteren Deacetylierungsschritt. Dieser wird von NeoD katalysiert. Die Bildung von 6 '''-Hydroxyneomycin C durch die Aktivität von NeoD konnte gezeigt werden. Das zu NeoD homologe KanN katalysiert diese Reaktion nicht.   #   Die in der Biosynthese von Kanamycin vorkommende Glycosyltransferase KanM 2 konnte durch die Generierung einer entsprechenden Mutante charakterisiert werden. Diese Mutante bildete eine antibiotisch wirksame Substanz (Paromamin?). Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} (AGAs) are important drugs in medical therapy. Specific modifications to these substances {{are necessary to}} circumvent resistance mechanisms of pathogens and to reduce toxic side-effects. An efficient way to modify these substances is represented by biocombinatorial approaches, for which a detailed understanding of the biosynthesis of the aminoglycosides is essential. Thus, {{the aim of this}} thesis was the characterization of the glycosyltransferases NeoM, NeoF, KanM 1 and KanM 2 and deacetylases NeoD and KanN of the neomycin and kanamycin biosyntheses from Streptomyces (S.) fradiae und S. kanamyceticus and, consequently, the further elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways. First biocombinatorial experiments to modify these substances were implemented.   #   The homologous enzymes NeoM and KanM 1 were identified as 2 -DOS : UDPGlcNAc glycosyltransferases (N -acetylparomamine synthases). After optimization of expression, in vitro enzyme assays were carried out. The heterologously overexpressed proteins showed high-level specificity for the donor substrate. Neither TDPGlc nor UDP-Glc were accepted as sugar donors by NeoM or KanM 1. A neoM -knockout mutant of S. fradiae was generated and genotypically and biochemically analysed. However, after in trans complementation with the genes neoM, kanM 1 and hygF, no production of AGAs was detected.   #   Due to the fact that UDP-GlcNAc was the only substrate accepted by NeoM and KanM 1, a deacetylation step in the biosynthetic pathways was proposed. It was shown in this study that the enzymes NeoD and KanN catalyse this step in the respective pathway. A neoD mutant of S. fradiae was tried to be complemented by neoD and kanN, whereas the expression of the genes was detectable while no AGAs were produced.   #   The glycosyltransferase NeoF occurs in the neomycin biosynthetic pathway. It catalyses the formation of 2 '''- N -acetyl- 6 '''-hydroxyneomycin C from <b>ribostamycin</b> and UDP-GlcNAc and showed, like NeoM and KanM 1, high donor-substrate specificity. No glucose residue was transferred from TDP-Glc or UDP-Glc to <b>ribostamycin</b> by NeoF.   #   The formation of 2 '''- N -acetyl- 6 '''-hydroxyneomycin C during neomycin biosynthesis requires a subsequent deacetylation reaction. This step is also catalysed by NeoD and resulted in the formation of 6 '''-hydroxyneomycin C. The homologue to NeoD, KanN, was not able to catalyse this reaction.   #   The glycosyltransferase KanM 2, which is specific for the kanamycin biosynthetic pathway, was characterised by knock-out mutagenesis of its gene. The mutant accumulated a substance which clearly showed antibiotic activity (paromamine?). </table...|$|E

We report here mutagenesis and computer modeling studies aimed at examining the mode of aminoglycoside binding to APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa.

Here we show that aminoglycosides chemically related to neomycin—paromomycin, <b>ribostamycin</b> and neamine—each bind to sites within h 44 and H 69 to perturb bridge B 2 and affect subunit rotation. Neomycin and paromomycin, which only differ by their ring-I 6 ′-polar group, drive subunit rotation in opposite directions. This suggests that their distinct actions hinge on the 6 ′-substituent and the drug's net positive charge. By solving the crystal structure of the paromomycin–ribosome complex, we observe specific contacts between the apical tip of H 69 and the 6 ′-hydroxyl on paromomycin from within the drug's canonical h 44 -binding site. These results indicate that aminoglycoside actions must be framed {{in the context of}} bridge B 2 and their regulation of subunit rotation.

The introduction of a recombinant plasmid carrying npmA could confer on E. coli consistent resistance to both 4, 6 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamines, such as amikacin and gentamicin, and 4, 5 -disubstituted 2 -deoxystreptamines, including neomycin and <b>ribostamycin.</b> The histidine-tagged NpmA elucidated methyltransferase activity against 30 S ribosomal subunits but not against 50 S subunits and the naked 16 S rRNA molecule in vitro.

Drug footprinting data indicated that binding of aminoglycosides to the target site was apparently interrupted by methylation at the A 1408 position. These observations demonstrate that NpmA is a novel plasmid-mediated 16 S rRNA methyltransferase that provides a panaminoglycoside-resistant nature through interference with the binding of aminoglycosides toward the A site of 16 S rRNA through N- 1 methylation at position A 1408...|$|E

Although {{the number of}} contacts between the RNA and the aminoglycosides varies between 20 and 31, up to eight direct hydrogen bonds between rings I and II of the neamine moiety are conserved in the observed complexes.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the identification of Mur 34 as the novel negative regulator involved in muraymycin biosynthesis. Independent disruption of mur 34 on chromosome and cosmid directly resulted in significant improvement of muraymycin production by at least 10 folds, thereof confirming the negative function of Mur 34 during muraymycin biosynthesis and realizing the engineered production of muraymycin in heterologous host. Gene expression analysis indicated that the transcription level of the mur genes in mur 34 mutant (DM- 5) was dramatically enhanced by ca. 30 folds. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Mur 34 specifically bound to the promoter region of mur 33. Further experiments showed that a 28 -bp region downstream of the transcription start point (TSP) was protected by His 6 Mur 34, and the - 10 region {{is essential for the}} activity of mur 33 promoter.

We have introduced a U 1406 -to-A mutation in a plasmid-encoded copy of E. coli 16 S rRNA which has been expressed either in a mixture with wild-type ribosomes or in a strain in which all rRNA is transcribed from the plasmid-encoded rrn operon. High-level resistance {{to many of the}} 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycosides is observed only when all the rRNA contains the U 1406 -to-A mutation. In contrast to the partial dominance of resistance observed with other mutations in the decoding region, there is a dominance of sensitivity with the 1406 A mutation. Chemical footprinting experiments indicate that resistance arises from a reduced affinity of the antibiotic for the rRNA target. These results demonstrate that although position 1406 is an important determinant in the binding and action of the 4, 6 -disubstituted aminoglycosides, other rRNA mutations that perturb the binding of ring I of both classes of 2 -deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides confer higher levels of resistance as well as a partial dominance of resistance...|$|E
40|$|The broad-spectrum {{aminoglycoside}} phosphotransferase, APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa, confers {{resistance to}} several aminoglycoside antibiotics in opportunistic pathogens {{of the genera}} Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. The profile of the drug resistance phenotype suggested that the enzyme would transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the 32 ̆ 7 -hydroxyl of aminoglycosides. In addition, resistance to the 32 ̆ 7 -deoxyaminoglycoside antibiotic, lividomycin A, suggested possible transfer to the 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl of the ribose [Trieu-Cuot, P., and Courvalin, P. (1983) Gene 23, 331 - 341]. Using purified overexpressed enzyme, we have prepared and purified the products of APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa-dependent phosphorylation of several of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Mass spectral analysis revealed that 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics such as amikacin and kanamycin are monophosphorylated, while 4, 5 -disubstituted aminoglycosides such as butirosin A, <b>ribostamycin,</b> and neomycin B are both mono- and diphosphorylated by APH(32 ̆ 7) -IIIa. Using a series of one- and two-dimensional 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P NMR experiments, we have unambiguously assigned the regiospecificity of phosphoryl transfer to several antibiotics. The 4, 6 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics are exclusively phosphorylated at the 32 ̆ 7 -OH hydroxyl, and the 4, 5 -disubstituted aminocyclitol antibiotics can be phosphorylated at both the 32 ̆ 7 - and 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyls. The first phosphorylation can occur on either the 32 ̆ 7 - or 52 ̆ 2 -hydroxyl group of neomycin B or butirosin A. Initial phosphotransfer to the 32 ̆ 7 -position predominates for butirosin while the 52 ̆ 2 -OH is favored for neomycin. These results open {{the potential for the}} rational design of aminoglycoside kinase inhibitors based on functionalization of either the 6 -aminohexose or the pentose rings of aminoglycoside antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycosides are a {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} functioning through binding to 16 S rRNA A-site and inhibiting the bacterial translation. However, the continuous emergence of drug-resistant strains makes {{the development of new}} and more potent antibiotics necessary. Aminoglycosides are also known to interact with various biologically crucial RNA molecules other than 16 S rRNA A-site and inhibit their functions. As a result, they are considered as the single most important model to understand the principles of RNA small molecule recognition. The detailed understanding of these interactions is necessary for the development of novel antibacterial, antiviral or even anti-oncogenic agents. In our studies, we have studied both the natural aminoglycoside targets like Rev responsive element (RRE), trans-activating region (TAR) of HIV- 1 and thymidylate synthase mRNA 52 ̆ 7 untranslated (UTR) region as well as the in vitro selected neomycin, tobramycin and kanamycin RNA aptamers. By this way, we think we have covered a variety of binding pockets to figure out the critical nucleic acid residues playing essential role in aminoglycoside recognition. Along with all these RNAs, we studied more than 10 aminoglycoside ligands to pinpoint the chemical groups in close contact with RNAs. To determine thermodynamic parameters for these interactions, we utilized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay by which we found that the majority of these interactions are enthalpy driven. More specifically, RNA aminoglycoside interactions are mainly derived by electrostatic and hydrogen binding interactions. Our studies indicated that the amino groups on the first ring of the aminoglycosides are essential for high affinity binding whereas having bulky groups on ring II sterically eliminate their interactions with RNAs. RNA binding trend of aminoglycosides are as follows: neomycin-B 3 ̆e <b>ribostamycin</b> 3 ̆e kanamycin-B 3 ̆e tobramycin 3 ̆e paromomycin 3 ̆e sisomicin 3 ̆e gentamicin 3 ̆e kanamycin-A 3 ̆e geneticin 3 ̆e amikacin 3 ̆e netilmicin. Aminoglycoside binding to the aptamer was shown highly buffer dependent. This phenomenon was analyzed in five different buffers and found that cacodylate-based buffer changes the specificity of the aptamer. In addition to ITC, we have used molecular docking to specifically find out the chemical groups in these interactions. We have specified the nucleic acid residues interacting with aminoglycosides. In parallel, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of neomycin RNA aptamer with neomycin-B in an all-atom platform in GROMACS were carried out. The results showed a mobile structure consistent with the ability of this aptamer to interact {{with a wide range of}} ligands. From molecular docking and MD simulations, we identified the neomycin-B aptamer residues that might contribute to its ligand selectivity and designed a series of new aptamers accordingly. Also, A 16 was found to be flexible, which was confirmed by 2 AP fluorescence studies. In this analysis, the buffer dependence was also confirmed against neomycin-B, <b>ribostamycin</b> and paromomycin. One of the challenges in therapeutics is the emergence of resistant cells. They become reistant to the drugs via changing the target site, or enzymatically modifying the drug, or producing drug pumps to export the drugs. To overcome the very last challenge, we are utilizing RNA-aminoglycoside partners to keep high intracellular drug concentration and increase the efficacy of aminoglycosides against bacteria. We called the system as DRAGINs (Drug binding aptamers for growing intracellular numbers). We express these RNAs in bacteria and detect their growth rate in order to evaluate their response to different concentration of aminoglycosides. In this study, we found that we could successfully decrease the IC 50 values by 2 to 5 fold with the help of aminoglycoside-binding RNA aptamers. Finally, we are mathematically modeling the effect of aptamers on IC 50 values of drugs with the use of four-compartment model. In our research group, we are utilizing these RNA-aminoglycoside partners to develop tags for detecting RNA in vivo and in real time. We called this system as intracellular multiaptamer genetic tags (IMAGEtags) ...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium graminearum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{problematic}} phytopathogens in US agriculture. This fungus causes head blight, foot rot, and damping off on wheat and barley. The infection lowers the grain yield and causes contamination of the grain product with mycotoxins. Effective control measures are lacking, and new fungicides that kill F. graminearum but remain safe and economical to use are needed. Newly synthesized aminoglycosides (JL 22, JL 38, JL 39, JL 40, NEOF 004, NEOF 005), classic aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin A, kanamycin B, neomycin, and <b>ribostamycin),</b> and a lipopeptide, syringomycin E (SRE), were studied to determine their antifungal potential to control F. graminearum. Aminoglycosides are protein synthesis inhibitors that mainly target bacteria, but a few were recently observed to kill fungi. They consist of an aminocyclitol ring bound with two or more amino sugars. Novel aminoglycosides were recently synthesized using novel glycodiversification synthetic schemes involving the replacement of the original amino sugars with unusual amino sugars. SRE is an antifungal lipodepsinonapeptide produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen in a wide range of plant species and produces several fungicidal lipopeptides. SRE forms pores on fungal plasma membrane and causes ion fluxes. An enhancement of its antifungal activity is reported in the presence of rhamnolipid surfactants. The antifungal activities of various aminoglycosides, SRE, and a SRE-rhamnolipids mixture were determined against F. graminearum by measuring in vitro minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) and in planta lesion area and chlorosis development using a leaf infection assay protocol. It was determined that using Tween® 20 at 0. 2 % (v/v) concentration in the leaf infection assay promotes lesion development by F. graminearum with minimum phytotoxicity. In vitro, SRE, SYRA, and synthetic aminoglycoside JL 38 showed the best antifungal activities. With the in planta assay, all three antifungal agents prevented infection by F. graminearum. However, inconsistent phytotoxicities were observed with SRE and SYRA that were influenced by the Tween® 20 surfactant included in the leaf infection assay. How Tween® 20 induces these phytotoxic inconsistencies is not known...|$|E
