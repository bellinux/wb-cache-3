25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to the federal government, {{and there could be}} no doubt that the federal government intended to give all <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to those to whom it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> existed.|$|E
25|$|Justice White {{would have}} {{overturned}} {{the judgment of}} the lesser court for determination of the <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> of the landowners in question.|$|E
25|$|The {{upstream}} states, Victoria and New South Wales, favoured the riparian doctrine, {{under which}} landowners {{are free to}} take water from streams flowing through their property. As the ‘Premier State’, New South Wales, claimed <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> not only over its own rivers, but over the entire main stream of the Murray. South Australia relied on provisions of the newly enacted Constitution under which the Commonwealth government had authority over navigation along the Murray River and an implied obligation to preserve flows in the South Australian section of the river.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, the Syrian-Jordanian {{agreement}} on {{development of the}} Yarmouk was blocked when Israel, as a <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> holder, refused to ratify the plan and the World Bank withholds funding. Israel's augments its Johnson plan allocation of 25,000,000 m³/yr by a further 45,000,000-75,000,000 m³/yr.|$|R
50|$|Adapted from English common law, the <b>riparian</b> water <b>right</b> {{dictated}} that landholders bordering on or encompassing streams had the reasonable {{use of the}} water that flowed over their property. This water right was well adapted to temperate climates with year-round rainfall, but proved ill-fitting for California's more arid climate. This standard brought riparian rights-holders into conflict in low-water years, creating issues of both priority and quantity which could only be settled in court. Furthermore the <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> allowed for the monopolization of water rights by buying all the land adjacent to a stream, creating a conflict between large landholders with the means to buy up stream-adjacent land, and those who needed water rights in order to run profitable farms.|$|R
5000|$|Walter F. Haas (1869 - 1936 [...] ) city {{attorney}} of Los Angeles, California, {{was considered to}} be a recognized authority on water and <b>riparian</b> legal <b>rights.</b>|$|R
25|$|As for {{the canal}} company's claims, the {{majority}} held that since {{none of the}} private landowners held <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> the company could not obtain such rights from the private landowners. Nor was there any evidence that Congress was relinquishing its rights to Water Street or the river. The court dismissed {{the claims of the}} last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land records and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, US Representative Frank J. Guarini and Gerald McCann, then {{mayor of}} Jersey City, sued New York City, contending that New Jersey should have {{dominion}} over Liberty Island {{because it is}} on the New Jersey side of the state line. By default, since the court chose not to hear the case, the existing legal status was unchanged. Portions of the island that are above water are part of New York, while <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to all of the submerged land surrounding the statue belong to New Jersey. The southwestern section, , of the island was created by land reclamation.|$|E
25|$|Limited private {{ownership}} rights similar to <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> in a surface stream. The amount of groundwater right {{is based on}} the size of the surface area where each landowner gets a corresponding amount of the available water. Once adjudicated, the maximum amount of the water right is set, but the right can be decreased if the total amount of available water decreases as is likely during a drought. Landowners may sue others for encroaching upon their groundwater rights, and water pumped for use on the overlying land takes preference over water pumped for use off the land.|$|E
5000|$|The {{only two}} dissenting Justices (Scalia and Alito) are both from New Jersey. Scalia {{wrote in his}} opinion, [...] "The New Jersey-Delaware Compact of 1905 (Compact or 1905 Compact), Art. VII, 34 Stat. 860, {{addressed}} the “exercise of riparian jurisdiction,” {{and the power to}} “make grants … of riparian … rights.” The particular <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> at issue here is the right of wharfing out. All are agreed that jurisdiction and power over that right were given to New Jersey on its side of the Delaware River." ...|$|R
5000|$|The appropriative right, on {{the other}} hand, was an ad hoc {{invention}} of miners in the Mother Lode region, adapted specifically {{to the realities of}} gold extraction. The organizing principle of [...] "first in time, first in right" [...] served miners whose gold claims could be miles or tens of miles from running water, while the organization of miners' courts provided a mechanism to settle disputes. Under the appropriative right, entitlement to water proceeded from its actual use, as opposed to the <b>riparian</b> <b>right</b> in which water rights are retained regardless of use, and could be sold or transferred.|$|R

25|$|For 400 years Maryland and Virginia have disputed {{control of}} the Potomac and its North Branch, since both states' {{original}} colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers. In its first state constitution adopted in 1776, Virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it, an act disputed by Maryland. Both states acceded to the Compact of 1785 and the 1877 Black-Jenkins Award which grants Maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low water mark on the Virginia side, while permitting Virginia full <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> short of obstructing navigation.|$|E
500|$|After the {{departure}} of the Romans, the low-lying Somerset Levels appear to have been abandoned, as the archaeological record shows that they were flooded and the former Roman landscape covered with a thick layer of alluvial deposits. Recovery of the levels involved both the construction of sea walls and the containment of the Parrett. Celtic Christianity came to the remoter areas of the Somerset Levels, making use of [...] "island" [...] sites. Glastonbury Abbey, possibly founded in the 7th century (or earlier), was nearby and had undertaken extensive water management to enable it to bring materials by boat to Glastonbury, albeit not via the Parrett. Muchelney Abbey, founded in the mid-8th century, was sited at the confluence of the Parrett and its tributaries, the rivers Isle and Yeo; and Athelney Abbey lay on another tributary, the River Tone. These three abbeys together with the Bishop of Bath and Wells were major landowners with fishing and <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> often conflicting, on these rivers. They gained financially from improvements to land and waterways due to the resulting greater fertility of their lands and the increased rents {{that they were able to}} charge their tenants.|$|E
2500|$|Justice White also {{examined}} the conveyance {{of the federal}} government's land to the new private landowners in depth as well. In his discussion, White interpreted the [...] "incorrect" [...] maps as indicating the <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to which the new private landowners were entitled (rather than a problem of inaccurate mapping). White concluded several times {{that the federal government}} fully intended to convey <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> to the new landowners because the government and its agents repeatedly indicated in letters, memoranda, contracts of sale, and other documents and statements its expectation that the waterside landowners were to build and maintain docks, wharves, and quays and improve the <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> they enjoyed. To assume otherwise, White concluded, was nonsensical. [...] Either the federal government intended to convey <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> or the government deceptively contemplated building Water Street and cutting the new landowners off from their access. [...] "...the first hypothesis is the one naturally to be assumed." [...] "The contracts for the sale of water lots with <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> attached, the reports of the surveyors, and the action of the commissioners, all blend into a harmonious and perfect whole, working from an original conception to a successful consummation of a well-understood result. The contrary view produces discord and disarrangement..." ...|$|E
50|$|In United States law, Littoral {{rights are}} rights {{concerning}} properties that abut an ocean, bay, delta, sea or lake, {{rather than a}} river or stream (<b>riparian).</b> Littoral <b>rights</b> are usually concerned with the use and enjoyment of the shore.|$|R
50|$|Tangible {{examples}} {{are all sorts}} of heirlooms and artefacts, land, fisheries, natural resources such as geothermal springs and access to natural resources, such as <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> and access to the riparian zone of rivers or streams. Intangible examples may include language and spiritual beliefs.|$|R
50|$|The {{second issue}} {{in this case was}} whether plaintiffs must exhaust their {{remedies}} before the Water Board prior to bringing action in court. The California Supreme Court determined that remedy can be pursued from the Water Board by challenging the unreasonable or unbeneficial use of appropriated water or by bringing an independent public trust claim. Therefore, the plaintiffs could claim that DWP’s use of the water was unreasonable. Plaintiffs also could bring the public trust claim pursuant to section 2501 of the Water Code, which said, “The board may determine, in the proceedings provided for in this chapter, all rights to water of a stream system whether based upon appropriation, <b>riparian</b> <b>right,</b> or other basis of right.” Section 2501 refers to water rights as bringing the proceedings before the Water Board.|$|R
2500|$|The case clearly {{established}} that West Virginia's riparian water {{rights to the}} Potomac River {{are the same as}} Virginia's, as established in Morris v. United States. However, in New Jersey v. New York, 523 U.S. 767 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a state can acquiesce in the regulation of its water rights by another state and still maintain its sovereign authority over those rights only so long as it protests the regulation. In Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56 (2003), the Court dealt with {{a situation in which the}} state of Virginia sought to exercise its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> over the Potomac River. Maryland statute and regulation did not permit this exercise of rights, and Virginia sued. The U.S. Supreme Court held that Virginia had maintained its sovereignty over its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> by continuously protesting Maryland's assertion of jurisdiction. [...] This has led some legal observers to conclude that West Virginia, too, must begin protesting Maryland's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction in order for West Virginia to maintain sovereignty over its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A 1997 United States Supreme Court {{decision}} involved such <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> around nearby Ellis Island. Being mostly {{constructed of}} artificial infill, New Jersey argued {{and the court}} agreed that the 1834 compact covered only the natural parts of the island, and not the portions added by infill. [...] Thus {{it was agreed that}} the parts of the island made of filled land belonged to New Jersey while the original natural part belonged to New York. This proved impractical to administer and New Jersey and New York subsequently agreed to share jurisdiction of the entire island. [...] This special situation only applies to Ellis Island and part of Shooters Island.|$|E
2500|$|The Stone Bridge is a {{causeway}} {{built by}} the United States Army in 1867. [...] It crosses the marshy channel that connects Hart Lake and Crump Lake in a remote area of Lake County in eastern Oregon, United States. [...] It was later incorporated into the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road which was completed in 1872. [...] The wagon road eventually {{became the subject of}} scandal and litigation ending with a United States Supreme Court decision in 1893. [...] The Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. [...] Today, the Stone Bridge is located on land claimed by the State of Oregon under <b>riparian</b> <b>rights.</b> [...] The wagon road adjacent to the Stone Bridge is owned by the United States Government and is administered by Bureau of Land Management.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} two {{divergent}} systems for determining water <b>rights.</b> <b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> (derived from English common law) are common {{in the east and}} prior appropriation water rights (developed in Colorado and California) are common in the west. Each state has its own variations on these basic principles, as informed by custom, culture, geography, legislation and case law. Californian law, for example, includes elements of both systems. In general, a water right is established by obtaining an authorization from the state {{in the form of a}} water right permit. A legal right is formally consummated, or perfected, by exercising the water right permit and using the water for a beneficial purpose.|$|R
50|$|Water {{rights were}} {{established}} in the early 1900s and my be purchased from someone who has either <b>riparian</b> or appropriative <b>rights.</b> The agency obtained water rights from the Conway Preservation Group, who had <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights.</b> Conway signed over their riparian property for $2.6 Million dollars upfront in 2016 and each year thereafter with a two {{percent increase over the}} next 24 years. After the 24 years the cities will then own the land. The agency also acquired a water permit from the State Water Resource Control Board. Permit 20281 allows water to be diverted from the Sacramento River at monthly rates up to 80 cubic-feet per second, at an annual rate up to 45,000 acre-feet a year.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> were {{inherited}} from the common law of England. [...] Under the doctrine, property owners have correlative rights to the reasonable use of the water passing through their land adjacent to the watercourse. The right {{is part and parcel}} with the land itself and, in California, only accompanies those tracts that have always directly touched the water.|$|R
2500|$|From 1957 to 1996, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) {{routinely}} issued permits {{applied for}} by Virginia entities concerning {{use of the}} Potomac. [...] However, in 1996 the MDE denied a permit submitted by the Fairfax County Water Authority to build a water intake 725 feet (220 m) offshore, citing potential harm to Maryland's interests {{by an increase in}} Virginia sprawl caused by the project. After years of failed appeals within the Maryland government's appeal processes, in 2000 Virginia took the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states. Maryland claimed Virginia lost its <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> by acquiescing to MDE's permit process for 63 years (MDE began its permit process in 1933). A Special Master appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of Virginia, citing the language in the 1785 Compact and the 1877 Award. On December 9, 2003, the Court agreed in a 7-2 decision.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not half}} settled this {{matter of the}} {{division}} of trout streams when another observation came, which was utterly unexpected. Koskomenos, half reptile though he seem, not only recognizes <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> but he is also capable of friendship--and that, too, for a moody prowler of the wilderness whom no one else cares anything about. Here is the proof.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the wall}} marked the {{boundary}} between Chatterton's <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> and those of Culmeny; and {{it was out of}} idle curiosity that Dane watched his host instead of hailing him as, first looking about him, he descended the bank and hauled in the line. An exclamation of disgust followed as a writhing eel was flung out upon the grass; but there were nobler fish attached, and presently Chatterton stood up holding a splendid trout. Dane remembered that his father had sworn by Chatterton's commercial integrity, but he was not wholly astonished when the man slipped the fish, and a second one which followed it, into his creel. Then, surmising that the angler would not have desired a witness, he turned back softly and met him in the wood, flattering himself that he had arranged the meeting neatly.|$|E
50|$|The Oklahoma Organic Act {{specifically}} extended {{civil and}} criminal Arkansas laws over the Indian Territory. Historically, non-Indians were not allowed in Indian Territory and the Federal Court in Ft. Smith, Arkansas had jurisdiction over Indian Territory. Arkansas recognizes the doctrine of <b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights,</b> based on English common law, and generally accepted {{in the eastern part}} of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Little Charity Island {{was once}} called Ile de Traverse, {{according}} to an 1839 map of Michigan. [...] In the 19th century and early 20th century Little Charity was owned by Bay Port Fish Company, a commercial fishing company in Saginaw Bay, for its <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights.</b> After the 1940s, when Michigan law changed, the island was sold as were other islands in the bay.|$|R
5000|$|This {{doctrine}} {{developed in}} the western states of the United States. These water rights are different from <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights,</b> which are applied {{in the rest of}} the United States. In the western states, water supplies are very limited and must be allocated sparingly based on the productivity of its use. The right is also allotted to those who are “first in time of use.” ...|$|R
50|$|While <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> are {{superior}} to appropriative rights and may survive dormant and unused, in 1979 the California Supreme Court found that the California State Water Resources Control Board {{has the power to}} assign unused <b>riparian</b> <b>rights</b> lower priority than existing prior appropriations.|$|E
50|$|Some {{water rights}} {{are based on}} land {{ownership}} or possession. For example, many common law jurisdictions recognize <b>riparian</b> <b>rights,</b> which are protected by property law. <b>Riparian</b> <b>rights</b> state that only {{the owner of the}} banks of the water source have a right to the 'undiminished, unaltered flow' of the water.|$|E

50|$|In {{projects}} with an uncertain {{supply of water}} due to annual variations in river discharge, water users at the top (the head users) of the irrigation system (i.e. near the system's take-off point) often have preference, to a certain extent, over users at the tail-end. Hence, the number of farmers {{that are able to}} grow an irrigated crop may vary from year to year according to the <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Under the Water Management Act 2000, updated <b>riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> {{were given}} to those within NSW with livestock. This change was named [...] "The Domestic Stock Right" [...] which gives [...] "an owner or {{occupier}} of a landholding is entitled to take water from a river, estuary or lake which fronts their land or from an aquifer which is underlying their land for domestic consumption and stock watering {{without the need for}} an access licence." ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{two systems}} of water rights were {{at odds with}} one another. [...] Appropriative water rights granted the first to claim the water's use {{complete}} <b>rights</b> to it. <b>Riparian</b> water <b>rights</b> established that use of the water was an uncontested right {{that came with the}} land and {{did not have to be}} shared with non-riparian land owners. The case of Lux v. Haggin clarified which system of water rights would prevail in California.|$|R
