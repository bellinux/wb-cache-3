2500|$|Germany – During the chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder, {{the social}} democratic-green {{government}} had decreed Germany's final retreat from using nuclear power by 2022, but the phase-out plan was delayed in late 2010, when during the chancellorship of Angela Merkel the conservative-liberal government decreed a 12-year delay of the schedule. This delay provoked protests, including a human chain of 50,000 from Stuttgart {{to the nearby}} nuclear plant in Neckarwestheim. This protest had long been scheduled for 12 March, which now {{happened to be the}} day of the explosion of <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> 1. Anti-nuclear demonstrations on 12 March attracted 100 000 across Germany. On 14 March 2011, in response to the renewed concern about the use of nuclear energy the Fukushima incident raised in the German public and in light of upcoming elections in three German states, Merkel declared a 3-months moratorium on the reactor lifespan extension passed in 2010. On 15 March, the German government announced that it would temporarily shut down 7 of its 17 reactors, i.e. all reactors that went online before 1981. Former proponents of nuclear energy such as Angela Merkel, Guido Westerwelle, Stefan Mappus have changed their positions, yet 71% of the population believe that to be a tactical manoeuvre related to upcoming state elections. In the largest anti-nuclear demonstration ever held in Germany, some 250,000 people protested on 26 March under the slogan [...] "heed Fukushima – shut off all nuclear plants." ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{performance}} of the methane oxidative coupling process based on different alternative reactor structures including fixed-bed reactor, two different feeding-structures of porous packed bed membrane reactor, and different conceptual network combinations of them was analyzed in a comprehensive model-based study. In this context, a contour-based graphical visualizing method accompanied by multiscenario generation and examination approach was exploited so as to systematically screen out the high achievable process performances and the corresponding reactor network specifications. As performance indicators, several objective measures including the highest achievable values for yield, selectivity and methane conversion were applied over a high number of design scenarios. Thereby, several sets of structural and operating parameters were evaluated. The investigated parameters are temperature, membrane thicknesses, types of catalysts, amount of inert packing in the catalyst bed, the flow rate of oxygen-rich stream entering the reactor system (total methane to oxygen ratio), distribution of the oxygen rich stream through the <b>reactor</b> <b>blocks</b> (local methane to oxygen ratio), distribution of the total methane-rich feed stream into the <b>reactor</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the contact time represented by the reactor length. A high C 2 -yield of 31 % and 88 % C 2 -selectivity were observed at the same time, and thus, highlighting {{the performance}} potential of the reactor network. Moreover, the proposed method enables one to consider operating aspects such as hot spot formation during the analysis and screening procedure...|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{experimental}} design {{the power plant}} suffered from accidents resulting in over 30 unplanned shutdowns. On January 5, 1976 two workers were killed due to a leak of carbon dioxide, which {{was used as a}} coolant. A 'technical' (mechanical?) failure occurred during refuelling and a fresh fuel assembly was shot off the reactor into the reactor's hall.The most serious accident from 1977 (see below) was rated INES-4. The damage could have been repaired with a large investment but on May 17, 1979 the government, dissatisfied with high costs, low performance and accidents, decided to decommission the plant.

50|$|The {{project was}} finally {{canceled}} by the Council of Ministers on September 4, 1990, after {{the recommendation of}} the Minister of Industry, Tadeusz Syryjczyk. He claimed the plant would be redundant in the Polish energy grid, had questionable economy of operation and was of unclear safety. The decision was motivated predominantly by the public outcry and the need to increase political support for the newly formed government, even though the supplied official reasons did not cite them as an important factor. At that time, the supporting infrastructure was almost complete, and the first <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> was about 40% complete. 44% of the planned budget was already spent, but further expenses unavoidable even if the construction was halted increased the total expenditure to about 84% of the budget.|$|E
40|$|Waste {{material}} {{buried in}} drums {{in the shallow}} subsurface at the Radioactive Waste Management Facility (RWMC) of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) contained significant amounts of organic compounds including lubricating oils and chlorinated solvents. CO{sub 2 } concentrations in pore gas samples from monitoring wells {{in the vicinity of}} the disposal pits are 3 to 5 times higher than the concentrations in nearby background wells. The stable carbon isotope ratios ({delta}{sup 13 }C values) of CO{sub 2 } from the disposal pits averaged 2. 4. less than CO{sub 2 } from the background wells, indicating that the elevated CO{sub 2 } concentrations around the pits were derived from source materials with {delta}{sup 13 }C values in the range of - 24 {per_thousand} to - 29 {per_thousand}. These {delta}{sup 13 }C values are typical of lubricating oils, but higher than most solvents. The radiocarbon ({sup 14 }C) contents of CO{sub 2 } across most of the site were significantly elevated above modern concentrations due to <b>reactor</b> <b>blocks</b> buried in a subsurface vault at the site. However, several samples collected from the high-CO{sub 2 } zone on the far side of the RWMC from the <b>reactor</b> <b>blocks</b> had very low {sup 14 }C contents (less than 0. 13 times modern), confirming production from lubricating oils manufactured from fossil hydrocarbons.

40|$|Implementation Model A {{central issue}} behind an {{implementation}} of an OCP system {{is clearly the}} management of efficient wakeups of <b>blocked</b> <b>reactors.</b> In analogy with active databases, there is a dependency on some primitive triggering mechanism {{on the part of}} the constraint system.

This gap motivates this section, which is an informal discussion on where the major implementation considerations lie.

Furthermore, it gives an outlook on future activities {{up to the}} final removal of the <b>reactor</b> <b>block.</b> MERLIN is an abbreviation for Medium Energy Research Light Water Moderated Industrial Nuclear Reactor. The FRJ- 1 (MERLIN) was shut down in 1985 and the fuel elements removed from the facility. After dismantling the coolant loops and removing the reactor tank internals with subsequent draining of the reactor tank water, the first activities for dismantling the <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> were carried out in summer 2001. The relevant license was granted in late July 2001 by the licensing authority specifying 8 incidental provisions. After dismantling the reactor extension (gates of the thermal columns and steel platforms surrounding the <b>reactor</b> <b>block),</b> a heavy-load platform including a casing around the <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> was constructed. Two ventilation systems with a volume flow of 10, 000 and 2, 000 m 3 /h will, moreover, serve to avoid a spread of contamination. The <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> will be dismantled in three phases divided according to upper, central and bottom sections. Dismantling the upper section started in August 2002. This section {{as well as the}} bottom section can probably be completely measured for clearance. For this reason, the activities have so far been carried out manually using mechanical and thermal techniques. The central section will probably have to be largely disposed of as radioactive waste. This is the region of the former reactor core in which the experimental devices are also integrated. Most of this work will probably have to be carried out by remote handling. More than 80 % of the dismantled materials of the <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> can probably be measured for clearance. For this purpose, a clearance measurement device was taken into operation in the FRJ- 1. On this occasion, the limits of clearance measurement have become evident. For concrete, which constitutes the largest portion of the dismantled materials by volume, an additional conditioning step has become necessary to fulfill the clearance criteria, whereas waste packages with steel components largely have to be reconditioned once more at a later stage. Material measured for clearance will be disposed of conventionally (recycling, landfill) after inspection by the official expert and clearance by the regulatory authority.

It is characterized by indeterminacy, nonstationarity and occurs in permanent uncontrolled disturbances. Therefore, the task of developing the predictive control system of the main product concentration of the dehydrogenation reaction - styrene to maintain this value within a predetermined range throughout the period of operation is important. This solution is impossible without {{the development of the}} process model {{on the basis of the}} kinetic revised scheme, taking into account the drop of the reactor catalytic bed activity due to coke formation on the surface. The article justifies and proposes: the drop changes dependence of catalyst bed activity as a time of <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> operation function and improved model of chemical reactions kinetics. The synthesized mathematical model of the process is a system of ordinary differential equations and allows you: to calculate the concentration profiles of reaction mixture components during the passage of the charge through the adiabatic reactor stage, to determine the contact gas composition at the outlet of the reactor stages throughout the cycle of catalytic system, taking into account temperature changes and drop of the catalyst bed activity. The compensation of the decreased catalyst bed activity is carried out by raising the temperature in the <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> for the duration of the operation. The estimation of the values of chemical reactions rate constants, as well as the calculation and analysis of the main and by-products concentrations of dehydrogenation reactions at the outlet of the reactor plant is curried out.

40|$|The {{experimental}} simulation and a computational {{validation of}} a methane-cracking solar reactor powered by solar energy {{is the focus}} of this article. A solar cyclone reactor operates at over 1000 ?C where the methane decomposition reaction takes place. Carbon particles are formed when methane molecules dissociate into carbon and hydrogen. During the course of this two-phase flow transport, part of the carbon particles tend to deposit on the inner surfaces such as the inner wall, window, and exit of the reactor. The deposition of carbon particles on the inner surfaces of the <b>reactor</b> <b>blocks</b> energy input and decreases converting efficiency. Particularly when they accumulate near the reactor exit, agglomeration of these particles tends to block the exit. In response to the unwanted deposition, a cyclone main flow provided a shield flow concept was predicted to prevent carbon deposition from the methane decomposition process via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Based on the geometry of previous CFD studies an experimental validation to the effectiveness of the shield flows was performed via particle image velocimetry (PIV) and pressure sensitive paint (PSP) techniques. Three flow cases using air at atmospheric pressure, air at partial vacuum and mixture of different gas species at atmospheric pressure were used to simulate the flow interaction in the high temperature environment where methane cracking process occurs. The vortex structure in the reactor prolonged the resident time of the main flow in favor of higher energy conversion. The optimal resident time took place when the main flow decreased by 20 % compared to a reference CFD prediction. The resident time decreased when wall streams increase. According to the experimental data obtained from the three flow cases, a CFD simulation was performed to validate the computational model. A high temperature case simulation was compared to the room temperature cases via CFD. The CFD results showed same flow pattern between high temperature case and room temperature cases.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Microreactors offer {{high rates}} of heat {{transfer}} able to intensify highly endothermic biomass reforming reactions in supercritical water. In this study, two continuous flow microreactor configurations were used to gasify biomass constituents in supercritical water. The first reactor configuration was a micro diameter stainless steel or Hastelloy tube (508 µm – 762 µm) imbedded into a <b>reactor</b> <b>block.</b> The reactor provided {{high rates of}} heat transfer to the reacting fluid to sustain an isothermal reaction temperature and was used to elucidate interactions between phenol, a lignin model compound, and xylose, a hemicellulose model compound, during co-gasification. In addition, a reaction mechanism and kinetics for phenol and xylose gasification by supercritical were estimated. The second microreactor configuration studied was a parallel channel Hastelloy microreactor. The reactor consisted of 14 parallel rectangular microchannels (1000 µm by 127 µm) integrated into a single contiguous <b>reactor</b> <b>block</b> by diffusion bonding a series of shims between two header plates. Fabrication of the reactor from Hastelloy C- 276, a high nickel content alloy, substantially intensified biomass gasification reactions and promoted the water gas shift and methanation reactions due to its high catalytic activity and the large surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the microchannel. The dispersion and channel flow distribution in the microchannel reactor was characterized experimentally and modeled using computational fluid dynamics by a tracer pulse study. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics were used to investigate the effect of endothermic biomass reforming reactions and the average fluid Reynolds number on the reaction temperature. Lastly, xylose was completely gasified to hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the parallel channel microreactor at 650 °C and 250 bar within a 1. 4 second residence time...|$|E
40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) s were {{successfully}} synthesized {{in a controlled}} fashion via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerizations utilizing an automated synthesizer. Sixteen polymers were synthesized in a parallel way utilizing the Chemspeed AcceleratorTM SLT 100 to investigate the reproducibility and the control over the polymerizations. The obtained polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and automated MALDI TOFMS measurements, thereby proving the reproducibility and controllability of the investigated automated setup. Furthermore, temperature optimization reactions were performed utilizing an individually heatable <b>reactor</b> <b>block.</b> Moreover, to demonstrate the presence of active polymer chains in the reaction mixture, chain extension polymerizations were performed on the automated synthesizer. The results obtained from these chain extension experiments demonstrate the possibility to design well-defined A-b-B block copolymers with different monomers as building units...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{monitoring}} phosphorus content in watercourses of Veverka catchment area. The measurements {{were performed on}} six specific profiles during eleven-month period with intervals of 14 days. The analysis of samples was carried out at DALE laboratory using her equipment, namely the mineraliser [...] Digital <b>Reactor</b> <b>Block</b> 200 (DRB 200), the spectrophotometer [...] DR/ 4000. Simultaneously, pH, conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were monitored in the field using portable device HQd HACH company. The water samples analysis indicates that Veverka catchment area is negatively affected by the increased concentrations of phosphorus. The main sources of phosporus are the waste-water treatments plants that causes water quality deterioration in catchment area. The agricultural activity has a marginal impact on water quality in terms of phosphorus...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa {{is one of}} Indonesian-main {{plantation}} commodities. During the cocoa seed drying process, {{there are}} two types of waste that are cocoa pod and cocoa sweating. Since the organic compounds contained in cocoa sweating is high enough, it is possible to anaerobically treat this wastewater in order to recover either intermediate or end products. Preliminary study showed that the existence of H 2 in the <b>reactor</b> would <b>block</b> acetic acid formation. Therefore, the aim of this current experiment was to decrease hydrogen partial pressure by flushing various nitrogen gas flow rate to shift the intermediate products during the cocoa sweating anaerobic treatment. The experiments were carried on a Circulating Bed Reactor (CBR) which contained organic compounds around 100, 000 mg/l COD. Then, the reactor was flushed continuously with nitrogen gas as without flushing, 125 ml/min, 500 ml/min and 750 ml/min. The results show there was a possibility that the introduction of nitrogen gas into the reactor could shift the profile of the intermediate product formation. At lower nitrogen gas flow rate more ethanol was formed than acetate formation, although at higher nitrogen gas flow rate the formation of acetate was still low enough...|$|R
40|$|A {{high power}} {{three-phase}} rectifier {{that does not}} require a passive phase shifter (e. g. polyphase multi-winding transformer) was studied analytically and by simulation. The proposed rectifier includes 6 uni-directional switches and 24 diodes that are used to realize two three-phase bridges. The outputs of the bridges are connected in parallel via two <b>blocking</b> <b>reactors.</b> One of the bridges is operating with a positive phase delay of 15 o while the other is operated with a negative delay of 15 o. Analytical derivations, confirmed by simulation, predict that THD of the proposed rectifier's line current will be about 17 % {{in a wide range of}} load currents. It is suggested that the proposed rectifier is advantageous in high power application. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{long term}} {{durability}} of WAXFIXi, a paraffin based grout, was evaluated for in situ grouting of activated beryllium wastes in the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA), a radioactive landfill at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex, {{part of the}} Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The evaluation considered radiological and biological mechanisms that could degrade the grout using data from an extensive literature search and previous tests of in situ grouting at the INL. Conservative radioactive doses for WAXFIX were calculated from the "hottest" (i. e., highest-activity) Advanced Test <b>Reactor</b> beryllium <b>block</b> in the SDA [...] These results indicate that WAXFIX would not experience extensive radiation damage for many hundreds of years. Calculation of radiation induced hydrogen generation in WAXFIX indicated that grout physical performance should not be reduced beyond the effects of radiation dose on the molecular structure. Degradation of a paraffin-based grout by microorganisms in the SDA is possible and perhaps likely, but the rate of degradation will be at a slower rate than {{found in the literature}} reviewed. The calculations showed the outer 0. 46 m (18 in.) layer of each monolith, which represents the minimum expected distance to the beryllium block, was calculated to require 1, 000 to 3, 600 years to be consumed. The existing data and estimations of biodegradation and radiolysis rate...|$|R
