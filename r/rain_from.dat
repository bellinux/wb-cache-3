5|$|Twelve tornadoes were {{reported}} during Fay's landfall; {{the most notable}} one destroyed a mobile home, and damaged a barn. Heavy <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> Fay's remnants also dropped 23inches (50–75mm) of rain over Frio County. Rainfall of 8inches (200mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12inches (300mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. Damage to buildings, roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002USD; $940,0002007USD).|$|E

5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} WrestleMania {{to be held}} entirely outdoors, Vince McMahon also {{announced}} that the show would have taken place regardless of the weather conditions. In the March 2008 issue of WWE Magazine, WWE set designer Jason Robinson revealed that a steel rig with a tarpaulin roof would be built above the ring itself to prevent <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> falling on the ring. In that same issue, an initial design of the ring setup was revealed showing a larger rig surrounding the tarpaulin rig, with lighting and two giant screens attached. The final design had the lighting and video screens on the tarpaulin rig, {{as well as the}} sound system. During an interview, WWE production manager Brian Petree mentioned that video reinforcement should prevent anyone's view from being obstructed by the steel structure. Up to seven generators were used to power up the show.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

5|$|Heavy <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> Typhoon Phanfone {{made the}} track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting {{from behind the}} safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg {{immediately}} fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead {{over the next four}} laps, overtook him on the 29th lap and pulled away. Jules Bianchi made contact with the rear of a tractor crane at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap that was tending to Adrian Sutil's car (which had crashed one lap earlier) and the race was prematurely ended three laps later. The race result was counted back two laps, and Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|October 23, 1878- The Gale of 1878, {{which makes}} {{landfall}} on North Carolina, brings hurricane-force winds {{to the entire}} state of Delaware. The storm drops over 3inches (75mm) of rainfall in the northern portion of the state, flooding portions of Wilmington. The winds and <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> the storm damages or destroys many houses statewide. The flooding washes out railroads, roads, and bridges, and destroys many carriages in Dover. Crop damage is severe, as well. The strong winds wreck four ships, in total killing 14. A 7-foot (2.1m) storm surge in Lewes drowns four when they can't escape the rising waters. Beach erosion is severe, as well. Across Delaware, the hurricane kills18 and causes $45,000 in damage (1878USD, $1million 2008USD). It is one of only three storms to bring hurricane-force winds to the state.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and <b>rain</b> <b>from</b> that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
