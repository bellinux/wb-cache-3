25|$|As {{it spread}} from Asia, the brown rat {{generally}} displaced the black rat {{in areas where}} humans lived. In addition to being larger and more aggressive, the change from wooden structures and thatched roofs to bricked and tiled buildings favored the burrowing brown rats over the arboreal black rats. In addition, brown rats eat {{a wider variety of}} foods, and are more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> extremes.|$|E
500|$|The slave {{houses were}} {{constructed}} out of tabby and {{built by the}} slaves probably in the 1820s or 1830s, although evidence exists that indicates {{two of them were}} inhabited by 1814. [...] Tabby was constructed of shells left over from Timucua middens, burned by the barrel-full in open pits or kilns, then pounded into lime particles, mixed with water, sand, and whole oyster or clam shells, then poured into wooden foundations about [...] high, and set to dry. The process was repeated and stacked until the desired height of the wall was reached. The floors of the kitchen house and the basement of the owner's house were also constructed of tabby. The material made the houses remarkably durable, <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and insects, better insulated than wood, and the ingredients were accessible and cheap, although labor-intensive. The slave quarters at Kingsley Plantation are widely considered some of the best surviving examples of the use of this building material.|$|E
50|$|WBP Glue Line -- BS 1088 plywood {{must use}} an adhesive, {{which has been}} proven to be highly <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> micro-organisms, cold and boiling water, steam and dry heat. The product's bonding must pass a series of British Standard tests.|$|E

30|$|The Globigerina Limestone is a softer, more porous, less durable stone. The Coralline Limestone is harder, denser {{and more}} <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{commercial}} mines {{cater to}} tourists. They can break up rock or screen soil <b>weathered</b> from it <b>to</b> find the quartz. The quartz itself is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The caplock offered many {{improvements}} {{over the}} flintlock. The caplock {{was easier to}} load, more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> and was much more reliable than the flintlock. Many older flintlock weapons were later converted into caplocks {{so that they could}} take advantage of this increased reliability.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{for local}} forest dieback {{due to the}} smoke from {{smelting}} furnaces was first noted the 19th century. In the 20th century, several mountain crests were deforested because of their climatically exposed location. Thus, in recent years, mixed forests are cultivated which are more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> effects and pests than the traditional monocultures of spruces.|$|E
50|$|Gorse wood {{has been}} used to make small objects; being non-toxic, it is {{especially}} suited for cutlery. In spite of its durability it is not used for construction because the plant is too small and the wood is unstable, being prone to warping. Gorse is useful for garden ornaments because it is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and rot.|$|E
50|$|The Kittatinny Mountain {{is of the}} Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate {{which is}} mainly {{composed}} of quartz. Due to the hardness of the quartz, the mountain is extremely <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... duricrust, {{formed by}} {{cementation}} of soils, saprolith and transported material by clays, silicates, iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, carbonates and sulfates, {{as well as}} less common agents, into indurated layers <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and erosion.|$|R
50|$|Many borate minerals, such as borax, colemanite, and ulexite, are salts: soft, readily soluble, {{and found}} in {{evaporite}} contexts. However, some, such as boracite, are hard and <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> more similar <b>to</b> the silicates.|$|R
50|$|Partially transparent, the {{retractable}} {{roof was}} made of fibreglass covered with teflon. This kind of material is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> factors (rain, {{the heat of the}} sun, and can hold up to 18 cm of wet snow) and the crease tendency. The production technology comes from German company Hightex GmbH, and the textile was produced in Bangkok by the Asia Membrane Co. Ltd.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of rubber}} band was popularized by {{use in the}} military. Ranger bands are {{essentially}} sections of tire inner tubing cut into various sizes. They {{have the advantage of}} being versatile, durable, and <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and abrasion. They are commonly used for lashings, and can also be used for makeshift handle grips, providing a strong high-friction surface with excellent shock absorption.|$|E

50|$|When {{the matrix}} {{in which the}} agates are {{embedded}} disintegrates, they are set free. The agates are extremely <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and remain as nodules in the soil, or are deposited as gravel in streams and along shorelines.|$|R
50|$|Unweathered {{sections}} of the Gogo Formation are made of siltstone, shale and calcarenite with numerous limestone concretions. These concretions are <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> producing extensive nodule fields {{on the ground in}} areas where the surrounding rock has eroded away.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{constituent}} of sand, in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings, is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), {{usually in the}} form of quartz, which, because of its chemical inertness and considerable hardness, is the most common mineral <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its bark is {{brownish}} grey, {{tough and}} hard to peel. The wood is of a pleasant yellowish colour, barely knotted and very tough and heavy (0,935 kg/dmÂ³). It's rich in tannins and therefore very <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and sun. It is not very useful for furniture since it {{is so hard to}} work by hand. It can be found as beams or fulfilling other structural uses where needed outdoors.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1842 was {{the last}} U.S. smoothbore musket. Many {{features}} that had been retrofitted into the Model 1840 were standard on the Model 1842. The Model 1842 was the first U.S. musket to be produced with a percussion lock, {{though most of the}} Model 1840 flintlocks ended up being converted to percussion locks before reaching the field. The percussion cap system was vastly superior to the flintlock, being much more reliable and much more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
50|$|Closed-cell PVC foamboard {{is mainly}} used for {{industrial}} and manufacturing purposes. The material is primarily {{used in the}} manufacturing of signs and displays which are used for promotion ads, as well as road signs. Its appealing material properties have made it popular among the makers of scale models and theatrical props. Builders who create yachts and composites used for experimental aircraft are typically found using PVC foamboard. This type of PVC foamboard is well <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and sunlight, and can thus be used to protect other, more damage-prone products.|$|E
25|$|Aluminosilicate glass: silica + alumina + lime + {{magnesia}} + {{barium oxide}} (BaO) + boric oxide (B2O3). Extensively used for fiberglass, used for making glass-reinforced plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.) and for halogen bulb glass. Aluminosilicate glasses are also <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and water erosion.|$|R
5000|$|DeWitt and Colton (1964) {{described}} the Needmore as [...] "soft calcareous medium dark-brownish-gray and greenish-gray shale and mudrock...and soft, slightly calcareous very fissile brownish-black shale" [...] {{that is not}} <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b> They estimated its thickness in their study area as approximately 150 feet.|$|R
30|$|Not {{compacting}} haul {{roads and}} safety berms {{that can be}} a source for acid drainage and poor water quality. Although the roadway surfaces are in most cases well compacted and <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> some mines have loose, deeply rutted haul roads, and the safety berms and roadway out-slopes are not compacted and are subject <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{name for the}} resin produced from the methyl methacrylate monomer (MMA) is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). MMA is a transparent and colorless fluid substance. A characteristic feature of PMMA is its high transparency. It is also highly <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> damage; it does not easily turn yellow or crumble when exposed to sunlight and {{has been known to}} last over thirty years. Polymethyl methacrylate is used for various translucent and transparent items such as aquariums, signboards, automobile taillights, bathtub liners, sinks, cell phone display screens, and backlight optical waveguides for liquid crystal displays (LCD).|$|E
5000|$|In Nordisk Genbank Husdyr, {{the breed}} is {{described}} as a [...] "not too large and not at all rough built, but otherwise it must not be refined and neat. Is very hardy and <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and disease and tolerates a harsh climate. It is hardy, very food-seeking and it has good juicy meat. Is somewhat temperamental, awake and guarding and will preferably be left alone during the breeding season." [...] Further descriptions of the breed's phenotypic court detail: Gase 5-5,5 kg, (11-12 lbs) Goose: 4-4,5 kg, (8.8-9.9 lbs) Egg weight: 130 grams or 4.5 ounces.|$|E
5000|$|NASA based its Martin Marietta X-24B test {{aircraft}} on the FDL-7 {{lifting body}} and valued the added range and stability the sleek, sharp-nosed design. FDL-7's lifting body design was {{projected to be}} able to give the Silver Dart about twice the lift coefficient of NASA's space shuttles at subsonic speeds. The design was expected to have a higher glide and cross range than the Shuttle Orbiter, since it was designed with a 4,000 mile cross range. [...] The ship was intended to use a metal skin that would be more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> conditions than the Space Shuttle. PlanetSpace planned for an initial demonstration flight in 2009.|$|E
30|$|In {{some cases}} of {{granitic}} blocks {{exposed to the}} environmental conditions (e.g. wall 2), major cracks and multiple flaking (scaling in thin scales of millimetric thickness) occurred. Rhyolite seemed <b>to</b> be relatively <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> processes besides a few hair-line cracks observed in relatively small blocks (e.g. wall 3).|$|R
40|$|The {{minerals}} {{present in}} intergrades Andosol-Oligotrophic Brown Earths {{has been studied}} by means of petrographic microscopy and X ray diffraction.

30|$|Differential {{weathering}} {{and erosion}} of various rock types {{has resulted in}} such relief variation. The low relief area is basically consisting of weaker rocks like slate and phyllite, while quartzite, gneiss and dolomitic limestones give rise to higher relief with sharp crested ridge because of relatively <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> and erosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{black rat}} {{originated}} in India and Southeast Asia, and {{spread to the}} Near East and Egypt, and then throughout the Roman Empire, reaching Great Britain {{as early as the}} 1st century. Europeans subsequently spread it throughout the world. The black rat is again largely confined to warmer areas, having been supplanted by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in cooler regions and urban areas. In addition to being larger and more aggressive, the change from wooden structures and thatched roofs to bricked and tiled buildings favored the burrowing brown rats over the arboreal black rats. In addition, brown rats eat a wider variety of foods, and are more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> extremes.|$|E
50|$|The various {{physical}} {{properties of the}} wood make it an attractive material for both general construction and boat building. Due to its slow growth it is hard and, like other cypress woods it is durable; it therefore offers good dimensional stability, and is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> insects, and contact with soil. It works easily with hand or machine tools; it turns and carves quite well. It can be fastened with glues, screws, and nails. Nootka Cypress's texture, uniform color, and straight grain will take a fine finish. It resists splintering and wears smoothly over time. When fresh cut it has a somewhat unpleasant bitter scent, but when seasoned it has barely any discernible scent, hence its traditional use in face masks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{seats in}} the stadium are made from polypropylene. They are <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> {{conditions}} and mechanical damage. A similar model is already used in Allianz Arena. The stadium has three categories of seats: the regular seats, press seats and VIP seats. Press seats have additional desktop space, power sockets and Internet access. Seat colours on the stadium {{is associated with the}} club's colours. The lower level of the stands is green, while the upper is a mix of three colors: green, white and red. There is a white inscription [...] "LEGIA" [...] on the east grandstand.The railings of the stadium are made of glass, which allows to comfortably watch the sport events. The railings are 130 cm high and 2 cm thick. They consist of double-layer glass shields, which may resist up to 200 kg per square meter.|$|E
50|$|Kittatinny's {{valley floor}} {{is part of}} the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation (shale and slate) which make up most of the valleyâand the Jacksonburg Formation (mostly limestone). The {{mountain}} is of the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerate which is mainly composed of quartz. Due to the hardness of the quartz, the mountain is extremely <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rocks that consist {{almost entirely}} of jadeite are called jadeitite. In all {{well-documented}} occurrences, jadeitite appears to have formed from subduction zone fluids in association with serpentinite. Jadeitite is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering,</b> and boulders of jadeitite released from the serpentine-rich environments in which they formed are found {{in a variety of}} environments.|$|R
50|$|Each hill in {{the chain}} {{consists}} of an erosional remnant of Cretaceous intrusive igneous rock and associated hornfels, which are more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering</b> than the surrounding sedimentary rock. All of the hills have dark-coloured mafic rock such as gabbro and essexite; some also have large areas of pulaskite, syenite, and other light-coloured rock.|$|R
