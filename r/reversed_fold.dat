40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} MRI to identify intra and extraintestinal findings of celiac disease in an adult population. Materials and Methods: Forty-one subjects (18 men and 23 women: mean age = 41. 3 years; 31 with biopsy-proven celiac disease. and 10 healthy volunteers) underwent MRI of the small bowel. MR studies were performed on a 1. 5 -T magnet using T 2 -weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) and true fast imaging in steady-state precession (True-FISP) sequences. The MR features and sensitivity,. and the specificity and accuracy {{of some of these}} features are described. Results: In the 31 celiac patients, MRI showed bowel dilatation in 61. 3 % (N = 19), increased number of ileal folds in 48. 4 % (N = 15), <b>reversed</b> <b>fold</b> pattern abnormality in 38. 7 % (N = 12), increased wall thickness in 16. 1 % (N = 5), duodenal stenosis in 6. 5 % (N = 2), intussusception in 12. 9 % (N = 4). mesenteric lymphadenopathy in 41. 9 % (N = 13), mesenteric vascular changes in 22. 6 % (N = 7), ascites in 6. 5 % (N = 2). and no abnormalities in 12. 9 % (N = 4).

This firsttectonic phase is characterized by isoclinals overturned to recumbent folds P 1 with N 0408208 NE trending axis, associated with axial plane schistosity S 0 S 1 which is mainly transposed in the bedding; (2) a D 2 phase of compressional (D 2 a) and transpressional(D 2 b) tectonics is responsible for the crossfolds P 2 a-P 2 b exhibiting curved axes.

The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR- 503 on reversing the cisplatin-resistance in lung cancer DDP-resistant cell line A 549 /DDP. Methods MTS assay was employed to determine the effect of miR- 503 on A 549 /DDP’ sensitivity to cisplatin. Apoptosis rate and intracellular concentration of rhodamine- 123 (Rh- 123) were determined by flow cytometry, the expression of multi-drugs resistant proteins MDR 1 and MRP 1, ERCC 1, RhoE, Survivin and Bcl- 2 were determined by Western blot and real time PCR. The phosphorylation of Akt was analyzed by Western blot, the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and AP- 1 were detected by dual-luciferase reporter gene systems.

The wavelength of the wake-field is shrunk {{in the direction of the}} increasing plasma density, which increases the phase velocity of the wake wave-namely the flying mirror velocity-in excess of the speed of light. The SFM exhibits some novel characteristics. When it up-shifts the light frequency, just as with a normal flying mirror, because the velocity of the SFM is quicker than light, the reflected light penetrates the electron density spike and propagates behind it. The transmitted light can gain extra energy from the wake wave so that the transmission coefficient is higher than one. Most interestingly, the reflected light may be <b>reversed</b> or <b>folded</b> in time during the reflection, if the SFM velocity gradually decreases and goes through the speed of light.

This rift margin consists of at least two major down-to-the-west la e Precambrian toCambrian ormal faults. Maximum fault dis-placement at one location is 3 km. These two faults strike N S 0 ~ in their northern portions; over their southern extent they trend N 30 ~ however.

The dominantly <b>reverse</b> faulting, <b>folding,</b> and positive flower structures in the shallower section indicate Eocene or younger transpression. We believe the late Tertiary faulting is due to reactivation of the basement faults, because on some of the reflection lines basement normal faults can be traced into Tertiary reverse faults, the Tertiary faults parallel the basement faults, and the Tertiary faults overlie or are adjacent to the basement faults. Numerous faults displace the highest (youngest) reflectors and therefore {{we do not know how}} recently faulting has occurred.

The structural {{organization of the}} fusion protein remained obscured by the N- and C-terminal flexible segments of dUTPase and the linker region connecting the two domains that are invisible in electron density maps. Small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that upon oligonucleotide binding the NC domains adopt the trimeric symmetry of dUTPase. High-resolution X-ray structures together with molecular modeling indicate that fusion with NC domains dramatically alters the conformation of the flexible C-terminus by perturbing the orientation of a critical beta-strand. Consequently, the C-terminal segment is capable of double backing upon the active site of its own monomer and stabilized by non-covalent interactions formed with the N-terminal segment. This co-folding of the dUTPase terminal segments, not observable in other homologous enzymes, {{is due to the}} presence of the fused NC domain.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The 1994 Northridge and 1987 Whittier Narrows {{earthquakes}} warned Los Angeles {{residents of}} the threat of earthquakes due to unmapped, blind reverse faults and emphasized the importance of identifying and characterizing blind reverse faults in assessing the seismic hazard to the region. The East and West Coyote Hills in the eastern Los Angeles basin are the surface expression of uplift accompanying blind <b>reverse</b> faulting. <b>Folded</b> Quaternary strata indicate that the hills are growing and that the faults underlying them are active. We use oil well data from the oil field beneath the East Coyote Hills to characterize the deformation. Detailed subsurface mapping in the East Coyote oil field shows that a previously-mapped, reverse-separation fault that cuts wells in the field is predominantly an inactive strike-slip fault that is not responsible for the uplift of the East Coyote Hills. The fault responsible for folding the East and West Coyote oil fields and the uplift of the Coyote Hills does not cut wells in either oil field. To characterize the geometry of the blind fault responsible for folding, we employ dislocation modeling. The dip and upper fault tip depths obtained from modeling suggest that the thrust fault beneath the Coyote Hills fault may be an extension of the Puente Hills blind thrust fault. The Coyote Hills fault is part of a major crustal structure that underlies much of the northern Los Angeles basin, with important implications for the tectonics and earthquake hazards of the Los Angeles basin. Modeling results suggest that the thrust fault responsible for folding would have 1400 m of reverse displacement over the last 1. 2 Ma. This yields an average slip rate of 1. 2 + 1. 4 / o 5 mm/yr for this time interval. Estimated moment magnitude for a reverse displacement earthquake on the Coyote Hills blind fault ranges from 6 to 7 depending on the length of the rupture.

40|$|Inversion structures’ (e. g. <b>folds,</b> <b>reverse</b> faults) {{spatially}} {{associated with}} basin-bounding faults are very widely recognised in rift basins in both onshore and offshore settings worldwide. The {{great majority of}} such structures are attributed to local or regional crustal shortening events. There is, however, an alternative, which is investigated in this paper: inversion could reflect a horizontal shortening component of deformation formed during progressive and partitioned transtension. A case study from the Carboniferous Northumberland Basin shows that shortening structures can also form in obliquely divergent rifts if the bulk strain undergoes kinematic partitioning into distinct regions of wrench- and extension-dominated transtension. Such strain partitioning appears to be particularly favoured in basins where fault localisation is strongly influenced by pre-existing basement structures. This may occur because the pre-existing anisotropies are zones of long-lived weakness that lie in an orientation particularly favourable to the preferential accommodation of either strike-slip or dip-slip displacements. Our strain analysis applied to the Northumberland Basin, traditionally considered as {{a classic example of}} a Variscan inverted basin, reduces the deformation history to a single kinematically partitioned phase of dextral transtension during the late Carboniferous–early Permian. Our findings have profound implications for the interpretation of inversion structures in any rift basin where the direction of extension may be significantly oblique to the basin margins...|$|R
