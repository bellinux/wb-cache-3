40|$|This paper proposes an {{improved}} branch predictor {{that reduces the}} number execution cycles of applications by selectively accessing a specific element in 4 -way associative cache. When a branch instruction is fetched, the proposed branch predictor acquires a branch target address from the selected element in the cache by referring to MRU buffer. Branch prediction rate and application execution speed are considerably improved by {{increasing the number of}} BTAC entries in <b>restricted</b> <b>power</b> <b>condition,</b> when compared with that of previous branch predictor which accesses all elements. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic branch predictor is verified by executing benchmark applications on the core simulator. Experimental results show that number of execution cycles decreases by an average of 10. 1 %, while power consumption increases an average of 7. 4 %, when compared to that of a core without a dynamic branch predictor. Execution cycles are reduced by 4. 1 % in comparison with a core which employs previous dynamic branch predictor...|$|R
40|$|Power {{domination}} in graphs {{arises from}} the problem of monitoring an electric power system by placing as few measurement devices in the system as possible. A power dominating set of a graph {{is a set of}} vertices that observes every vertex in the graph, following a set of rules for power system monitoring. A practical problem of interest is to determine the minimum number of additional measurement devices needed to monitor a power network when the network is expanded and the existing devices remain in place. In this paper, we study the problem of finding the smallest power dominating set that contains a given set of vertices X. We also study the related problem of finding the smallest zero forcing set that contains a given set of vertices X. The sizes of such sets in a graph G are respectively called the <b>restricted</b> <b>power</b> domination number and restricted zero forcing number of G subject to X. We derive several tight bounds on the <b>restricted</b> <b>power</b> domination and zero forcing numbers of graphs, and relate them to other graph parameters. We also present exact and algorithmic results for computing the <b>restricted</b> <b>power</b> domination number, including integer programs for general graphs and a linear time algorithm for graphs with bounded treewidth. We also use <b>restricted</b> <b>power</b> domination to obtain a parallel algorithm for finding minimum power dominating sets in trees. Comment: 22 page...|$|R
