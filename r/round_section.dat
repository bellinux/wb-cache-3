25|$|Part of the 1994 National Register of Historic Places listing for the University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District {{includes}} three round barns. The barns were constructed {{every two years}} from 1908 thru 1912. The barns are known by the simple designations, Barn #1, Barn #2 and Building #857. Though all round barns, Building #857 includes a rectangular brick wing attached to main <b>round</b> <b>section</b> of the building.|$|E

They {{are characterized by}} round-section root with thick velamen, four-angled fleshy pseudobulbs of one internode, often basally protected by dried sheaths and with only one apical leaf(except for Bifrenaria steyermarkii, which occasionally has two), plicate (fan-folded) enervated leathery leaves, yet malleable and not exceedingly thick, with a pseudo-petiole of basal <b>round</b> <b>section,</b> and a basal inflorescences bearing up to ten flowers, which seldom surpass the leaves' length.|$|E
2500|$|The VB {{became the}} main {{production}} {{version of the}} Mark Vs. Along with the new Merlin 45 series the B wing was fitted as standard. As production progressed changes were incorporated, some of which became standard on all later Spitfires. Production started with several Mk IBs which were converted to Mk VBs by Supermarine. Starting in early 1941 the <b>round</b> <b>section</b> exhaust stacks were changed to a [...] "fishtail" [...] type, marginally increasing exhaust thrust. Some late production VBs and VCs were fitted with six shorter exhaust stacks per side, {{similar to those of}} Spitfire IXs and Seafire IIIs; this was originally stipulated as applying specifically to VB(trop)s. After some initial problems with the original Mk I size oil coolers, a bigger oil cooler was fitted under the port wing; this could be recognised by a deeper housing with a circular entry. From mid-1941 alloy covered ailerons became a universal fitting.|$|E

[...] He is actively involved in the Ravinia Festival's Steans Institute for Young Artists as well as Ravinia's model community outreach and education programs, and plans to help lead and expand educational projects during his tenure at Los Angeles Opera. [...] Conlon has been active with the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition since 1997, where he not only conducts the final round of the competition, but also initiated a program through which he leads master classes and coaches finalists. His work in several Cliburn competitions was taped and aired in a special series on PBS, the most recent of which debuted in spring 2006, and the Final Round concerts comprising the concerti and recital performances, rehearsals, symposia including “A Talk with James Conlon,” and the awards ceremony, were webcast live during the 2009 competition. He is also featured in the final <b>round</b> <b>section</b> of the 2001 Van Cliburn Competition documentary film The Cliburn: Playing on the Edge.|$|E

50|$|Ironically, when Potsdamer Platz was rebuilt after German reunification, {{the site}} of Haus Vaterland was the only parcel on which no {{entertainment}} facility was sited, only offices, because it was felt to be too small.

50|$|The {{building}} is {{set back from}} Victoria Road, on which it sits. There is a gardened square outside, bounded by a dwarf wall.

50|$|Since {{both sides}} of the Pataliputra capital are {{decorative}} (there is no blank side corresponding to a wall abutment), it is normally not structurally an anta capital, but rather a pile or pillar capital: the capital of an independent supporting column of square, rectangular or possibly <b>round</b> <b>section.</b> Such capitals, if set on a square column, typically retain the design of an anta capital, but are decorated in all directions, whereas an anta capital is only decorated on the three sides that do not connect to the wall. If set on a round column such as one similar to a pillar of Ashoka, an intermediary piece of <b>round</b> <b>section</b> would be placed between the pillar and the capital, such as a lotus-shaped bulbus capital as those seen on the Ashoka pillars. Rather similar arrangements can be seen, for example, at the Ajanta cave. The Pataliputra capital has two holes on the top, which would imply a mode of fixation with a structural element overhead.|$|E

50|$|The Traina Center {{is located}} {{on the east side of}} Downing Street in {{southern}} Worcester, just north of the central campus of Clark University. It is a two story brick building, with a hip roof and trim of granite and yellow brick. Its principal feature is a projecting section on its main facade, which has a three-story central <b>rounded</b> <b>section.</b> This is flanked by two-story projecting sections with large round-arch openings that shelter the building entrances. A rusticated stone beltcourse separates the basement from the first floor, and similar stone is used for the window sills, and some of the window lintels on the <b>rounded</b> <b>section.</b> Arched windows and openings are highlighted in yellow brick, which is also used for some window lintels, and a frieze band above the second floor.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{involved}} {{a simple but}} highly ingenious method of using <b>round</b> <b>section</b> thin gauge steel tubing throughout the structure with a fabric covering. Powered by a neatly cowled six-cylinder inline 160 hp Napier Javelin engine driving a fixed pitch wooden propeller, the tubular mounting was designed so that all parts were accessible for easy servicing and was electrically started. A simple, tubular construction undercarriage carried low pressure tyres and employed shock absorber struts.|$|E
50|$|The {{load-bearing}} springs of {{the trailing}} bissel consisted of single helical springs of <b>round</b> <b>section.</b> Since the single spring would {{not stand up}} to the load, it was soon replaced by a double spring. Laminated springs were subsequently fitted. Apart from this, the engines were trouble-free and gave more than seventy years of service. After withdrawal, many were sold into industrial service and some of these reached almost 100 years in service.|$|E

5000|$|The first longships {{can trace}} their origin back to between 500 and 300 BC, when the Danish Hjortspring boat was built. It was {{fastened}} with cord, not nailed, and paddled, not rowed. It had <b>rounded</b> cross <b>sections</b> and although 65 ft long was only 6 ft wide. The <b>rounded</b> <b>sections</b> gave maximum displacement {{for the lowest}} wetted surface area, similar to a modern narrow rowing skiff, so were very fast but had little carrying capacity.
