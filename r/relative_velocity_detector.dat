When applied to geodesic trajectories, this formalism yields surprising results: (i) though they have zero acceleration, the temperature measured by detectors on circular orbits is higher than that measured by static detectors at the same distance from the hole, and diverges on the photon sphere, (ii) in the near-horizon region, both outgoing and incoming modes excite infalling detectors, and, for highly bound trajectories (E≪ 1), the latter actually dominate the former, (iii) in this region, the relationship between the temperature of Hawking radiation and the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> between the <b>detector</b> and the hole is not of Doppler type.

We provide an alternative view to the situation considered by Pikovski et al., where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role by providing a <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> to the <b>detector</b> frame with respect to the particle; visibility can be easily recovered by giving the screen an appropriate uniform velocity. We then apply this insight to their thought experiment in (1 + 1) D to draw a direct correspondence, and obtain the same mathematical result for dephasing.

In three, compression of the facial artery obliterated the ophthalmic artery signal. In a fourth patient compression of the superficial temporal artery produced the same result. The technique presently used to monitor ophthalmic artery blood flow and to detect retrograde ophthalmic flow is described. This simple method appears to be at least as useful as ophthalmodynamometry in the routine evaluation of patients for extracranial occlusive disease, is easier to perform, and has a wider range of application. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS ophthalmic artery collateral blood flow blood velocity cerebral angiography ophthalmodynamometry • The Doppler ultrasonic blood <b>velocity</b> <b>detector</b> was first used clinically to localize transcutaneously the precise site of vascular occlusion in peripheral arteries. 1 Because of the relationship of extracranial carotid occlu-sion to strokes, it seemed that this atraumatic diagnostic method might also be used to evaluate these patients.

40|$|We {{are proving}} that the Lorentz boost entails the <b>relative</b> <b>{{velocity}}</b> to be ternary: ternary <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> is a velocity {{of a body}} with respect to an interior observer as seen by a preferred exterior-observer. The Lorentz boosts imply non-associative addition of ternary <b>relative</b> <b>velocities.</b> Within Einstein's special relativity theory, each preferred observer (fixed stars, aether, etc), determine the unique <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> among each pair of massive bodies. Therefore, the special relativity founded on Minkowski's axiom, that each pair of reference systems must be related by Lorentz isometry, needs a preferred reference system {{in order to have}} the unique Einstein's <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> among each pair of massive bodies. This choice-dependence of <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> violate the Relativity Principle that all reference systems must be equivalent. This astonishing conflict of the Lorentz relativity group, with the Relativity Principle, can be resolved in two alternative ways. Either, abandon the Relativity Principle in favor of a preferred reference system [de Abreu 2004; de Abreu and Guerra 2005, 2006]. Or, within the Relativity Principle, replace the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid, with the choice-free binary <b>relative</b> <b>velocities</b> introduced by Minkowski in 1908. Binary - means that the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> is a function of a pair of reference systems.

We find that if unaccounted, the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> effect can shift the BAO peak position and bias estimates of the dark energy equation-of-state due to its non-smooth, out-of-phase oscillation structure around the BAO scale.

40|$|We {{develop a}} configuration-space {{picture of the}} <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> between baryons and dark matter that clearly {{explains}} how it can shift the BAO scale in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function. The shift occurs because the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> is non-zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the correlation function asymmetrically about the BAO peak. We further show that in configuration space the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> has a localized, distinctive signature in the three-point galaxy correlation function (3 PCF). In particular, we find that a multipole decomposition is a favorable way to isolate the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> in the 3 PCF, {{and that there is}} a strong signature in the l= 1 multipole for triangles with 2 sides around the BAO scale. Finally, we investigate a further compression of the 3 PCF to a function of only one triangle side that preserves the localized nature of the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> signature while also nicely separating linear from non-linear bias. We expect that this scheme will substantially lessen the computational burden of finding the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> in the 3 PCF. The <b>relative</b> <b>velocity's</b> 3 PCF signature can be used to correct the shift induced in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function so that no systematic error due to this effect is introduced into the BAO as used for precision cosmology.
