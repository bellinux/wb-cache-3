40|$|This study {{analyses}} reading proficiency, strategy use, {{and interest}} in English as the second language (L 2) of 463 upper secondary students (16 / 17 -year-olds). They were identified among a national sample of 10, 331 students and labelled ‘Outliers’ due to their unusual combination of being poor <b>readers</b> <b>in</b> L 1, but good <b>readers</b> <b>in</b> L 2. Further analysis showed that the Outliers use relevant reading strategies and report high interest in L 2. The largest group was boys in vocational programmes, a group with a high dropout rate internationally. The findings challenge key assumptions about poor <b>readers</b> <b>in</b> L 1 also being poor <b>readers</b> <b>in</b> L 2, {{while at the same}} time adding to studies on the importance of gender and interest for reading comprehension...|$|R

5|$|In 1966, Gowing became <b>Reader</b> <b>in</b> Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of <b>Reader</b> <b>in</b> Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.|$|E

5|$|McAloney {{retired to}} his home in Sandringham, Victoria, where he indulged his passions in {{gardening}} and golf. He was also an active Freemason, and a voracious <b>reader.</b> <b>In</b> 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were according invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, McAloney and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Stanley Gibbs, Robert Kavanaugh, Dick Richards and McAloney, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony in Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972. McAloney later donated his Albert Medal to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook in 1987, where it was placed on display.|$|E
5|$|Nasha strana was {{the major}} Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with Tribuna for the {{immigrant}} <b>reader.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, {{there was only one}} daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996. Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media. Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as Israel Plus. In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian. Today, there are four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends. Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.|$|E

His first civilian job after World War I was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W. In 1920, he took up a post as <b>Reader</b> <b>in</b> English Language at the University of Leeds, and became the youngest professor there. While at Leeds, he produced A Middle English Vocabulary and a definitive edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with E. V. Gordon, both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated Sir Gawain, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo. In 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.|$|E

5|$|Andrić {{was an avid}} <b>reader</b> <b>in</b> his youth. The young Andrić's {{literary}} interests varied greatly, {{ranging from}} the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann, French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andrić also read the works of Miguel de Cervantes, Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James, and Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karadžić, Njegoš, Kočić and Aleksa Šantić. Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton Župančič, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears {{to have had a}} significant influence on Andrić's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature, which he read as French- and German-language translations.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong first taught {{phonetics}} in 1917 in Daniel Jones's summer {{course for}} missionaries; even before then, Jones {{had planned to}} give Armstrong a full-time position at the University College Phonetics Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and <b>reader</b> <b>in</b> 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review. Armstrong also occasionally taught at the School of Oriental Studies. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. Learned societies Armstrong belonged to included the International Phonetic Association, the Modern Language Association, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Bohr did {{not enjoy}} {{teaching}} medical students. He {{decided to return to}} Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a <b>reader</b> <b>in</b> place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.|$|E

They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script <b>reader.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine was published, the editors of the {{magazine}} have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. Strawberry Panic!s origin was in the October 2003 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work Sister Princess that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters {{and at the same time}} younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the <b>reader</b> <b>in</b> the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine.|$|E
