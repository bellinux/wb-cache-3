40|$|Palm kernel shells were {{assessed}} as aggregate in concrete and laterite blocks. Results showed that laterite <b>blocks</b> <b>reinforced</b> with kernel shells at the optimum proportion of 1 : 4 (kernel shells:laterite) by volume were about 15 % stronger than plain laterite blocks. The strength of laterite <b>blocks</b> <b>reinforced</b> with kernel shells also compared favorably with strength of sandcrete blocks which are popularly used as partitions in buildings. However, replacement of crushed stone aggregate with kernel shells in concrete blocks {{resulted in a}} strength reduction of about 50 %. Therefore, palm kernel shells are not good substitutes for crushed stone aggregates in concrete...|$|R
50|$|In {{physical}} geography and geology, a horst is the <b>raised</b> fault <b>block</b> bounded by normal faults or graben. A horst is a <b>raised</b> <b>block</b> of the Earth's crust that has lifted, or has remained stationary, while the land {{on either side}} has subsided. Horst is Dutch and German for heap.|$|R
50|$|The {{wall was}} between six and eight metres high, {{including}} the parapet, about three meters thick at the base. It {{was made from}} two walls of large ashlar-faced limestone <b>blocks,</b> <b>reinforced</b> with an infill of rough-hewn stone rubble and mortar. The wall was topped with a crenellated two-metre wide chemin de ronde.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} using eleven styles of precast concrete <b>blocks,</b> <b>reinforced</b> by steel rods. It has {{a total of}} 492 windows, which consist of glass contained within the precast concrete blocks. Instead of gutters, copper flashing and downspouts allow for water to run off the roof, which is protected by insulation, a rubber membrane and pea gravel.|$|R

40|$|Our aim is {{to present}} some new {{procedures}} for constructing the <b>reinforced</b> <b>block</b> designs introduced by Das (1958). This work contributes {{to the theory of}} connected block designs supplemented by one or more additional treatments and blocks. Such designs are widely used in practice, particularly in agriculture and medicine, where one or more additional treatments called control or standard treatments are often introduced. The basic and additional treatments are replicated {{in such a way that}} the requirement of constant number of replications is preserved for both groups of treatments. The <b>reinforced</b> <b>block</b> designs are discussed from the point of view of the properties of so-called information matrix C. The spectral form of C is used.

50|$|Glen Eyrie's {{location}} {{at the base}} of Queen's Canyon leaves it vulnerable to flash floods, a risk that increased after the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire. The fire did no damage to the Glen Eyrie grounds, but it stripped the vegetation from Queen's Canyon. Over a million dollars in flood mitigation has since provided two debris nets and a wider, deeper, concrete and cinder <b>block</b> <b>reinforced</b> creek bed, which allows water to flow at 2,000 cubic feet per second through the grounds at Glen Eyrie.|$|R
40|$|Leisure {{items are}} {{commonly}} used as reinforcers in behavior-analytic applications. However, {{a defining feature of}} autism is the occurrence of stereotypy, and individuals with autism often engage leisure items in a stereotyped manner. The opportunity for stereotyped interaction may be the only aspect of a contingent stimulus that makes it a reinforcer for appropriate behavior. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of <b>blocking</b> stereotyped <b>reinforcer</b> interaction on reinforcer efficacy for 2 children with autism. Results showed that <b>blocking</b> stereotypic <b>reinforcer</b> interaction did not influence reinforcer efficacy...|$|R

This five-storey hotel was repaired in 1928 after an earthquake. The vertical axis of symmetry is predominant. Two marble staircases face each other, passing under the arched openings. The last two floors are unified, with the central part protruding from the building and raised at the end. The decorations are linear. The bearing structure consists of masonry, <b>blocks,</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete.|$|R
50|$|Caprock-breaching faults are sparser in Queen Charlotte Sound than in {{northern}} {{parts of the}} basin; the Queen Charlotte Basin is not overpressured. Regional geological and geophysical correlations suggest the major Mesozoic block-fault networks were reactivated in the Cenozoic.

5000|$|It is an arched bridge, {{with soft}} incline, over two arcs with long, regular staves, {{reinforced}} by triangular cutwaters. On the ramp are large rectangular stone blocks {{that act as}} railing. It is proceeded by a gentle incline from a curvilinear bend in the road on both sides. The arches are slightly uneven with a 3 m diameter, supported by long, regular staves. Between either arch are reinforcements: upstream, triangular cutwater and, downstream, rectangular struts. The ramp slabs are protected by guardrails formed by large <b>blocks,</b> <b>reinforced</b> by iron [...] "staples".|$|R
40|$|Physicochemical {{characteristics}} of Hibiscus cannabinus (kenaf) fibers from Burkina Faso were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy, {{thermal gravimetric analysis}} (TGA), chemical analysis and video microscopy. Kenaf fibers (3 cm long) were used to <b>reinforce</b> earth <b>blocks,</b> and the mechanical properties of <b>reinforced</b> <b>blocks,</b> with fiber contents ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8 wt%, were investigated. The fibers were mainly composed of cellulose type I (70. 4 wt%), hemicelluloses (18. 9 wt%) and lignin (3 wt%) and were characterized by high tensile strength (1 ± 0. 25 GPa) and Young’s modulus (136 ± 25 GPa), linked to their high cellulose content. The incorporation of short fibers of kenaf reduced the propagation of cracks in the blocks, through the good adherence of fibers to the clay matrix, and therefore improved their mechanical properties. Fiber incorporation was particularly beneficial for the bending strength of earth <b>blocks</b> because it <b>reinforces</b> these <b>blocks</b> after the failure of soil matrix observed for unreinforced <b>blocks.</b> <b>Blocks</b> <b>reinforced</b> with such fibers had a ductile tensile behavior that made them better building materials for masonry structures than unreinforced blocks...|$|R

50|$|Several {{movements}} of the earth's crust that lead to mountains are associated with faults. These movements actually are amenable to analysis that can predict, for example, {{the height of a}} <b>raised</b> <b>block</b> and the width of an intervening rift between blocks using the rheology of the layers and the forces of isostasy. Early bent plate models predicting fractures and fault movements have evolved into today's kinematic and flexural models.|$|R

50|$|Manda Hararo is a {{group of}} basaltic shield volcanoes in east Africa whose last {{eruption}} was in 2009. The group is very large, spreading over 105 km2. At its northern end is a small example. South of this volcano is the Gumatmali-Gablaytu fissure system, an area dominated by fissure-fed lava flows. At the centre of the complex rise two volcanoes. Manda Hararo's large size is because it is a <b>raised</b> <b>block</b> from the end of a mid-ocean ridge spreading center. It is known for its rare basalts.|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{strengthening}} the cement matrix with plant fibers was {{developed as a}} potential substitute for asbestos fibers in 1940 [2]. The use of plant fibers in the reinforcement of building materials is a relatively old field, noting for example the impregnation as horse hair in filling mortars or the manufacture of earth <b>blocks</b> <b>reinforced</b> with straw. In cement-based composites, cellulose fibers {{have been used as}} pulp, short fibers, long fibers or fabrics [3, 4]. However, the traditional methods used did not obey any technological development and scientific analysis until 1970, when the first work was done to replace asbestos fibers in prefabricated profiled fiber cement elements [5] composites, cellulose fiber has been used as pulp, short fibers, long fibers or fabrics [3, 4].|$|R

50|$|Because most {{stresses}} {{relate to}} the tectonic activity of moving plates, most motion between blocks is horizontal, that {{is parallel to the}} Earth's crust by strike-slip faults. However vertical movement of blocks produces much more dramatic results. Landforms (mountains, hills, ridges, lakes, valleys, etc.) are sometimes formed when the faults have a large vertical displacement. Adjacent <b>raised</b> <b>blocks</b> (horsts) and down-dropped blocks (grabens) can form high escarpments. Often the movement of these blocks is accompanied by tilting, due to compaction or stretching of the crust at that point.|$|R

In optical grid networks, files replicated at multiple sites are downloaded in parallel to reduce downloading time. Furthermore, each replica is downloaded with multiple wavelengths. Although parallel and multi-wavelength downloading can reduce downloading time, they <b>raise</b> <b>blocking</b> probability of file downloading. To resolve this problem, the proposed scheme selects replicas and establishes lightpaths based on wavelength availability.
