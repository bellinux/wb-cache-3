5|$|Fleming {{considered}} {{a number of}} titles for the story; his first choice had been The Moonraker, until Noël Coward <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel {{of the same name}} by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, Wide of the Mark, The Infernal Machine, Mondays are Hell and Out of the Clear Sky. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E
25|$|In 1564 a {{prominent}} feature {{on the floor}} of the Lateral ventricles of the brain was named the hippocampus by Aranzi as its curved shape on each side supposedly <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seahorse, the Hippocampus (apart from a spell after Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by others until 1829). At that same time a ridge on the occipital horn was named the calcar avis, but in 1786 this was renamed the hippocampus minor, with the hippocampus being called the hippocampus major.|$|E
25|$|The {{name was}} {{originally}} Peñamellera, given by José de Escandón, as the mountain formation east of town <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar formation in Asturias, Spain in the Peñamellera Baja. It was officially named Santa María de Peñamillera when the area became a sub prefecture of Tolimán. Eventually, the name morphed {{to what it}} is today. The municipality’s coat of arms represents the history and traditions of the area, especially those related to the founding of the Spanish town in 1748 and after. Since it was the 18th century, the sun figure has eighteen rays. Another motif is that of a colonizer subjugating an indigenous person to represent the conquest of the Chichimecas. As thirty seven families moved in to found the town, there are thirty seven marked tombs, and a tree represents the distribution of lands. Eight palms in a walnut tree branch represent the most important annual celebration, that of the Virgin of the Assumption on August 15. The parish church is represented, and the mass of foundation is represented by a cross {{at the top of the}} coat of arms.|$|E

25|$|The town of Peñamiller {{is a small}} {{community}} of less than 1,100 as of 2005, located in {{the west of the}} municipality at an altitude of 1330 meters. The town is wedged between mountains and the banks of the Extoraz River. It was founded and named by José de Escandón {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. He named it Peña Mellera as the mountain now known as Picacho just east of the town <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar formation in the Peñamellera Bajo in Spain. Inside and just outside the town there are many walnut trees. Just further out there are many tall cactus and buzzards can frequently be seen circling in the air riding on warm air currents. Many of the town’s roads are still dirt. The main church building dates from the 19th century and the municipal palace building is one of the oldest in the town. The municipal seat has one public library called the Biblioteca Pública Municipal Lic. Benito Juárez. It offers lending of books with home delivery, research help, guided tours, story hours for children and digital services.|$|E

Jay-Z referred to him as a [...] "breath of fresh air", saying that he <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> younger version of himself. Jay-Z later helped him get a record deal at Atlantic Records. While Fiasco was working on his debut solo album, he released his mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 over the internet, which gained notoriety by word-of-mouth.|$|E

500|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to Ganguli's image, appearance and personal style [...] by the international media, the British in particular. They continue to paint his profile as an alluring, exotic and enigmatic figure. The editor of the Spectator wrote in his magazine diary that Ganguli <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cross between Oscar Wilde and Malcolm McLaren while James Collard of The Saturday Times Magazine reported that Pablo Ganguli was a wunderkind and a mystery. He went on to add 'Or even, as Winston Churchill said in an altogether different context, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' Words including rare, flamboyant, legendary and fascinating have been used to describe Ganguli.|$|E
500|$|... "Give It All" [...] {{is a short}} {{hardcore}} punk track, with a {{fast pace}} and a slow bridge. Lead vocalist Tim McIlrath commented that the song is [...] "kind of a punk rock anthem about being a punk rocker in today’s world; like what being a human being in today’s world is like." [...] Scott Heisel of Punknews.org felt that the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 version maintained the band's distinctive sound, and signing to a major record label had not changed the band's music. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic noted that the Siren Song of the Counter Culture version <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> harder version of songs by the Offspring, {{and that it was}} controlled enough to appeal to casual rock fans.|$|E
500|$|The Claytonites {{started calling}} the new faction [...] "the Brindle Tails". This name {{can be traced}} back to Clayton {{supporter}} Jack Agery, who was a Freedman, contractor, and orator in the state. In a speech he gave in Eagle Township in Pulaski County, he said that Brooks <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "brindle tailed bull" [...] he had known as a child that scared all the other cattle. The Claytonist then began mockingly referring to Joseph Brooks and his supporters as [...] "Brindle Tails", and this is how they were referred to from then on. The Brindle Tails' platform included a proposal for a new constitution that would re-enfranchise ex-Confederates, which appealed to Democrats and pre-war Whigs. They began gaining support among the disenfranchised and the Liberal Republicans.|$|E

500|$|The Greyhound {{name had}} {{its origins in}} the inaugural run of a route from Superior, Wisconsin to Wausau, Wisconsin. [...] While passing through a small town, Ed Stone, the route's operator, saw the {{reflection}} of his 1920s era bus in a store window. The reflection <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greyhound dog, and he adopted that name for that segment of the Blue Goose Lines. The Greyhound name became popular and later applied to the entire bus network. Stone later became General Sales Manager of Yellow Truck and Coach, a division of General Motors (GM), which built Greyhound buses. Wickman, {{as the president of}} the company, continued to expand it so that by 1927, his buses were making transcontinental trips from California to New York. In 1928, Greyhound had a gross annual income of $6 million.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time we encounter a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, a {{relatively}} unknown artist Boots, signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation. In {{an interview for}} Pitchfork after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person {{for the first time}} and Boots presented Beyoncé with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song [...] "Haunted" [...] on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a stream of consciousness rap called [...] "Ghost", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a melody that <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hypnotic state, then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble the work of English electronic musician Aphex Twin. Subsequently, [...] "Ghost" [...] became the first half of [...] "Haunted"; he later described Beyoncé as the [...] "only visionary in the room" [...] for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of Beyoncé.|$|E
5000|$|Ice {{also makes}} {{an allusion to}} the motion picture Dr. Strangelove, when {{astronaut}} Shepherd states that a [...] "war room" [...] on the lunar base <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar room in that film.|$|R

500|$|Leonard Maltin {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, {{describing}} it a [...] "weird, almost incoherent crime story." [...] Celluloid Dream's Simon Hill commented that the writing was a disappointment, musing that it did however feature [...] "glimpses of director Raimi would become". A scene in a dentist office <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scene from Spider-Man 2, a film also directed by Raimi. He commented that [...] "even in his small part Campbell is the most memorable character in the film", also praising the performance of the two exterminators. Campbell also criticized the film, describing it as a [...] "lesson about abject failure", writing [...] "no matter how you slice it, the film was a dog, and everyone involved can pretty much line up and take forty whacks. As filmmakers, we failed to execute a misguided concept and our studio refused us the benefit of any doubt." [...] The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film. In one of the few positive notices, MTV writer Adam Rosenberg described the film as [...] "criminally underrated". Rosenberg disagreed with the consensus about the film, labeling it as a [...] "hard-to-find classic". Kim Newman also called the film underrated, writing that the film [...] "revels" [...] in its slapstick nature, taking influence from everything from horror comics to The Three Stooges.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2013, Gaga {{revealed}} via Twitter that [...] "Dope" [...] {{would be}} the final song available for purchase before the release of Artpop, accessible for digital download from November 4. The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette hair falling over her shoulders, an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] double-breasted blazer, sheer underwear, one black leather boot and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Powell, {{who served}} {{as chief of staff}} to British Prime Minister Tony Blair {{at the same time as}} Rumsfeld's tenure under Bush, disparaged the memoir in The New Statesman. He remarked that Rumsfeld <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reactionary Bourbon monarch after the French restoration. Powell also {{asserted}} that Rumsfeld made [...] "no revelations of importance" [...] and wrote with a [...] "relentless desire always to be right" [...] that is [...] "deeply off-putting". Powell wrote (quoting Talleyrand) that Rumsfeld had [...] "learned nothing and forgotten nothing".|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Blair mordantly {{recalled}} his prep {{school in the}} essay [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys", claiming among other things that he [...] "was made to study like a dog" [...] to earn a scholarship, which he alleged was solely to enhance the school's prestige with parents. Jacintha Buddicom repudiated Orwell's schoolboy misery described in the essay, stating that [...] "he was a specially happy child".

2500|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in London, Cody took some of his Wild Westers to see Sir Henry Irving's production of Goethe's Faust at the Lyceum Theater.

In the premier theater of London, Red Shirt, considered the [...] "Chief of the Show Natives by the press, was seated in the royal box suggesting an aura of nobility for the cowboys and Natives in attendance. Irving used the occasion to his own advantage, inviting the performers onstage after the show. Irving remarked to the theatrical paper Era that it was novel to [...] "see Native chiefs in the full panoply of war–paint, holding the scalp–fringed banner {{in one hand and}} eating sugar plums with the other." [...] Red Shirt remarked that the show <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dream.
