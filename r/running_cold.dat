2500|$|He then {{consulted}} with a distillation expert, James A. Moffett, who was operating the Camden {{branch of the}} Standard Oil Company of Parkersburg, Moffett was convinced that dye manufacturing could be profitable and invested money in Bloede & Rathbone. [...] Dye manufacturing was organized as a separate entity named the American Aniline Works. [...] The founders of the new company had little dye making experience so they read German texts on the subject. There was no money left for new equipment, {{so they had to}} rely on scrapped equipment they obtained from the Standard Oil junk pile. [...] Instead of a heavy cast iron nitrator, an old boiler shell with a capacity of 1,000 gallons (3785 Litres) was fitted with a central shaft of horizontal wrought iron paddles. [...] The valve regulating the flow of acid into the nitrator was operated by a wire several hundred feet away. The operator would periodically run close enough to the nitrator to read the thermometer and run back to safety. [...] Cooling was accomplished by <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> spring water over the top and sides of the nitrator, keeping the reaction within a range of five degrees Fahrenheit. This procedure resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 pounds (3175 – 3628kg) of nitrobenzene per batch. In 1883 he established himself in Baltimore as a chemist and manufacturer of chemical products; and decided that there was a wide field for improvement in the methods then in use in chemical factories. Applying his skills he made tremendous advances in the chemistry business, mainly in the methods of dyeing cotton fabrics; and between 1890 and 1895 he obtained 15 or 20 patents for his chemical processes, {{one of the most important}} patents being his process for the dyeing [...] "sun-fast", unfading shades.|$|E

The bank {{on either side of the}} highway ran {{straight}} down without any break to the water's edge. There was no sign of a bridge, and a black shadow in the centre of the stream showed where the ferry-boat was returning after conveying some belated travellers across. The driver never hesitated, but gathering up the reins, he urged the frightened creatures into the river. They hesitated, however, when they first felt the cold water about their hocks, and even as they did so one of them, with a low moan, fell over upon her side. Despard's bullet had found its mark. Like a flash the coachman hurled himself from the box and plunged into the stream; but the pursuing horsemen were all round him before this, and half-a-dozen hands had seized him ere he could reach deep water, and had dragged him to the bank. His broad hat had been struck off in the struggle, and De Catinat saw his face in the moonshine. Great heavens! It was Amos Green.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{an urban}} setting, the cold engine {{pollutant}} emission of vehicles constitutes a important fraction of total pollutant emission. Cold start emission {{is difficult to}} estimate, as {{it depends on the}} local fraction of vehicles <b>running</b> on <b>cold</b> engines. In principle knowledge of this fraction requires the knowledge of travelers’ activity plans. The paper proposes a different approach: to use parking data, and parking dynamics, in order to estimate the volume of traffic <b>running</b> on <b>cold</b> engine which is generated in any link at any time. A macroscopic traffic flow model, derived from the GSOM family (generic second order modeling), is used to propagate the flow of vehicles <b>running</b> on <b>cold</b> engines. The model is dynamic, it is compatible with cross-entropy dynamic assignment, and can thus be used with various levels of data availability. The main innovations of the paper are: the GSOM model with cold emission travel time as an attribute, the parking in/outflow model, and the use of parking dynamics for the estimation of cold start emission...|$|R

There are only a handful of FEMA trailer designs, so nearly all trailers have the same general layout. Furniture is attached to the trailer; {{it is not possible to}} move it, and it would be illegal to do so. It is also illegal to paint the inside or outside of the trailer. Trailers have little storage space, can be very cramped, and offer little or no privacy.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, Faema {{began with}} {{horizontal}} boiler, lever piston machines, which were {{typical of the}} time. In 1961, however, Faema released the E61, an espresso machine introducing many 'firsts' which are still commonly found in most espresso machines. The most significant was the delivery of pressurized water through a mechanical pump at approximately 9 bar, replacing the piston-lever designs of the 1950s. Faema circumvented the problem of running heated water through the pump, by <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> water through the pump, through a heat exchange tube through the steam boiler to flash heat the water, before entering the diffusion block and through the ground coffee to create an espresso. Faema also introduced a new grouphead that was kept warm by circulating water from the boiler through the grouphead in a thermosyphon circuit. The grouphead was activated by a lever, which when partially open, allows the release of pressure created from the municipal water line. That pressure soaked the coffee with brew-temperature water, allowing for a smoother extraction. When the lever is fully raised, the pump is activated and the coffee is extracted at full pressure.|$|E

The first cellblock opened on 2 July 1883, {{and over the years}} many other buildings came and went on the site. The first buildings were built by Robert Porter, contained 57 cells and were constructed using materials from the demolished Petrie Terrace Jail. In 1903 a prison was built to hold female prisoners. This later became known as the No.2 Division, and is now the only prison building still standing. It is heritage-listed. The 'No.1 Division' built in 1883 was the scene of 42 hangings, including the hanging of Ernest Austin in 1913 - the last execution in Queensland. A new prison was built around the perimeter of No.1 prison during the 1960s and No.1 prison was demolished leaving area for an oval and recreational facilities for the newly built prison and this prison had <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> water and toilet facilities in all cells.

50|$|Through flashbacks {{it turns}} out that Stone and Vlad grew up {{together}} in the same orphanage where they were mistreated by the headmistress and The Physical Education Guider. Once Vlad stolen from a warehouse condensed milk, and the Stone is not passed it. Then Vlad persuades the boy to steal a folder with their personal affairs and to escape from the orphanage (Vlad hopes that it will take a grandmother who for whatever reason do not unmentioned issued guardianship over him at the time). On the way, Vlad says Stone that when he grows up, he will set their own rules, and no one will give them orders. But destroying folders chores, Vlad suddenly throwing stones, claiming that his grandmother will not take the two of them. Stone wanted for theft cases - and he could crawl under the window in the archive. In parting, he hands him his nail, which was used as a weapon of self-defense. Realizing that in the orphanage he was severely punished, and hope for the adoption burned together with the case (and before escaping he went up for adoption), Stone tried to cut his throat with a nail. But he is caught and returned to the orphanage, where the Headmistress and the Physical Education Guider tortured the boy under <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> and hot water.|$|E
