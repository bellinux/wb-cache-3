5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E

5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units.

5|$|Vampire {{lifestyle}} {{is a term}} for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the Goth subculture, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> popular culture related to cult symbolism, horror films, the fiction of Anne Rice, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, {{commonly referred to as}} sanguine vampirism, and psychic vampirism, or supposed feeding from pranic energy.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who moved}} to France {{suffered}} ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding {{the collapse of the}} French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. Thus, the <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Pieds-Noirs has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term rapatriés d'Algérie implies that they once lived in France, most Pieds-Noirs were born in Algeria. Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered Pieds-Noirs, were as indigenous to Algeria as its Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionPostpartum {{screening}} for glucose intolerance among women with <b>recent</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) {{is important for}} identifying women with continued glucose intolerance after birth, yet screening rates are suboptimal. In a thorough review of the literature, we found no studies of screening practices among certified nurse-midwives (CNMs). The objectives of our study were to estimate the prevalence of postpartum {{screening for}} abnormal glucose tolerance and related care by CNMs for women with <b>recent</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> GDM and to identify strategies for improvement. MethodsFrom October through December 2010, the Ohio Department of Health sent a survey by mail and Internet to all licensed CNMs practicing in Ohio. We calculated prevalence estimates for knowledge, attitudes, clinical practices, and behaviors related to postpartum diabetes screening. Chi-square statistics {{were used to assess}} differences in self-reported clinical behaviors by frequency of postpartum screening. ResultsOf the 146 CNMs who provided postpartum care and responded to the survey (62. 2 % response rate), 50. 4 % reported screening women with GDM-affected pregnancies for abnormal glucose tolerance at the postpartum visit. Of CNMs who screened postpartum, only 48. 4 % used fasting blood sugar or the 2 -hour oral glucose tolerance test. Although 86. 2 % of all responding CNMs reported that they inform women with <b>recent</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> GDM of their increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, only 63. 1 % counseled these women to exercise regularly and 23. 3 % reported referring overweight/obese women to a diet support group or other nutrition counseling. CNMs reported that identification of community resources for lifestyle interventions and additional training in postpartum screening guidelines may help to improve postpartum care. DiscussionCNMs in Ohio reported suboptimal levels of postpartum diabetes testing and use of a recommended postpartum test. Providing CNMs with additional training and identifying community resources to support needed lifestyle behavior change may improve care for women with recent GDM-affected pregnancies.
