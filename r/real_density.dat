5000|$|Going into 2002, LGarde was {{developing}} polyurethane resins for a 3-ply composite laminate {{that could be}} used in the fabrication of rigidizable structures suitable for use in space. [...] In a paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), engineers found that such composites can be used to fabricate ultra-lightweight deployable rigidizable structures for space applications and that polyurethane was chosen because it could become rigid when exposed to the low temperatures of space. The paper goes on to observe that under NASA's SSP program (Space Solar Power Truss), a 24-foot long inflatable-rigidizable truss using polyurethane composites withstood a compression load of 556 pounds, 10% above its designed compression strength while reducing mass of comparable mechanical structures by a factor of 4.It had been long theorized that solar sails could reflect photons streaming from the sun and convert some of the energy into thrust. The resulting thrust, though small, is continuous and acts for the life of the mission without the need for propellant. In 2003, LGarde, together with partners JPL, Ball Aerospace, and Langley Research Center, under the direction of NASA, developed a solar sail configuration that utilized inflatable rigidized boom components to achieve 10,000 m2 sailcraft with a <b>real</b> <b>density</b> of 14.1 g/m2 and potential acceleration of 0.58 mm/s2. The entire configuration released by the upper stage has a mass of 232.9 kg and required just 1.7 m3 of volume in the booster. Additional advancement of the solar sail project came as LGarde engineers improved “sailcraft” coordinate systems and proposed a standard to report propulsion performance.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the spatial variability of soil physical attributes within the superficial layer (0 - 10 cm) in an area of agricultural colonization in Machadinho d?Oeste (RO). The attributes analyzed were <b>real</b> <b>density,</b> clay, silt, coarse sand, and fine sand contents. In September, 2004, 76 samples were collected through an irregular sampling strategy, based on soil and topographic features. Oxisols and Ultisols are the predominant soil types in the area. The clay content ranged from 2 to 67 %, silt from 2 to 63 %, coarse sand from 4 to 78 %, fine sand from 6 to 45 %, and <b>real</b> <b>density</b> from 2. 08 to 2. 60 (g cm- 3). Some of the high contents of silt can be due to resistant aggregates of the clay fraction, as the adopted methodology did not separate clay grains. The majority of attributes presented coefficients of variation higher than 40 %, except for <b>real</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Real</b> <b>density</b> is highly correlated with the coarse sand fraction (r = 0, 94) and with the sum of the clay and silt fractions (r = - 0, 86). Geostatistics was used to understand the spatial variability of such attributes, through the analysis of semivariograms, kriging, and isoline maps. Despite statistical distances among the samples, the spatial dependence ratio (RD) was classified as moderate and strong. The spherical model had good adjustment for the studied attributes. Similarities were found for the spatial behavior of some attributes, such as clay, coarse sand, and <b>real</b> <b>density.</b> The lowest range values were for clay, silt, and coarse sand (i. e., around 10, 000 m). For fine sand and <b>real</b> <b>density,</b> the range was between 15, 000 and 16, 000 m. Kriging techniques were suitable to depict the space distribution of the studied attributes.

40|$|The {{canonical}} correlation or Kubo-Mori scalar {{product on the}} state space of a finite quantum system is a natural generalization of the classical Fisher metric. This metric is induced by the von Neumann entropy or the relative entropy of the quantum mechanical states. An important conjecture of Petz that the scalar curvature of the state space with Kubo-Mori scalar product as Riemannian metric is monotone {{with respect to the}} majorisation relation of states: the scalar curvature is increases if one goes to more mixed states. We give an appropriate grouping for the summands in the expression for the scalar curvature. The conjecture will follows from the monotonicity of the summands. We prove the monotonicity for some of these summands and we give numerical evidences that the remaining terms are monotone too. Note that the <b>real</b> <b>density</b> matrices form a submanifold of the complex density matrices.

The use of an interactive powder mixture of gas releasing agent and carrier particles, potentially combines the benefits of small point sources of gas with easy homogenization in the fresh geopolymer. This concept was exploited here for the preparation of porous flyash-based geopolymers. The interactive powder mixture was a SiC powder containing reactive submicron FeSi/FeSi 2 particles. Premature foaming was avoided due to prolonged induction period and slow reaction rate of the active phase. Samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, tree-point bending tests and thermal conductivity measurements.
