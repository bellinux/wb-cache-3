40|$|Cigarette smoking {{continues}} to be a major public health problem that specifically affects the adoles-cent population. The prevalence of cigarette smoking among Iranian adolescents has been re-ported between 2. 5 to 17. 0 % (1). Such a broad range is primarily due to the variety of the defini-tion of “being a smoker”, the age difference of the samples under study and the location where such studies have been undertaken. The key point is that by reviewing the studies in Iranian adolescents, even with considering the differences in definition of cigarette smoker and studied samples, it can be easily observed increas-ing trend in smoking prevalence in Iranian adoles-cents.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{personality traits}} and parental education {{are associated with}} smoking initiation {{in a sample of}} Spanish secondary school students. Participants, taken from the ITACA study (842 adolescents aged 14 - 15 years), completed a questionnaire assessing personality traits of the Five Factor Model, smoking behaviours and parental education. Multinomial logistic regression models controlling for age and sex were used to determine the independent associations and interactions of personality traits and parental education with risk of ever trying smoking, as well as with being a <b>regular</b> <b>smoker</b> in adolescence. Higher conscientiousness was related to a lower chance of trying smoking at least once (OR = 0. 57, 95 % CIs = 0. 46, 0. 71) as well as being a <b>regular</b> <b>smoker</b> (OR = 0. 39, 95 % CIs = 0. 27, 0. 55). Higher emotional instability (neuroticism) was associated with higher risk of being in either smoking category (OR = 1. 33, 95 % CIs = 1. 10, 1. 60 and OR = 1. 76, 95 % CIs = 1. 31, 2. 35, respectively).
