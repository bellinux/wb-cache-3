5000|$|... 1998 saw the {{replacement}} of the Peak Chair with a high-speed quad. The original Peak Chair was renamed to Franz's Chair and moved parallel to the Big Red Express chair with a <b>return</b> <b>station</b> approximately halfway up the Big Red Express lift line. Franz's Chair runs primarily in early and late season, when lower altitudes are not well covered. The Black Chair was replaced with a high-speed quad, the Garbanzo Express Chair. The Fitzsimmons Express Chair was added in 2000, following the line of the long-gone Village Chair and roughly paralleling the gondola. The top of the Fitzsimmons and the bottom of the Garbanzo are co-located in the Village Gondola Olympic station area, providing extra lift capacity from the Whistler Village {{to the top of the}} mid-mountain zone in addition to the gondola itself.|$|E

At a processing station X, the container is loaded with silicon wafers and thereafter returned by the arm to the fixed position P at the pickup and <b>return</b> <b>station</b> Y. A plurality of the containers may be processed in sequence from the fixed pickup position by providing a movable carriage upon which container pedestal platforms are supported, {{at least one of}} which is an elevator platform. The platforms include abutments for properly positioning the containers for accurate pickup by the manipulator arm...|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday‘s conurbations {{suffer from}} {{inefficiency}} in transportation systems. Bike sharing systems (BSS) combine {{the advantages of}} public and private transportation to better exploit the given transportation infrastructure. They provide bikes for short-term trips at automated rental stations. However, spatio-temporal variation of bike rentals leads to imbalances in the distribution of bikes, causing full or empty stations {{in the course of the}} day. Ensuring the reliable provision of bike and free bike racks is crucial for the viability of these systems. On the tactical planning level, target fill levels of bikes at stations are determined to provide reliability in service. On the operational planning level, the BSS operator relocates bikes in vehicles among stations based on target fill levels. A recent approach in tactical service network design (SND) anticipates relocation operations of BSS by means of a dynamic transportation model yielding the required demand of relocation services (RS). A RS is described by pickup and <b>return</b> <b>station,</b> time period, and the number of relocated bikes. RS represent the design decision for implementing a service between two stations in each period for each day of the system operation. The output of the SND model are the time-dependent target fill levels at stations and the set of cost-efficient RS to facilitate these target fill levels. However, the existing approach neglects the sequence of RS into tours, thus leading to a weak anticipation of operational decisions. We extend an existing SND approach by including the concept of service tours (ST). RS are sequenced in ST which start and end at the depot. Experiments shows that the ST obtained by the extended SND yield a stronger anticipation of operational decisions...|$|E
