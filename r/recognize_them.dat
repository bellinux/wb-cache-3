All airports were closed on October2 and sea travel was suspended. With international airports shut down, President Chen, who was {{returning from a}} visit to the United Arab Emirates, was forced to land in Indonesia. The landing in Indonesia was seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as Indonesia does not <b>recognize</b> <b>them</b> as a separate nation from China.|$|E

They express the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E

5|$|Salanoia durrelli, {{also known}} as Durrell's vontsira, is a Madagascan mammal in the family Eupleridae of the order Carnivora. It is most {{closely related to the}} brown-tailed {{mongoose}} (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to <b>recognize</b> <b>them</b> as separate species. After an individual was observed in 2004, the animal became known to science and S.durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area.|$|E
5|$|During Beebe's later years, Simla was an {{important}} gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow. Snow became a regular visitor to Simla, and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research. Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh {{that had been a}} gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not <b>recognize</b> <b>them</b> were just endured by Beebe until they left.|$|E
5|$|Two {{memorials}} {{to those}} {{who died in the}} crash were established by the Government of Nova Scotia.

The second is a more private, but much larger commemoration located west of the crash site near Bayswater Beach Provincial Park on the Aspotogan Peninsula in Bayswater. Here, the unidentified remains of the victims are interred. A fund was established to fund maintenance of the memorials and the government passed an act to <b>recognize</b> <b>them.</b> Various other charitable funds were also created, including one {{in the name of a}} young victim from Louisiana, Robert Martin Maillet, which provides money for children in need.|$|E

The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who <b>recognize</b> <b>them</b> as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their biological or adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E
