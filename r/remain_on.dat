5|$|The IEPA spoke approvingly of this {{proposed}} scheme under which non-recyclables would <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> site. If given {{a green light}} to go ahead, the work was estimated to take around ten years to complete.|$|E
5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Akagi: 267; Kaga: 811; Hiryu: 392; Soryu: 711 (including Captain Yanagimoto, {{who chose}} to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> board); a total of 2,181. The heavy cruisers Mikuma (sunk; 700 casualties) and Mogami (badly damaged; 92) {{accounted}} for another 792 deaths.|$|E
30|$|After debonding, {{the tooth}} and bracket {{surfaces}} were examined with a stereomicroscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) under 40 × magnification. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) [33] {{was used to}} classify the failure modes, using the following scores: 0 indicates that no bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the tooth, 1 indicates that {{less than half of}} the bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the tooth, 2 indicates that more than half of the bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the tooth and 3 indicates that all bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> the tooth, along with a clear impression of the bracket mesh.|$|R
50|$|The Hamdan tribe <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> {{the side}} of Ali, after the defeat of Ali and later his sons. The tribes <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> {{alliance}} to Ali but didn't oppose the Umayyads or ally themselves with the other Shias.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 Drummer, Guitarist, and co-vocalist Dan Molad {{left the}} group to pursue other projects. Molad was {{replaced}} as the band's live drummer by Adam Sturtevant, with Deis (Guitar) and Martins (Guitar, Keys) <b>remaining</b> <b>on</b> lead vocals, and Lizmi <b>remaining</b> <b>on</b> Bass.|$|R
5|$|As the Bankers {{are seen}} as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the barrier islands. To cope with the {{expanding}} population, prevent inbreeding and attempt to minimize environmental damage, several organizations partner in managing the herds.|$|E
5|$|At a four-way {{stop with}} {{channelized}} right turn lanes, drivers must turn to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the highway. To {{the south is}} Renfrew County Road 40, which continues to Highway17 {{at the southern end}} of the Pembroke Bypass. Highway 148 continues east, crossing the Ottawa Valley Railway and the entrance to Hazley Bay before entering the community of Cotnam Island. The highway curves northeast and crosses the Ottawa River, entering Quebec midspan.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|These post-Revolution photographers {{influenced}} the generations after them, but the emphasis <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> social issues. This included work by Nacho López and Hector Garcia, {{best known for}} their photography of the student uprising of 1968.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, KHBC-TV's digital signal <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> its pre-transition UHF channel 22 (using its former analog channel 2 as its virtual channel), while KOGG's digital signal <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> its pre-transition UHF channel 16 (using its former analog channel 15 as its virtual channel) for post-transition digital operations.|$|R

5|$|Falco peregrinus furuitii, {{described}} by Momiyama in 1927, is {{found on the}} Izu and Ogasawara Islands south of Honshū, Japan. It is non-migratory. It is very rare, and may only <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> a single island. It is a dark form, resembling pealei in colour, but darker, especially on tail.|$|E
5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} retain a {{consistent}} shape of the Stanley Cup, as there is only sufficient space for thirteen teams {{on each of the}} five lower bands, team names can only <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the cup for 64 years. In 2005 the band for teams from 1941 to 1953 were removed and placed on display, thus Teeder Kennedy's name no longer appears on the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|It would <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the U.S. Army's roll until November 1919, {{when it was}} {{completely}} demobilized. Only two years later, in June 1921, the division was reconstituted with its headquarters in Wheeling, West Virginia. On 29 May 1923, the division received its shoulder sleeve insignia.|$|E
5|$|Most of her tenants bitterly resented {{her for the}} {{decision}} to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> Sark during the ensuing five years of occupation, but thanked her after the war when they saw how total evacuation destroyed the neighbouring island of Alderney. The Dame had her senior official meet German officers at the harbour and escort them to her residence, where her maid announced {{them as if they}} were guests.|$|E

5000|$|A batter reaches base on a fielder's choice which {{removes a}} baserunner who has reached base safely on an error or has <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> base {{as the result}} of an error, {{reaching}} first base on a passed ball on a called or swinging third strike, or <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> base on an error on a fielders' choice play that should have retired him, and subsequently scores.|$|R
5|$|Some Overlords <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> Earth {{to study}} the {{children}} from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes too dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E
5|$|Strenuous {{efforts by}} the Royal Navy to salvage the badly damaged {{battleship}} {{during the summer of}} 1906 failed, and in 1907 it was decided to give up and sell her for scrap. Montagu was scrapped at the scene over the next fifteen years. Diving clubs still visit the site, where armour plate and live 12-inch (305-millimetre) shells <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> the seabed.|$|E
5|$|The 102d {{returned}} to the United States in August 1962. Regular Air Force personnel {{and a group of}} Air National Guard personnel who volunteered to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing.|$|E

The lights <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by a cappella groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Bow Street changed after {{the construction of}} the nearby Covent Garden Theatre {{to the west of the}} street in 1809. Only a short run of buildings from No.35 to Russell Street <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> their original sites; the rest having been given up for large buildings. During the 19th century, Bow Street was a de facto extension of Covent Garden and its associated markets, selling then-exotic fruit and vegetables.|$|E
