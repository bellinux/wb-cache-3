40|$|Movable refuge {{chambers}} are a {{new kind}} of rescue device for underground mining, which is believed to have a potential positive impact on reducing the rate of fatalities. It is likely to be hot and humid inside a movable <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber</b> due to the metabolism of trapped miners, heat generated by equipment and heat transferred from outside. To investigate the heat stress experienced by miners trapped in a movable <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber,</b> the predicted heat strain (PHS) model was used to simulate the heat transfer process between the person and the thermal environment. The variations of heat stress with the temperature and humidity inside the <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber</b> were analyzed.

40|$|Composing in many {{different}} musical forms, Prokofiev and Shostakovich both reflected the turbulent, often overwhelming times in which they lived while being denounced by Soviet authorities as "imitators of decadent, Western bourgeois art. " Starting in 1936, having been accused with other artists and writers of "anti-people Formalism", both composers adapted to these new circumstances. Prokofiev turned to composing music for children, films and ballet, while Shostakovich sought <b>refuge</b> in <b>chamber</b> works. Being denounced again in 1948 for "bourgeois Formalism, anti- melodious content and {{lack of understanding of}} Soviet heroism", each composer's health and financial situation worsened. Wordless protests found their way into Prokofiev and Shostakovich's music. Examples include grotesque, brutal musical gestures (the 2 nd movement of Prokofiev's F minor Violin and Piano Sonata), musical codes and/or quotes (the Shostakovich Viola and Piano Sonata), and symbolic sounds ('bell' sounds reminiscent of Russian Orthodox Churches, 1 st movement of the Prokofiev's F minor Violin and Piano Sonata; the 'knocking-at -the-door' rhythm in Shostakovich's Viola and Piano Sonata). Knowing more about Prokofiev and Shostakovich being victimized by the Soviet Union's totalitarian regime, I understood their music as a testimony to their times. This helped me to better appreciate and interpret both composers' musical intents and subtleties.

40|$|Three major {{coal mining}} {{disasters}} occurred in 2006, involving either fires or explosions, killing 19 miners. In {{all of these}} tragedies, miners survived the initial disaster but were unable either to escape or successfully isolate themselves from the poisonous gases present in the mine environment resulting from the disaster. In response, Congress passed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER Act) of 2006 (Public Law 109 - 236). Among its mandates, the MINER Act called for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) to "provide {{for the conduct of}} research, including field tests, concerning the utility, practicality, survivability, and cost of various refuge alternatives in an underground coal mine environment, including commercially-available portable <b>refuge</b> <b>chambers.</b> " The primary function of a refuge alternative (RA) is to provide safe refuge for miners unable to escape their work area immediately after a disaster due to toxic gases or a blocked escapeway. To be effective, the RA must survive the initiation of the disaster, whether it is an explosion or fire. Furthermore, it would additionally be beneficial if it would protect the miners inside the RA from the blast impacts of a secondary explosion. In response to the MINER Act mandate, NIOSH OMSHR conducted research on refuge alternatives and provided its findings {{in the form of a}} report to Congress [NIOSH 2007]. In sum, this report found that refuge alternatives were practical for use in most underground coal mines to facilitate escape and to serve as a refuge of last resort, provided that mine operators develop comprehensive escape and rescue plans incorporating refuge alternatives and training on their use. These findings applied to both portable RAs and built-in-place (BIP) RAs, with the BIP RAs emerging as being able to provide a superior environment. They offer the potential to provide miners with an improved psychological and physiological environment, which can be greatly advantageous to their health and safety in the stress of an emergency, and they can be provided with fresh air via a borehole to the surface or a protected compressed air line. Despite these advantages, current BIP RA designs cannot be moved frequently from a practical standpoint - with movement of the RA location required to keep up with dynamic mining production - and as such it would generally be impractical to keep them within 1, 000 feet of the nearest working face, as prescribed in 30 CFR 11 75. 1506 (c). Notwithstanding, OMSHR's 2007 report to Congress on refuge alternatives concluded that, as compared to portable RAs, the strengths of built-in-place refuge alternatives "are so significant that consideration should be given to allowing extended distances, if in-place shelters are used to provide refuge for face workers" [NIOSH 2007]. Currently, there are approximately 30 BIP RAs in U. S. underground coal mines; however, all of these are located outby the face area and none are designed to be advanced with the working face. The usage of BIP RAs that can be advanced with the working face will only be practical if three issues can be addressed: (1) locating BIP RAs further from the face; (2) providing a consistent process for the design and approval of RA stoppings; (3) delivering a reliable supply of clean, breathable air to a BIP RA. In this Report of Investigations, these three issues are explored in detail. NIOSHTOC No 2004597...|$|R

They provide water, food, toilet, breathable air, and a seal to protect occupants from the outside environment for at least 96 hours, or 4 days. Although states and mines refer to refuge alternatives by different names, this guide will refer to those nearest to the face as refuge chambers, whether inflatable from a skid or constructed from steel. Other popular terms for refuge chambers are rescue shelters and refuge shelters. Refuges that are toward the mine entrance or shaft, whether a prefabricated <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber</b> or one built into a crosscut, will be referred to as outby refuges because of their location in the mine. Outby refuges can be permanent, semipermanent, or portable and are usually located at every other self-contained selfrescuer (SCSR) cache. Outby refuges are sometimes called hardened rooms, outby shelters, and in-place shelters. The term "refuge alternatives" is used to describe both refuge chambers and outby refuges. This training is intended for refuge chambers that are prefabricated by manufacturers. This presentation may, however, be useful for other types of refuge alternatives as long as the instructor adapts the Quick Start Guide to fit the operation of the refuge alterative. Purpose: The purpose of this training presentation is to teach underground miners how {{to operate a}} <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber</b> using a Quick Start Guide. Refuge chambers are a technology that may be new to miners. Therefore, this training will assist the instructor in developing a quality training tool to teach miners how to operate refuge chambers based on Quick Start Guides. It is designed to be used as a template for mine instructors to modify based on the refuge chambers used at their mine" [...] NIOSHTIC- 2.

40|$|Safety in a mine is {{important}} where working underground poses many threats. A solution {{to improve the}} safety {{is the use of}} refuge chambers. The technology and machinery in a mine varies therefore changing the regulations of the design of the refuge chambers to withstand a fire. The purpose of this report is to determine how long {{it should be possible to}} maintain a safe environment in the chamber. Today, refuge chambers are produced to meet the different demands from both the customer and current regulations. Since these demands vary the refuge chambers are designed in different ways. A literature study was conducted to find factors that affect the amount of air that is consumed in the <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber.</b> The demands on refuge chambers in Sweden and in some other countries were investigated to check the similarities and differences between them. When the study was finished hand calculations were made on two different fire cases. The calculations were performed for two types of wheel loaders in a mine. The calculations were supposed to show the duration time of a fire. The results from the literature study and hand calculations were later compared and an image of the demands that were necessary was obtained. The factors that were identified as sensitive were air consumption for each person, the function of the air system, psychological effects and the number of people in the <b>refuge</b> <b>chamber.</b> The countries chosen have different regulations and varying approach for use of refuge chambers. The calculations showed that a fire in a vehicle can last for more than seven hours and produce a heat release rate over 15 MW. Many countries take into consideration the aspects that affect the air consumption but Sweden has calculated with the highest air consumption, 20 l air per person and minute. Western Australia is the region which has accounted for the most amounts of factors when determining the time for how long the workers will be able to stay safe inside the chamber. They were also amongst the countries with the longest time for stored air. Table. Time demands on breathable air. Australia-Western Australia 36 hoursCanada – Province of Nova Scotia 8 hoursUK 36 hours is mentioned for one type of chamber. USA 36 - 48 hoursSweden 4 hoursSignificant differences between the countries’ regulations have been identified. The calculated duration time of more than seven hours for the fire in the vehicle, show that the four hours that are stated in Sweden is not enough. If the risk of explosion and the rescue operation time is considered 36 hours would be more appropriate. Validerat; 20140113 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
