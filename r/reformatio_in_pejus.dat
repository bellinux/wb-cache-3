40|$|The {{requirement}} of the prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius may arise taking into consideration several basic principles of the criminal procedure. The most important element of the prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius {{is that it is}} a legal guarantee for the defence to be able to file an appeal without the risk that a judgment might be altered to the detriment of the accused. Therefore, the accused will have confidence that the appeal will not do wrong to his interest. Nevertheless, the prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius can only be considered as a legal favour, but at the same time, many problems and counterarguments are being discussed regarding the prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius, such as the violation of fundamental principles and constitutionality. This paper examines the reasons for the existence of the prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius in the course of the criminal procedure while arguing its connection to the principle of constitutionality. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} no <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius (prohibition of reformation in peius {{means that}} a person should not {{be placed in a}} worse position as a result of filling an appeal) should be respected both in the trial of the remedy at law and the retrial of the case, after the invalidation or the repeal of the judgment, because the retrial is the consequence of the exercise of the challenge methods, and the party must have the certainty that its situation will not be deteriorated, not only in the filling of the appeal promoted but also in the preproceeding process subsequent to the admission of the appeal. Thus the principle no <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius is adjusted under the article 481 from the Code of Civil Procedure, it can't create for the appellant a worse situation that the one before the judgment under appeal, besides if he expressly consents to this one or in the cases specifically provided by law. ...|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the case}} {{law of the}} Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), a Board cannot put a sole {{appellant}} in a worse position than {{if he had not}} appealed the first instance decision. Hence in relation to appeals, the term [...] "prohibition of <b>reformatio</b> <b>in</b> peius" [...] essentially means that a person should not be placed in a worse position as a result of filing an appeal. Thus, in general, EPO Boards of Appeal are prevented in opposition appeal proceedings from going beyond the request of a sole appellant to put it in a worse position than it was before it appealed. The central case detailing this principle is G 4/93 consolidated with G 9/92.|$|R

It was presented in 1439 at the Council of Basel, published by an anonymous author, and referred to the injustice of the German rulers. It included a vision of Sigismund's about the appearance of a priest-king, Frederick, as well as plans for a wide reform of the monarchy (and emperorship) and the (German) empire.|$|R

5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as <b>Reformatio</b> legum ecclesiasticarum <b>in</b> 1552.|$|R
40|$|Objetivou-se colocar em evidência as políticas {{realizadas}} na função repressiva do Sistema Brasileiro de Defesa da Concorrência (SBDC) sobre a fixação de preços de revenda (FPR) a partir da Lei n. 8. 884 / 1994 (revogada pela Lei n. 12. 529 / 2011). Do mesmo modo que a conduta poderia acarretar consequências perversas ao ambiente concorrencial, a falta de padrões claros para caracterizar a conduta como ilícita também pode ensejar efeitos deletérios ao ambiente institucional protegido pelo SBDC. O problema central da pesquisa está nos arranjos institucionais para promover a maximização da segurança jurídica no contexto da FPR no SBDC. Partiu-se da hipótese de que essas alternativas institucionais podem ser encontradas no próprio arcabouço normativo no SBDC, sem prejuízo de outras soluções estruturais. A partir dessa premissa, foi aplicado o método de análise de instituições para resolver um problema de arcabouço institucional aplicado. Inicialmente, o método abordou uma análise como um fim descritivo, objetivando identificar os elementos/particularidades do ambiente recortado para delimitar os contornos do problema da pesquisa. Para tanto, foram analisadas as decisões paradigmáticas do Cade sobre o tema. Ato contínuo, passou-se à função analítica aplicada do método, para formular um instrumental propositivo a respeito das possíveis falhas do arcabouço anteriormente estudado. Para tanto, a linha de raciocínio subjacente à tarefa foram os métodos dedutivo e hipotético-dedutivo, tomando como fontes a bibliografia especializada, além das estruturas balizadoras do ordenamento jurídico nacional. Concluiu-se que a estabilidade institucional é um dos fatores a ser considerado na promoção da defesa da concorrência, devendo ser garantida na intersecção entre as funções repressiva e educativa do SBDC, isto é, por meio de medidas educativas (medidas ex ante de conscientização) antes de medidas sancionadoras (ações punitivas ex post). Cabe ao Cade considerar os postulados da razoabilidade e proporcionalidade não apenas em suas atividades-fim, mas também nos reflexos de seus atos administrativos sobre o ambiente institucional, o que inclui o dever de proteção da segurança jurídica. Portanto, qualquer inovação institucional <b>in</b> <b>pejus</b> ao administrado aplicada pelo Cade, inclusive no caso de standards interpretativos, deverá ser considerada na perspectiva dos pilares da lei de processo administrativo como ponderação necessária, vedadas medidas contraditórias àquelas que se têm praticado no mesmo ambiente institucional. The research {{encompasses the}} policies {{enforced by the}} Brazilian System of Competition Defence (SBDC) with regard to Resale Price Maintenance (RPM). While the conduct may produce a negative impact over competition - reducing the welfare of consumers -, the lack of predictability from the rulings enforced by SBDC on the subject might, likewise, produce deleterious outcomes to the institutional environment. The focus of this research rests on the premise of promoting a maximization of legal security {{in the context of}} RPM within SBDC. The initial hypothesis is that the institutional alternatives may be found within the very normative scope of SBDC, without prejudice of other structural solutions. Based on those premises we applied the Analysis of Institutions method in order to solve the issue within an institutional scope. Such method encompassed the analysis as a descriptive means, with the objective of identifying the elements/particularities of the given environment in order to define the contours from the object of the research. Subsequently, we moved on to the analytical method in order to instrumentally investigate possible flaws within the scope of what was previously studied. Thus, the subsequent lines of thought were both deductive and hypothetico-deductive. As a conclusion, the institutional stability is one of the factors to be considered in the promotion of competition defense, and it should be warranted within an intersection of repressive and educative functions from the SBDC, that is, through educative measures (ex ante) before repressive actions (punitive actions, ex post). It was concluded that institutional stability is one of the factors to be considered in promoting competition and should be guaranteed at the intersection between the repressive and educational functions of the SBDC, that is, through educational measures (ex ante measures) before punitive measures ex post. It will always be up to Cade to consider the claims with regard to reasonability and proportionality, not only with regard to the end activity but also with regard to the outcomes over the institutional environment - which also encompasses the duty of legal protection as well. Moreover, the notion of restrictions of competition b̈y the object-̈ as well as any institutional innovation contrary to the ones previously administered - should be considered {{from the perspective of the}} pillars of the Administrative Process Law...|$|R
