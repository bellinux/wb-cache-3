40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a new experimental procedure for calibrating the permeability measuring 1 -D flow set-up used routinely by the composites processing community using the liquid composite molding {{processes such as}} RTM and VARTM. A <b>reference</b> porous <b>medium</b> consisting of a bank of parallel cylindrical holes is created in an aluminum plate whose theoretical permeability is computed using the Hagen–Poiseuille flow equation and whose numerical permeability is estimated using Fluent. It is observed that the deviation of the experimentally measured permeability from the theoretical {{as well as the}} numerical permeabilities increases with the flow rate for an injection set-up using a gear pump as well as a piston-cylinder pump. The cause of permeability deviation is traced to opening of a small gap above the rigid <b>reference</b> porous <b>medium</b> due to high pressures at higher flow rates. However no such deviation is observed while measuring the permeability of a fiber mat at different flow rates. So the proposed <b>reference</b> porous <b>medium</b> can calibrate a conventional 1 -D flow based permeability measuring set-ups at low flow rates; the accuracy thus obtained can be extended to higher flow rates as well if permeability of a fiber mat can be shown to remain constant with the flow rate...|$|R

50|$|This {{methodology}} for length determination requires a careful specification of the wavelength {{of the light}} used, and is one reason for employing a laser source where the wavelength can be held stable. Regardless of stability, however, the precise frequency of any source has linewidth limitations. Other significant errors are introduced by the interferometer itself; in particular: errors in light beam alignment, collimation and fractional fringe determination. Corrections also are made to account for departures of the medium (for example, air) from the <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> of classical vacuum. Resolution using wavelengths is {{in the range of}} ΔL/L ≈ 10−9 - 10−11 depending upon the length measured, the wavelength and the type of interferometer used.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind a transit-time {{measurement}} of length {{is to send}} a signal {{from one end of}} the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*"v",with v the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its speed depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in SI units the speed is a defined value c0 in the <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> of classical vacuum. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach, length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the pulse emission and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the refractive index correction relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the classical vacuum. A refractive index of the medium larger than one slows the light.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of seismic inversion methods in petroleum exploration is the potential quantitative evaluation of the distributed parameters (propagation velocity, acoustic im-pedance) which characterize subsurface formations. Such methods are particularly attractive for detecting stratigraphic traps, which can be recognized by a lateral variation in these parameters. Consequently, they can yield a substantial improvement over conventional pre-stack migrations which only provide images of heterogeneities. Among inversion methods, the linearized inversion is arousing great interest because of simplifications it brings to computing. The disadvantage of this approach stems from the difficulty in finding a so-called <b>reference</b> <b>medium,</b> sufficiently close to the actual unknown medium as to justify the linearization. The first part of this work aims at providing {{a better understanding of the}} 2 -D linearized forward problem and attempts to answer the following question: how close must the <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> be to the exact medium for the linearization to be justified? The second part of this work examines the 2 -D linearized inverse problem and analyses how errors resulting from the linearization can influence the solution of the problem. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the linearized inversion. More specifically it allows a quantitative identification of the heterogeneities, as well as a non-linear inversion does, when the <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> accurately approximates the velocity of the actual medium. With a cruder <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> the quantitative identification of the heterogeneities becomes usually less accurate, but at least the linearized inversion yields a substantially better image than the pre-stack migration.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Full {{waveform}} inverse methods {{describe the}} full physics of wave propagation and can potentially overcome {{the limitations of}} ray theoretic methods. This work explores the use of integral equation based methods for simulation and inversion and illustrates their potential for computationally demanding problems. A frequency-domain integral equation approach to simulate wave-propagation in heterogeneous media and solve the inverse wave-scattering problem will be presented for elastic, acoustic, and electromagnetic systems. The method will be illustrated for georadar (ground- or ice-penetrating radar) applications and compared to results obtained using ray theoretic methods. In order to tackle the non-linearity of the problem, the inversion incorporates {{a broad range of}} frequencies to stabilize the solution. As with most non-linear inversion methods, a starting model that reasonably approximates the true model is critical to convergence of the algorithm. To improve the starting model, a variable reference inversion technique is developed that allows the background <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> to vary for each source-receiver data pair and is less restrictive than using a single <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> for the entire dataset. The <b>reference</b> <b>medium</b> can be assumed homogeneous (although different for each data point) to provide a computationally efficient, single-step, frequency-domain inversion approach that incorporates finite frequency effects not captured by ray based methods.
