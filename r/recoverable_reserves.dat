25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo {{to where it was}} used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2–3% could result in currently <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|E

25|$|The Yilgarn Craton and {{its cover}} {{sequences}} are host {{to a significant}} percentage of the world's endowment in economically demonstrable and <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> (EDR) of uranium. Most uranium is hosted within palaeochannels derived from granites of the Yilgarn Craton and/or its flanking Proterozoic orogens, and this metal is deposited within Tertiary or younger palaeodrainage and current drainage systems. Examples include Yeelirrie, Mulga Rock and Lake Way-Centipede.|$|E
25|$|Brazil has total coal {{reserves}} of about 30 billion tonnes, but the deposits vary {{by the quality}} and quantity. The proved <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> are around 10 billion tonnes. In 2004 Brazil produced 5.4 million tonnes of coal, while coal consumption reached 21.9 million tonnes. Almost all of Brazil’s coal output is steam coal, of which about 85% is fired in power stations. Reserves of subbituminous coal are located mostly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná.|$|E
25|$|A {{natural gas}} {{processing}} facility was formerly located in Pickering. The Lockton {{natural gas field}} was discovered under the North York Moors National Park by the Home Oil Company of Canada in 1966. It is located {{at a depth of}} 5,700ft (1,740m) in Middle Magnesian Limestone. The gas is about 94% methane, 3% inert gas with traces of hydrogen sulphide. <b>Recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> were initially estimated to be 250billion cubic feet (7billionm3).

25|$|The {{original}} {{agreement between}} Home Oil and British Gas was a 15-year contract valued at £27million for {{the delivery of}} 75 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) (2.1 million m3/d) of gas with a maximum flow of 100 MMSCFD (2.8 million m3/d). By 1974 aquifer water ingress into the gas reservoir had significantly reduced gas production to about 1 MMSCFD (28,300 m3/d). The production and gas treatment facility was permanently shutdown in October 1974. Over three years it had produced 11.3 billion standard cubic feet of gas (320 million standard m3), only 4.5% of the estimated <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vaca Muerta, a 30,000km² (11,600mi²) {{unconventional}} {{oil field}} with proven <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> {{of up to}} 927 million barrels, had been discovered by RepsolYPF in November 2011. Repsol executives declared however that government policies would have to change {{in order to allow}} investment in new production. Following bills signed by governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces during March and April 2012 revoking YPF leases accounting for over a fifth of its production, the president announced on April 16 that the Argentine Government would acquire a majority stake in YPF. Repsol YPF Gas, a liquefied natural gas subsidiary in which Repsol had an 85% stake, was concurrently nationalized on April 19.|$|E
25|$|Mexico drilled {{its first}} shale gas well in 2011, in the Burgos Basin of {{northern}} Mexico, in {{the equivalent of}} the Eagle Ford Formation of the US. But as of February 2013, there have been only six productive shale gas and tight oil wells drilled in Mexico (a seventh was abandoned as non-productive), all producing from Eagle Ford equivalent. The national oil company Pemex has limited investment capital, and focuses its effort on what it sees as higher-return conventional oil and gas projects, rather than gas shales or tight oil. The US Energy Information Administration estimates Mexico's <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of shale gas to be 681 trillion cubic feet, the fourth largest shale gas reserves in the world.|$|E

30|$|For the water-flooded {{reservoir}} at ultra-high {{water cut}} stage, {{the ratio of}} oil and water relative permeability and the water saturation deviate from the linear relationship and show the downwarping trend in the semi-log coordinate, and the conventional water drive curves show the upwarping trend. Aiming at predicting the dynamic, <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> and recovery of oilfields at ultra-high water cut stage, a new formula characterizing {{the relation between the}} ratio of oil and water relative permeability and the water saturation was proposed, derivation of a new water drive curve was done by reservoir engineering methods, and the formula of <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> and recovery was derived. Comparison of the new water drive curve and the conventional one through numerical simulation and field application showed higher accuracy and better adaptability resulted from the new water drive curve, which solved the problems of upwarping and big prediction error in curves of ultra-high water cut stage.|$|R

2500|$|... 2011 {{estimates}} by the US Department of Energy in 2011 pegged out Polish shale reserves {{as the largest}} in Europe. The authors of the report calculated that Poland had reserves of about 22.45trillion cubic meters of shale gas, of which 5.30trillion cubic meters was recoverable. Most of the shale gas about 3.66trillion cubic meters is in the Baltic Sea Basin, about 1.25trillion cubic meters within the region of Lublin province, followed by 0.4trillion cubic meters in the Podlaskie province. 2012 {{estimates by}} the Polish Geological Institute put <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> at only around 350–750 billion cubic meters, and a 2012 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey estimated 38.09 billion cubic meters of recoverable gas.

2500|$|The {{fossil fuels}} include coal, {{petroleum}} and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons. More than 92% of them, or 4,5 billion tons, is lignite, {{which is the}} lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With reserves of 2,856 billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, {{is by far the}} largest coal basin in the country which powers Maritsa Iztok Complex, the largest energy complex in South-Eastern Europe. Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (reserves of 870 million tons), Elhovo (656 million tons), Lom (277 million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170 million tons). The reserves of sub-bituminous coal are 300 million tons, situated mainly near Bobov Dol, Pernik and Burgas. The <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserves</b> of bituminous coal and anthracite are insignificant— only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in Southern Dobruja with estimated reserves of over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.|$|E

40|$|Gullfaks {{is located}} in block 34 / 10 in the {{northern}} part of the Norwegian North Sea. This field is nicknamed as Golden Block because of the high interest rate. It was discovered in 1979, at a water depth of 135 meters. The initial <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> is 2. 1 billion barrels (330 &# 215; 106 m 3), and the remaining <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> in 2004 is 234 million barrels (37. 2 &# 215; 106 m 3). This oil field reached peak production in 2001 at 180, 000 barrels per day (29, 000 m 3 /d). It has satellite fields Gullfaks South, Rimfaks, Skinfaks and Gullveig. The Gullfaks Oil Field is one of the of the best and most studied areas in the world with respect to the structural and sedimentary architecture and one of the most interesting and important structures of the field are fault structures. There are plenty of divergent interpretations about faults of the Gullfaks area. This thesis work is about to show another observation and interpretation on these faults. In this study, 3 D seismic data which collected at Gullfaks oil field is interpreted by Kingdom Suite software. Sea bottom, near top Paleocene, base Cretaceous, Jurassic and top Carnian formations are interpreted as horizons. Interpreted major normal faults, which strike in a north-south direction were the main target. 3 D visualizations were generated to increase the understanding of the fault structures. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea that}} the rate of oil {{production}} would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one. In 1919, David White, chief geologist of the United States Geological Survey, wrote of US petroleum: [...] "... the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years." [...] In 1953, Eugene Ayers, a researcher for Gulf Oil, projected that if US ultimate <b>recoverable</b> oil <b>reserves</b> were 100 billion barrels, then production in the US would peak no later than 1960. If ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels, which he warned was wishful thinking, US peak production would come no later than 1970. Likewise for the world, he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 (one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable) and 2000 (two trillion barrels recoverable). Ayers made his projections without a mathematical model. He wrote: [...] "But if the curve is made to look reasonable, it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine, in this way, the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate <b>recoverable</b> <b>reserve</b> numbers" ...|$|R
