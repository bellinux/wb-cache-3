5|$|The South West Coast Path is England's longest waymarked long-distance {{footpath}} and a National Trail. It stretches for , {{running from}} Minehead in Somerset, along {{the coasts of}} Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Since it <b>rises</b> <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> with every river mouth, {{it is also one}} of the more challenging trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931ft (35,031m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted 'Britain's Best Walking route' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks.|$|E

25|$|A lock is {{a device}} used for raising and {{lowering}} boats, ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways.

25|$|Many FM {{detector}} circuits exist. A common {{method for}} recovering the information signal {{is through a}} Foster-Seeley discriminator. A phase-locked loop {{can be used as}} an FM demodulator. Slope detection demodulates an FM signal by using a tuned circuit which has its resonant frequency slightly offset from the carrier. As the frequency <b>rises</b> <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> the tuned circuit provides a changing amplitude of response, converting FM to AM. AM receivers may detect some FM transmissions by this means, although it does not provide an efficient means of detection for FM broadcasts.|$|E

25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of the African wolf {{is similar to}} that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded. The African wolf's vocalisations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles. Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls. One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that <b>rises</b> <b>and</b> <b>falls,</b> and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status. A comparative analysis of African wolf and some grey wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the Indian grey wolf, being high pitched and of relatively short duration.|$|E
