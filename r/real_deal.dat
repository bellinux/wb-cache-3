500|$|Betrayal is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to be released on a non-PlayStation platform and presented as a 2D side-scrolling game.

Although God of War is primarily a home console series, Betrayal was praised for its fidelity to the series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics: [...] "the <b>real</b> <b>deal</b> third game in the killer franchise".

He wasn't content anymore just being the guy who ended up with the girls that he could get from it". Lloyd remained in Los Angeles and participated in a number of studio projects with Fowley and Mike Curb such as October Country, the Smoke, St. John Green, and the Fire Escape.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Dallas Stewart, trainer of rival Commanding Curve, dismissed California Chrome's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races. Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California. In contrast to the critics, reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $10million.|$|E

You've got to really be prepared for it", he said.|$|E
500|$|In late 2005, McAdams starred with Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Keaton in the {{seasonal}} family comedy-drama The Family Stone, which gave McAdams {{an opportunity to}} play a dishevelled and sardonic sister, rather than the usual [...] "obvious" [...] girlfriend or wife roles.

[...] Justin Chang of Variety noted that [...] "a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she's the <b>real</b> <b>deal,</b> delivering a deliciously feisty performance". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that her [...] "engaging screen presence holds your attention and sympathy despite the handicap presented by her character's personality." [...] The film was a commercial success: it cost $18 million to make and grossed over $92 million worldwide.|$|E

[...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', and I loved that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the <b>real</b> <b>deal.</b> They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.|$|E
500|$|Betrayal {{received}} mixed-to-positive reception, including {{praise for}} its {{fidelity to the}} series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics.

500|$|Special effects makeup {{designer}} David White took {{head and}} body casts of actors, such as Bautista, {{to experiment with}} materials used to create the characters. White said, [...] "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the <b>real</b> <b>deal</b> there on set." [...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E
