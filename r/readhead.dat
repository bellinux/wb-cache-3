5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which {{made it difficult for}} him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph <b>Readhead,</b> who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E

25|$|Wandle had {{not only}} lost her bow; what {{remained}} of her was now badly twisted. <b>Readheads</b> straightened her, built a new bow onto her and on either 30 March or 8 April 1943 {{she was ready to}} return to service.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic linear {{encoders}} employ either active (magnetized) or passive (variable reluctance) {{scales and}} position may be sensed using sense-coils, Hall effect or magnetoresistive <b>readheads.</b> With coarser scale periods than optical encoders (typically {{a few hundred}} micrometers to several millimeters) resolutions {{in the order of}} a micrometer are the norm.|$|R
25|$|All {{three were}} {{on the north side}} of River Tyne. The company also owned the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, the yard that built the engines for the Mauretania, from 1903 until the 1980s. At various times Swan Hunter also owned Palmers Hebburn Yard, Hawthorn Leslie Hebburn Yard and <b>Readheads</b> at South Shields which were all on the south side of the River Tyne.|$|R

25|$|The last shipbuilder, John <b>Readhead</b> & Sons, {{closed in}} 1984 {{and the last}} pit, Westoe Colliery, in 1993. Today, the town relies largely on service industries, whilst many {{residents}} commute to work in nearby Newcastle, Gateshead, North Tyneside and Sunderland.|$|E
50|$|Distance coded {{reference}} marks (DCRM) are placed onto the scale {{in a unique}} pattern allowing a minimal movement (typically moving past two {{reference marks}}) to define the <b>readhead's</b> position. Multiple, equally spaced reference marks may also be placed onto the scale such that following installation, the desired marker can either be selected - usually via a magnet or optically or unwanted ones deselected using labels or by being painted over.|$|R
50|$|The Wallsend Club {{of today}} came about {{due to the}} Swan Hunter Recreation Ground being given up during the great {{amalgamation}} of Swan’s, Vicker’s, Hawthorn Leslie’s and <b>Readhead’s</b> into “British Shipbuilders”. Fortunately, the Sports Centre at Bigge’s Maine had been opened and we were invited to move “lock, stock & goalposts” providing we changed our name to “Wallsend RFC” and our colours to Green & Gold. So we left behind “the Hut” and the communal concrete bath for our new home in 1969. The metamorphosis from “Swan’s in blue” to “Eagles in green” was not easy. We’d been our own masters with virtually no outside interference, but at the Sports centre we were just another section and difficulties arose with regard to changing room availability and pitch condition control; plus {{the fact that we}} no longer had our own income, but now had fees and charges imposed upon us.|$|R

25|$|Phillip {{remained}} at the Greenwich School {{for two and a}} half years, considerably longer than the average student stay of twelve months. At the end of 1753 he was granted a seven-year indenture as an apprentice aboard Fortune, a 210-ton whaling boat commanded by merchant mariner Wiliam <b>Readhead.</b> He left the Greenwich School on 1 December and spent the winter aboard Fortune awaiting the commencement of the 1754 whaling season.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, coal mining, {{alkaline}} {{production and}} glass making {{led to a}} boom in the town. The population increased from 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the 1860s, bolstered by economic migration from Ireland, Scotland {{and other parts of}} England. These industries played a fundamental part in creating wealth both regionally and nationally. In 1832, with the Great Reform Act, South Shields and Gateshead were each given their own Member of Parliament and became boroughs, resulting in taxes being paid to the Government instead of the Bishops of Durham. However, the rapid growth in population brought on by the expansion of industry made sanitation a problem, as evident by Cholera outbreaks and the building of the now-listed Cleadon Water Tower to combat the problem. In the 1850s 'The Tyne Improvement Commission' began to develop the river, dredging it to make it deeper and building the large, impressive North and South Piers to help prevent silt build up within the channel. Shipbuilding (along with coal mining), previously a monopoly of the Freemen of Newcastle, became another prominent industry in the town, with John <b>Readhead</b> & Sons Shipyard the largest.|$|E

2500|$|An Admiralty {{salvage officer}} came aboard and cut away several hundred tons of wreckage. This {{relieved}} {{the strain on}} her bulkhead, which was then patched and shored up with heavy timbers. She was towed into Yarmouth {{for a few hours}} but was then towed north again by two tugs. A northerly gale arose and swung her about violently, and she was often awash. The tugs and Wandle sheltered in the Humber to escape heavy seas and in a bay to wait for fog to pass. On the fifth day after being torpedoed, Wandle finally reached the River Tyne. On 5 December she was dry-docked at John <b>Readhead</b> & Sons' shipyard in South Shields. During this whole period of salvage and towing, the volunteer crew led by Captain George Mastin, Mate Edward Clarke and Engineer [...] "Stanley" [...] Johnson, remained with the Wandle, until she was safely docked at Redheads, to ensure no salvage claims were made on the owners.|$|E
