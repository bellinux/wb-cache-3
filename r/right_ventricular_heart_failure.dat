40|$|SummaryA 19 -year-old male was {{admitted}} to the emergency room of our hospital after a motor vehicle accident. During his first physical examination, a holosystolic murmur was heard at the fourth left parasternal border. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe tricuspid insufficiency, but the cause of tricuspid insufficiency was unclear. Therefore, three-dimensional echocardiography was performed and demonstrated flail anterior, posterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve. The diagnosis was tricuspid insufficiency due to papillary muscle rupture secondary to chest blunt trauma. Surgical repair of the tricuspid valve was performed in this patient. After surgery, the signs and symptoms of <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> were relieved.

40|$|Background— Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is {{an inherited}} disorder that causes sudden death and <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in the young.

Genetically, loss-of-function mutations in desmosomal proteins (plakophilin, desmoplakin, or plakoglobin) {{have been associated with}} ARVC. To test the hypothesis that reduced desmosomal protein expression causes ARVC, we studied the cardiac effects of heterozygous plakoglobin deficiency in mice. Methods and Results— Ten-month-old heterozygous plakoglobin-deficient mice (plakoglobin+/–) had increased right ventricular volume, reduced right ventricular function, and spontaneous ventricular ectopy (all P< 0. 05). Left ventricular size and function were not altered. Isolated, perfused plakoglobin+/– hearts had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia of right ventricular origin and prolonged right ventricular conduction times compared with wild-type hearts. Endurance training accelerated the development of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias in plakoglobin+/– mice. Histology and electron microscopy did not identify right ventricular abnormalities in affected animals. Conclusions— Heterozygous plakoglobin deficiency provokes ARVC.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSustained <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> (RV) apical pacing {{may lead}} to {{deterioration}} in ventricular function and {{an increased risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> especially in patients with pre-existing systolic dysfunction. The BLOCK HF (Biventricular Versus <b>Right</b> <b>Ventricular</b> Pacing in <b>Heart</b> <b>Failure</b> Patients With Atrioventricular Block) trial demonstrated that biventricular-paced patients had a reduced incidence of a composite endpoint of death, heart failure–related urgent care, and adverse left ventricular remodeling. ObjectivesIn a pre-specified analysis, this study examined clinical outcomes, including clinical composite score, quality of life (QOL), and change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification. MethodsThe BLOCK HF trial randomized patients with atrioventricular block, NYHA symptom class I to III <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> and left <b>ventricular</b> ejection fraction ≤ 50 % to biventricular or RV pacing. NYHA functional classification, QOL, and clinical composite score were assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Bayesian statistical methods were used, with the pre-specified metric of benefit being a posterior probability ≥ 0. 95. ResultsPatients with biventricular pacing showed greater improvement in NYHA functional class at 12 months, with 19 % improved, 61 % unchanged, and 17 % worsened, compared with 12 %/ 62 %/ 23 % in the RV arm. QOL was improved through 12 months. At 6 months, clinical composite score was improved/unchanged/worsened in 53 %/ 24 %/ 24 % in the biventricular arm compared with 39 %/ 33 %/ 28 % in the RV arm. This improvement in clinical composite score was sustained through 24 months.

Two groups were studied: MCT-treated rats (MCT-rats), and age-matched controls (CON-rats). Serial echocardiography and in vivo 67 -Gallium (Ga- 67) scintigraphy were performed. Local inflammation in the RV was assessed by (i) ex vivo semi-quantitative Ga- 67 autoradiography, (ii) immunohistochemistry of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker of neutrophil activity, and (iii) mRNA assays of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In MCT-rats, Ga- 67 scintigraphy showed increased myocardial uptake which started during the early stages of RV disease. Ga- 67 autoradiography revealed that this increased Ga- 67 uptake occurred in the RV and inter-ventricular septum, but not in the LV. The stage-dependent increases of in vivo Ga- 67 RV myocardial uptake were paralleled by increases in mRNA gene expression for TNF-alpha in RV, and increased MPO staining in RV.

Al-though the incidence of pulmonary hypertension of all causes has not been reported, the annual incidence of a rare form, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH), is esti-mated to be 1 – 2 per million of the population. 5 A variety of commercially available vasodilators {{have been used as}} monotherapy or in combination to treat pul-monary hypertension. 2, 4 - 9 Since many of these agents are costly, toxic, inconvenient to administer, or partially effec-tive or ineffective in certain patients, other agents have been investigated for pulmonary hypertension. 2, 4, 6 - 9 Recently, sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, has been investigated for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in both pediatric and adult patients. 4, 6, 8, 10 - 16 The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in predomi-nantly adult patients with pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|AbstractAimsIn {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (PAH), increases in endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance which ultimately causes death by <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> (RV) <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> ET antagonists are effective in treating PAH but lack efficacy in treating left <b>ventricular</b> (LV) <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> where ETA receptors are significantly increased. The aim was to quantify the density of ETA and ETB receptors in cardiopulmonary tissue from PAH patients and the monocrotaline (MCT) rat, which recapitulates some of the pathophysiological features, including increased RV pressure. Main methodsRadioligand binding assays were used to quantify affinity, density and ratio of ET receptors. Key findingsIn RV from human PAH hearts, {{there was a significant}} increase in the ratio of ETA to ETB receptors compared with normal hearts. In the RV of the MCT rat, the ratio also changed but was reversed. In both human and rat, there was no change in LV. In human PAH lungs, ETA receptors were significantly increased in the medial layer of small pulmonary arteries with no change detectable in MCT rat vessels. SignificanceCurrent treatments for PAH focus mainly on pulmonary vasodilatation. The increase in ETA receptors in arteries provides a mechanism for the beneficial vasodilator actions of ET antagonists. The increase in the ratio of ETA in RV also implicates changes to ET signalling although it is unclear if ET antagonism is beneficial but the results emphasise the unexploited potential for therapies that target the RV, to improve survival in patients with PAH...|$|R

However, {{it is still}} unknown whether these changes are only the consequence of heart failure decompensation or can also predict development thereof. Objectives were to verify if simple, non-invasive autonomic parameters, such as baroreflex sensitivity and short-term heart rate variability can provide independent of other well-known clinical parameters information on {{the risk of heart}} failure decompensation in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In 142 stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40 %, baroreflex sensitivity and short-term heart rate variability, as well as other well-known clinical parameters, were analyzed. During 23 ± 9 months of follow-up 19 patients were hospitalized due to the heart failure decompensation (EVENT). Pre-specified cut-off values of baroreflex sensitivity (≤ 2. 4 ms/mmHg) and low frequency power index of heart rate variability (≤ 19 ms 2) were significantly associated with the EVENTs (hazard ratio 4. 43, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 35 - 14. 54 and 5. 41, 95 % CI 1. 87 - 15. 65 respectively). EVENTs were also associated with other parameters, such as left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class, diuretic use, renal function, brain natriuretic peptide and hemoglobin level, left atrial size, left and <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> signs. After adjusting baroreflex sensitivity and low frequency power index for each of the abovementioned parameters, autonomic parameters were still significant predictors of hospitalization due to the heart failure decompensation.

30|$|Furthermore, {{alterations}} in {{left and right}} ventricular surface area as well as regional {{alterations in}} RV surface area are shown. The increase in LV surface area during ventricular contraction after an initial decrease could result from wall motion abnormalities due to the acute open-chest experimental setup and is not in line with other studies which describe a continuous decrease of LV surface area during systole (Ourselin et al. 2013). The decrease in total surface area of right and left ventricle occurred simultaneously in this case study. The investigation of temporal time patterns between left and right ventricular contraction is important, since an asynchrony has been described to aggravate valve dysfunction or cardiomyopathy (Bordachar et al. 2003). This experimental method would allow for the detailed assessment of changes in synchrony between right and left ventricular contraction in several diseased settings or {{of the effects of}} a cardiac resynchronization therapy. Furthermore we found a greater reduction of the total right ventricular surface area than of the left ventricular surface area. Left ventricular systolic output (i.e. decrease in left ventricular volume) is mainly driven by wall thickening and left ventricular torsion (Ennis et al. 2009; Rodriguez et al. 2004). Since the right ventricular myocardium is significantly thinner than that of the left ventricle, a decrease in epicardial surface area could be of a greater importance than wall thickening, which also suggests fundamentally different myocardial contraction mechanisms between left and right ventricle. In addition, we found regional heterogeneities with respect to alterations in right ventricular surface area. A better understanding of physiological right ventricular contraction patterns or of changes in regional contraction in the case of <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> could help to improve therapies targeting a mechanical support of the right ventricle.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Patients {{with severe}} heart failure are {{candidates}} for LVAD implantation. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction {{is related to}} abnormal ventricular region (AVR) extension that could be affected by systolic abnormalities, diastolic abnormalities and electro-mechanical dissynchrony. The aim of this work is to study the effect of an AVR on hemodynamics during LVAD assistance. Methods: A lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system was updated. Circulatory sections are described by Windkessel models. Atria, ventricular free walls and interventricular septum are described by variable elastance models driven by ECG times. LV free wall is represented by two variable elastance models to simulate an AVR. A model of parallel continuous flow LVAD was also implemented. Starting from a simulated pathological condition, the effect of LVAD on hemodynamics was studied changing: 1) AVR systolic elastance, 2) AVR diastolic elastance 3) the contraction delay between the {{two parts of the}} LV free wall and 4) AVR extension. Results: All experiments compare the relative changes between pathological and assisted conditions giving their mean values. The variable that is more influenced by AVR changing is the external work. The presence of an AVR dissynchrony (0 ? 150 ms) influences mean aortic pressure (+ 10 %). The changing of AVR systolic function (0. 1 ? 1 mmHg/mL) affects both LV end systolic volume (+ 6 %) and cardiac output (+ 12 %), while the changing of AVR diastolic function (0. 01 ? 0. 2 mmHg/mL) affects left atrial pressure (- 19 %) and LV end diastolic volume (- 14 %). The presence of an AVR diastolic dysfunction could expedite the occurrence of <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> This fact is more evident if a diastolic septum dysfunction occurs together with a moderate AVR diastolic dysfunction. Conclusions: The model could be useful to estimate the role of different parameters on LVAD performance and could be used to support the clinical decision adapting the LVAD assistance to specific patient conditions...|$|E
40|$|Acute <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> (RV) {{failure is}} a serious {{clinical}} challenge not only in cardiology intensive care but in adult critical care in general. It is relat-ed not only to left ventricular failure but also {{to a number of}} other causes of pulmonary vascular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (PH), for example, PH due to hypoxia, thromboembolism, mechanical ventila-tion or portopulmonary hypertension. Acute RV failure is often difficult to manage and it is associated with a worse prognosis. Mortality from cardiogenic shock due to RV infarction (> 50 %) exceeds that due to left ventricular disease. Acute RV failure is also related to increased mortality after surgical procedures. The general principles of management include pre-load optimization, increase in RV inotropy and after-load reduction by lowering pulmonary vascular resistance. This review focuses on the principles of RV failure management including general measures, vasoac-tive substances, ventilation strategies, surgical as well as mechanical ap-proaches.

40|$|Chronic hypoxia induces {{pulmonary}} vascular remodeling, {{leading to}} pulmonary hypertension, <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, and <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Heterozygous deficiency of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha), which mediates the cellular response to hypoxia by increasing expression of genes involved in erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, {{has been previously}} shown to delay hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. HIF- 2 alpha is a homologue of HIF- 1 alpha and is abundantly expressed in the lung, but its role in pulmonary hypertension remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the pulmonary response of WT and viable heterozygous HIF- 2 alpha-deficient (Hif 2 alpha(+/-)) mice after exposure to 10 % O(2) for 4 weeks. In contrast to WT mice, Hif 2 alpha(+/-) mice were fully protected against pulmonary hypertension and <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, unveiling a critical role of HIF- 2 alpha in hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary expression levels of endothelin- 1 and plasma catecholamine levels were increased threefold and 12 -fold respectively in WT but not in Hif 2 alpha(+/-) mice after hypoxia, suggesting that HIF- 2 alpha-mediated upregulation of these vasoconstrictors contributes {{to the development of}} hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of chronic <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> (RV) pacing were first demonstrated 10 {{years ago when}} the DAVID trial clearly demonstrated the hazards of unnecessary RV pacing- including worsening left ventricular (LV) function, increased <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> hospitalization and increased mortality. 1 This finding was confirmed in other studies, 2 prompting the development of various device algorithms to ensure that periods of RV pacing are kept at an absolute minimum, with the ultimate aim of preserving LV function. More recently, the 2012 AHA/ACC/HRS and the 2013 ESC/EHRA practice guidelines recommended de novo cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients who had indications for permanent pacing with underlying severe LV dysfunction. 3, 4 It is unknown whether receiving a biventricular (BiV) pacing device {{at the time of the}} initial implant – rather than a standard pacemaker – would help preserve LV function in patients with milder degrees of LV systolic dysfunction and a conventional indication for anti-bradycardia pacing.

MethodsWe reviewed data from 116 stable patients referred to the French pulmonary hypertension referral center. All patients had right heart catheterization with mean pulmonary pressure (mPAP) > 25 mmHg, with pulmonary wedge pressure 3 WU. On echo-cardiography, severity of TR was determined from 2 -dimensional and Doppler color flow image in the apical 4 -chamber view. Patients were divided in two groups according to the severity of TR (TR<grade 3 and TR≥grade 3). Results 37 (32 %) patients have TR grade≥ 3. Compared with patients TR<grade 3, no difference were observed in gender, NYHA class, and 6 -minute walk distance. On RCH, both groups had similar mPAP, cardiac index, right atrial mean pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. On echocardiography, Patients with TR grade≥ 3 have higher right atrial volume (57 (45 - 70) vs 36 (32 - 40) mL/m 2, p< 0. 001), higher end-diastolic right ventricular area (16 (14 - 17) vs 14 (13 - 15) cm 2 /m 2, p= 0. 04), higher end-systolic right ventricular area (12 (10 - 14) vs 10 (9 - 11) cm 2 /m 2, p= 0. 01), and higher BNP level (248 (141 - 355) vs 102 (59 - 144) pg/mL, p= 0. 003). There were no difference in tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion nor in tricuspid S’ velocity. During a median follow up of 17 months, death or ARVHF was observed in 14 % of patients with TR grade≥ 3 and 7 % of patients with TR grade< 3 with no statistical difference. ConclusionPPH patients with TR grade≥ 3 have higher right atrial volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic right ventricular area and BNP level compared with patients with TR<grade 3.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) {{is a rare}} but disabling disorder, characterised by raised {{pulmonary artery}} pressure leading to <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> progressive disability and death. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a distinct category of PH, is {{a condition in which}} the initiating event is either overt or occult pulmonary embolism (PE). It is believed that the persistence of thrombus is a prerequisite for the development of PH following PE. It was hypothesised that defective fibrinolysis {{on the surface of the}} pulmonary endothelium causes progression from PE to CTEPH. Thrombin generation and fibrinolysis were assayed in parallel on endothelial cells using exogenous tissue factor or TNF-α stimulation. Thrombin generation was measured using a modified calibrated automated thrombogram assay (CAT). Fibrinolysis was measured using a turbidometric assay. Assays were established first on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The study of patient’s endothelium is complicated by the difficulty in accessing tissue. Using a recently developed technique, blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) were isolated from the mononuclear fraction of peripheral blood from patients with CTEPH and controls. Discrete colonies of BOECs appeared between days 7 - 21 in culture. Cells were passaged to obtain confluent BOEC monolayers with characteristic endothelial cobblestone morphology. Endothelial identity was confirmed using immunofluorescence with a range of endothelial markers including VWF and VE-Cadherin. BOECs were successfully isolated from patients with CTEPH and healthy controls in order to evaluate thrombin generation and fibrinolysis using the assays developed on HUVECs. No difference in thrombin generation was observed but surprisingly shorter clot lysis times were shown on BOECs from CTEPH patients as compared to controls. In order to determine the cause of the paradoxical increase in fibrinolysis, mRNA expression of a panel of candidate genes was performed using RT-PCR array analysis. Differences in gene expression were seen between CTEPH and healthy control BOECs. Statistically significant results included an increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 and fibronectin expression with a decrease in VEGF receptor 2 expression. Other genes implicated in the pathogenesis of PH and CTEPH for example endothelin receptor A, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 also showed altered expression and therefore further studies with larger numbers are required to confirm these findings.

40|$|AbstractBackground Mitral {{regurgitation}} (MR) {{has many}} etiologies; {{the most common}} is degenerative disease. If not corrected, severe MR may cause left and <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>failure.</b> Mitral valve (MV) repair is {{the gold standard for}} treatment of MR. All repair techniques include MV annuloplasty, but various techniques are employed to repair the valvular apparatus. The classical technique of leaflet resection is associated with excellent results, but repair using artificial chordae is gaining popularity and has been shown to achieve similar results. Aims (1) Does MV repair with artificial chordae correct the morphology and function of the MV better than leaflet resection? (2) How common are MR at rest and systolic anterior motion (SAM) when these techniques are comparedat rest and during physical exercise? (3) To what extent is the right ventricular function restored in patients with chronic MR after MV repair? (4) Is MV repair preferable for the surgical treatment of MV infective endocarditis?Methods Study I: Retrospective study conducted in two centers that compares the results of MV repair using two different surgical techniques. Studies II and III: Prospective studies of resting and exercise echocardiography in patients that had undergone MV repair with either artificial chordae or leaflet resection. Study III compares the hemodynamics and left ventricularfunction of the repaired MV. Study IV evaluates the right ventricular function at rest and during exercise. IV: Retrospective study of long term outcomes of patients with MV infective endocarditis (IE) who underwent surgical repair in Lund with different surgical techniques. Results and importanceI: Both evaluated techniques for repair the MV were associated with good long-term survival and low incidence of recurrent MR, reoperation, IE and thromboembolism. No significant differences were detected between the groups. II: Both surgical techniques were associated with low pressure gradients over the MV at rest and during exercise without any significant difference between the groups. The left ventricular function was well preserved and both groups had good exercise capacity. III: At follow up, patients who underwent mitral valve repair had significantly worse RV function at rest and peak exercise than did healthy individuals. IV: Mortality following surgery for mitral IE is high. Independent predictors of poor outcome are the preoperative symptoms of persisting fever, clinical stroke and heart failure and infection with S. aureus, diabetes mellitus, renalfailure and age. The surgical method (i. e. repair or prosthesis implantation) did not influence survival of IE...|$|E
40|$|Lumped {{parameter}} {{models have}} been employed for decades to simulate important hemodynamic couplings between a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the native circulation. However, these studies seldom consider the pathological descending limb of the Frank-Starling response of the overloaded ventricle. This study introduces a dilated <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> model featuring a unimodal end systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) to address this critical shortcoming. The resulting hemodynamic response to mechanical circulatory support are illustrated through numerical simulations of a rotodynamic, continuous flow ventricular assist device (cfVAD) coupled to systemic and pulmonary circulations with baroreflex control. The model further incorporated septal interaction to capture the influence of left ventricular (LV) unloading on <b>right</b> <b>ventricular</b> function. Four <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> conditions were simulated (LV and bi-ventricular failure with/ without pulmonary hypertension) in addition to normal baseline. Several metrics of LV function, including cardiac output and stroke work, exhibited a unimodal response whereby initial unloading improved function, and further unloading depleted preload reserve thereby reducing ventricular output. The concept of extremal loading was introduced to reflect the loading condition in which the intrinsic LV stroke work is maximized. Simulation of bi-ventricular failure with pulmonary hypertension revealed inadequacy of LV support alone. These simulations motivate the implementation of an extremu...|$|R
