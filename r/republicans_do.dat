500|$|The news of {{her death}} {{produced}} sincere mourning in Brazil. The Brazilian poet and journalist Artur Azevedo wrote of the general view toward Teresa Cristina after her death: [...] "I never spoke to her, but also never passed her without respectifuly removing my hat and bowing myself, not to the Empress, but to the sweet and honest figure of a poor, almost humble, bourgeoise. I saw many extremist <b>republicans</b> <b>do</b> the same." [...] He continued: [...] "They called her {{the mother of the}} Brazilians, and we all really attributed to her a kind of a filial veneration. That is the truth." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{exceedingly}} desirable that {{all parts of}} this great confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with another. Let us <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> our part to have it so. Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill-temper. Even though the Southern people will {{not so much as}} listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them.|$|E

50|$|An ABC News-Washington Post poll {{conducted}} August 13-17, 2009 found that 78% of conservative Republicans think {{the war is}} worth fighting, while 22% of liberal Democrats do. 65% of conservative Republicans also think that the U.S. is winning the war. 64% of liberal Democrats want the number of U.S. troopsto be reduced, while 22% of conservative <b>Republicans</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
50|$|Historically, Onondaga County was a Republican stronghold. The GOP {{carried the}} county {{in all but}} one presidential {{election}} from 1952 to 1988. However, it has become friendlier to Democrats in recent years; it has gone Democratic in every presidential election since 1992. At the state and local level, however, it is more of a swing county. Generally, Democratic strength is concentrated in Syracuse itself, while <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> well in the suburbs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{not get a}} delay on {{the medical}} device tax, a {{concession}} they wanted that had {{been included in the}} Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 (H.J.Res 59). [...] <b>Republicans</b> also <b>did</b> not get a limitation on the U.S. Treasury Department's ability to enact [...] "emergency measures" [...] to avoid default once a debt ceiling limit is reached.|$|R

25|$|On January 28, 2009, the House {{passed the}} bill by a 244–188 vote. All but 11 Democrats {{voted for the}} bill, and 177 Republicans voted against it (one <b>Republican</b> <b>did</b> not vote).|$|R
50|$|Oregon's {{politics}} are largely {{divided by the}} Cascade Mountains, with much of western Oregon leaning Democratic and eastern Oregon leaning Republican. <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> have some strongholds {{in the western part}} of the state, however, such as Linn County, where the Republican presidential candidate has won in every election since 1980. Southern Oregon is also a Republican stronghold, except in Jackson County, which frequently votes for both Republican and Democratic candidates.|$|E
50|$|The CBS News poll {{conducted}} July 9-12, 2010 also reported the strong partisan divide over the war. The 73% majority of Democrats want a timetable set for withdrawal, {{while the majority}} 66% of <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> not. The nearly-three-quarters majority, 74%, of Democrats want most U.S. troops to be withdrawn {{within a year or}} two, while a majority 52% of Republicans want them to stay longer than another two years.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the state}} {{legislature}} is overwhelmingly Democratic, and has been since the early 2000s. As of December 2016, there are over 860,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. Democrats {{do well in the}} populous counties closer to New York City and Philadelphia, like Essex and Camden counties as well as in Mercer County, which has the state capital Trenton. <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> well along the Jersey Shore and in northwestern counties, like Morris and Hunterdon.|$|E
50|$|Olin won {{his first}} term in 2006 when he {{defeated}} Republican DelRay Flom, an agricultural businessman, {{by a margin of}} 54% to 46%. Incumbent Rep. Maxine Penas, a <b>Republican,</b> <b>did</b> not seek re-election.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not run any {{candidates}} for Congress in 1892. The new People's Party {{made its first}} appearance in Florida's congressional elections this year. Robert Bullock (D) of the [...] did not run for renomination.|$|R
50|$|The Anti-Masonic state {{convention}} met in August 1830 at Utica, and nominated Assemblyman Francis Granger for governor, and Samuel Stevens, of New York City, for lieutenant governor. The National <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{not call}} a convention, {{and supported the}} Anti-Masonic ticket.|$|R
50|$|Existing {{organizations}} and conservative political groups are disposed to keep renewable energy proposals {{out of the}} agenda at many levels. Most <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> not support renewable energy investment because their framework is built on staying with current energy sources while promoting national drilling to reduce dependence on imports. In contrast, progressives and libertarians tend to support renewable energy by encouraging job growth, national investment and tax incentives. Thus, polarized organizational frameworks that shape industrial and governmental policies for renewable energy tend to create barriers for implementing renewable energy.|$|E
50|$|In Northern Ireland, Remembrance Sunday {{has tended}} to be {{associated}} with the unionist community. Most Irish nationalists and <b>republicans</b> <b>do</b> not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers. However, some moderate nationalists have attended Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The IRA said it had made a mistake and had been targeting soldiers parading to the war memorial.|$|E
50|$|Those who {{identify}} with the Democratic Party have more favorable opinions of women in leadership positions, both within government and business. The Democratic Party is also the predominant party of elected female officials. Women in the Democratic party are strong proponents of female political leaders, more so than Democratic men or Republican women. Democrats as a whole are {{significantly more likely to}} say women do better job in terms of political leadership qualities than Republicans. <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily favor men, but are likely to say there isn’t a difference between men and women.|$|E
6000|$|The old <b>republican</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} in saints, or in prayers, or in what he called [...] "priest's religion." [...] Liberty and Garibaldi were his divinities; but he tolerated [...] "superstition" [...] in women, {{preserving}} in these matters a lofty and silent attitude.|$|R
50|$|Hahn {{resigned}} as governor in March 1865, and {{was elected by}} the state legislature to the U.S. Senate in 1865. However, Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not seat him, as they believed the state had {{more work to do}} before being allowed to rejoin the Union.|$|R
50|$|In the ABC News - Washington Post poll {{conducted}} October 15-18, 2009, the majority 60% of Democrats opposed sending any more U.S. troops, {{while the majority}} 69% of Republicans favored sending more troops. 36% of Democrats felt the war was worth fighting, while 71% of <b>Republicans</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Despite DiNapoli's {{relatively}} narrow win in 2010, <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> {{not believe}} that he is vulnerable because [...] "Comptrollers seem to get re-elected {{as long as they do}} their jobs." [...] They are instead concentrating their efforts on defeating Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, citing numerous reasons, including the fact that DiNapoli comes from Nassau County, as opposed to Schneiderman, who comes from the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Republicans initially found it extremely difficult to find even a dummy candidate to fill the ballot line, with the Conservative Party saying it would nominate its own candidate if the Republicans didn't find someone. Onondaga County Comptroller Robert Antonacci stepped forward for the Republicans in May 2014.|$|E

50|$|McClendon rarely faced serious opposition. <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{not even}} contest her heavily Democrat seat in 2014, when the party won 98 of the 150 state House seats. In her last {{legislative}} race, McClendon defeated a Libertarian Party opponent, Gilberto Villela, 16,892 (82.3 percent) to his 3,637 (17.7 percent).|$|R
50|$|Peter Welch, a Democrat {{representing}} Vermont's sole congressional district, became {{both the}} Democratic and Republican nominee for the House {{when he ran}} for re-election in 2008. Because the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field any candidate on the primary ballot, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.|$|R
50|$|Remembrance Day {{is officially}} {{observed}} in Northern Ireland {{in the same}} way as in Great Britain. However, it has tended to be associated with the unionist community. Most Irish nationalists and <b>republicans</b> <b>do</b> not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers. This is mainly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. However, some moderate nationalists began to attend Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing eleven people. The IRA said it had made a mistake and had been targeting soldiers parading to the war memorial. The bombing was widely condemned and attendance at Remembrance events, by both nationalists and unionists, rose in the following years. The Republic of Ireland has a National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who have died in war.|$|E
5000|$|After the battle, the Vendean army melted away, as if, one chronicler wrote, [...] "into thin air." [...] Yet, within days, {{as many as}} 35,000 men {{gathered}} at Chatillon, and moved toward Fontenay. Under the command of Charles de Bonchamps, they withstood an hour-long cannonade and sustained musketry fire; not until Louis Marie de Lescure advanced {{to the head of}} his column did the insurgent army move forward. Reportedly, Lescure, who had given his men the command to attack, saw them waver and hang back. Alone he advanced, waved his hat, and shouted (reportedly) Vive le Roi! (Long live the king!) The Republicans showered him with bullets, but he was unwounded. Turning, he shouted to his men, [...] "The Blues (<b>republicans)</b> <b>do</b> not know how to shoot." [...] The insurgents rushed forward and took the city. [...] The general advance of the insurgents, who had little ammunition and few weapons, caused disorder among the Republican troops; they fled. The insurgents recaptured their cannon, a symbol of their unity, and acquired, in the process, stores of grain and weapons.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to monarchist arguments, those against the Crown assert {{that it is}} possible to have an elected head of state be an apolitical individual and there would be no possibility of a clash with the prime minister over differences in political persuasion, though some <b>republicans</b> <b>do</b> desire an empowered chief executive who could hold the Cabinet in check for political reasons. Others feel an appointed Canadian president would be more democratic than the Crown. The range of often contradictory proposals highlights the fact that Canadian republicans are not fully united on what sort of republican form of government they believe the nation should adopt. The Westminster-style parliamentary republican model, which is advocated by other Commonwealth republican movements, has been embraced by Citizens for a Canadian Republic as the preferred model for Canada. The truth is that the monarchy stands for much that has held Canada back. It embodies the triumph of inheritance over merit, of blood over brains, of mindless ritual over innovation. The monarchy reminds us to defer to authority and remember our place. In Quebec, the Royals are regarded as an insult. Margaret Wente, 2001 ...|$|E
