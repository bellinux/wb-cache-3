Using public accounting practitioners as participants, this {{study examines}} users ’ perceptions of different <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> used in disseminating financial information. This study includes examining the link between users ’ perceptions and preferred reporting format and whether these perceptions {{are similar to the}} quality of their decision in the completion of a specific task. This study follows Davis (1989, p. 320) who defined perceptions into 2 : perceived usefulness as “the degree a user believes that a particular aid would enhance his performance ” and perceived ease of use as “the degree to which a user believes that using a particular aid would reduce or be free of effort”. The results indicate that users ’ perceptions of usefulness among the digital <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> differ significantly. However, perceptions of ease of use are similar across the three digital <b>reporting</b> <b>formats.</b> Users ’ perceptions are also found to influence their preferred reporting format. The findings also show that users ’ perceptions of usefulness are analogous to their decision accuracy for HTML and XBRL formats but not for PDF format. Perceptions of ease of use, however, do not correspond to actual cognitive effort for all <b>reporting</b> <b>formats.</b> The results indicate that if more advanced forms of digita...|$|E

40|$|Three studies {{involving}} 3 participant samples (Ns 39, 55, and 53) {{tested the}} hypothesis that people retrieve episodic emotion knowledge when reporting on their emotions over short (e. g., last few hours) time frames, but that they retrieve semantic emotion knowledge when reporting on their emotions over long (e. g., last few months) time frames. Support for 2 distinct judgment strategies was based on judgment latencies (Studies 1 and 2) and priming paradigms (Studies 2 and 3). The authors suggest that self-reports of emotion over short versus long time frames assess qualitatively different sources of self-knowledge. People are commonly asked by psychologists to report on emo-tions {{that they are not}} currently feeling. Retrospective <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> ask people to characterize their emotions in the past, aggregated <b>reporting</b> <b>formats</b> ask them to characterize their emo-tions over a specific time interval, and generalized reporting for-mats ask them to characterize their emotions in general. Regardless of the time frame used, participants seem to have little trouble giving reliable and (to a certain extent) valid emotion ratings. O...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the first version}} of a <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> for modelling studies which is based on a general <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> by our taskforce, which was published in the previous issue of this journal. The use of decision-analytical models for economic evaluations is increasing because, in practice, it is not always possible to derive information from prospective studies. However, the acceptance of modelling studies is generally lower than prospective studies {{not only because of the}} use of secondary data, but also because the reports of modelling studies do not always have sufficient transparency. Hence, a standardised <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> may improve the transparency and, consequently, the acceptance of modelling studies. This {{article presents}} an example of a <b>reporting</b> <b>format</b> for economic evaluation based on modelling studies, which may facilitate the development of future guidelines for modelling studies. The format consists of a number of headings, which are followed by a brief recommendation on the content. This format does not deal with methodology and data management, but especially addresses validation and quality assurance, which may increase the transparency of the report.

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} much {{advancement}} in GPS receiver technology in recent years. GPS accuracy, especially the dynamic (moving) accuracy, {{is very important in}} precision agriculture for collecting data and controlling variable rate inputs. Typical applications of GPS receivers in agriculture include yield monitoring, parallel tracking and variable-rate application of fertilizer. Perhaps more important is the relevance of existing tests (primarily static tests), and the inability to compare receivers because of a variety of <b>reporting</b> <b>formats.</b> This project evaluated several different receivers. Test results showed that different performance reporting techniques make it difficult to evaluate and compare the performance of receivers. Also, the static performance of receivers was not indicative of dynamic performance. A proposed framework for a dynamic test standard for agricultural GPS receivers is presented...|$|E

Further, {{assessment of}} children 2 ̆ 7 s mathematical skills at this level has been infrequent compared to social, emotional and physical assessments. However, there are contexts where reliable, valid, standardised data from assessment in mathematics are required. This paper outlines the development of two assessment tools for mathematics that were originally developed for such contexts. Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses enabled the construction of assessment forms that address the range of abilities of 4 - to 8 -year-old children, and provided the scales used for constructing formative and summative reports of achievement.

For those {{who did not want to}} report precise amounts, there was the option of reporting in broad categories. Both respondents on salary and those who were self-employed were included. Given the range of <b>reporting</b> <b>formats,</b> a great deal of work (transformations) was done to place the responses on a common scale. Ultimately, estimated monthly earnings for salaried workers (including bonuses) and for the self-employed were calculated, combined and then converted to annual earnings.
