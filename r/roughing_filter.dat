40|$|Slow sand {{filtration}} {{is a method}} of water purification by means of percolating water through a column of fine granulated sediment {{and in some cases}} a layer of biological growth at the sand/water interface called the schmutzdecke. A series of nine slow sand filters (six of which were operational) were each connected to a main flow pipe which was attached to a <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> filled with gravel to remove solid waste from the untreated water. Raw untreated water was shunted through the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> and then through each of the six operational slow sand filters for a period of roughly four months. The data indicate that there was a significantly greater amount of total coliforms including Escherichia coli present in the raw untreated reservoir water compared to the treated effluent water filtered by each of the six slow sand filters. However, because there was no observable schmutzdecke growth (studies show that the schmutzdecke aids in the removal of coliforms from untreated water (Weber-Shirk, Chan 2006)) in any of the slow sand filters, the significant removal of coliforms and E. coli from the raw untreated water must therefore be attributed to the kinetic adhesion of the bacterial cells to the sand particulates and the microscopic holes and divots located on sand particles. The three cleaning methods that were applied to the slow sand filters were harrowing, scraping and fabric application; however, {{there was no significant difference}} among the cleaning methods pertaining to the amount of coliforms present in their respective filtered water. Furthermore, the data suggest that there is no correlation between the influent flow rate (ml/s) of water into the slow sand filters and the prevalence of total coliforms including E. coli in the treated effluent water. ...|$|E

30|$|Deblocking filter {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as a loop filter is the final stage of the decoding process. DF subfunction reduces the blocking effect that is introduced by encoding the process at block boundaries. Comparatively high complexity of the subfunction is in consensus. Even after a tremendous effort in speed optimization of the filtering algorithms, the filter can easily account for one-third of the computational complexity of a decoder [35]. The complexity is mainly based on the high adaptivity of the filter, which requires conditional and decisional processing on the block edge and sample levels, thus, there are many conditional branches in the filter which leads to excessive power consumption. At the same time, for a macroblock, the vertical filter begins from left-most edge and is followed from left to right by the three vertical edges; besides, the horizontal filter begins from top edge, and is followed by the three internal horizontal edges from top to bottom. Amount of relevant and candidate pixels should be loaded into the memory, this leads to additional power consumption either. Scalable energy can be achieved by classifying the filtering process into three levels, including full, half, and <b>rough</b> <b>filtering.</b> Among these, full filtering operation means that overall branch filtering is implemented for the macroblock. And, half filtering represents the operation reduced in computational complexity, which can be achieved by taking into account the fact that the image area in past frames is already filtered, and thereby optimizing or omitting the filtering process accordingly. For the <b>rough</b> <b>filtering,</b> skip operation is used with low quality degradation, while the lowest power consumption of the DF subfunction is required in this mode.|$|R

Building such a collection demands {{a large amount of}} human work, however, be- cause of the diversity, vastness and sparseness of web pages. Even though many researchers have investigated methods for searching and classifying web pages, etc., most of the methods are best-effort types and pay no attention to quality assurance. We are therefore investigating a method for building a homepage collection eff- ciently while assuring a given high quality, with the expectation that the investigated method can be applicable to the collection of various categories of homepages. 　This dissertation consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 gives the introduction, and Chapter 2 presents the related work. Chapter 3 describes the objectives, the overall performance goal of the investigated system, and the scheme of the system. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the two parts of our two-step-processing method in detail respectively. Chapter 6 discusses the method for reducing the processing cost of the system, and Chapter 7 concludes the dissertation by summarizing it and discussing future work. 　Chapter 3, taking into account the enormous size of the real web, introduces a two-step-processing method comprising <b>rough</b> <b>filtering</b> and accurate classifica- tion.

The <b>rough</b> <b>filtering</b> is a method for gathering researchers 2 ̆ 7 homepages (or entry pages) by applying our original, simple, and effec- tive local page group models exploiting the mutual relations between the structure and the content of a logical page group. It aims at narrowing down the candidates with a very high recall. First, property-based keyword lists that correspond to researchers 2 ̆ 7 common properties are created and are grouped either as organization- related or non-organization-related. Next, four page group models (PGMs) taking into consideration the structure in an individual logical page group are intro- duced. PGM_Od models the out-linked pages in the same and lower directories, PGM Ou models the out-linked pages in the upper directories, PGM_I models the in-linked pages in the same and the upper directories, and PGM_U models the site top and the directory entry pages in the same and the upper directories. 　Based on the PGMs, the keywords are propagated to a potential entry page from its surrounding pages to compose a virtual entry page. Finally, the virtual entry pages that scored at least a threshold value are selected. Since the application of PGMs generally causes a lot of noises, we introduced four modified PGMs with two original techniques: the keywords are propagated based on PGM_Od only when the number of out-linked pages in the same and lower directories is less than a threshold value, and only the organization-related keywords are propagated based on other PGMs. The four modified PGMs are used in combination in order to utilize as many informative keywords as possible from the surrounding pages. 　The effectiveness of the method is shown by comparing it with that of a single- page-based method through experiments using a 100 GB web data set and a manually created sample data set.

The reason for this technology being widely used and accepted is its ease of use and effectiveness: water is placed in clear plastic bottles and exposed to direct sunlight for approximately six hours. The microorganisms in the water absorb the sunlight and it, in turn at sufficient UV dosages, causes mutations to their genetic material, inhibiting reproduction. Although some pathogens may still be viable they are no longer infective. The result is microbiologically safe water. Research to date has explored everything from which colour and size the SODIS containers should be to whether adding catalysts to the water before exposure improves disinfection. Apart from a few studies that examined the effect of shaking the bottles (to entrain air) before exposure, there has been limited research on pretreatments for enhancing solar disinfection. The focus of this project was to explore two pretreatments for SODIS and determine how they affect the efficiency of the process. The first stage was to examine one of the currently used pretreatments: cleaning the water containers before use. The second stage was to develop an accessible, low-cost filtration technique to remove particles from the water before exposure to sunlight. Particles in the water disperse the light and protect the microorganisms from being inactivated, so {{it is important to have}} as few particles as possible; the recommended upper limit is 30 NTU for solar disinfection. In many instances, surface water with high turbidity (greater than 200 NTU) serves as the only source for drinking water in developing areas. The first series of experiments in the current research evaluated if cleaning the bottles was necessary and if so, which cleaning agents would be most effective and available. The agents selected were 70 % isopropyl alcohol, a soap-water mixture, and lime juice. The experiments demonstrated that cleaning with 70 % isopropyl alcohol did not affect the process in any way. Cleaning with the soap-water mixture did have a slightly negative effect on the process; there was substantial microbial recovery when bottles were kept in the dark overnight. In the case of the lime juice, it actually inhibited the disinfection process. It is necessary to remove any debris that might exist within the containers before using them, but using a chemical cleaning agent or mechanically scrubbing can decrease the amount of disinfection that occurs during SODIS. Thus, it is suggested that using a chemical pretreatment is not necessary and has the potential to inhibit disinfection, especially without proper training or technical knowledge. The second series of experiments identified the optimal design for a low-cost <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> that could be used to remove particles from water before exposure to sunlight. The <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> that was built from the same plastic pop bottles used for solar disinfection, as well as gravel and sand. It was constructed with three centimetres of gravel on the bottom of the pop bottle and then 17 cm of coarse sand was added on top to make the total filter height 20 cm. A 0. 6 mm hole was made at approximately 1. 5 cm from the bottom of the bottle using a standard sewing needle. Each filter run consisted of 10 L of water at approximately 200 NTU. Experimental results indicated that 95 % removal of turbidity could be achieved. These roughing filters can be constructed from readily available and affordable materials in developing countries and produce an effluent water quality of less than 30 NTU when initial turbidities are greater than 200 NTU. Finally, the third series of experiments focused on testing the newly developed <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> in series with SODIS to evaluate the system as a whole. The results confirmed that using the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter,</b> as a pretreatment to SODIS, is a highly effective means of improving the disinfection potential of the process. These roughing filters produce an effluent water quality of less than 30 NTU, which is required for SODIS, making them a viable pretreatment for turbid water intended for SODIS use...|$|E
40|$|Slow sand {{filtration}} is a proven and sustainable technology for drinking water treatment in small communities. The process, however, {{is sensitive to}} lower water temperatures {{that can lead to}} decreased biological treatment, and high raw water turbidity levels that can lead to premature clogging of the filter and frequent cleaning requirements, resulting in increased risk of pathogen breakthrough. Multistage filtration, consisting of roughing filtration followed by slow {{sand filtration}}, can overcome these treatment limitations and provide a robust treatment alternative for surface water sources of variable water quality in northern climates, which typically experience water temperatures ranging down to 2 °C. Prior to this study, however, multistage filtration had yet to be systematically challenged in colder climates, including testing of its performance under increased hydraulic loadings and elevated influent turbidity together with cold water conditions. The primary goal of this research was to demonstrate the reliability of multistage filtration for small communities in northern climates with reference to the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act. In this research, testing was conducted on two different pilot multistage filtration systems and fed with water from the Grand River, a municipally and agriculturally impacted river in Southern Ontario. One system featured pre-ozonation and post-granular activated carbon (GAC) stages, and shallower bed depths in the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> and slow sand filter. The other system featured deeper bed depths in the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> and slow sand filter, two parallel roughing filters of different design for comparison, and a second stage of slow sand filtration for increased robustness. Removal of turbidity, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms under a range of influent turbidities (1 to > 100 NTU), water temperatures (~ 2 to 20 °C), and hydraulic loading rates (0. 2 to 0. 8 m/h) were investigated. In addition, the slow sand filters in each pilot system were challenged with high concentrations (~ 10 6 oocyst/L) of inactivated Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. The performance of both pilot multistage filtration systems was highly dependent on the biological maturity of the system and its hydraulic loading rate. In a less mature system operating in cold water conditions (50 NTU), increased hydraulic loadings (0. 6 m/h), and filter cleaning occasionally resulted in effluent turbidity above 1 NTU. Furthermore, in a less mature system operating during runoff events of high turbidity, reducing the hydraulic loading rate to 0. 2 m/h was important for achieving effluent turbidity below 1 NTU. However, in a more mature system operating in warm water conditions (19 - 22 °C), effluent turbidity was consistently below 0. 3 NTU at a hydraulic loading rate of 0. 4 m/h, and below 0. 5 NTU at 0. 8 m/h, despite numerous events of high influent turbidity (> 25 NTU). It {{remains to be seen whether}} this performance could be sustained in colder water temperatures with a fully mature filter. Removal of coliform bacteria was occasionally incomplete in a less mature multistage system, whereas, in a more mature system operating in warm water conditions (> 9 °C), removal was complete in all measurements. Furthermore, the average removal of Cryptosporidium was greater than 2. 5 logs in both systems (with hydraulic loading rates ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 8 m/h) and improved with increased filter maturity. Each individual stage of the multistage system was an important treatment barrier in the overall process of turbidity and pathogen removal. The <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> was not only important for protecting the slow sand filter from solids loading and increasing its run length, but was also a significant contributor to coliform removal when the system was less mature. Removal of turbidity was significantly improved when the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> was more mature, suggesting that biological treatment was an important treatment mechanism in the <b>roughing</b> <b>filter.</b> Although pre-ozonation was used mainly for the removal of organic carbon and colour, it achieved complete removal of coliform bacteria and was also suspected to be important for enhanced removal of turbidity. The second slow sand filter in series provided additional robustness to the process by reducing effluent turbidity to below 1 NTU during cold water runoff events of high turbidity and increased hydraulic loadings (0. 6 m/h), while achieving effluent below 0. 3 NTU during normal periods of operation. It also provided additional removals of coliforms under challenging operating conditions, and contributed an additional average removal of Cryptosporidium of 0. 8 logs, which resulted in cumulative removal of 3. 7 logs, approximately 1 log greater than all the other challenge tests. Collectively, the entire multistage system performed well with water temperatures ranging down to 2 °C, limited filter maturity, elevated raw water turbidities, and increased hydraulic loading rates. Its ability to meet the current Ontario turbidity regulations and greater than 2 log removal of Cryptosporidium over a range of operating conditions, with little or no process adjustment, is a testament to the robustness and minimal maintenance requirements of the process, which are desirable attributes for small water systems that are often located in rural areas. While this research demonstrated the performance of multistage filtration using pilot scale testing, it is important to note that full-scale plants tend to produce significantly better results than pilot facilities, due to long term biological maturation of the system. Overall, multistage filtration is a sustainable and cost-effective technology that, through this research, appears to be a safe, reliable, and robust treatment alternative for small and non-municipal water systems in North America and the developing world. Further, based on its performance with challenging influent water quality and cold water conditions, multistage filtration holds particular promise for small communities in northern climates that are required to meet safe drinking water regulations, but are dependent on surface water sources of variable water quality and temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Combination between {{oxidation}} and filtration can be {{used for}} removing iron and manganese from groundwater especially when the concentrations of these metals were high. This study focused on the effectiveness of the cascade aerator {{and the size of the}} limestone filter media to remove iron and manganese from groundwater. Water samples used for this study were collected from orphanage home, Rumah Nur Kasih, Taiping. Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) has provided a tube well of 15 m depth and 150 mm diameter for the orphanage home. However, the water cannot be used for domestic consumption due to high amount of iron and manganese at 6. 48 and 1. 9 mg/L which exceeded the drinking water standard of 0. 3 and 0. 1 mg/L respectively. Using laboratory physical model, the study has shown that the removals of iron and manganese have reduce the concentration until 0. 17 and 0. 2 mg/L respectively. Thus, the results from this study which utilize cascade aerator and limestone <b>roughing</b> <b>filter</b> could be implemented on site for the community to use the ground water for domestic purposes...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{recommends}} {{the use of}} horizontal-flow <b>roughing</b> <b>filters</b> to treat spring water of variable annual quality in MaeLa Temporary Shelter, Thailand. The public drinking water system for 45, 000 refugees is overseen by Aide M 6 dicale Intemacionale, with which this project was conducted. Half the drinking water for the camp is provided by thirteen springs. The volume and turbidity of these springs varies annually, correlating with the rainy and dry seasons. Treating the varying turbidity and volume at these sources so that the water can be effectively disinfected is the treatment goal. Available materials and operation and maintenance capabilities are also design parameters. Horizontal-flow roughing filtration was determined to fit these parameters and a design with two equivalent filters operating in parallel is recommended. One important feature of the filters is baffles that dictate the flow path of water through the filter. A second feature is an outflow {{at the top of}} the filter that will maintain a constant water volume in the filter. The feasibility of the design is based on flow tests and turbidity measurements taken on site as well as weekly flow rates an...|$|R
