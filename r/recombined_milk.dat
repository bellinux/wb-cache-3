40|$|Halloumi {{cheese is}} made in some Middle Eastern {{countries}} from sheep's and goat's milk. It is a hard, unripened white cheese that tastes like immature Cheddar, {{and it has the}} capacity to melt and stretch when heated. The present investigation was undertaken to provide information on the manufacture of Halloumi cheese from fresh cow's milk, to define a process for its manufacture from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk,</b> and to examine the application of ultrafiltration procedures to Halloumi manufacture. The first part of the research programme was conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal manufacturing conditions for making Halloumi from fresh cow's milk, and to establish appropriate methods of measuring physical properties of the cheese (stretchability, meltability and fat loss). It was found that those manufacturing variables which altered the rate and extent of acid development (percentage of starter, priming, cooking temperature and time) had a marked effect on cheese physical properties. These variables could be altered by the cheesemaker to optimize Halloumi properties. previous reports indicated that Halloumi with desired properties could not be made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk.</b> The second part of this thesis describes a study of the manufacture of Halloumi from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> (milk made by recombining skim milk powder with anhydrous milkfat). Two main reasons for this were considered, namely, the effect of homogenization treatment used in the recombining process, and the quality of the powder used. It was demonstrated that high homogenization pressures resulted in poor stretchability and meltability of the cheese. In contrast low pressure homogenization gave cheese with satisfactory properties. A model based on the viscoelastic behaviour of polymer systems was described in an attempt to explain how the homogenization treatments influence the stretching behaviour of the cheese network, and it was possible to verify the model in suitable experiments. The preheat temperatures of the skim milk used in the manufacture of skim milk powders were also shown to markedly affect the properties of the cheese. High preheat temperature resulted in reduced stretchability and meltability of the cheese. It was likely that this was due to alteration of the mineral balance and to denaturation of whey proteins. The concentration of total solids prior to spray drying was shown to have no significant effect on the properties of the cheese. In the final part of the investigation, the application of UF to the manufacture of Halloumi cheese was studied using fresh UF milk, and skim milk powder prepared from UF skim milk. When a 5 : 1 UF concentrate of fresh milk was used, some modification in the setting time and cutting device was necessary. The quality of UF Halloumi was very similar to that of the control cheese. In considering the manufacture of Halloumi from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> using UF skim milk powder, the effects on the cheese quality of variations in the ratio of protein to fat, in the solids concentration of the <b>recombined</b> <b>milk,</b> and in the calcium content of the UF skim milk powder were investigated. Best results were obtained when the cheese was manufactured from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> with a low protein-to-fat ratio. The use of low-calcium UF skim milk powder, as opposed to high-calcium powder, resulted in some improvement in the quality of the cheese. Varying the concentration of the <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> solids had no significant effect on the cheese properties. The present investigation has demonstrated that good quality Halloumi cheese having the desirable typical stretchability and meltability can be made not only from fresh cow's milk, but also from recombined and UF milks provided that appropriate materials and manufacturing procedures are used...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the effects of different compositions of fat globule membranes as well as heat treatment of reconstituted skim milk, on the properties of acid milk gels. Rheological and microstructural properties of acid milk gels were determined. Recombined milks were made by mixing reconstituted skim milk with homogenised (20. 7 and 3. 5 MPa, first and second stage pressures, respectively) emulsions which were stabilised by low-heat, medium-heat or high-heat skim milk powder, sodium caseinate, whey protein concentrate, heated (80 °C for 30 min) whey protein concentrate, Tween 60 or the native fat globule membrane of whole milk. To study the effect of milk heat treatment, unheated reconstituted skim milk or milk heated at 80 °C for 30 min was used for making <b>recombined</b> <b>milk.</b> Gels were formed by acidification of <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> with glucono-δ-lactone by incubating at 30 °C for 16 h. Each type of emulsion was characterised by determining the size distribution of fat globules, protein load and composition of fat globule membrane. The average fat globule size in the emulsion systems varied from 0. 66 to 0. 48 μm. Emulsions made with low-heat skim milk powder had the highest protein load (7. 05 mg/m 2), because of the adsorption of large particles (casein micelles) on to fat globules. In contrast, emulsion systems made with whey protein concentrate had the lowest protein load (1. 13 mg/m 2). The membrane of emulsions stabilised by skim milk powder solutions contained both caseins and whey proteins while whey protein concentrate stabilised emulsions had both β-lactoglobulin than α-lactalbumin adsorbed onto the fat globule surface. The membrane of Na caseinate stabilised emulsions contained all caseins at the surface. The rheological properties of <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> during acidification were determined by low amplitude oscillation using a Bohlin Rheometer and a penetration test using the Instron. The storage modulus (G') of acid gels made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> that was made from heated skim milk were in the range ~ 180 to 530 Pa, whereas acid gels made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> made from unheated skim milk systems produced gels with G' values in the range ~ 20 to 90 Pa. The G' of acid gels made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> containing fat globules stabilised by different materials was in the order: heated whey protein concentrate > sodium caseinate > skim milk powders > Tween 60, unheated whey protein concentrate or natural membrane material (fresh cream). The results of the penetration test were variable and did not fully agree with the trends from the oscillation tests. For all <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> systems both the pH of gelation and the gelation time were influenced by the heat treatment of reconstituted skim milk, i. e. heating increased the pH of gelation and decreased the gelation time. The microstructure of the acid gel network was determined by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Acid gels made from unheated reconstituted skim milk appeared to be formed from irregular clusters and strands, interspersed with fat globules whereas more crowded structure was observed from unheated systems. Recombined fat globules appeared to be embedded in the matrix. Differences in microstructures between gels containing different types of fat globule membranes were not very clear. Acid gels made from Tween 60 and whole milk were different from the other fat systems; the fat globules in the Tween 60 stabilised milk appeared to be very small while in contrast those in whole milk were much larger probably because whole milk was not homogenised. Possible mechanisms have been proposed which explain the effects of heat treatment on gel properties and the role of fat globule membrane material in gel structure and stiffness...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} heat {{treatment}} and homogenization {{on the physical}} and rennet coagulation properties of <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk</b> (40 % total solids) made from reconstituted milk protein concentrate (MPC- 56) (20 %) and fresh frozen milkfat for recombination (FFMR) (20 %) have been investigated. The effects of heat treatment of the concentrate prior to drying were also studied. Heat treatment, either during MPC powder manufacture or after reconstitution and recombination of MPC powder had a significant influence on whey protein denaturation, viscosity, and rennet coagulation properties of <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk.</b> The degree of whey protein denaturation, {{as determined by the}} decrease of soluble whey protein at pH 4. 6, increased with increasing severity of heat treatment, and β-lactoglobulin A was more heat sensitive than β-lactoglobulin B and α-lactalbumin. <b>Recombined</b> cheese <b>milk</b> showed shear thinning behaviour, e. g. <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milks</b> behaved as pseudoplastic materials. The viscosity of <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk</b> determined at a shear rate of 18. 5 - 731 s increased with increasing severity of heat treatment, indicating aggregation of protein and fat particles. The changes in viscosity were related to the degree of whey protein denaturation and the interactions between whey proteins and casein micelles. The rennet coagulation properties of <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk</b> were determined in terms of gelation time (GT), storage modulus (G'), and the force required to fracture the renneted gels (yield force). In general, G' and yield force decreased with increasing severity of heat treatment. Gelation time appeared to remain unaffected by heat treatment, either of the <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk</b> or during MPC manufacture. There was an almost linear inverse relationship between G' or yield force and whey protein denaturation of up to ~ 60 %. Further denaturation had no further effect. It is likely that denaturation and complex formation between whey proteins and casein micelles sterically interferes with the aggregation of altered casein micelles, resulting in slower increases in G' and yield force values. Compared to heat treatment, the degree of homogenization appeared to have a minor effect on the physical and rennet coagulation properties of <b>recombined</b> cheese <b>milk.</b> Increased homogenization pressure resulted in a decrease in average fat globule diameter and an increase in viscosity. Rheological parameters, i. e. G' and yield force of renneted-induced gels decreased as the homogenization pressure was increased. The changes in milk fat globule diameter and its surface composition are probably involved in this phenomenon. Microstructure examination and permeability measurements of renneted gels indicated that the casein networks were very strong and dense with limited porosity. Since increasing heat treatment and homogenization reduced the strength of renneted gels, with only a small effect on gelation time, {{it might be possible to}} use these two processes to counter the gel firmness problem of recombined cheese made from MPC powder...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the suitability of the non-protein nitrogen (NPN), Hull, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) methods for measuring proteolysis in fresh and <b>recombined</b> UHT <b>milk</b> samples during storage. They were also used to measure proteolysis in milk samples with added culture filtrate. The effect of heating milk on proteolysis measurements was also studied. The OPSA method showed higher proteolysis in fresh HUT <b>milk</b> than in <b>recombined</b> UHT <b>milk</b> sample while the methods indicated no clear difference. The measurements by the OPA method had low correlation with NPN measurements; however, it was highly correlated with hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), indicating that it was affected by other changes in UHT milk during storage. After the addition of culture filtrate, the OPA method gave a higher percentage increase in proteolysis measurements for <b>recombined</b> UHT <b>milk</b> than for pasteurized and fresh UHT milks, while the NPN method showed a higher percentage increase in proteolysis measurements in pasteurized milk than in UHT milk. the percentage increase in proteolysis measurements by the NPN, Hull and TNBS methods were highly correlated, while {{the results of the}} OPA method had low correlation with those of the NPN method. Heating fresh UHT milk at 80 ºC resulted in a significant increase in proteolysis measurements by all methods. NPN had the lowest and OPA had the highest percentage increase, and OPA had the highest correlation with the increase in HMF concentration. The results indicated that the OPA method was not suitable for comparing proteolysis in different milk types. The NPN and Hull methods were more suitable than the TNBS method for comparing proteolysis in different milk types and for following proteolysis in HUT milk during storage...|$|R
40|$|An NIR {{reflectance}} sensor, {{with a large}} {{field of}} view and a fibre-optic connection to a spectrometer for measuring light backscatter at 980 nm, was used to monitor the syneresis process online during cheese-making {{with the goal of}} predicting syneresis indices (curd moisture content, yield of whey and fat losses to whey) over a range of curd cutting programmes and stirring speeds. A series of trials were carried out in an 11 L cheese vat using <b>recombined</b> whole <b>milk.</b> A factorial experimental design consisting of three curd stirring speeds and three cutting programmes, was undertaken. Milk was coagulated under constant conditions and the casein gel was cut when the elastic modulus reached 35 Pa. Among the syneresis indices investigated, the most accurate and most parsimonious multivariate model developed was for predicting yield of whey involving three terms, namely light backscatter, milk fat content and cutting intensity (R 2 = 0. 83, SEy = 6. 13 g/ 100 g), while the best simple model also predicted this syneresis index using the light backscatter alone (R 2 = 0. 80, SEy = 6. 53 g/ 100 g). In this model the main predictor was the light backscatter response from the NIR light back scatter sensor. The sensor also predicted curd moisture with a similar accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary- Ras cheese {{was made}} by the {{traditional}} process from fresh cow's milk and different recom-bined milks. The recombined milks were prepared by mixing recombined cream (20 % fat) with recon-stituted skimmilks obtained from classicallow heat and medium heat powders, the latter one added or not with calcium caseinate and also from a new milk powder recently developed under an INRA paten-ted process using membrane microfiltration. Milks, wheys and fresh cheeses were carefully analyzed in order to determine reliable weight and cheese component recoveries. Organoleptic qualities deter-mined through f 1 avour, body and texture scorings were assessed during the 3 -month ripening period. The highest weight cheese yields were evidently observed with recombined milks enriched with-ealclum caseinate and the lowest with <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> made from medium heat powder. 8 atisfactory weight cheese yield and milk component recoveries were achieved with INRA powder recombined milk; they were even higher than those of fresh milk.

40|$|Labneh is made commercially by {{different}} methods. The {{effects of processing}} methods in five diary plants on labneh composition, physiochemical properties and, sensoric quality were studied. The composition of labneh made {{by different}} methods differ significantly. Labneh made from yoghurt with 25 % total solids had the highest fat, protein and lactose content. All labneh samples met the Saudi Standards for fat but, only samples from one plant met the solids not fat requirement. Labneh made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> had higher titratable acidity and proteolysis than labneh made from fresh milk. Labneh made from fresh milk with yoghurt culture had higher proteolysis and lipolysis than that made with buttermilk culture. Labneh produced from fresh milk by the traditional method was superior in all organoleptic properties to all other labnesh samples. However, fresh labneh made by the new mechanized method was inferior to all other samples. This was attributed to yogurt pasteurization {{and the addition of}} gelatin as stabilizer. This labneh had lustrous weak jelly appearance and foreign chemical odor and taste. Samples made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> (from plants 3, 4, and 5) were similar in most of their sensoric properties. Even though the traditional method produced a superior labneh, the mechanized method could be improved to produce good labneh.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of heat treatment, high pressure (HP) treatment or combined heat and HP treatments, either before or after homogenization, on <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> systems. The main focus was to explore the changes induced by these treatments on the surface layers of recombined fat globules, milk proteins and rheological properties of acid gels. Heat treatments caused denaturation of whey proteins; the degree of denaturation was dependent on temperature, holding time {{and to a lesser extent}} on the placement of heat treatment. Recombined milks that underwent heat treatment before or after homogenization had similar levels of whey protein denaturation. The amounts of caseins and denatured whey proteins adsorbed on the surface of fat globules of <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> heated before homogenization were significantly lower than those heated after homogenization, indicating different interaction mechanisms in these two systems. Increases in treatment pressure used in HP treatment resulted in decreased amounts of caseins, while whey proteins adsorbed onto the surface layers of fat globules increased. This was probably due to the dissociation of casein micelles under HP treatment and the interactions between HP-induced denatured whey proteins and casein particles on the surface layers of fat globules. Combined heat and HP treatments induced changes on adsorbed caseins and whey proteins on fat globule surface layers. HP treatment induced additional denaturation of whey proteins in heated milks, resulting in slightly increased amounts of denatured whey protein adsorbed onto the surface layers. Gelation pH, final G? and yield stress values of acid gels prepared from recombined milks heated before or after homogenization were dependent on temperature, holding time and the placement of heat treatment. These changes were attributed to the extent of denaturation of the whey proteins and their interactions with casein particles adsorbed onto the fat globule surface and in the serum. Differences in acid gels prepared from recombined milks heated before and after homogenization were attributed to the relative proportions of caseins and whey proteins at the surface layers of fat globules resulting in different interactions with protein strands in the gel network. The acid gels prepared from recombined milks HP-treated either before or after homogenization had shorter gelation times, higher gelation pH, final G? and yield stress values compared with untreated <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> and the effects were dependent on treatment pressure, temperature, holding time and the placement of HP treatment. The denaturation of whey proteins and their interactions with casein particles were responsible for these changes. In HP-treated recombined milks the proportions of caseins and denatured whey proteins adsorbed onto the surface layers of fat globules had significant effects on the acid gel structure. When HP treatment was applied after homogenization, the proteins on the surface layer were present as a layer which might provide better sites for the interactions with the protein strands in the gel matrix. The application of these processing treatments to <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> could provide new avenues to the dairy industry for manufacturing novel products with enhanced texture and nutritional properties...|$|E
40|$|Recombined dairy {{products}} are commonly produced using various dry milk ingredients, fat, sugar and water. This research work examined {{the possibility of}} replacing milk protein, specifically casein/caseinates, with Isolated Wheat Protein (IWP) in various recombined {{dairy products}}. These include <b>Recombined</b> Sweetened Condensed <b>Milk</b> (RSCM), <b>Recombined</b> Full Cream <b>Milk</b> Powder (RFCMP), <b>Recombined</b> High Fat Powder (RHFP) and Coffee Creamer (CC). These dairy products were first manufactured at laboratory-scale with certain modifications in the standard manufacturing process. This was done to achieve finished product with the desirable properties of commercial product. Next, the partial or full replacement of casein/caseinate using IWP in the selected dairy-type products was investigated. And last, the emulsifying properties of both casein and IWP were compared {{in terms of a}} range of functional parameters critical to particular dairy products. IWP performed better than casein in RSCM in terms of emulsifying properties since only partial replacement (25 % and 50 % with 1 % reduced overall protein) was sufficient to compete with 100 % casein in terms of viscosity, the most critical parameter for resulting product "Imitation Sweetened Creamer (ISC) ". The free fat content and emulsion stability, the most critical parameters for spray dried emulsions, particularly, RFCMP, RHFP and CC, performed functionally the same as Recombined Creamer Powder (RCP) made using IWP. Consequently IWP can be used to totally replace casein in a RFCMP, RHFP and CC-type emulsion products. Similar products made using dairy and non-dairy fats showed that casein and IWP can effectively stabilise emulsions whatever the type of fat/oil used. This study showed that Isolated Wheat Protein performed better than casein/caseinates in the selected liquid emulsion system (RSCM), but was only comparable in the spray-dried emulsions (RFCMP, RHP and CC) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of preheat treatments on fouling by fresh whole <b>milk</b> (FWM), <b>recombined</b> whole <b>milk</b> (RCB) and reconstituted whole milk (Recon) in the high-temperature heater of indirect UHT plants. Various preheat treatments prior to evaporation during milk powder manufacture were applied to skim milk powder (SMP, 75 °C 2 s, 85 °C, 155 s and 95 °C, 155 s) and whole milk powder (WMP, 95 °C, 33 s). These preheat treatments were so-called “evaporator preheat treatments”. Skim milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) were derived from the same original batch of pasteurised FWM to remove the effects of the variation in milk composition between different milk batches. These SMPs were <b>recombined</b> with anhydrous <b>milk</b> fat and water to prepare RCB, and WMPs were reconstituted with water to prepare Recon. Then, (homogenized) FWM, RCB and Recon were subjected to various preheat treatments (75 °C, 11 s, 85 °C, 147 s and 95 °C, 147 s) prior to UHT processing. These preheat treatments were so-called “UHT preheat treatments”. Temperature difference (hot water inlet temperature – milk outlet temperature) was taken as a measure of the extent of fouling in the high-temperature heater. The slope of the linear regression of temperature difference versus time (for two hours of UHT processing) was taken as fouling rate (°C/h). Increasing both evaporator and UHT preheat treatments resulted in increasing fouling rate and total deposit weight for all three whole milk types for several milk batches. In the case of FWM, there was no reduction in fouling rate with increasing UHT preheat treatment whether FWM was homogenized then preheated, preheated then homogenized or not homogenized at all. These findings, which are wholly consistent and well replicated, are in apparent conflict with the results of most previous comparable studies. Possible reasons for this are explained. Further investigations of the effects of homogenization relating to the role of whey protein on the surface of the fat globules showed that whey protein associated with the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, RCB and Recon and that association increased with increasing heating process stage. The increasing association of whey protein with the milk fat globules membrane with increasing severity of heating process stage became faster when preheat treatment was more severe: the association of whey protein plateaued on intermediate temperature heating when the milks were preheated at 75 °C, 11 s and on preheating when the milks were preheated at 95 °C, 147 s. In the case of FWM, the thickness of the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, which increased with the severity of heating process stage, was greater than the thickness of the membrane in preheated then homogenized FWM. Preheating then homogenization resulted in the greater interfacial spreading of small molecules on the surface of fat globules, i. e. whey protein or small molecules from the disintegration of casein micelles during preheating. Possible basic mechanisms for UHT fouling in the high-temperature heater include: the reduction in the solubility of calcium phosphate and the deposition of protein as fat-bound protein and non-fat-bound protein. When non-fat-bound protein in milk plasma deposited, it could be a carrier for the deposition of mineral, such as, the precipitate of calcium phosphate in the casein micelles or the deposition of complexes between whey protein and casein micelles...|$|R
40|$|Milk fat is {{considered}} hypercholesterolemic {{because it contains}} cholesterol and {{a large proportion of}} saturated fatty acids. The use of vegetable oil to substitute for milk fat in cheesemaking has been proposed to improve the nutritional value of the cheese. However, the quality of vegetable-oil cheese has not been as good as that of traditional cheese. The objectives of this study were to modify vegetable oils to resemble milk fat for use in cheese production and to produce high quality, nutritious Swiss cheese from modified vegetable oils and skim milk;High-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) was chemically modified by incorporating shortchain fatty acids (C 4 [...] C 10) (SCFA) through interesterification of short-chain triglycerides and HOSO. A simplified gas chromatography method based on decyl esters was used to determine the fatty acid compositions of milk fat and modified vegetable oils. All modified vegetable oils had a short-chain fatty acid composition closely resembling that of milk fat. Seven types of Swiss cheese were made by <b>recombining</b> skim <b>milk</b> with various fat sources, namely, HOSO; milk fat; randomized milk fat; HOSO with commercial shortchain fatty acids interesterified at 100 % and 120 % of the levels in the milk fat; HOSO with SCFA from milk fat interesterified, and HOSO with free fatty acids (C 4 [...] C 10) dissolved. The quality of Swiss cheese was evaluated after three months of ripening by sensory, chemical, and physical methods. All cheeses made from modified HOSO had significantly higher scores in typical Swiss flavor and volatiles than did unmodified HOSO and were not significantly different from milk fat control cheeses. Simple correlation of sensory flavor and chemical parameters indicated that Swiss flavor was correlated positively with sweetness, volatiles, caramelized flavor, non-fat solids, and C 4 [...] C 10 fatty acids and negatively with fat and salt content. A linear regression model (R 2 = 0. 91) was established for Swiss flavor that included fat, salt, titritable acidity, and C 12 [...] 16 fatty acids as variables;Instrumental texture profile analysis indicated no differences among the treatments in texture attributes except for cohesiveness; however, sensory panelists detected differences among the treatments in hardness and springiness.

40|$|Highly {{concentrated}} micellar casein concentrate (HC-MCC), {{a potential}} ingredient for cheese making, containing ~ 20 % casein with ~ 70 % of serum proteins removed by microfiltration, and diafiltration of skim milk, and then further concentrated by vacuum evaporation. The objectives {{of this research}} were to investigate solubilization, cold gelation, rennet coagulation properties of recombined HC-MCC and cream for its use in cheese making. In Chapter 3, either mixing thawed HC-MCC in water at high temperature (~ 50 C) or addition of trisodium citrate can achieve complete dispersion and more than 80 % solubility of HC-MCC in water (3 % protein). Overnight storage helps to fully disperse HC-MCC, but only reaches ~ 30 % of solubility at 20 C. Cold-gelation of HCMCC is thermally reversible and reducing protein levels in HC-MCC can decrease its CGT. The HC-MCC with less than 16 % of protein does not gel at 5 C. We propose that cold-gelation of HC-MCC occurs when the kinetic energy of the casein micelles is sufficiently reduced to inhibit their mobility in relation to adjacent casein micelles. In Chapter 4, the <b>recombined</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> (RCM) by mixing thawed frozen HC-MCC and cream with 12 % casein at pH 6. 6 does not gel until cooled below 12 °C. Addition of either sodium citrate or high levels of calcium increased CGT, although low levels of calcium did not impact CGT. Cold gelation of RCM was thermally reversible, even when citrate was added to partially chelate calcium. We propose that cold gelation of RCM occurs when protein strands that have been partially released from the casein micelles entangle, restrict their mobility and form a fine stranded gel network. The RCM at a casein level of 12 % (wt/wt) has potential for use in cheese making. In Chapter 5, reducing rennet level can increase coagulation time of RCM (11 % casein) without impact on curd firmness or firming rate. Decreased coagulation temperature helps to increase coagulation time and decrease curd firmness rate, but also increases the initial viscosity of RCM. Pre-acidified RCM has no advantage in increasing coagulation time, decreasing curd firmness or firming rate. Microstructure of RCM and its coagulum indicates that the increased curd firmness probably results from the highly inter-linked and longer protein strands in RCM curd. Reducing rennet level {{can be applied to}} slow down rennet coagulation of RCM (11 % casein) in cheese making...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{treatment}} is conventionally used in dairy industry {{to achieve the}} microbial safety and desired functional properties of dairy products. However, heat treatment can cause detrimental effects on dairy products such as changes in colour and loss of vitamins. Novel processing technologies including pulsed electric fields (PEF) and ultrasound (US) processing have shown great potential to be the alternatives to heat treatment for dairy processing. In this study, the effects of PEF and US processing on milk protein systems that are altered by pH adjustment, EDTA addition or high-heat treatment are examined. The results show that PEF processing {{did not affect the}} structure of the casein micelles or denature the whey proteins in reconstituted skim milk, despite the pH adjustment (pH 6. 7 to 8. 0) or the EDTA addition (10 to 30 mM). On the other hand, US processing (particularly at 20 kHz) of reconstituted skim milk can disrupt casein micelles and reform micelle-like particles with smaller size and comparable ζ-potential to native micelles. US processing of high-heat treated (90 °C/ 10 min) reconstituted skim milk can modify the physicochemical properties of casein micelle particles and the heat-induced protein aggregates. Based on the processing effects on the milk proteins, processed milk samples were selected for functionality tests. The results show that milk ultrasonicated at pH 8. 0 and adjusted to pH 6. 7 had superior renneting properties compared to untreated milks or milk ultrasonicated at pH 6. 7. The concentrated milk (&gt; 40 % total solid) made from milk ultrasonicated at pH 8. 0 and adjusted to pH 6. 7 had higher viscosity, compared to that made from untreated milk at pH 6. 7. However, the GDL-induced acid gels made from high-heat treated milks that were ultrasonicated had similar gelation properties, compared to those made from milks that were only high-heat treated. The heat stability of <b>recombined</b> concentrated <b>milks</b> made from high-heat treated milks that were ultrasonicated was unchanged, compared to those made from milks that were only high-heat treated. Therefore, PEF processing can be an alternative for pasteurization of milk with preservation of the important milk proteins, although the processing temperature should be carefully controlled. US processing can be integrated to dairy processing to modify the physicochemical properties of milk proteins and achieve desired functional properties...|$|R
40|$|All {{concentrated}} milks thicken with {{storage time}} {{and the degree of}} thickening is highly dependent on the storage temperature. The aim of the current research project was to investigate this phenomenon in reconstituted concentrated <b>milk</b> (RCM) and <b>recombined</b> sweetened condensed <b>milk</b> (RSCM) and to investigate a method for overcoming the quality defect. RCM was initially investigated as this system had been extensively documented by previous works at Massey University, New Zealand. The RCM system was chosen to provide an opportunity of learning all about time dependent rheology. It was observed that reshearing of age thickened RCM samples destroyed the ability to age thicken again in subsequent storage. RSCM was then investigated to assess the effect of shear and temperature on age thickening during storage. Two shear levels of 900 and 31, 000 s- 1 were applied during the recombination stage in the process of producing RSCM. Samples of RSCM produced using both shear rates were then stored at temperatures of 30, 40 and 50 °C for a period of 12 weeks. Triplicate samples from each storage temperature were analysed weekly for apparent viscosity, particle size distribution and colour. The RSCM samples stored at 50 °C gelled by the 7 th week while RSCM samples stored at 30 and 40 °C did not gel even by the 12 th week. The results of particle size distribution were consistent with the age thickening results. The particle sizes of samples stored at 30 and 40 °C almost did not change with storage time but the particle sizes of samples stored at 50 °C increased with storage time until they gelled. The colour of RSCM became darker with increased storage temperature and time. This was particularly noticeable at 50 °C. The study showed that the commonly observed quality defect in RSCM could be overcome for samples stored below 40 °C for at least 12 weeks by the application of shear rates in excess of 900 s- 1 during the manufacture of the product...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some chemical composition and microbiological load during storage period of plain set yoghurt samples present on local market in Khartoum State. Ninety- six commercial yoghurt samples, from different manufacturers produces plain set yoghurt from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> powder (A, B), and fresh milk (C, D), were collected from 4 shops in Khartoum North during the period November 2008 - February 2009. Analysis of yoghurt samples, collected from different manufacturers revealed significant (P< 0. 01) differences in total solids (TS), solids not fat (SNF), fat, protein and ash contents and titratable acidity due to the variations of manufacturers and type of milk used. The titratable acidity showed no significant effect due to the type of milk used. Yoghurt samples obtained from different manufacturers and type of milk significantly (P< 0. 01) affected TS, SNF, protein contents, and titratable acidity during storage period, whereas fat and ash contents were not significantly affected by storage period. Microbiological analysis showed that total bacterial count, coliform count and yeast and mould count were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by the manufacturers. On the other hand, coliform count and yeast and mould count were not significantly affected by the type of milk used. Total bacterial count, coliform count and yeast and mould count were significantly affected by storage period in all yoghurt samples. The study concluded that the plain set yoghurt made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> powder and fresh milk agrees with the Sudanese standards for yoghurt chemical composition. Moreover, all plain yoghurt samples revealed high contamination, and the storage period had a significant effect on both chemical and microbiological load. vii Hence, it is recommended that determining the maximum level of all harmful microorganisms associated with a product, provides a good hygienic conditions during processing. Also, more research is needed on the type of milk used, the conditions of processing and storage of yoghurt and its association with the quality of the product...|$|E
40|$|Seven Bacillus strains {{isolated}} from milk powder production lines were grown in two selective media. All the strains produced extracellular and intracellular proteinase and lipase activity, but at different levels. Proteolytic activity was generally highest at neutral to alkaline pH. Inhibitor {{studies showed that}} two types of proteinase were produced — a serine proteinase and a metallo-proteinase. Not all of the strains produced both types of activity and those that did produced different levels. All strains produced a 1, 3 -specific lipolytic activity that showed a preference for short-chain fatty acids. The lipolytic activity had greater heat stability than the proteinase activities, but all would clearly survive pasteurisation at 72 °C for 2 min in milk. Further, the enzymes are likely to survive any heat treatments applied during commercial milk powder manufacture. The enzymes remain active in milk powder during storage, and are therefore likely to be active in milk products made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> powder...|$|E
40|$|The {{flavor of}} Swiss cheese made from various natural and {{synthetic}} fats was compared with cheese {{made from the}} natural milk emulsion. Cheeses made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> fat and skim milk {{with or without the}} addition of gum acacia gave typical flavor similar to the natural milk emulsion. Homogenization did not have an effect on flavor of the cheese. Cheese made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> fat and skim milk plus buttermilk solids had lower typical flavor than the natural milk emulsion or cheeses made with gum acacia. Cheeses made from high-oleate sunflower oil with or without the incorporation of synthetic short-chain fatty acids gave the lowest typical flavor. Cheeses made with high-oleate sunflower oil with the incorporation of natural short-chain fatty acids gave slightly better flavor. All cheeses had flavor that was acceptable to panelists;Fat content of the recombined cheeses was slightly lower than controls. pH of all cheeses varied, and was below normal. Moisture content was within normal range. Production of acetic and propionic acids was normal, indicating that normal fermentation had occurred. Proteolysis varied, with the highest levels occurring in cheeses made from the natural emulsion, milk fat, or high-oleate sunflower oil modified by natural short-chain fatty acids;Cheeses with the poorest flavor tended to have the lowest levels of short-chain fatty acids. The fat-aqueous interface seems {{to play a role in}} encouraging lipolysis. Minor short-chain fatty acids were tentatively identified in the cheeses. Short-chain fatty acids are critical to good flavor development in Swiss cheese;A model was developed to predict the flavor variability of these cheeses by chemical and physical analyses. A factor composed of proteolysis, fat content, long-chain free fatty acids, and acetic acid predicted 42 % of the flavor variability of these cheeses. A second factor consisting of the short-chain fatty acids plus oleic acid was correlated with the first factor, but its contribution to the model was not significant;An improved method for determination of dicarbonyls produced by microorganisms in culture was developed.

40|$|Cheeses of low pH, such as Feta, Blue, Cream and Cheshire, often exude whey after manufacture. This {{exudation}} {{lowers the}} yield and reduces product acceptability. Virtually no scientific {{study has been}} undertaken on this subject. Investigations were therefore undertaken to determine the factors affecting exudation and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Cream cheese made by the hot-pack method and recombined Feta cheese made by the traditional method, representing unripened and ripened varieties of cheese respectively, were studied. In Cream cheese the amount of exudate increased with decreased protein to fat (P /F) ratio, decreased homogenisation pressure, decreased pasteurisation temperature, decreased pH at cooking, decreased cooking temperature, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Within the selected limits of variation of P /F ratio, fat did not affect exudation. However, an increase of moisture in non-fat substance resulted in an increased amount of exudate. The effect of homogenisation pressure appears {{to be due to}} the increase in the fat globule surface area and the increase in the coating of fat globule with casein. The partial heat-denaturation of the whey proteins in the cheesemilk was effective in reducing the rate of exudation, possibly due to the complex formation between 13 -lactoglobulin and K-casein that prevented fusion of casein micelles. Residual lactose and pH did not change, and proteolysis was not detected up to 16 weeks in Cream cheese stored at 5 · C. It is concluded that exudation from Cream cheese does not occur due to any gross chemical changes during storage. Manufacture of Feta cheese involved the use of <b>recombined</b> cow's <b>milk</b> and vacuum packaging of cheese after brining. A storage study of Feta cheese up to 6 months showed steady proteolysis, slow metabolism of residual lactose and a gradual decrease of pH. The water activity of the cheese depended on the salt-in-moisture concentration. In Feta cheese the amount of exudate increased with increased P /F ratio, i ncreased pH at draining, increased residual rennet, packaging cheese without vacuum, increased storage temperature and increased storage time. Variation of priming time, with a constant curd pH at draining, did not affect exudation. Unlike Cream cheese, an increase in protein and a decrease in fat content in Feta correlated with increase in the amount of exudate. The effects of change in pH and calcium (within a range expected in normal Feta) on exudation were minor. Homogenisation was effective in reducing the rate of exudation in Feta cheese. However, a variation in the homogenisation pressure had no effect. The type of material adsorbed to the fat globule surface influences syneresis during manufacture as well as subsequent exudation during storage. The effect of a reduction in the size of fat globules on exudation appears to be less important. In Feta cheese the incorporation of heat-denatured whey proteins did not affect exudation. However, there was a substantial increase in yield. Proteolysis is the dominant factor affecting exudation. Its influence is apparently due to the disintegration of the casein network and the release of water physically held in the capillaries. Exudation is also substantially influenced by the gradient in NaCl concentration in Feta cheese following brining. Denaturation of whey proteins in Cream cheese; and homogenisation, controlled proteolysis, decreased salt gradient, use of vacuum packaging in Feta cheese appear to be the main factors available for reducing the extent of exudation. Based on the findings of the investigation a hypothesis is proposed to explain the exudation from cheeses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dahi was {{prepared}} from whole milk, skim milk, reconstituted and combined milk by adding 12 % sugar to each type and then these milks were boiled {{to reduce the}} volume by 30 %. After adding 3 % starter culture all these dahi mix were incubated at 40 °C for 4 - 5 hours. Then all the dahi samples were kept in the refrigerator at 4 °C for at least 2 hours. All these types of dahi were judged {{by a panel of}} expert judges to determine the physical qualities. Chemical and microbiological tests were also car ried out to determine the composition and qualities. Whole milk dahi was the best for overall acceptabili ty followed by skim milk dahi but other two types were somewhat less acceptable. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 01) among the overall scores obtained. There were a significant difference (P< 0. 01) in percent acidity, for all the samples % DM, % fat, % protein and % ash showed a non significant difference. For all the chemical qualities, dahi from whole milk ranked the highest followed by others types. Among the microbial qualities, total viable counts were higher in all the sample, though {{there was a significant difference}} (P< 0. 05). Yeast and mold counts differed significantly (P< 0. 01), although the counts were lower. Although, dahi prepared from reconstituted and <b>recombined</b> <b>milk</b> were not as good as that from whole milk, there is a great prospect to improve the qualities...|$|E
40|$|The Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) {{method was}} {{originally}} developed to extract volatile and semivolatile compounds from wastewater samples but {{has since been}} applied to flavour compounds in foods and beverages. Research using the HS-SPME in related areas such as cheese and skim milk powder {{has been carried out}} but, to date, no work has been done on yoghurt flavours. The main objective {{of this study was to}} devise a methodology for the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) technique to investigate and quantify six flavour analytes in natural, set yoghurts made from <b>recombined</b> <b>milk.</b> The relevant literature was reviewed and from it, a research proposal for this work on yoghurts was drawn. The first step in analysing and quantifying the yoghurt volatiles was to set up a working methodology for the HS-SPME method. The 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre was chosen along with 20 minutes being the optimum fibre adsorption time. General equipment, materials and methods used throughout this thesis are also detailed. The external standard (ES) method was used to calibrate the GC and quantify the analyte concentrations in this study. The internal standard (IS) method was not used as a quantitative tool in this study. Once the HS-SPME methodology had been set up for the analysis of yoghurts, the classical Static Headspace (SH) method was compared with the HS-SPME method for extraction efficiency. The results suggested that the two methods were complementary in that the SH method extracted the more volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, acetone and 2 -butanone) whereas, the HS-SPME method extracted the semi- to non-volatile compounds (ethanol, diacetyl and acetoin) more readily. However, the HS-SPME was found to be the more sensitive and effective method of the two techniques tested. The next step in the thesis was to investigate the presence of the six analytes in milk and cultured yoghurt. The effects of the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation on the volatile concentrations were also examined. The results suggested that the six analytes were inherently present in milks but at low concentrations. No conclusive effects were found for the sample matrix, fat levels and incubation. However, it was evident that fermentation of the milks using bacterial starter cultures resulted in a large increase in some of the volatiles being investigated. Following this, the effects of fat levels, storage time and storage temperature on the six volatiles in yoghurts were examined. The results indicated that significant fat level effects were only seen for diacetyl and acetoin, while temperature effects were only observed for ethanol. In both trials, only general trends for the analytes concentrations were drawn because the data varied from day to day. The results suggested that most of the compounds decreased with time except for diacetyl, which seemed to increase. The final part of this study looked at applying the devised HS-SPME methodology to a series of commercial yoghurts as a preliminary trial, with a view to investigating a potential application for the HS-SPME method. Fourteen commercial yoghurts were analysed and the six analytes quantified. The data obtained was analysed using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which divided the yoghurts into groups based on their analyte concentrations. From these groupings, eight yoghurts were selected and fresh samples were analysed using HS-SPME and PCA. This was carried out parallel with an untrained consumer panel, which had to distinguish differences between the yoghurts in a series of triangle tests by smelling the headspace on opening the yoghurt containers. The conclusions drawn were that, unlike the HS-SPME method with PCA, the average consumer could not differentiate the yoghurts based on smell alone. PCA also showed that the HS-SPME results obtained were fairly reproducible. In conclusion, the HS-SPME method was shown to be a useful analytical technique, which can be used to analyse and quantify flavour compounds in natural, set yoghurts. This area of investigation has a lot of scope, with the results from this study providing a basis or starting point for further investigations in this area. Future studies may lead to potential applications for the HS-SPME method, one of which may be quality control where correlation of sensory data with HS-SPME analytical data is required...|$|E

The flavor of butter oil directly affects the quality the end product. Thus, {{it is important to}} use the high quality butter oil which can be indicated by the extraction and analysis of volatile flavor compounds (VFC). Since the existing extraction technique prior to GC-MS analysis has deficiency in VFC extraction from oily sample, {{the first part of this}} research was devoted to the LDPE membrane pouch extraction. This method was developed to extract VFC from butter oil prior to GC-MS analysis. Butter oil represented for oily sample with complex flavor compounds. The butter oil was placed in the pouch and heat-sealed for extraction in diethyl ether. The extraction was taken at 40 ºC for 1 h and followed by GC-MS analysis. The result showed the wide spectrum of VFC including 12 fatty acids and 7 lactones, which characterized butter oil aroma. The separation of VFC from large molecules of triglycerides was explained by the molecular sieve effect of LDPE membrane. The relatively small and middle molecules such as VFC could diffuse through the amorphous region of the LDPE membrane while the relatively large molecules such as triglycerides in butter oil could not diffuse through the region. The percent recoveries of fatty acids and lactones by this method were 1. 00 - 1. 74 % and 10. 1 - 11. 2 %, respectively. Sensory evaluation of aroma recombinate and reference butter oil was assessed to indicate the accuracy of the extraction. The aroma recombinate was prepared from 12 odorants in the same concentration as determined in butter oil. The average sensory scores and standard deviations from 10 panelists showed that creamy odor and buttery odor had high scores in both butter oil and aroma recombinate. These odors characterized the main aroma of butter oil while sweet odor was undertone of the creamy odor. The sensory scores showed that the components extracted by LDPE membrane pouch method were matched the odor character in butter oil. The next part is specific lactone release from dehydrated butter oil by non-enzymatic treatment. The effect of moisture, temperature and storage time on lactone release in butter oil was studied. The accumulated lactone concentrations were determined along with moisture content in butter oil samples during storage. The dehydrated samples had moisture content reduced from 948 ppm to 280 ppm and were kept at 5 ºC or 20 ºC for 4 weeks. After storage, the samples were weekly extracted by LDPE membrane pouch method and analyzed by GC-MS for volatile flavor compounds. The lactone concentration highly increased in the first 2 weeks and remained at high level while there was no increase of free fatty acids. Lactones potential were also manipulated to determine the ability of the specific lactone release. The lactone formation mechanism was proposed with the intermediate structure of 6 -membered-ring, which composed of 4 - or 5 -hydroxy fatty acid glyceride ester and water molecule. Lactone potentials indicated that sample with approximately 750 ppm moisture content and kept at 20 ºC for 3 weeks gained the optimum condition for lactone release. δ-Tetradecalactone and δ-dodecalactone were predominance in the dehydrated butter oil which gave a pleasant and rich butter flavor after storage without enzyme application. In conclusion, LDPE membrane is recognized for its permeability and act as molecular sieve. In cooperated with organic solvent, LDPE membrane can separate small molecules such as volatile flavor compounds from large molecules of triglycerides. The method was developed to establish the efficient methodology for volatile flavor compound extraction from butter oil prior to GC-MS analysis without depending on specific apparatus. The generated lactones along with the former fatty acid were expected to characterize the buttery and creamy aroma for butter oil samples. The specific lactone release is the alternative method for lactone generation in flavor industry...|$|E
