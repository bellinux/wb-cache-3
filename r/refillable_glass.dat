40|$|A non-marginal tax on {{beverage}} packages {{was implemented}} in Sweden. This tax {{is found to}} be related to several shifts in the market shares of competing beverage packages. <b>Refillable</b> <b>glass</b> bottle use increases. Non-refillable glass bottle use declines greatly, while cans increase in use. A lack of substitutability between cans and glass containers may explain the increased market share for cans. These results indicate that an environmental tax may have significant effects on consumer package choice in beverage delivery systems.

40|$|With the {{continually}} declining {{percentage of}} soft drink sales in refillable bottles {{in favour of}} cans and PET bottles, despite a growing soft drink market, governments have become increasingly concerned about the alleged more environmentally harmful impacts of throw-away convenience packaging and tried to enact policies to induce consumers to switch to <b>refillable</b> <b>glass</b> bottles. In many cases, fully or partially refundable deposits have been opted for to provide consumers with the incentive to properly dispose of packaging, but not to switch between different container types, and thus, they may not constitute the most desirable solution. The effects of various regulatory measures on produceers' choices of packaging quality and mix {{in the presence of}} consumers with differing demand intensities are therefore analyzed to discern the least distortionary alternative. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{practice}} of reuse, the relation between individuals and objects, using {{as a case study}} the <b>refillable</b> <b>glass</b> milk bottle. Based on interviews with 22 individuals in mainly rural settings, the study aims to understand what the milk bottle means today to the many people who still use it, and what the socioeconomic and other structures are that sustain this kind of product reuse. The discussion exposes the way that reuse is about both consumption and disposal and is maintained by a web of household practices, revealing the milk bottle as both a site of resistance to supermarkets and a site for the construction of collective and individual identities. We also expose the way that the materiality of the bottle enables myth and trust to be articulated. We conclude that this reuse practice is a form of non-market mediated exchange, marking reciprocal relations of care and trust. ...|$|E
40|$|Life-cycle {{inventory}} and cost-analysis tools applied to milk packaging offer guidelines for achieving better environmen-tal design {{and management of}} these systems. Life-cycle solid waste, energy, and costs were analyzed for seven sys-tems including single-use and <b>refillable</b> <b>glass</b> bottles, single-use and refillable high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, paperboard gable-top cartons, linear low-density polyeth-ylene (LLDPE) flexible pouches, and polycarbonate refill-able bottles on a basis of 1, 000 gal of milk delivered. In addition, performance requirements were also investigated that highlighted potential barriers and trade-offs for envi-ronmentally preferable alternatives. Sensitivity analyses, in-dicated that material production energy, postconsumer solid waste, and empty container costs were key param-eters for predicting life-cycle burdens and costs. Recent trends in recycling rates, tipping fees, and recycled materi-als market value had minimal effect on the results. Inven-tory model results for life-cycle solid waste and energy indicated the same rank order as results from previously published life-cycle inventory studies of container systems. Refillable HDPE and polycarbonate, and the flexible pouch were identified as the most environmentally prefer-able with respect to life-cycle energy and solid waste. The greater market penetration of these containers may be lim-ited by performance issues such as empty container stor-age, handling requirements, and deposit fees for refillables, and resealability and puncture resistance for the pouch.

40|$|The {{industrialized world}} is facing an {{increasing}} problem {{of solid waste}} management. Voluntary household source separation recycling of domestic waste items has not had the publicity that centralized, large-scale, capital-intensive systems have had. Rather, source separation recycling projects have been dependent on the efforts and goodwill of individuals, council officers, industries, charitable groups and other environmentally-conscious people in the community. This research examines the various reasons for the mounting waste problems and the historical attitudes to and practices of waste management. The historical overview provides a perspective of how early mankind viewed domestic waste. In the Middle Ages, waste was either ignored or very casually dealt with {{on an individual basis}} until the connection between waste and disease was made in Britain in the early 1800 s. The American experience of waste management is contrasted with the Australian experience. The less dense settlements in most Australian cities and towns in the 1800 s allowed a freer and more cavalier attitude towards waste disposal, as domestic animals were used to 'recycle' the food scraps. It was not until the local councils {{in the middle of the}} 1800 s at the insistence of the cities' health officers emphasized the disease and waste connection, that public 'tips' were opened usually at the edge of the towns for public waste disposal. The historical backcloth provides the context for the discussion of the rise of environmentalism and the more recent concern for the natural environment. The recycling ethos arose out of the environmental movement of the 1960 s. The Glenorchy Case Study sought to establish whether or not a weekly, source separation, multi-material (glass, paper, and aluminum cans) recycling project could be viable in the Glenorchy Municipality, on the northern edge of Hobart, Tasmania. The Study measured three neighborhoods' weekly participation rates over 8 quarters or 2 years. The neighborhoods selected were of high, medium and low socioeconomic level. The detailed participation rates over 2 years of weekly data and the amounts of recyclables collected were tabulated. A comparison between the 3 test neighborhoods showed that Neighborhood A, the highest socioeconomic neighborhood, had a higher rate of participation and generated a higher value of recyclables. The use of the questionnaire survey as both a data-gathering method and as a publicity technique proved to be a successful tool in maximizing the use of limited financial resources for the start-up of the recycling project. The results of the Glenorchy Study showed that 6 out of 10 householders sampled said they attempted to recycle their <b>refillable</b> <b>glass</b> bottles. Only 53...|$|E
