5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kesiny struck Madagascar {{during a}} period of {{political}} strife after the Malagasy presidential election in 2001. In the election, incumbent president Didier Ratsiraka lost to Marc Ravalomanana, but rejected the results; after the election, Ratsiraka declared the city of Toamasina as the new capital of the country. The political crisis caused difficulties after the storm in distributing food, and Ratsiraka's operational center in the city was damaged. During the storm, Toamasina experienced severe flooding, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. Emergency volunteers provided water and food to the affected residents. Workers from the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) provided medical assistance to residents in Toamasina during the storm. Damaged roads contributed to economic contraction, after trucks were unable to use <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> in the eastern portion of the country. By October, the political crisis had ended, and the government repaired most of the damaged infrastructure. The cost of repairing the <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> was about $2.5million (2002 USD), which was paid by a $50million credit from the World Bank Group. Due to poor harvest related to the storm in some areas, the World Food Programme provided 18,000tonnes of food to 394,250residents, beginning in November 2002 {{at the request of the}} Malagasy government. After the storm, the government of Norway donated kr1.2million (2002Norwegian krone, 172,000 USD) for storm relief, and the government of Switzerland provided about $33,000 (USD).|$|E

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight limit for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges,</b> which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E

The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long term solutions. Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. <b>Roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding.

40|$|In Sri Lanka {{most of the}} <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> {{construction}} works are handled by a contractor and supervised by a consultant. Road Development Authority of Sri Lanka (RDA) is the client organization for the National roads operating directly under the Ministry of Highways. Most of the <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> {{construction works}} are handled by the <b>Road</b> Construction <b>and</b> Development Co. (PVT) Ltd., (RC & DC) which is the main contractor organization and the subsidiary of the Road Development Authority. Some of the <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> construction works, mainly the foreign funded works are awarded to the independent consultants and contractors through tenders. Claim situations rarely arise with RC & DC as the contracts handled are negotiated contacts between RDA and RCDC. However, claim situations are common in contracts given on tenders to parties out side the RC & DC where independent consultants administer the works of independent contractors. Appointment of a separate Project Manager to look after client's interests from the inception {{is one of the}} arrangements used successfully in contract administration. In this research it was considered the Project Management approach could be used to administer the <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> construction works. Main objectives of this research were to establish the relevancy of the project management concept to <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> construction work <b>and</b> to study some cases and evaluate how this concept could be applied in <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> construction claims. For the purpose of achieving the first objective a literature survey and an opinion survey was carried out. Results showed the necessity of a separate Project Manager for the <b>road</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> construction work <b>and</b> the requirement of an independent Project Manager for large Projects. Five case studies were carried out in view of achieving the second objective. Results of these analyses showed the significance of management inputs to projects which could be utilized to minimize the claim situations...|$|R

5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E
5|$|Swells from Fred reached wide {{stretches}} of the West African coastline, stirring up high seas {{as far north as}} Senegal. Along the shorelines between Dakar and M'Bour, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges.</b> About 200houses were demolished in the district of Hann, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of Bargny endured similar destruction. In the suburb of Rufisque, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque. Outside the capital area, several villages were completely cut off from their surroundings. Victims across the affected region received more than 100tons (220,000lbs) of rice and 12million CFA francs (US$20,000) in government relief funds.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>bridges.</b> CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.|$|E
