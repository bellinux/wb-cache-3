5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome <b>Research</b> <b>Study</b> (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E

40|$|There {{is not a}} {{long history}} of <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in Industrial and Product Design (IPD) in China. In this article, the author {{initially}} reviews the current <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in IPD in China. He identifies the limitations and deficiencies of these <b>research</b> <b>studies,</b> which either emphasise engineering or fine-art aspects. Most of these <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> are thesis-oriented, with research students only focusing their efforts on the writing of theses. The studies lack any practical experience in research areas. Taking Hong Kong design research programmes as a case study, the author criticises this kind of thesis-oriented <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in IPD, since it de-motivates students from putting an effort into the practice of their research areas. The author then attempts to identify the changes necessary in <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in IPD. By using the reform of <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in IPD in Hong Kong as a case study, the author discusses the advantages, limitations, difficulties and possibilities of having a balance in research and practice in <b>research</b> <b>studies</b> in IPD.

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year <b>research</b> <b>study</b> to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
