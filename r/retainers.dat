5|$|<b>Retainers</b> {{formed a}} large portion of the {{fighting}} forces amassed by the future Emperor Guangwu (r. 2557 CE) during the civil war against Wang Mang's failing regime. The military role of <b>retainers</b> became much more pronounced by the late 2nd century CE during the political turmoil that would eventually split the empire into three competing states. By then, hosts began to treat <b>retainers</b> as their personal troops (buqu 部曲), which undercut the freedoms of mobility and independence that earlier <b>retainers</b> had enjoyed. Whereas individual <b>retainers</b> had earlier joined a host by their own personal decision, by the late 2nd century CE the lives of the retainers' entire families became heavily controlled by the host.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his <b>{{retainer}}s</b> {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all <b>retainers</b> shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; <b>retainers</b> who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} <b>retainers,</b> but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the <b>retainers</b> were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Following the crisis, the Colonel Director of <b>Retainers</b> {{retained}} his privileged {{possession of}} the Staff of Authority and was granted the same investigative and censorial powers as the Chancellor and Imperial Counselor over officialdom. He routinely inspected the conduct of officials in the capital region and seven nearby commanderies. His investigative powers matched those of a provincial Inspector, although his Staff of Authority made him {{more powerful than the}} latter. The Colonel Director of <b>Retainers</b> was a personal servant of the emperor, answering only to him, allowing the emperor to greatly enhance his control over the bureaucracy. However, the Staff of Authority was removed from the Colonel in 45 BC, limiting his powers to inspection, investigation, and impeachment and he was distinguished from a provincial Inspector only by a higher salary-rank. The office of Colonel Director of <b>Retainers</b> was abolished in 9 BC, and reinstated once more as the Director of <b>Retainers</b> in 7 BC. He was now a subordinate of the new Excellency of Works and supervised convicts in public works projects, like his early Western Han counterpart. In Eastern Han, the Colonel Director of <b>Retainers</b> was reappointed without the Staff of Authority, with powers to inspect the capital region, but his salary-rank was reduced from 2000–dan to Equivalent to 2000–dan.|$|E

The micro sensor was created to help parents and orthodontists monitor <b>retainer</b> use after braces are removed. The smart <b>retainer</b> chip {{is about the size}} of a shirt button and provides detailed information about the chip's environmental surroundings. In the United States a smart <b>retainer</b> sensor is exclusively provided by orthodontists who have signed up to be providers, and should retail for around $100.|$|R
5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and <b>retainers</b> (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the {{property}} of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. <b>Retainers</b> often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his <b>retainers</b> in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others could work as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E

When the plot was uncovered, the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou (d.172AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan (張奐) favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his <b>retainers</b> {{at the palace}} gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other.

40|$|<b>Retainer</b> {{medicine}} {{has become an}} important yet controversial form of primary care practice in the United States, coming under attack for its purported failure to measure up to professional ethics. Critics opine that <b>retainer</b> medicine obstructs professional commitments to health care access and social justice. Some ethicists urge that society should restrict or ban <b>retainer</b> medicine; professional organizations have yet to take a stand. The authors believe that <b>retainer</b> medicine is compatible with professional ethics and will more likely aid in solving the difficulties facing primary care rather than add to them. Although professional ethics should evolve to address new condi-tions, a condemnation of <b>retainer</b> medicine is warranted neither by traditional ethical precepts nor by contemporary developments in medical ethics. Any move to sanction <b>retainer</b> medicine {{under the banner of}} professionalism or professional ethics will be counterpro-ductive. The primary care shortage will only get worse if physicians in <b>retainer</b> practice leave primary care altogether, a likely outcome of legal or professional condemnation of <b>retainer</b> practice.

5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for <b>retainers</b> who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, <b>retainers</b> could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E

40|$|What’s not to {{like about}} <b>retainer</b> medicine? Patientsand {{physicians}} both want unhurried visits, im-proved access, and better continuity and coordination of care.

In contemporary business par-lance, <b>retainer</b> medicine is a win–win situation—as long as you’re part of the “in ” group. Critics charge that <b>retainer</b> medicine is unethical be-cause it increases disparities and poor access to primary care. Furthermore, now that Medicare covers an annual wellness visit, <b>retainer</b> fees that cover an executive physical examination may run afoul of Medicare bans on double-billing (1).

5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their <b>retainers</b> with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} {{could be}} avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers.

50|$|Here is an {{abstract}} {{of an article}} in a US Orthodontic Journal:Retention is routinely prescribed after orthodontic treatment to prevent relapse. Orthodontists often notice a discrepancy between what a patient reports about <b>retainer</b> wear and what a clinical examination shows.

The technology behind the Smart <b>Retainer</b> environmental microsensor is possible because of recent reductions in electronic component sizes and power requirements. A proprietary USB-powered Smart Reader uses wireless technology to download information about actual usage from the Smart <b>Retainer.</b> The information is decrypted and analyzed, and can be shown to the patient in easy-to-understand charts. The orthodontist can use this information to discuss actual <b>retainer</b> usage vs prescribed <b>retainer</b> usage with the patient or parent and make data-driven recommendations about future retention.|$|R
