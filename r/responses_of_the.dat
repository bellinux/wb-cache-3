5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E

5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|Inflammation {{is one of}} {{the first}} <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system to infection. The {{symptoms}} of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|On Saint Lucia, wakes {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed {{both inside and outside}} of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate system}} {{includes}} {{a range of}} feedbacks, which alter <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system to changes in external forcings.

5|$|The {{physiological}} <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{epaulette shark}} to low oxygen are {{mediated by the}} nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the Navier-Stokes {{equations}} {{which are}} set up with the arbitrary Lagrange-Euler description, a finite element model considering close fluid-structure interaction (FST) is established to analyze <b>the</b> seismic <b>response</b> <b>of</b> bridge piers in the deep water. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> close FSI on the bridge pier is analyzed including the relative displacement, shear force and bending moment. In addition, the close FSI and its effects are discussed with respect to different water levels. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case study indicate that the displacement and internal force will become larger obviously when the FSI is considered. Effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close FSI on seismic <b>response</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pier are related to <b>the</b> frequency characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input earthquake wave.
