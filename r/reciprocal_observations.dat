Mathematical {{learning}} {{processes are}} more and more understood as active knowledge constructions of the students in which they proceed in a discovering way themselves and gain new insights by means of common reflection. By analogy to this, the teachers ‘ mathematical instruction activity should also expressively be the subject of their common reflection in which among other things <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observations</b> of their own instruction activity (e. g. by means of video recordings) are analyzed. On the basis of experiences gained in a co-operative research project with elementary school teachers, several conceptual basic ideas of the pro fessional reflection of the own instruction activity are developed and explained by means of concrete examples...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{surveying}} and photogrammetry {{are being}} increasingly {{applied to the}} measurement of engineering objects which have typical dimensions in the range 2 - 100 metres. Both techniques are examples {{of the principle of}} triangulation. By applying photocrammetric concepts to surveying methods and vice-versa, a general approach is established which has a number of advantages. In particular. alternative strategies for constructing and analysing measurement networks are developed. These should help to strengthen the geometry and simplify the analysis. The primary results concern the use of non-levelled theodolites, which have applications on board floating objects, and three new suggestions for controlling and computing relative orientations in photogrammetry. These involve <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observations</b> with theodolites. the photographing of linear scales defined by three target points and employing cameras which have been levelled. As a secondary result, some consideration Is given to automation, and instrument design. It is suggested that polarimetry could be successfully applied to improve the transfer of orientation in confined situations, such as in mining. In addition, the potential use of electronic cameras as photo-theodolites is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Concurrently {{estimating}} the 6 -DOF pose of multiple cameras or robots—cooperative localization—is a core problem in contemporary robotics. Current works {{focus on a}} set of mutually observable world landmarks and often require inbuilt egomotion estimates; situations in which both assumptions are violated often arise, for example, robots with erroneous low quality odometry and IMU exploring an unknown environment. In contrast to these existing works in cooperative localization, we propose a cooperative localization method, which we call mutual localization, that uses <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observations</b> of camera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually observable world landmarks. We formulate and solve an algebraic formulation for the pose of the two camera mutual localization setup under these assumptions. Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free cooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2 cm range and 0. 7 degree accuracy at 2 m sensing for 6 -DOF pose. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we compare our results with ARToolKit [1] and Bundler [2], over which our method achieves a tenfold improvement in translation estimation accuracy.

40|$|In {{surveying}} missions {{the volume}} {{and the weight of}} the surveying equipment are often a problem. In a previous work, the A. proposed what he called blind traverse for control network assessment in close-range photogrammetry. It is a procedure that forms the so-called topographic models, linking together a couple of Theodolite Stations by their observations to the common points, similarly to what happens in photogrammetry with the photogrammetric models. The theodolite relative orientation has three +one unknown parameters, estimated by means of co-planarity conditions, observing a minimum of three common points. When all the possible couples of TS are formed, they are oriented in an absolute reference system with a procedure similar to independent model adjustment in aerial triangulation (S-transformations). The advantage consists in the possibility to avoid to link together the TS with the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observations,</b> allowing {{to reduce the amount of}} needed equipment by more than 50 % in volume and weights (from three tripods to one, etc). The term “blind ” refers to the null visibility among TS. In the present paper, the analogy between photogrammetry and surveying is extended to block bundle adjustment. The angular observations of a theodolite stations are similar to an image bundle. Compared to the photogrammetric bundle, the unknown parameters for any single TS, are reduced to four only, say the three co-ordinates of the TS and the bearing of zero reading of the horizontal circle. The fundamental equations are the horizontal direction and vertical one. Since the approximated values of the co-ordinates for the unknown points are needed, they are supplied by the previous stage by the blind traverse. The benefits are again the independence of the theodolite stations and i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the trial and}} development of a peer review program for teaching improvement in the Faculty of Business at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS). It first explores {{some of the key}} issues in the purpose and design of peer review schemes. It agrees with a strong theme in the peer review literature that peer review is most effective when used for quality enhancement rather than quality assurance in the sense used by Lomas and Nicholls (2005). It also recognises the possibility of resistance from academic staff to the idea of peer review and scepticism about its usefulness. A methodology for the conduct of a pilot peer review scheme is outlined drawing on the work of Bingham and Ottewill (2001) and Puget and Schubert (2008) in which peer review is voluntary, confidential and reciprocal involving a mutual arrangement with a trusted colleague to observe each other’s teaching and to offer private constructive feedback within agreed parameters. The experience of participants in the pilot scheme is reported and observations made about both the process of peer review itself and of attempting to establish a peer review program in a Faculty not previously used to such methods of professional and educational development. peer review of teaching; educational development; <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mathematics {{education}} is {{a critical part of}} the curriculum for students worldwide (Linder, Costello 2 ̆ 6 Stegelin, 2011). Children possess some mathematical understanding before entering into formal schooling. However, pre-primary education provides them with a platform where they start their systematic learning of mathematical concepts by connecting them with their daily life experiences. In this connection, effective teaching and learning processes make a difference in young children’s attitude towards mathematics and build a strong foundation for mathematics learning later in life. The effectiveness of teaching depends on the teachers’ content and pedagogical skills, which are enhanced through different courses and collaborative work with other teachers. Action research is one of the effective methods for continuous professional development of teachers as it informs teachers about their practices and empowers them to take leading responsibilities in their own teaching contexts (Donato, 2003). In order to facilitate pre-primary teachers’ and my own professional skills particularly in developing number sense in young children, I conducted a collaborative action research in one of the private schools in Karachi. Two pre-primary teachers and four pre-primary students participated in the study. Collaborative planning, teaching, interview, <b>reciprocal</b> <b>observation</b> of teaching methods and informal discussions with participant teachers helped me to collect and enrich my data. The data indicates that the collaborative action research benefitted both teachers and the young learners in multiple ways. It benefitted teachers in developing pedagogical skills through planning, implementing, reflecting and re-planning with necessary changes in a cyclic way. It helped us in learning both skills and content from each other’s experiences and teaching practices, through co-teaching and providing feedback to each other. The study was helpful for young children to develop their understanding of numbers through their active engagement with concrete materials for their exploration. It also enabled them to learn mathematical concepts in a smooth transition from concrete to representational to abstract level. The results of this study can be replicated in a public school context and in a rural setting {{over a longer period of}} time. On the basis of the study findings, I believe that this study can help pre-primary teachers and teacher educators in identifying different strategies and activities to enhance young children’s mathematical understanding...|$|R

Because the neutron production is scarce and expensive, the detection has to be extremely efficient. We take advantage of the recent improvements of light sensors in photon detection and detection dynamics, to develop a new type of two-dimensional neutron detector combining high detection efficiency and high spatial resolution. A prototype named Barotron (from the name of the inventor) has been built on this strategy. This 2 D-neutron detector displays exceptional performances: Wide <b>reciprocal</b> space <b>observation,</b> spatial resolution lower than 0. 5 mm, low detection threshold (< 1 neutron/cm 2 /s), reduced dimensions and a permanent possibility of upgrading.

The welding simulations were realized by rapidly fusing similar to 5 mm spot in Fe-Cr-Ni steel. During the solid-liquid-solid phase transformations, a section of the weld pool was placed in an incident 50 - 150 keV polychromatic synchrotron X-ray beam, in a near-horizontal position at a very low inclination angle. Multiple high-resolution 2 D detectors with very high frame rates were utilized to capture time resolved X-ray diffraction data from suitably oriented solid dendrites evolving in the weld pool. Comprehensive analysis of the diffraction data revealed individual and overall dendritic growth characteristics and relevant melt and solid flow dynamics during weld pool solidification, which was completed within 1. 5 s. Columnar dendrite tip velocities were estimated from the experimental data and during early stages of solidification were exceeded 4 mm/s. The most remarkable observation revealed through the time-resolved <b>reciprocal</b> space <b>observations</b> are correlated to significant tilting of columnar type dendrites at their root during solidification, presumably caused by convective currents in the weld pool. When the columnar dendrite tilting are transformed to respective metric linear tilting velocities at the dendrite tip; tilting velocities are found {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude as the columnar tip growth velocities, suggesting a highly transient nature of growth condition...|$|R
40|$|PTOV 1 is a mitogenic {{protein that}} {{shuttles}} between the nucleus and the cytoplasm {{in a cell}} cycle-dependent manner. It consists of two homologous domains arranged in tandem that constitute {{a new class of}} protein modules. We show here that PTOV 1 interacts with the lipid raft protein flotillin- 1, with which it copurifies in detergent-insoluble floating fractions. Flotillin- 1 colocalized with PTOV 1 not only at the plasma membrane but, unexpectedly, also in the nucleus, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation of endogenous and exogenous flotillin- 1. Flotillin- 1 entered the nucleus concomitant with PTOV 1, shortly before the initiation of the S phase. Protein levels of PTOV 1 and flotillin- 1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in S. Depletion of PTOV 1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of flotillin- 1, whereas depletion of flotillin- 1 did not affect nuclear localization of PTOV 1. Depletion of either protein markedly inhibited cell proliferation under basal conditions. Overexpression of PTOV 1 or flotillin- 1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their localization to the nucleus, and was dependent on the <b>reciprocal</b> protein. These <b>observations</b> suggest that PTOV 1 assists flotillin- 1 in its translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Polaritons in microcavities are {{versatile}} quasi- 2 D bosonic particles with a {{high degree}} of coherence and strong nonlinearities, thanks to their hybrid light-matter character. In their condensed form, they display striking quantum hydrodynamic features analogous to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, such as long-range order coherence, superfluidity and quantized vorticity. Their variegated dispersive and dissipative properties, however, set significant differences from their atomic counterpart. In this work, we report the unique phenomenology that is observed when a pulse of light impacts the polariton vacuum: the condensate that is instantaneously formed does not splash in real space but instead coheres into an enigmatic structure, featuring concentric rings and, most notably, a sharp and bright peak at the center. Using a state-of-the-art ultrafast imaging with 50 fs time steps, we are able to track the dynamics of the polariton mean-field wavefunction in both real and <b>reciprocal</b> space. The <b>observation</b> of the real-space collapse of the condensate into an extremely localized [...] -resolution limited [...] -peak is at odd with the repulsive interactions of polaritons and their positive effective mass. An unconventional mechanism is therefore at play to account for our observations.

40|$|The {{recurrent}} network composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons {{is fundamental to}} neocortical function. Inhibitory neurons in the mammalian neocortex are molecularly diverse, and individual cell types play unique functional roles in the neocortical microcircuit. Recently, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive (VIP+) neurons, comprising a subclass of inhibitory neurons, have attracted particular attention because they can disinhibit pyramidal cells through inhibition {{of other types of}} inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin- (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) inhibitory neurons, promoting sensory information processing. Although VIP+ neurons have been reported to receive synaptic inputs from PV+ and SOM+ inhibitory neurons as well as from cortical and thalamic excitatory neurons, the somatodendritic localization of these synaptic inputs has yet to be elucidated at subcellular spatial resolution. In the present study, we visualized the somatodendritic membranes of layer (L) 2 / 3 VIP+ neurons by injecting a newly developed adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector into the barrel cortex of VIP-Cre knock-in mice, and we determined the extensive ramification of VIP+ neuron dendrites in the vertical orientation. After immunohistochemical labeling of presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic structures, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the synaptic contacts were unevenly distributed throughout the perisomatic (< 100 μm from the somata) and distal-dendritic compartments (≥ 100 μm) of VIP+ neurons. Both corticocortical and thalamocortical excitatory neurons preferentially targeted the distal-dendritic compartment of VIP+ neurons. On the other hand, SOM+ and PV+ inhibitory neurons preferentially targeted the distal-dendritic and perisomatic compartments of VIP+ neurons, respectively. Notably, VIP+ neurons had few <b>reciprocal</b> connections. These <b>observations</b> suggest different inhibitory effects of SOM+ and PV+ neuronal inputs on VIP+ neuron activity; inhibitory inputs from SOM+ neurons likely modulate excitatory inputs locally in dendrites, while PV+ neurons could efficiently interfere with action potential generation through innervation of the perisomatic domain of VIP+ neurons. The present study, which shows a precise configuration of site-specific inputs, provides a structural basis for the integration mechanism of synaptic inputs to VIP+ neurons...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{generation}} of geostationary satellites carry sensors such as ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager on GOES- 16) and the AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager on Himawari) that closely mimic the spatial and spectral characteristics of Earth Observing System flagship MODIS for monitoring land surface conditions. More importantly they provide observations at 5 - 15 minute intervals. Such high frequency data offer exciting possibilities for producing robust estimates of land surface conditions by overcoming cloud cover, enabling studies of diurnally varying local-to-regional biosphere-atmosphere interactions, and operational decision-making in agriculture, forestry and disaster management. But the data come with challenges that need special attention. For instance, geostationary data feature changing sun angle at constant view for each pixel, which is <b>reciprocal</b> to sun-synchronous <b>observations,</b> and thus require careful adaptation of EOS algorithms. Our {{goal is to}} produce a set of land surface products from geostationary sensors by leveraging NASA's investments in EOS algorithms and in the data/compute facility NEX. The land surface variables of interest include atmospherically corrected surface reflectances, snow cover, vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) /fraction of photosynthetically absorbed radiation (FPAR), as well as land surface temperature and fires. In order {{to get ready to}} produce operational products over the US from GOES- 16 starting 2018, we have utilized 18 months of data from Himawari AHI over Australia to test the production pipeline and the performance of various algorithms for our initial tests. The end-to-end processing pipeline consists of a suite of modules to (a) perform calibration and automatic georeference correction of the AHI L 1 b data, (b) adopt the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm to produce surface spectral reflectances along with compositing schemes and QA, and (c) modify relevant EOS retrieval algorithms (e. g., LAI and FPAR, GPP, etc.) for subsequent science product generation. Initial evaluation of Himawari AHI products against standard MODIS products indicate general agreement, suggesting that data from geostationary sensors can augment low earth orbit (LEO) satellite observations...|$|R
