30|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of wireless communication, flexible, complex, and diversified wireless communication applications are required. However, {{the difficulty of}} enabling new wireless communication applications {{is the lack of}} low power radio frequency (RF) transmission devices, especially the RF receiver. In order to alleviate this problem, an RF low power subsampling architecture for wireless communication applications is proposed in this paper. This subsampling architecture adopts a single-ended to differential configured balun low noise amplifier (balun-LNA), a subsampling mixer with high sampling ratio and a finite input response (FIR) filter and infinite impulse response (IIR) filter achieving frequency down-conversion, avoiding using high power-hungry blocks. Based on a subsampling theory, an optimum sampling frequency for the subsampling architecture is necessary to relax the complexity of the system. For the application of internet of things (IoT) wireless communication, the paper provides the implementation of the subsampling <b>receiver</b> <b>solutions</b> to get a tradeoff between power consumption, gain, noise, and sensitivity. It can achieve − 85  dBm sensitivity for an amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation at the data rate of 1  Mbps with the clock sampling frequency of 40  MHz. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the performance of the subsampling architecture has several advantages over others.|$|R

30|$|High data rates, {{low-power}} consumption, and low complexity will be {{the most}} important parameters {{in the design of the}} next-generation mobile terminals. In this paper we are introducing a new paradigm in the design of direct sequence spread spectrum receiver by combining analog and digital signal processing. The main difference with respect to the conventional all-digital receiver design approach is that the proposed mixed analog/digital processing results in a symbol rate sampling rather than the high-rate subchip sampling. Analog signal despreading is the key part of the proposed <b>receiver</b> <b>solution,</b> which is based on a five-port device, a passive RF square-law-type device. It is used to perform two important tasks at the same time, namely, the direct conversion and analog despreading. To achieve lower complexity, the proposed receiver uses rectangular instead of pulse-matched despreading at the cost of only a small performance degradation. Also, we propose a new noncoherent pseudonoise (PN) code tracking scheme based on error signal generated through the L 1 norm. This results in comparable or even better PN code tracking performance than L 2 norm circuitry, using less complex hardware. Further, we explore how this technology can be applied in the design of DS-CDMA RAKE receiver for mobile terminals. Depending on how the pilot signal is multiplexed, we propose two types of RAKE receivers. It is shown that under Rayleigh fading channel such receiver structures offer robustness and high performance, while maintaining the low complexity achievable through the five-port device.|$|E
40|$|A novel low-complexity {{coherent}} <b>receiver</b> <b>solution</b> {{is presented}} to improve spectral efficiency in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems. It {{is based on the}} receiver-side partial-response equalization and maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) in pre-filtered WDM systems. The partial- response equalization shapes the channel into an intermediate state with a known partial response which is finally recovered by MLSD without the need of channel estimation. In this scheme, the severe ISI induced by the pre-filtering can be shared between the partial-response equalization and MLSD. Therefore, a tradeoff can be made between complexity and performance. The feasibility of receiver-side partial-response shaping relaxes the efforts and requirements on the transmitter-side pre-filtering, which permits the mature WDM components to implement pre-filtering. In addition, the partial-response equalization or shaping structure is also improved based on our prior art, which further simplifies the overall scheme. For near-baudrate-spacing optically-pre-filtered WDM systems, duobinary response is experimentally proved as a good intermediate response to shape. Due to the short memory of the duobinary response, the complexity of the receiver based on duobinary shaping has been reduced to a low level. As a whole, the proposed scheme provides a good alternative to Nyquist-WDM at comparable spectral efficiencies. With the proposed receiver-side duobinary shaping technique, three sets of experiments have been carried out to verify the improved duobinary shaping scheme and meanwhile demonstrate the main features, including 5 * 112 -Gbit/s polarization-multiplexed quadrature phase-shift keying (PM-QPSK) WDM transmission over a 25 -GHz grid, single- channel 40 -Gbaud PM-QPSK experiment, and 30 -GHz-spaced 3 * 224 -Gbit/s PM 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation transmission...|$|E
