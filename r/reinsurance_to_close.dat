50|$|Since the 2005 {{pull back}} by {{insurance}} giants Allstate, State Farm, etc., small, in-state {{companies have been}} taking {{a larger share of}} policies. These start-ups have not followed the traditional insurance model by accumulating cash reserves to cover expenses in high claim years. Instead, they pay as much as half of the policy premium for <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> offshore companies to cover claims. In the seven years since the last major Florida hurricane, profits have risen, but many small companies shifted that money into affiliated businesses and ignored the need for a reserve. Insurance rates were based on the company making a reasonable profit after expenses, which included funding a reserve. The OIR suggests that insurance companies have reserves and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> cover a once in 100-year storm. Many firms in past years purchased less, and if claims exceeded reinsurance and reserves, they were taken over by the state, who paid off remaining claims.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the price of {{catastrophe}} reinsurance varies considerably over time. In particular, prices tend to rise after catastrophes and drift down between catastrophes. We construct a dynamic model to explain these stylised features. The model has three sets of players; households, insurers and a reinsurer. As catastrophe losses are undiversifiable, insurers must set aside capital or buy <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> cover losses in the eventuality of a catastrophe. This is costly because of alternative investment opportunities. We show that imperfections in the capital market are crucial for generating time variation in the price of catastrophe reinsurance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{financial}} exposure of households and firms to natural catastrophe disasters is borne primarily by insurance companies.

In a well-functioning financial system, these risks would be more widely shared.

I then examine how financial innovation can help change the equilibrium toward a more efficient outcome. ...|$|R

50|$|When a {{non-life}} insurance company <b>closes</b> a contract <b>to</b> provide insurance against loss, the revenues (premiums) {{expected to be}} received {{over the life of}} the contract are called gross premiums written. Insurance companies often purchase <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> protect themselves against the risk of a loss above a certain threshold; the cost of reinsurance (reinsurance premiums) is deducted from gross premiums written to arrive at net premiums written. Net premiums written is the sum of all types of insurance premiums which a company may collect throughout the whole duration of existing insurance policies minus the costs like agent's commissions or payments made for reinsurance.|$|R

Furthermore, we find that converting insurers decrease the demand for reinsurance from non-affiliated reinsurers, but increase the demand for reinsurance from affiliated reinsurers after the conversion. One possible explanation is that converting insurers may treat <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> affiliated reinsurers as risk retention rather than risk transfer so that they can reduce reinsurance cost. Another interesting finding is that converting insurers increase demand for reinsurance from non-affiliated reinsurers before conversion.

50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek surplus <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> limit the losses it might incur {{from a small}} number of large claims as a result of random {{fluctuations}} in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|R
40|$|Reinsurance {{is often}} empirically {{hailed as a}} value-adding risk {{management}} strategy which an insurer can utilize to achieve various business objectives. In {{the context of a}} distortion-risk-measure-based three-party model incorporating a policyholder, insurer and reinsurer, this article formulates explicitly the optimal insurance–reinsurance strategies {{from the perspective of the}} insurer. Our analytic solutions are complemented by intuitive but scientifically rigorous explanations on the marginal cost and benefit considerations underlying the optimal insurance–reinsurance decisions. These cost-benefit discussions not only cast light on the economic motivations for an insurer to engage in insurance with the policyholder and in reinsurance with the reinsurer, but also mathematically formalize the value created by <b>reinsurance</b> with respect <b>to</b> stabilizing the loss portfolio and enlarging the underwriting capacity of an insurer. Our model also allows for the reinsurer’s failure to deliver on its promised indemnity when the regulatory capital of the reinsurer is depleted by the reinsured loss.

40|$|We analyze optimal risk {{adjustment}} in competitive health-insurance markets when insurers have better {{information on their}} customers' risk profiles than the sponsor of health insurance. In the optimal scheme, the sponsor uses <b>reinsurance</b> <b>to</b> screen insurers with bad and good risks, in order to lower premiums for enrollees with high expected healthcare costs. We then explore the effects of adding a community-rating requirement to complement this risk-adjustment scheme. With community rating, insurers have incentives to distort contract generosities to cherry-pick low-cost consumers. However, the reduced generosity for low-cost types makes screening through reinsurance easier, allowing the sponsor to redistribute more. When costs for reinsurance are low, or the sponsor's bias towards high-cost consumers is high, community rating dominates risk rating...|$|R
