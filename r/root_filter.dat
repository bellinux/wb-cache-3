Three prohibitive steps in cascade version of DPM are accelerated, including 2 D cor-relation between <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> and feature map, cascade part pruning and HOG feature extraction. For 2 D correlation, the <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> is constrained to be low rank, so that 2 D cor-relation can be calculated by more efficient linear combi-nation of 1 D correlations. A proximal gradient algorithm is adopted to progressively learn the low rank filter in a dis-criminative manner. For cascade part pruning, neighbor-hood aware cascade is proposed to capture the dependence in neighborhood regions for aggressive pruning. Instead of explicit computation of part scores, hypotheses can be pruned by scores of neighborhoods under the first order ap-proximation.

40|$|Data {{assimilation}} (DA) approaches, including variational and {{the ensemble}} Kalman filter methods, provide a computationally efficient framework for solving the CO 2 source–sink estimation problem. Unlike DA applications for weather prediction and constituent assimilation, however, {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of DA approaches for CO 2 flux estimation have not been extensively explored. In this study, we compare and assess estimates from two advanced DA approaches (an ensemble square <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> and a variational technique) using a batch inverse modeling setup as a benchmark, within the context of a simple one-dimensional advection–diffusion prototypical inverse problem that has been designed to capture the nuances of a real CO 2 flux estimation problem. Experiments are designed to identify the impact of the observational density, heterogeneity, and uncertainty, as well as operational constraints (i. e., ensemble size, number of descent iterations) on the DA estimates relative to the estimates from a batch inverse modeling scheme. No dynamical model is explicitly specified for the DA approaches to keep the problem setup analogous to a typical real CO 2 flux estimation problem. Results demonstrate that the performance of the DA approaches depends on a complex interplay between the measurement network and the operational constraints. Overall, the variational approach (contingent on the availability of an adjoint transport model) more reliably captures the large-scale source–sink patterns. Conversely, the ensemble square <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> provides more realistic uncertainty estimates. Selection of one approach over the other must therefore be guided by the carbon science questions being asked and the operational constraints under which the approaches are being applied...|$|E

40|$|A video {{contains}} {{a large amount}} of visual information. In order to obtain a compact, yet distinctive representation of a video, it is important to identify the most meaningful components of the video. Shot boundary detection is often used to break down a video into smaller, semantically meaningful temporal components. In this work, our goal is to identify key temporal segments in a video clip that are most relevant to a video event category. This is achieved by discovery of recurring visual concepts across the videos from a given event class. The temporal segments of a video where this key concept appears most frequently are then labeled as the most relevant components. As opposed to some techniques of video content summarization which find most relevant objects within a single video clip, we are interested in learning the key concepts that are representative of an event class. For automatic discovery of salient objects or visual structure in an event, we use deformable parts-based models (DPMs) with latent-SVM training [1].

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{ensemble}} filters, called the Diffuse Ensemble Filter (DEnF), is proposed in this paper. The DEnF assumes that the forecast errors orthogonal to the first guess ensemble are uncorrelated with the latter ensemble and have infinite variance. The assumption of infinite variance corresponds to the limit of "complete lack of knowledge" and differs dramatically from the implicit assumption made in most other ensemble filters, {{which is that the}} forecast errors orthogonal to the first guess ensemble have vanishing errors. The DEnF is independent of the detailed covariances assumed in the space orthogonal to the ensemble space, and reduces to conventional ensemble square root filters when the number of ensembles exceeds the model dimension. The DEnF is well defined only in data rich regimes and involves the inversion of relatively large matrices, although this barrier might be circumvented by variational methods. Two algorithms for solving the DEnF, namely the Diffuse Ensemble Kalman Filter (DEnKF) and the Diffuse Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (DETKF), are proposed and found to give comparable results. These filters generally converge to the traditional EnKF and ETKF, respectively, when the ensemble size exceeds the model dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the DEnF eliminates filter collapse, which occurs in ensemble Kalman filters for small ensemble sizes. Also, the use of the DEnF to initialize a conventional square <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> dramatically accelerates the spin-up time for convergence. However, in a perfect model scenario, the DEnF produces larger errors than ensemble square root filters that have covariance localization and inflation. For imperfect forecast models, the DEnF produces smaller errors than the ensemble square <b>root</b> <b>filter</b> with inflation. These experiments suggest that the DEnF has some advantages relative to the ensemble square root filters in the regime of small ensemble size, imperfect model, and copious observations...|$|E
