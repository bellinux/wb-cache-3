500|$|When Roebling {{was called}} to the Niagara Suspension Bridge project in 1851, he had six {{suspension}} structures to his name. [...] He found Ellet's final plan to be impractical; the bridge {{would have been too}} heavy and expensive. [...] Roebling had another design in mind: the double-deck bridge he had proposed earlier during the bidding. [...] The lower deck, level with the edge of the chasm, would convey passengers and carriages, and the upper deck, [...] above, would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non-stop, albeit at a speed of [...] [...] Roebling reasoned that the decks and sufficient trusses would form a <b>rigid</b> <b>tube,</b> making the bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge. [...] The theory was {{similar to that of the}} tubular bridge but implemented at a lower cost. [...] The engineering community was critical of Roebling's project. [...] Robert Stephenson, builder of the tubular Britannia Bridge, was among those short-listed to complete the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling's selection. [...] Stephenson had submitted a design for a tubular bridge, and in 1859 he built a large and expensive tubular bridge for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal, Quebec. [...] The bridge builder then said in derision of Roebling's suspension railway, [...] "If your bridge succeeds, mine is a magnificent blunder." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{velocity}} dependent {{changes in}} the impedance of flowing blood have been widely reported in the literature. These changes have been suggested {{as a source of}} the impedance change of the thorax measured during Impedance Cardiography techniques. In this study, a theoretical model incorporating red blood cell orientation, was developed to predict the impedance of pulsatile blood as it flows through <b>rigid</b> <b>tubes.</b> Experimental measurements were recorded for comparisons with the theoretical model. Bovine blood was pumped through <b>rigid</b> <b>tubes</b> in a mock circulatory system and its impedance and velocity were measured. Experimental and theoretical impedance and velocity waveforms are presented for a range of cardiac parameters such as pulse rate, stroke volume and systolic/ diastolic ratio. Comparisons show that the theoretical model successfully simulated features of the experimental waveforms. These were: 1) a difference between impedance during accelerating and decelerating flow at the same velocity, 2) an instantaneous impedance response to acceleration, and 3) a decay in impedance during deceleration to zero flow. Both the modelled and experimental impedance data also indicate a good cross correlation with the velocity (r= 0. 73 and 0. 65 respectively at a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute) ...|$|R
