Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. After controlling the ball, Larsson made a left footed <b>return</b> <b>pass</b> to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control the ball with his left foot. He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E
500|$|A good {{relationship}} quickly developed between Ramsey {{and his new}} manager, finding that they shared similar personalities and views on tactics. Like Ramsey, Rowe believed in a progressive, fast-moving style of play. These ideas evolved into [...] "push-and-run", a playing style unlike anything previously attempted in British football, based around quick passing. Tottenham pioneered the style to good effect—a Spurs player moving forward would lay the ball off to a teammate, then run past the opposing defender to receive an immediate <b>return</b> <b>pass.</b> [...] "Under Rowe, Alf became {{far more than a}} defender," [...] comments McKinstry. Rowe tasked him with instigating attacks and based much of the Tottenham game plan around Ramsey's accurate passing.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} league {{campaign}} {{at home to}} Fulham on 12 August 2007. A mistake by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, [...] "screw an attempted <b>return</b> <b>pass</b> against his own knee", allowed striker David Healy to score, just under 52 seconds. However, a late penalty scored by Robin van Persie and a goal from Alexander Hleb resulted in the team winning the match. In their next match, away to Blackburn Rovers, another error by Lehmann – this time letting David Dunn's shot slip through his fingers and into the goalnet, meant the team drew 1–1. Cesc Fàbregas scored the winning goal against Manchester City, ten minutes {{before the end of}} the match. The result was followed with what The Guardian described as a [...] "fluent attacking display" [...] at home to Portsmouth, on the first day of September. Arsenal faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur after a week-long international break and went a goal behind when Gareth Bale’s free-kick beat goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, past the net. Emmanuel Adebayor scored the equaliser in the second half, before Fàbregas [...] "piloted a 30-yarder beyond Paul Robinson in the 80th minute." [...] In stoppage time, Adebayor flicked the ball up and volleyed it into the top corner of Tottenham's goal; the result meant Arsenal went top of the league table, for the first time in the season. A week after, Adebayor scored a hat-trick (three goals) in a 5–0 win against Derby County. Van Persie scored the only goal against West Ham United on 29 September 2007 to maintain the lead at the top.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Give and go': This {{is a basic}} tactic {{which is}} {{essentially}} the same as 'pass and move', and {{is an essential part of}} the 'target man' style of play (see below). The player in possession of the ball plays a pass to a teammate and then immediately seeks to move into space. If the player who passed the ball can 'lose' his defensive marker (either through pace, movement, superior fitness or a lack of awareness on the part of the defender) he could then be free to receive a <b>return</b> <b>pass</b> and advance towards and possibly threaten the goal.

2500|$|Using the two-man {{combination}}. The 2-man combination pass, variously {{called the}} wall pass, the [...] "one-two", the [...] "give and go" [...] {{and other local}} names, is among the simplest yet most powerful team techniques in football. It requires a fair level of individual skill to pull off, yet this should not stop coaches from introducing it early in the higher youth leagues, nor should players from these leagues neglect it in favour of the all too easy [...] "kick and chase". There {{are two ways to}} execute it: (a) pass and run to space for the <b>return</b> <b>pass</b> without pausing or (b) pass then pause briefly to gauge opposing reaction before running into an open spot for the return. In tight conditions, the first method is better, while the second can be used where there is a bit more space to operate.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008–09 season, Bryson {{established}} himself as an important first team player, making thirty-three league appearances, thirty-one of them starts. His first goal of the season came in a Scottish League Cup second round match against Brechin City on 27 August 2008. Described variously as [...] "stunning", [...] "unstoppable", [...] "sublime" [...] and [...] "a thunderbolt", he scored the second in a 2–0 win when he received a cross from Garry Hay and flicked {{the ball into the}} top corner. His next two goals were late winners in successive matches: on 4 October in a 2–1 win at Hearts he made a well-timed run into the box in the 82nd minute to collect a <b>return</b> <b>pass</b> from Donovan Simmonds and finish well into the bottom corner; and then on 18 October he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home to Motherwell, slipping the ball into the net at the far post in the 89th minute after a deflected shot-cum-cross from Jamie Hamill. Manager Jim Jefferies praised Bryson after the win over Hearts, saying his late run into the box and finish was comparable to a move by Colin Cameron. He was also named man of the match after the win over Motherwell.|$|E
