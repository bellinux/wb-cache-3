30|$|The <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> {{lighting}} and those without lighting had slightly different posted speed limits. Since {{the effects of}} light conditions also seem to be slightly different on <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> very high speed limits and on <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> lower speed limits, <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> and without lighting cannot be compared based on the averages of the whole sets of roads.|$|R

5000|$|Swedish {{national}} road (Riksväg; literally: road of the rike/realm), are <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> <b>road</b> {{numbers from}} 1 through 99 in Sweden. The national roads are usually {{of high quality}} and sometimes pass through several counties. <b>Roads</b> <b>with</b> lower numbers are in southern Sweden, and <b>roads</b> <b>with</b> higher numbers are in northern Sweden. There are many cases where two or more routes in this system share the same physical road for a considerable distance, giving the country several kilometers of double-numbered road.|$|R

5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane <b>road</b> <b>with</b> a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E

5|$|A roadway has {{connected}} Benton City to Richland {{since at}} least 1926, while a <b>road</b> <b>with</b> an alignment more {{similar to that of}} the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH3. The highway now known as SR224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and Secondary highway numbers, replacing them with Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes.|$|E

In order to accommodate the ramps for Highway412, the highway is being shifted north at the interchange under construction.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage <b>road</b> <b>with</b> what eventually became Highway 82.
