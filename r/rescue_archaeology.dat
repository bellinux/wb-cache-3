5|$|While {{working as}} photojournalists, the Joneses {{continued}} to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 they began {{working as a}} freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works. At the time the Ministry {{was responsible for the}} upkeep of Ancient Monuments and, by extension, the large volume of <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> required to document archaeological sites before they were destroyed by the postwar construction boom. A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a number of such excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology.</b> Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{his stature}} within the archaeological establishment, the {{government}} appointed Wheeler as the British representative on a UNESCO project {{to undertake a}} programme of <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> in the Nile Valley ahead {{of the construction of}} the Aswan Dam, which was going to flood large areas of Egypt and Sudan. Personally securing UK funding for the project, he deemed it an issue of national and personal shame when he was unable to persuade the British government to supply additional funding for the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples. In October 1968, he took part in a UNESCO visit to Pakistan to assess the state of Mohenjo-daro, writing the project's report on how the archaeological site could best be preserved. His involvement with UNESCO continued {{for the rest of his}} life, and in March 1973 he was invited to the organisation's conference in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Born in Birkenhead, Jones {{first became}} {{involved}} in archaeology while studying at the University of Liverpool, where she volunteered on W. J. Varley's excavations. After graduating {{she worked as a}} wartime postal censor and freelance photojournalist, whilst continuing to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain. In 1956, Jones began working for the Ministry of Works as a freelance archaeologist in the burgeoning field of <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology.</b> She worked at a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at Mucking, a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging from the Stone Age to the Medieval period. The Mucking excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at Mucking, as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Archaeology {{became a}} {{professional}} {{activity in the}} first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when maritime archaeology and urban archaeology became more prevalent and <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.|$|E
25|$|During {{construction}} of the metro tunnels, artifacts of archaeological interest were discovered and <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> was employed. Teams of archaeologists worked ahead of, then with, engineers for six years, protecting and recording archaeological finds (streets, houses, cemeteries, sanctuaries, public workshops, foundry pits, kilns, aqueducts, wells, cisterns, drains and sewage tunnels). This afforded new insight into the city's ancient topography, through unprecedented infrastructure development combined with the study and preservation of archaeological data. Exhibitions of ancient artifacts or replicas are found {{at a number of}} metro stations, including Monastiraki and Syntagma.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2002, Odyssey {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the British government on a formula for sharing any potential spoils, under which Odyssey would get 80 percent of the proceeds up to $45 million, 50 percent from $45 million to $500 million and 40 percent above $500 million. The British government would get the rest. The company was poised to start the excavation in the late summer of 2003, according to the approved project plan and engaged Gifford and Partners to assist with archaeological aspects, but the project was delayed when Odyssey discovered and began excavating the SS Republic which continued until early 2003. The Sussex agreement was criticized by some archaeological organizations and charities, including the Council for British <b>Archaeology,</b> <b>Rescue,</b> and the Institute of Field Archaeologists, denouncing it as a dangerous precedent for the [...] "ransacking" [...] of shipwrecks by private firms under the aegis of archaeological research. An early day motion was signed by 60 British MPs condemning the treasure hunting.|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{heritage}} management (CHM) is the vocation {{and practice}} of managing cultural heritage. It is a branch of cultural resources management (CRM), although it also draws on the practices of cultural conservation, restoration, museology, archaeology, history and architecture. While the term cultural heritage is generally used in Europe, in the USA the term cultural resources is in more general use specifically referring to cultural heritage resources. CHM has traditionally been concerned with the identification, interpretation, maintenance, and preservation of significant cultural sites and physical heritage assets, although intangible aspects of heritage, such as traditional skills, cultures and languages are also considered. The subject typically receives most attention, and resources, {{in the face of}} threat, where the focus is often upon <b>rescue</b> or salvage <b>archaeology.</b> Possible threats include urban development, large-scale agriculture, mining activity, looting, erosion or unsustainable visitor numbers. The public face of CHM, and a significant source of income to support continued management of heritage, is the interpretation and presentation to the public, where it is an important aspect of tourism. Communicating with government and the public is therefore a key competence.|$|R
500|$|Jones' career {{took place}} against a {{backdrop}} of increasing professionalization and commercialization of archaeology, which Jones herself had a hand in birthing. During her work as a freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works in the 1950s and 60s, Jones saw the rapid destruction of archaeological sites by construction and development, and bemoaned the lack of resources allocated to properly documenting it. Jones and her colleagues were paid only a day-rate for time spent digging and the costs directly incurred, precluding any post-excavation analysis or publication of their finds. Although Mucking was the largest excavation in the country for over a decade, she ran it on a shoestring budget, relying heavily on volunteer labour. In 1973 she was involved in founding the campaign group Rescue, which lobbied for increased government funding for <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology.</b> This initiative was ultimately successful, increasingly shifting the labour of pre-development excavation from volunteers to professional archaeologists, and culminating in the creation of modern commercial archaeology with the publication of Planning Policy Guidance Note 16 in 1991. According to her obituarist Mike Pitts, Jones also influenced the formation of modern <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> in Britain by demonstrating [...] "dogged salvage excavation on a grand scale" [...] at Mucking.|$|E
500|$|Fresh {{work in the}} 1970s and 1980s {{challenged}} both Postan's and Marxist {{approaches to}} the medieval economy. Local studies of medieval economics, often in considerable detail and fusing new archaeological techniques and <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> with historical sources, often ran counter to their broader interpretations of change and development. The degree to which feudalism really existed and operated in England after the initial years of the invasion was thrown into considerable doubt, with historians such as David Crouch arguing that it existed primarily as a legal and fiscal model, rather than an actual economic system. Sociological and anthropological studies of contemporary economies, including the work of Ester Boserup showed many flaws with Postan's key assumptions about demography and land use. The current academic preference is to see the English medieval economy as an [...] "overlapping network of diverse communities", in which active local choices and decisions {{are the result of}} independent agency, rather than a result of historically deterministic processes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 a {{committee}} {{was formed in}} order to mount a third, and even larger excavation at Sutton Hoo. Backed by the Society of Antiquaries of London, the committee proposed an investigation to be led by Philip Rahtz from the University of York and Rupert Bruce-Mitford, but the British Museum's reservations led to the committee deciding to collaborate with the Ashmolean Museum. The committee recognised that much had changed in archaeology since the early 1970s. The Conservatives' privatisation policies signalled a decrease in state support for such projects, whilst the emergence of post-processualism in archaeological theory moved many archaeologists toward focussing on concepts such as social change. The Ashmolean's involvement convinced the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries to help fund the project. In 1982, Martin Carver from the University of York was appointed to run the excavation, with a research design aimed at exploring [...] "the politics, social organisation and ideology" [...] of Sutton Hoo. Despite opposition by those who considered that funds available could be better used for <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology,</b> in 1983 the project went ahead.|$|E
2500|$|The Alemanni sacked {{the city}} in the 280s, and neither Aventicum nor its {{hinterland}} recovered from both the impact of the attack and the subsequent changes of the Roman frontier which no longer granted security to the area. By the collapse of Rome in the 5th century, this area was already fully under the control of Germanic tribes whose dialects became the basis for Swiss German. In the 6th century some Christian life continued in the acropolis of the Roman town- the amphitheatre became a fortress as did the theatre. By the 7th century, however, the focus of the church had moved to Lausanne, Aventicum is only mentioned as an old ruined city though it had fallen into ruins previously. Over the following centuries it is mentioned but always as ruins. In 1710 Marquard Wild was the first to argue that Aveticum had been the capital of Helvetia, and not Antre as was formerly believed. In 1783-86 the Marquess of Northampton led an archeological expedition to Aventicum and in 1788 he put his discoveries on display. His discoveries encouraged many treasure seekers to travel to Aventicum to search for artifacts. In response to the finds, the Musée Vespasien was opened in 1824. In 1838 it was taken over by the Canton of Vaud, renamed the Roman Museum, and installed in the tower of the Amphitheatre. In 1884 the association Pro Aventico was founded with a goal of discovering and preserving the ruins. Aventicum was a well-known location in the Grand Tour and Joseph William Mallord Turner made a drawing of the [...] "Cigognier", which interestingly shows the old town behind. Archaeology benefitted curiously from the first and second world wars when foreigners interned in Switzerland, and local unemployed, were engaged to excavate the main buildings of the Roman city and to renovate and open to the public the theatre, [...] "Cigognier" [...] and the gates and one tower of the wall. With the advent of the national highway scheme in the late 1960s a programme of <b>rescue</b> <b>archaeology</b> was set up under the association [...] "Pro Aventico" [...] under the remarkably capable direction of Professor Hans Bogli, after whom the Roman museum has since been named. Early work uncovered the Forum and associated temple area including a possible [...] "Capitoleum". In 1985 during the construction of the A1 highway, further portions of the Roman town were discovered. In 1987 the road was moved to avoid the site. Further and extensive work over the succeeding decades opened up much of the insulae- the rectangular street system of the focus of the Roman town. Much of the area within the walls was not a densely occupied city at all, but rather, like Rome itself, was occupied by [...] "urban villas', large houses surrounded by substantial tracts of garden and small-holdings. The more recent work also uncovered a remarkable palace building, much of the centre of the Roman town, and outside the walls a canal and roadway leading from the nearby lake, doubtless assisting in the transport of stone from the Jura by lake and canal, and cemeteries and aqueducts outside the line of the Roman walls. Pro Aventico is also responsible for the constant round of restoration of the buildings opened up {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, including sections of the wall and the original Roman tower-raised and protected through its use as a mediaeval watch tower, and the northern gate.|$|E

Excavations of historic farmsteads have indicated that many mid- and late nineteenth century families lived in well constructed, frame dwellings. Log buildings were not as common as once believed.
