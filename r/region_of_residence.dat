METHODS: All Black deaths from circulatory diseases (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision. codes 390 through 459) were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics mortality detail files for 1979 through 1991. Age-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated {{for males and females}} for combinations <b>of</b> five <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> at birth and four <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> at death. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality rates from circulatory diseases than females in every regional combination <b>of</b> birthplace and <b>residence</b> at death. For both genders, the highest rates were for those who were born in the South but died in the Midwest; the lowest rates were for those who were born in the West but died in the South. Excess mortality for both Southern-born males and females begins at ages 25 through 44. CONCLUSIONS: There is a region-of-birth component that affects mortality risk from circulatory diseases regardless <b>of</b> gender or <b>residence</b> at time <b>of</b> death.

In Beer Sheva, a major center for immigrant absorption in Israel, a primary objective was to evaluate their health status and to refer them for care. 137 Cs levels in 1228 men, women, and children were measured with a portable whole-body counter. Whole-body counts showed clear correlation with the degree of 137 Cs ground contamination in previous <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> The population could thus be sub-divided according to degree of exposure, based on previous <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence.</b> The thyroid status of 300 local immigrant children was evaluated because of the increased risk of childhood thyroid cancer in the regions from which they came. This group was subdivided into comparative groups of children who came from less and more contaminated areas according to the International Atomic Energy Agency soil 137 Cs contamination maps. Enlarged thyroids were found in about 40 % of both groups. One 12 -year-old girl from Gomel had a malignant papillary carcinoma. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, though within normal limits, were significantly greater (p < 0. 02) for girls from high exposure regions.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined A common {{finding of}} 30 – 40 years of family {{migration}} studies worldwide {{is that such}} migration primarily benefits the careers of men in couples but generally damages the women’s careers. Findings have recently become more nuanced as the research focus has broadened, hinting that families returning to one spouse’s <b>region</b> <b>of</b> previous <b>residence</b> might deviate from this general observation of men as gainers. The present research demonstrates that when families migrate to regions where one spouse has previously lived, it is the female spouse who tends to return, the male spouse (and children, if any) accompanying her as a trailing spouse. This result also holds when restricting attention to those few families in which the female spouse experiences the greatest income increase by moving. There {{is no evidence of}} a tradeoff between returning to a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> previous <b>residence</b> and career development. The findings suggest that women compensate for the slighter economic gains with greater non-monetary gains...|$|R

50|$|The Central Sava Statistical Region (Zasavska statistična regija) is a {{statistical}} region in Slovenia. This statistical {{region in the}} Sava Hills is the smallest region {{in the country in}} terms of both area and population. In mid-2013 almost 43,300 people lived on 264 km², meaning that together with the Central Slovenia Statistical Region it is the most densely populated statistical region. The natural and geographic features of this region create conditions for industrial activities and {{more than a third of}} gross value added is still generated by manufacturing, mining, and other industry. In 2013, the region once again recorded the highest negative annual population growth rate (−11.9‰), which was mainly a result of migration to other statistical regions. Among all statistical regions in 2013, this region had the highest negative net migration between regions; namely, −9.5. This region also stands out by age of mothers at childbirth.In 2013 first-time mothers in the region were on average 28.5 years old, whereas first-time mothers in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region were on average 1 year older. In the same year, the number of unemployed persons increased further. The registered unemployment rate was among the highest in the country (16.6%). In comparison with other regions, this is 7 percentage points more than in the region with the lowest registered unemployment rate, Upper Carniola, and almost 1 percentage point less than in the region with the highest unemployment rate, the Mura Statistical Region. According to the labour migration index, this is the most residential statistical region.

Although [...] "local and federal governments implemented social protection programs so as to alleviate poverty conditions and interregional disparities, in general, conditions for indigenous people remain unchanged," [...] (Gonzales cited World Bank, 2005). Studies have shown that ethnicity is an important cause for inequality in income distribution, access to basic health care services and education, which in turn explain the significant difference in earnings between indigenous and non-indigenous people. According to the World Bank, about three-quarters of indigenous peoples in Mexico are poor and the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous groups is very high; the difference in poverty has been divided into explained and unexplained components. The explained components are [...] "the amount of the gap attributed to observable characteristics such as education, age, occupation, <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and so on," [...] (World Bank, 2005) which account for three quarters of poverty. The unexplained components {{are related to the}} level of discrimination and explain a quarter of the poverty.
