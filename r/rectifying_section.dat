For example, in Figure 1, assuming the molar flow rate of the reflux L is 1000 moles per hour and the molar flow rate of the distillate D is 590 moles per hour, then the downward slope of the rectifying operating line is 1000 / (590 + 1000) = 0.63 which means that the y-coordinate of any point on the line decreases 0.63 units for each unit that the x-coordinate decreases.|$|E

This study is carried out to influence the unwanted side product dibutylether formation, produced by butanol dehydration. First of all, activity based intrinsic reaction kinetics for the main reaction (esterification) and the side reaction (etherification) have been developed. Effect of various parameters such as temperature, mole ratio, catalyst loading and catalyst particle size was studied. The intrinsic kinetic parameters related to Pseudohomogeneous (PH), Eley-Rideal (RE), Langmuir Hinshelwood Hougen Watson (LHHW), and modified LHHW (ML) models were developed. Good agreement between the model predictions and experimental data were obtained. For the main reaction RE model or modified LHHW model and for the side reaction LHHW model are appropriate representations of intrinsic kinetics.

40|$|Abstract — Currently, {{distillation}} columns consume {{a large amount}} of energy in petroleum and alcohol industry. This has {{led to the development of}} a new internal configuration in the {{distillation columns}} called Heat-Integrated Distillation Column (HIDiC). In this configuration the column is composed for two concentric sections called rectifying and stripping. The heat transfer is conducted from the <b>rectifying</b> <b>section</b> (which works at higher pressure and temperature) to the stripping section (which works at lower pressure and temperature) forming a fractionating column. The HIDiC offers great potential to reduce energy consumption compared to the conventional column. However, the complexity of the proposed configuration justifies the need of rigorous simulations that enable a better understanding of the column operation. In this work, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) was used to study the heat transfer in a concentric stage of a HIDiC column.

40|$|Analytical {{transfer}} function matrices are developed for describing the dynamic behaviour of the compositions within the <b>rectifying</b> and stripping <b>sections</b> of both very short and very long distillation columns, {{in response to}} changes in energy and liquid throughout. Matrices of first-order lags are shown to describe both situations very closely and the simple structure of the models demonstrates the need to consider only steady-state operating curves {{for the elimination of}} interaction problems arising in twin product control. The models are useable directly by the plant or design engineer who merely needs to substitute basic design data to obtain good estimates of all the model parameter values. An elementary inverse Nyquist approach is presented which predicts precisely the extent of the detuning of one composition control loop by closing the other loop. The long column model is shown to have much in common with models produced by other authors who have used widely different and usually partly-empirical approaches to column modelling. The analytical approach here proves, for specified conditions, the empirical observations relied upon by these previous workers. The modelling method used here involves the solution of the process partial differential equation at high frequency and the discrete process equations at low frequency. The two resulting models join together quite naturally because of their structural similarity. It is believed that the approach could find application in separation processes generally. ...|$|R

We show that one can identify the feasible product and possible column profile regions for the batch rectifier, stripper and middle vessel columns using methods developed for continuous distillation. Extractive distillation has been used for continuous and rectifying batch columns in separating azeotropic mixtures by feeding an extractive agent, normally a high boiler, {{near the top of the}} column. Using insights developed for continuous distillation, we compare extractive distillation using the batch rectifier and middle vessel column and show that these columns can theoretically recover all of the pure distillate product from an azeotropic feed.

One of the promising methods is {{recovery of}} acrylic acid from wastewater through esterification. Acrylic acid could be converted to acrylic ester while wastewater could be purified. To date, study about esterification by using diluted acrylic acid has not been reported in the literature. In this present work, a simulation study on the direct utilization of dilute acrylic acid in the production of n-butyl acrylate via esterification with n-butanol in a reactive distillation column was presented. The reaction is heterogeneously catalyzed by ion exchanged resin (Amberlyst- 46). A pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model was used to describe the reaction kinetics. An equilibrium stage model was applied and the proposed model was validated with experimental data from past research study. The validated model was then used to study effect of various parameters like acrylic acid concentration, catalyst loading, reboiler duty, reflux ratio, number of trays in reactive section and number of trays in separation section. From this study, {{it can be seen that}} the best operating conditions in recovering 4 % w/w acrylic acid from the wastewater stream were with a catalyst loading of 0. 105 kg/m, reboiler duty of 283. 133 kJ/hr, reflux ratio of 1. 0 and finally with 7 trays in the reactive section and 2 trays in the <b>rectifying</b> and stripping <b>section</b> respectively. With these operating conditions, 95. 245 % of AA managed to be converted into BA. The findings have proven the feasibility of the acrylic acid recovery via esterification in reactive distillation column and it serves as the groundwork for the detailed column design and experimental study in the futur...|$|R
