5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b <b>rectangle</b> with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the <b>rectangle</b> using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual <b>rectangle</b> untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual <b>rectangle</b> with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual <b>rectangle</b> r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual <b>rectangle,</b> i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual <b>rectangle</b> exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original <b>rectangle.</b> For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original <b>rectangle</b> (shown in green).|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red <b>Rectangle</b> nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red <b>Rectangle</b> approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) — which may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth — in a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} <b>rectangle</b> {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the <b>rectangle</b> into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attacks the}} {{following}} problem. We {{are given a}} large number N of <b>rectangles</b> in the plane, each with horizontal and vertical sides, and also a number r<N. The given list of N <b>rectangles</b> may contain duplicates. The problem is to find r of these <b>rectangles,</b> such that, if they are discarded, then {{the intersection of the}} remaining (N-r) <b>rectangles</b> has an intersection with as large an area as possible. We will find an upper bound, depending only on N and r, and not on the particular data presented, for the number of steps needed to run the algorithm on (a mathematical model of) a computer. In fact our algorithm is able to determine, for each s< r, s <b>rectangles</b> from the given list of N <b>rectangles,</b> such that the remaining (N-s) <b>rectangles</b> have as large an area as possible, and this takes hardly any more time than taking care only of the case s=r.

40|$|The {{combinatorial}} optimization problem considered {{in this paper}} is a special two dimensional cutting stock problem arising in the wood, metal and glass industry. Given a demand of non oriented small <b>rectangles</b> and a theoretically in nite set of large stock <b>rectangles</b> of given lengths and widths, {{the aim is to}} generate layouts with minimal waste, specifying how to cut the demand out of the stock <b>rectangles.</b> Special restrictions are chosen with respect to the production conditions of the at glass industry. An iterative algorithm for solving this problem heuristically is developed. By a maximum weight matching suitable <b>rectangles</b> are matched in every iteration step and the matched pairs are considered as new, so called meta <b>rectangles.</b> These meta <b>rectangles</b> can be treated {{in the same way as}} ordinary <b>rectangles.</b> Furthermore, by the use of shape functions the orientations of the demand <b>rectangles</b> are not xed until the layout has been computed. The algorithm, programmed in C, has been tested with several instances, containing between 52 and 161 <b>rectangles,</b> taken from real demands of a glass factory.

The fundamental region is a shape such as a <b>rectangle</b> that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license.

Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt <b>rectangle</b> to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet.
