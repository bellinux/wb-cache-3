To ensure the proper operation of such systems, manufacturers of integrated circuits and sensors intended for the military aerospace markets adopt various methods of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening.</b> An overview of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques for IC design is given in this study. First, seven major radiation damage sources, two fundamental damage mechanisms, five sorts of end-user effects and six types of single-event effects are introduced, followed by the brief introduction of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques. Secondly, typical physical <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques are introduced. Thirdly, typical logical <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques are introduced. Fourthly, we propose our <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> scheme for microwave power amplifier chip design.

2500|$|The Pixel Detector, the {{innermost}} {{part of the}} detector, contains three concentric layers and three disks on each end-cap, {{with a total of}} 1,744 [...] modules, each measuring 2centimetres by 6centimetres. [...] The detecting material is 250µm thick silicon. [...] Each module contains 16 readout chips and other electronic components. The smallest unit that can be read out is a pixel (50 by 400micrometres); there are roughly 47,000pixels per module. [...] The minute pixel size is designed for extremely precise tracking very close to the interaction point. [...] In total, the Pixel Detector has over 80 million readout channels, which is about 50% of the total readout channels of the whole experiment. Having such a large count created a considerable design and engineering challenge. Another challenge was the radiation to which the Pixel Detector is exposed because of its proximity to the interaction point, requiring that all components be <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> in order to continue operating after significant exposures.|$|E
2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardened</b> {{transistors}} and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they are doing is bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E

50|$|One {{technique}} {{that can be}} used to reduce the soft error rate in digital circuits is called <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening.</b> This involves increasing thecapacitance at selected circuit nodes in order to increase its effective Qcrit value. This reduces the range of particle energiesto which the logic value of the node can be upset. <b>Radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> is often accomplished by increasing the size of transistors who sharea drain/source region at the node. Since the area and power overhead of <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> can be restrictive to design, the technique is often applied selectively to nodes which are predicted to have the highest probability of resulting in soft errors if struck. Tools and models that canpredict which nodes are most vulnerable are the subject of past and current research in the area of soft errors.|$|R

40|$|The CERN/RD 50 {{collaboration}} {{is dedicated to}} the <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> of semiconductor sensors for future super-collider needs. The findings of this collaboration are therefore especially relevant to the pixel devices for the LHC experiment upgrades. A considerable amount of results on the enhancement of the radiation tolerance of silicon sensors has been found within RD 50. The research towards <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> has highlighted, and increased the knowledge on properties of sensors that are relevant to other applications. For example <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> relies on the speed of signal collection in irradiated devices. As a consequence, the methods envisaged for increasing this collection speed turn out to be promising for significantly improving the performance of time resolved, high spatial resolution systems. A new type of device processing strongly emerging for production of future pixel sensor systems is the HV-CMOS technology.

40|$|Although {{system-level}} <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> can {{enable the}} use of high-performance components and enhance the capabilities of a spacecraft, hardening techniques can be costly and can compromise the very performance designers sought from the high-performance components. Moreover, such techniques often result in a complicated design, especially if several complex commercial microcircuits are used, each posing its own hardening challenges. The latter risk is particularly acute for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components since high-performance parts (e. g. double-data-rate synchronous dynamic random access memories - DDR SDRAMs) may require other high-performance commercial parts (e. g. processors) to support their operation. For these reasons, {{it is essential that}} system-level <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> be a coordinated effort, from setting requirements through testing up to and including validation...|$|R

40|$|A gate-level <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> {{technique}} for cost– effective {{reduction of the}} soft error failure rate in combinational logic circuits is described. The key idea is to exploit the asymmetric logical masking probabilities of gates, hardening gates that have the lowest logical masking probability to achieve cost– effective tradeoffs between overhead and soft error failure rate reduction. The asymmetry in the logical masking probabilities at a gate is leveraged by decoupling the physical from the logical (Boolean) aspects of soft error susceptibility of the gate. Gates are hardened to single-event upsets (SEUs) with specified worst case characteristics in increasing order of their logical masking probability, thereby maximizing {{the reduction in the}} soft error failure rate for specified overhead costs (area, power, and delay). Gate sizing for <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> uses a novel gate (transistor) sizing technique that is both efficient and accurate. A full set of experimental results for process technologies ranging from 180 to 70 nm demonstrates the cost-effective tradeoffs that can be achieved. On average, the proposed technique has a <b>radiation</b> <b>hardening</b> overhead of 38. 3 %, 27. 1 %, and 3. 8 % in area, power, and delay for worst case SEUs across the four process technologies...|$|R
