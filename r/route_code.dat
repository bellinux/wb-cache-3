2500|$|Where {{there is}} a large number of {{possible}} routes, splitting signals are unsuitable because they would be easily confused, and route indicators are used instead. These consist of a black background, mounted under a single stop signal, on which is superimposed a white letter(s), number(s) or combination of the two, to make a code indicating the route to be taken. For example, if the possible routes were to Cambridge and to Norwich, a Norwich-bound train might be shown 'N' and a Cambridge-bound train 'C'. The <b>route</b> <b>code</b> is only shown when the signal is off. In semaphore areas, route indicators may be mechanical, with boards that slide into view to display the code; or electric [...] "theatre-type", with a light projected through a suitably-printed screen.|$|E

50|$|There {{are signs}} marking {{the start and}} end of an {{expressway}} at its entry and exit points respectively. The expressways are also assigned <b>route</b> <b>codes</b> consisting three letters that form their respective initials, making the Singaporean expressway network as the only highway system with <b>route</b> <b>coding</b> system. The Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System is used on all the expresswaysâ€”cameras are used for live monitoring of expressway conditions, and LED signboards display information messages, such as warnings of any disruptions to the normal flow of traffic, as well as estimated travel times. The longest expressway, the Pan Island Expressway, is only 41 km long and therefore has no rest areas.|$|R

50|$|On the Southern Railway, {{a single}} {{alphabetic}} character system of denoting routes used on suburban lines {{grew into a}} two character route-based system. This was developed {{at the same time}} as a significant programme of electrification and the consequent introduction of a large number of multiple unit trains. Many of these trains were fitted with display devices to show the <b>route</b> <b>code</b> instead of a lamp or disc-based headcode. Originally this was a back-lit stencil with the single letter code, later a two-character roller-blind system was used. The code system had equivalence with the lamp or disc route-based headcodes in assisting signallers with routing trains.|$|E

50|$|Website {{monitoring}} companies provide organizations {{the ability}} to consistently monitor a website, or server function, and observe how it responds. The monitoring is often conducted from several locations {{around the world to}} a specific website, or server, in order to detect issues related to general Internet latency, network hop issues, and to pinpoint errors. Monitoring companies generally report on these tests in a variety of reports, charts and graphs. When an error is detected monitoring services send out alerts via email, SMS, phone, SNMP trap, pager that may include diagnostic information, such as a network trace <b>route,</b> <b>code</b> capture of a web page's HTML file, a screen shot of a webpage, and even a video of a website failing. These diagnostics allow network administrators and webmasters to correct issues faster.|$|E
50|$|Sandy Bay Road is a road in Tasmania {{that connects}} the southeastern edge of the Hobart CBD with the southeastern suburb of Taroona. It is two-way over its {{entirety}} and is 12 kilometres in length. It begins as a continuation of Harrington Street near where it intersects with Davey Street. From there, Sandy Bay Road travels southwards alongside {{the western edge of}} St. Davids Park, bypassing Battery Point. It then turns slightly to the west again, before descending a small hill towards the south-east once more, into Sandy Bay proper. Sand Bay Road then continues south-easterly, hugging the western shore of the River Derwent. Passing Wrest Point Hotel Casino it continues to the south-east along Sandy Bay Beach through Lower Sandy Bay. At the point where the Alexandra Battery overlooks Long Beach, Sandy Bay road follows the coast bending in a more southwards direction. The road then begins to climb uphill towards the suburb of Taroona where it becomes the Channel Highway. The road is allocated <b>route</b> <b>code</b> B68.|$|E

40|$|RSPY, the routing ispy, is a {{transputer}} network worm explorer {{program that}} uses a generalised code routing system. This document describes the structure and operation of RSPY. Useful background information on writing a program to explore an array of transputers is contained in [1]. Section 2 below gives {{a brief overview of}} the RSPY system, defining the concepts and terminology used; section 3 examines each module in more detail. Finally, section 4 describes how to use RSPY to run an arbitrary piece of code on every node in the network. Two versions of RSPY exist: hosted and transputer. Both use the same worms to determine and route the network; they differ {{in the manner in which}} the worms are started. The description below concentrates on the hosted version; differences in the transputer version can be found in section 3. RSPY can be divided into two parts: the various worms, which boot and explore the network and then <b>route</b> <b>code</b> to the desired node; and the controller, which runs on the host, supports the operation of the worms, and presents the final results to the user. RSPY starts with a link to a network containing an undefined number of processors, each in an un-defined state. The first task, therefore, is to find what each node is and how they are connected to each other. To do this, code is loaded on the first node which probes each of its links in turn. I...|$|E

The former White Rose service from London King's Cross to Leeds ran with a prefix of 1X due to the train's unusually long length.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} two samples of a nominal composition Bi 1. 6 Pb 0. 4 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox were {{prepared by the}} solid state reaction method, using two different <b>routes.</b> <b>Codes</b> A and B are {{used to refer to}} the two samples. In preparing sample A, the standard method for calcination was used, while for sample B, the SrCO 3 and CaCO 3 were calcinated at 1100 â„ƒ for 3 h. Calcination was done separately on SrCO 3 and CaCO 3 in order to eliminate CO 2 . Then after mixing and grinding, the powder mixtures of Bi 2 O 3 , CuO, PbO, SrO and CaO were calcinated at 840 â„ƒ for 70 h. Also, the samples (samples C) of nominal compositions Bi 1. 6 Pb 0. 4 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox+ % x Gd 2 O 3 (% x = 0, 3, 5, 7 and 9) have been synthesized by this method.
