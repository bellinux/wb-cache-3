5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted <b>red</b> <b>valerian,</b> which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E

60|$|The reds we {{like best}} in flowers are the {{delicate}} roseate and pinky shades; {{they are more}} to us than the purest and most luminous tints. And here, as with bird notes which delight us on account of their resemblance to fresh, young, highly musical human voices, flowers please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tints--the apple blossom and the bindweed, musk mallow and almond and wild rose, for example. After these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and not too luminous reds--the red which we admire in the red horse-chestnut blossom, and many other flowers, down to the minute pimpernel. Next come the intense rosy reds seen in the herb-robert and other wild geraniums, <b>valerian,</b> <b>red</b> campion and ragged robin; and this shade of red, intensified but still soft, {{is seen in the}} willow-herb and foxglove, and, still more intensified, in the bell- and small-leafed heath. Some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple in them, and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal to us {{in the same way that}} red flowers do, receiving their expression from the same cause. There is some purple colour in most skins, and even some blue.|$|R

The wiles of women of the world he knows too well; but a pretty little ingénue can twist him round her finger. They rowed on and on, till they drew abreast of Seamew's island. It is a jagged stack or skerry, well out to sea, very wild and precipitous on the landward side, but shelving gently outward; perhaps an acre in extent, with steep gray cliffs, covered at that time with crimson masses of <b>red</b> <b>valerian.</b> Mrs. Granton rowed up close to it. [...] "Oh, what lovely flowers!" [...] she cried, throwing {{her head back and}} gazing at them. [...] "I wish I could get some! Let's land here and pick them. Sir Charles, you shall gather me a nice bunch for my sitting-room." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} nine years old, perhaps {{a month or}} two more, when during one of my rambles on horseback I found at a {{distance}} of two or three miles from home, a flower that was new to me. The plant, a little over a foot in height, was growing in the shelter of some large cardoon thistle, or wild artichoke, bushes. It had three stalks clothed with long, narrow, sharply-pointed leaves, which were downy, soft to the feel like the leaves of our great mullein, and pale green in colour. All three stems were crowned with clusters of flowers, the single flower a little larger than that of the <b>red</b> <b>valerian,</b> of a pale red hue and a peculiar shape, as each small pointed petal had a fold or twist at the end. Altogether it was slightly singular in appearance and pretty, though not to be compared with scores of other flowers of the plains for beauty. Nevertheless it had an extraordinary fascination for me, and from the moment of its discovery it became one of my sacred flowers. From that time onwards, when riding on the plain, I was always on the look-out for it, and as a rule I found three or four plants in a season, but never more than one at any spot. They were usually miles apart.|$|E

50|$|The {{residential}} {{garden of}} 1864 contains a functional kitchen garden and a typical garden for recreational purposes {{in the upper}} classes of the mid 19th century. The {{central part of the}} garden is composed of a large round section with columbine, larkspur, dianthus and <b>red</b> <b>valerian</b> in addition to numerous other plants and flowers typical of this time. The kitchen garden is separated from the recreational garden and contains typical vegetables and herbs in addition to many lesser known plants not commonly used today.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{quite large}} and heavy moth with a {{wingspan}} of 50-60 mm. The forewings are quite variable from light brown to almost black. The darker individuals {{often have a}} pale streak along the costa. The hindwings are bright orange-yellow with a black sub-terminal band. As with other Noctua species (and numerous other insects), this contrast of bland-on-land and bright-in-flight is used to confuse potential predators. This species flies at night from July to September [...] and is attracted to light, sometimes in huge numbers. It will also visit flowers such as Buddleia, ragwort, and <b>red</b> <b>valerian.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This is a quite {{variable}} species, forewings {{ranging from}} pale to dark brown but always recognizable by the distinctively shaped dark stigmata which give it its common name. The hindwings are whitish (compared with other common Agrotis species the hindwings {{of this species}} are usually paler than in heart and club but darker than in turnip moth). The wingspan is 35-44 mm. This species usually has a dark area {{at the front of}} the thorax, visible as a horizontal bar when viewing the moth head-on. This moth flies at night from May to July [...] and is attracted to light, sometimes in large numbers. It also frequently visits nectar-rich flowers such as Buddleia, ragwort and <b>red</b> <b>valerian.</b>|$|E

The presence of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in the diseased plants was demonstrated by the reactions of test plants, electron microscopy, serology and RT-PCR. On the basis of highest identities and closest phylogenetic relationships, CMV from C. ruber was most closely related to CMV subgroup I A. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled by back-inoculating healthy C. ruber seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Free {{radicals}} {{have been}} implicated in various pathological conditions such as, stroke, aging and ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. The role of antioxidants in protection from {{the harmful effects of}} free radicals has long been recognized. Trapping extremely reactive free radicals and eliminating them from circulation {{has been shown to be}} effective in animal models. Nitrone-based free radical traps have been extensively explored in biological systems. Examples include nitrones such as PBN, NXY- 059, MDL- 101, 002, DMPO and EMPO. However, these nitrones have extremely high oxidation potentials as compared to natural antioxidants such as Vitamin E (á-tocopherol), and glutathione. Becker et al. (1995) synthesized novel azulenyl nitrones, which were shown to have oxidation potentials much lower than that of any of the previously reported nitrone based spin traps. Another azulenyl nitrone derivative, stilbazulenyl nitrone (STAZN), was shown to have an even lower oxidation potential within the range of natural antioxidants. STAZN, a second generation free radical trap, was found to be markedly superior than the two most studied nitrones, PBN and NXY- 059, in animal models of cerebral ischemia and in an in vitro assay of lipid peroxidation. In this study, a third generation azulenyl nitrone was synthesized with an electron donating group on the previously synthesized STAZN derivative with the aim to lower the oxidation potential even more. Pseudoazulenes, because of the presence of an annular heteroatom, have been reported to possess even lower oxidation potential than that of the azulenyl counterpart. Therefore, pseudoazulenyl nitrones were synthesized for the first time by extracting and elaborating valtrate from the roots of Centranthus ruber (<b>Red</b> <b>valerian</b> or Jupiter’s beard). Several pseudoazulenyl nitrones were synthesized by using a facile experimental protocol. The physical and biological properties of these pseudoazulenyl nitrones can be easily modified by simply changing the substituent on the heteroatom. Cyclic voltammetry experiments have shown that these pseudoazulenyl nitrones do indeed have low oxidation potentials. The oxidation potential of these nitrones was lowered even more by preparing derivatives bearing an electron donating group at the 3 -position of the five membered ring of the pseudoazulenyl nitrone...|$|E
