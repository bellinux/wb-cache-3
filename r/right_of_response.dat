It {{argues that the}} action of the police officers who shot and killed Menezes was conditioned by same logic that informs the prosecution of the war on terror. This logic bares comparison to the humanist conviction that states possess a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> where they perceive themselves to have a `fear' of impending injury or assault. This paper explores the historical lineage of this trope in the writings of Alberico Gentili, Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and, humanist thought more generally. The aim is to explore the politics of fear at work in Britain in the political climate defined by the war on terror, with a view to ascertaining how deep it runs and whether a politics of trust might offer a possible remedy to it...|$|E
40|$|Response latency - {{the time}} taken to {{initiate}} or complete an action or task - {{is one of}} the principal measures used to investigate the mechanisms subserving human and animal cognitive processes. The <b>right</b> tails <b>of</b> <b>response</b> latency distributions have received little attention in experimental psychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been considered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected to reflect &#x 27;contingent&#x 27; neural events unrelated to the experimental question. Most current theories predict the <b>right</b> tail <b>of</b> <b>response</b> latency distributions to decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends discarding very long response latencies as &#x 27;outliers&#x 27;. Here, I show that the <b>right</b> tails <b>of</b> <b>response</b> latency distributions always follow a power-law with a slope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be considered outliers.

However, {{drawing on}} the literature, {{it is safe to}} assume measures such as sex, previous educational qualifications, age, and social media presence, which have been used in previously, are a good starting point (Koutropoulos et al. 2014; Simpson 2006). It is important during the next stage to formalize a method of data capture that is neither controversial ethically or problematic conceptually. In any system that collects and utilizes personal data privacy concerns arise and questions are raised, including “Who keeps and who owns the record of personal preferences? Can individuals view their own records, and what <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>response</b> do they have if that information is wrong? What happens if this information is released deliberately or is stolen in a security breach?” (Ashman et al. 2014). These are important points to consider in any system and when addressing such issues, it is important to protect privacy by restricting access to data by adding certification or access control to the data entries and by anonymizing data such that sensitive information cannot be pinpointed to an individual (Wu et al. 2014). A related issue arises in the next stage of data capture as information must be collected reliably to ensure that the mechanisms through which we undertake this collection are secure and deliver unmolested results. Furthermore, in striking a balance between privacy and data, {{it is also important to}} capture data that encompasses the widest possible demographic to ensure that we are sampling the breadth of samples as to not distort the results. However, in the experience of the authors, the above is rarely likely to be total in its participation. Indeed, how does one measure a student who does not exist in terms of the metrics defined? Nevertheless, the following approach assumes total engagement with the measured metrics.|$|E

The flavour of the village and the approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women.

This involved carrying out a category analysis of the tutors' feedback to the students using Bales's 'interactional categories' as a theoretical basis. The advantage of this category system is that it distinguishes between task-orientated contributions, and the 'socio-emotive' element used by tutors to maintain student motivation. This reveals both how the tutor makes recommendations to improve the assignment content, and how they provide emotional support to students. Bales's analysis was presented to a group of tutors who felt an electronic feedback system based on this model would help them to get the <b>right</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> to their students.

Based on signals from the innate immune system and the immunological {{context in which the}} pathogen is presented, responding lymphocytes will adopt a particular phenotype, e. g. secrete a particular profile of cytokines. Once stimulated, lymphocytes store the appropriate type <b>of</b> <b>response</b> by differentiating from a naive to a memory phenotype. This allows the appropriate type of immune reaction to be regenerated upon re-stimulation of those memory clones. We developed a computer simulation model in which cross-reacting effector/memory clones contribute to the immunological context of pathogens. If a pathogen is recognized by both naive clones and pre-existing effector/memory clones, the naive lymphocytes adopt the effector mechanism of the memory clone. The adaptive immune system thereby stores immunological decisions and somatically learns to induce the <b>right</b> type <b>of</b> immune <b>response</b> to pathogens sharing epitopes. The influence of effector/memory lymphocytes may be detrimental when they cross-react to new pathogens that require a different kind <b>of</b> immune <b>response.</b> Here, we show that the immune system needs to be sufficiently specific to avoid such mistakes and to profit from the information that is stored in effector/memory lymphocytes.

Echoplanar images were acquired at 3 Tesla with sparse image acquisition once per 12 -second block of sound stimulation. Combinations of binaural intensity and stimulus presentation rate were varied between blocks, and selected to allow measurement of response-intensity functions in three configurations: monaural 55 – 85 dB SPL, binaural 55 – 85 dB SPL with intensity equal in both ears, and binaural with average binaural level of 70 dB SPL and interaural level differences (ILD) ranging ± 30 dB (i. e., favoring the left or <b>right</b> ear). Comparison <b>of</b> <b>response</b> functions equated for contralateral intensity revealed that BOLD-response magnitudes (1) generally increased with contralateral intensity, consistent with positive drive <b>of</b> the BOLD <b>response</b> by the contralateral ear, (2) were larger for contralateral monaural stimulation than for binaural stimulation, consistent with negative effects (e. g., inhibition) of ipsilateral input, which were strongest in the left hemisphere, and (3) also increased with ipsilateral intensity when contralateral input was weak, consistent with additional, positive, effects of ipsilateral stimulation. Hemispheric asymmetries in the spatial extent and overall magnitude <b>of</b> BOLD <b>responses</b> were generally consistent with previous studies demonstrating greater bilaterality <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> in the <b>right</b> hemisphere and stricter contralaterality in the left hemisphere.

Attachment of merozoites to erythrocytes, on the other hand, can be blocked by antibody. Convincing experimental evidence shows that completely protective immunity to malaria can be induced. The challenge now is to design recombinant or synthetic vaccines that induce the <b>right</b> types <b>of</b> immune <b>responses</b> to specific life cycle stages. This requires the identification and characterization of B- and T-lymphocyte epitopes expressed by the parasite or by parasitized host cells. These epitopes must be incorporated into a delivery system that maximizes the interaction between the vaccine epitopes and the host immune system. Many epitopes from several parts of the life cycle are already characterized; development of multivalent vaccines, that is, vaccines which contain immunogens from more than one part of the life cycle, is a promising area for research efforts...|$|R
5|$|A Vindication <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman {{was written}} against the tumultuous {{background}} of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now {{referred to as the}} Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to {{the separation of church and}} state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men, a <b>response</b> to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790). In his Reflections, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments <b>of</b> Wollstonecraft's <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men, published just six weeks after Burke's Reflections, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.|$|R
