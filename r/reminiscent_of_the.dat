5|$|The Shingouz are aliens {{who make}} their first {{appearance}} in Ambassador of the Shadows and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums. They are brown, short-furred creatures, slightly less than a metre tall, resembling flightless birds with a snout instead of a beak. Their appearance is <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main characters in the Mad magazine comic strip Spy vs. Spy.|$|E

5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. The call of the greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and is <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black pitohui. The call of the lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, {{both of which are}} repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Mérens {{are the result of}} the harsh mountain environment where they live, and they are <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horses in the cave drawings at Niaux, made some 13,000 years ago. These images depict animals with dense coats and a skull shaped like the modern Mérens, with a beard-like protrusion of hair under the jawbone.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{parallels}} with Christian scripture in the novel. The life and death of Joe Christmas is <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passion of Christ, Lena and her fatherless child parallel Mary and Christ, and Byron Bunch acts as a Joseph figure. Christian imagery such as the urn, the wheel, and the shadow, can be found throughout.|$|E
40|$|Alexandrowicz (1951) has {{recently}} described organs in the abdomen and thorax <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lobsters, Homarus vulgaris L. and Palinurus vulgaris L., which he {{considers to be}} stretch receptors.

50|$|Brési first {{appears in}} works on gastronomy from about XV. Its name derives from its rich red colour <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> brazilwood, <b>the</b> (at that time highly prized) Asian timber, which {{at about the}} same time gave its name also to Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Zeno's paradoxes, {{particularly}} {{the paradox of}} the runner, are <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparent paradox that 0.999... and 1 are equal. The runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric series. However, {{it is not clear}} if this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues Zeno was exploring.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 May through Downtown Toronto, <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|Following release, {{there were}} several {{complaints}} about the game crashing, having a vague user interface, and lacking any save system. In response to these complaints, Svensson noted that a patch was being discussed with the development team {{to address these issues}} in a future update. An updated version was released on January 28, 2013 under the name, Street Fighter X Mega Man V2. The update boasts an improved user interface, better controller compatibility, bug fixes, a password save system <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Mega Man games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and an additional boss character.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s the East End was {{the area}} most {{associated}} with gangster activity, most notably {{that of the}} Kray twins. The 1996 Docklands bombing caused significant damage around South Quay Station, {{to the south of}} the main Canary Wharf development. Two people were killed and thirty-nine injured in one of Mainland Britain's biggest bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. This led to the introduction of police checkpoints controlling access to the Isle of Dogs, <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City's 'ring of steel'.|$|E
5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E
50|$|All {{voices were}} {{performed}} by Peter Hawkins. The story featured <b>the</b> narration <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Minstrel character, whose Cockney accent was rather <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Michael Caine. <b>The</b> music was composed by Alan Parker.|$|R
5|$|In her {{drawings}} {{she uses}} black outlines filled with flat areas of colour, a post-impressionist technique <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French poster artists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late nineteenth century...The regular patterning of men, tents and buildings in many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works suggests the control that was imposed by <b>the</b> vast machine <b>of</b> men and modern war. In many drawings {{there is a}} strong sense of waiting: waiting to move into battle, waiting for the war to end, waiting to be sent home.|$|R
50|$|Anna is <b>the</b> love {{interest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book and <b>the</b> very character <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> story hangs. She {{is described as}} being pale-skinned who is as beautiful as she is plain. <b>The</b> description <b>of</b> her physical features is <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> Freyja, <b>the</b> goddess <b>of</b> Norse paganism. She is infatuated with her own martyrdom.|$|R
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

5|$|Rebounding {{from their}} 2008 campaign, the 2009 Sounds {{achieved}} a 75–69 record under new manager Don Money. Despite {{a winning record}} and spending {{the majority of the}} season in first place, the Sounds finished the season two games behind their cross-state rivals, and eventual league champions, the Memphis Redbirds. The 2010 season proved to be <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous campaign. Though Nashville finished the year with a winning 77–67 record under Money, it was only good enough to place fourth (last) in the division.|$|E
50|$|Dune {{consists}} of two interwoven gameplay layers: an adventure layer <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> dungeon crawler games, and a top-down strategy layer more <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> 4X games. <b>The</b> player may switch between these two layers at will, to carry out completely different sets of activities required to win the game.|$|R
40|$|Coalescence {{processes}} are investigated during phase separation in a density-matched liquid mixture (partially deuterated cyclohexane and methanol) under near-critical conditions. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interplay between capillary and lubrication forces, ''nose'' coalescence {{appears to be}} always associated with <b>the</b> slow growth <b>of</b> isolated droplets (exponent almost-equal-to 1 / 3), whereas ''dimple'' coalescence corresponds to <b>the</b> fast growth <b>of</b> interconnected droplets (exponent almost-equal-to 1). At each stage <b>of</b> growth, <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> droplets trapped during dimple coalescence is <b>reminiscent</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous coalescence events...|$|R
