5|$|Farmer {{moved from}} trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn {{from the early}} 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability {{to get what he}} wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpetâ€“flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>settings,</b> from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E

25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>settings.</b> Socially, it expresses extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, {{have been found in}} those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E
25|$|Nurses {{practice}} in a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>settings,</b> from hospitals to visiting people {{in their homes and}} caring for them in schools to research in pharmaceutical companies. Nurses work in occupational health settings (also called industrial health settings), free-standing clinics and physician offices, nurse-led clinics, long-term care facilities and camps. They also work on cruise ships and in military service. Nurses act as advisers and consultants to the health care and insurance industries. Many nurses also work in the health advocacy and patient advocacy fields at companies such as Health Advocate, Inc. helping in a variety of clinical and administrative issues. Some are attorneys and others work with attorneys as legal nurse consultants, reviewing patient records to assure that adequate care was provided and testifying in court. Nurses can work on a temporary basis, which involves doing shifts without a contract in a variety of settings, sometimes known as per diem nursing, agency nursing or travel nursing. Nurses work as researchers in laboratories, universities, and research institutions. Nurses have also been delving into the world of informatics, acting as consultants to the creation of computerized charting programs and other software.|$|E

40|$|A {{licensed}} pharmaceutical {{process is}} required to be executed within the validated ranges throughout the lifetime of product manufacturing. Changes to the process usually require the manufacturer {{to demonstrate that the}} safety and efficacy of the product remains unchanged. Recent changes in the regulations for pharmaceutical processing allow broader <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> process <b>settings</b> to be submitted for regulatory approval, when a manufacturer can scientifically support the rationale for these settings. The combined validated <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>settings</b> for process parameters constitute the so called process design space. In this thesis, the applicability of this concept of the process design space is investigated for the cultivation process step for a vaccine against whooping cough disease. This thesis demonstrates that the general principles of PAT and process design space are general and can even be applied to an undefined biological product such as a whole cell vaccine...|$|R
