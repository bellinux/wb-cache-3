50|$|The Air-to Air Stinger ATAS is an {{adaptation}} of the man portable Stinger System. It is a light weight missile designed to engage low altitude targets. A major milestone in {{the improvement of the}} Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block-1 missile was demonstrated on 19 November 1996 at Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. An OH-58D piloted by CPT Bob Blanchett, US Army Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM), successfully acquired, tracked, engaged, and destroyed a QUH-1 drone helicopter deploying countermeasures at a range greater than 4500 meters. This firing also demonstrated the capabilities of the improved missile to successfully engage a target without the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> super- <b>elevation.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{sphingomyelin}} pathway, {{which is}} initiated by sphingomyelin hydrolysisto generate the second messenger ceramide, signals apoptosis for tumor necrosis factor α, Fas, and ionizing radiation. In the present studies, the anticancer drug daunorubicin also stimulated ceramide elevation and apoptosis in P 388 and U 937 cells. Cell-permeable analogs of ceramide, but not other lipid second messengers, mimicked daunorubicin in inducing apoptosis. Daunorubicin-stimulated ceramide elevation, however, {{did not result}} from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, but rather from de novo synthesis via activation of the enzyme ceramide synthase. An obligatory role for ceramide synthase was defined, since its natural specific inhibitor, fumonisin B 1, blocked daunorubicin-induced ceramide elevation and apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that ceramide synthase activity can be regulated in eukaryotes and constitute definitive evidence <b>for</b> a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> ceramide <b>elevation</b> in the induction of apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{properties of}} long-term potentiation (LTP) following pairing of pre- and postsynaptic activity were examined at a known glutamatergic synapse in the leech, specifically between the pressure (P) mechanosensory and anterior pagoda (AP) neurons. Stimulation of the presynaptic P cell (25 Hz) concurrent with a 2 nA depolarization of the postsynaptic AP cell significantly potentiated the P-to-AP {{excitatory postsynaptic potential}} (EPSP) in an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) -dependent manner based on inhibitory effects of the NMDAR antagonist MK 801 and inhibition of the NMDAR glycine binding site by 7 -chlorokynurenic acid. LTP was blocked by injection of bis-(o-aminophenoxy) -N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) into the postsynaptic (AP) cell, indicating a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> postsynaptic <b>elevation</b> of intracellular Ca 2 +. Autocamtide- 2 -related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a specific inhibitor of Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), and Rp-cAMP, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), also blocked pairing-induced potentiation, indicating a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> activation of CaMKII and PKA. Interestingly, application of AIP during pairing resulted in significantly depressed synaptic transmission. Co-application of AIP with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid restored synaptic transmission to baseline levels, suggesting an interaction between CaMKII and protein phosphatases during induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. When postsynaptic activity preceded presynaptic activity, NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) was observed that was blocked by okadaic acid. Postsynaptic injection of botulinum toxin blocked P-to-AP potentiation while postsynaptic injection of pep 2 -SVKI, an inhibitor of AMPA receptor endocytosis, inhibited LTD, supporting the hypothesis that glutamate receptor trafficking contributes to both LTP and LTD at the P-to-AP synapse in the leech...|$|R
40|$|The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) was {{the sole}} {{instrument}} for NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimetry mission. The {{primary purpose of the}} ICESat mission was to make ice sheet elevation measurements of the polar regions. Additional goals were to measure the global distribution of clouds and aerosols and to map sea ice, land topography and vegetation. ICESat was the benchmark Earth Observing System (EOS) mission to be used to determine the mass balance of the ice sheets, as well as for providing cloud property information, especially for stratospheric clouds common over polar areas. The GLAS instrument operated from 2003 to 2009 and provided multi-year elevation data needed to determine changes in sea ice freeboard, land topography and vegetation around the globe, in addition to elevation changes of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This document describes the Precision Orbit Determination (POD) algorithm for the ICESat mission. The problem of determining an accurate ephemeris for an orbiting satellite involves estimating the position and velocity of the satellite from a sequence of observations. The ICESatGLAS elevation measurements must be very accurately geolocated, combining precise orbit information with precision pointing information. The ICESat mission POD requirement states that the position of the instrument should be determined with an accuracy of 5 and 20 cm (1 -s) in radial and horizontal components, respectively, to meet the science <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> determining <b>elevation</b> change...|$|R

Applicants in-province may have less stringent grade requirements than out-of-province applicants.
