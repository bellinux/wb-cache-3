The study aims to develop a FE tyre model that can solve fast and be accurate enough to be used in multibody dynamic vehicle simulations.

The work explores <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> superimposed finite elements to model the varying stiffness in the respective orthogonal directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidewall and tread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre.</b> Non-linear elements defined by Neo-Hookean or Ogden models and elements with different linear orthogonal stiffnesses are superimposed onto each other to simulate the global material properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tread and <b>the</b> sidewall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> investigated. <b>The</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> studied was measured experimentally using laser displacement transducers and digital image correlation techniques. Material properties <b>of</b> segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> were obtained by performing tensile tests on samples. Since the rubber slipped against the clamps during <b>the</b> experiment, deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segments was also measured using digital image correlation. These geometrical and material properties were used as input to develop a finite element model of an “off-road” tyre. Measurements were conducted using laser displacement transducers, load cells mounted to actuators, etc. to obtain accurate sidewall deformation profiles and global radial load vs. displacement curves for different radial loading conditions. The data obtained from the results was used to validate <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> model developed. Numerous analyses are performed with different combinations of moduli <b>of</b> elasticity in <b>the</b> respective orthogonal directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidewall stiffness and the tread to investigate its influence on <b>the</b> global behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> model. <b>The</b> main focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project was to develop a tyre model from data obtained from laser and photogrammetry measurements in a laboratory that accurately represents tyre behaviour due to radial forces. A finite element model that can simulate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> radial forced and obstacles on a <b>tyre</b> was developed. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> two subsets of elements, superimposed onto each other to simulate global material properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rubbers, steel wires, polyester and nylon threads, was investigated. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> material properties that gave the best fit for all the load cases investigated were determined. The finite element model correlated well with the load vs. displacement graphs and sidewall displacement profiles determined experimentally. The solving time is still fairly high and is still not quite suitable for real-time dynamic simulation. However, it solves faster than more complex tyre models where details of steel wires, etc. are included in the model. For future studies it is recommended that different element types be investigated in <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> model. <b>The</b> study proves that equivalent material properties can be used to simulate <b>the</b> composite properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials in <b>tyres.</b> Most tyres can be divided into a few regions that each has its own material structure right through the region. These regions can be characterized by simple tests and the input {{can be used as a}} first estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre’s</b> material properties for the model.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an approach}} to model <b>the</b> vibrations <b>of</b> a deformed rolling tyre at low frequencies (below 500 Hz). The starting point for this approach is a finite element (FE) model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>the</b> aim is to calculate <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> a rolling <b>tyre</b> including <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> its complex build up. This allows to relate <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> design parameters to its vibro-acoustic properties. In this context, a modal approximation based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors extracted from the detailed FE model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> seems a computationally efficient possibility. In the proposed approach the natural frequencies and modeshapes of a deformed tyre are calculated in a standard FE package using the full (nonlinear) FE model. Subsequently, this modal base is transformed to determine <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotating <b>tyre</b> in a fixed (Eulerian) reference frame. Furthermore, this approach {{makes it possible to}} define a receptance matrix for <b>the</b> rotating <b>tyre.</b> Results from relatively simple tyre models show that <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> rotation are modelled correctly and are in accordance with results from literature...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} a growing concern. <b>The</b> growing {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the main cause for climate change. In order to prevent dangerous changes in the climate system the GHG emissions have to be controlled. GHG assessment {{can be seen as}} an important tool in controlling GHG emissions as the emissions and their sources have to be known in order to restrain them. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this thesis was to determine all relevant GHG emissions from tyre industry with special focus on indirect GHG emissions. As a case study <b>the</b> GHG emissions <b>of</b> Nokian Tyres’ operations were assessed. In the study GHG emissions from production and transportation of raw materials, manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres,</b> distribution and sales operations, use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres,</b> and <b>the</b> end-of-life treatment were included. In the manufacturing emissions the indirect emissions from auxiliary operations such as wastes, commuting, and business travel were also included. To calculate the total GHG emissions the non-CO 2 gases were converted into CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) using their global warming potentials. All GHG emissions were calculated using activity data and emission factors. In addition a calculator was created to enable easy calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annual GHG emissions from the operations based on activity data only. Many studies have shown that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> creates most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GHG emissions during the whole lifecycle. In this study the total GHG emissions from all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operations were 30 364 kg CO 2 e/t tyres produced. 87 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GHG emissions were formed during <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres.</b> <b>The</b> manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> comprised only a small amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total GHG emissions (2. 1 %). Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GHG emissions from manufacturing are caused by energy use. <b>The</b> high usage <b>of</b> carbon neutral energy sources keeps the GHG emissions low however. Emissions from distribution and sales operations mainly comprised <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sales facilities. <b>The</b> production <b>of</b> raw materials formed second largest part of all GHG emissions (7. 8 %). GHG emissions from end-of-life treatment were insignificant (less than 0. 1 %). The largest GHG emission reduction potential is during the use phase. By lowering <b>the</b> rolling resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> <b>the</b> fuel consumption and thus GHG emissions can be reduced. GHG emissions from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>tyres</b> are however also dependent on car and fuel industries. As the impact on the GHG emissions from raw materials is limited energy use has the second best potential for GHG emission reductions. By substituting more energy sources in the factories and sales facilities by renewable or carbon neutral sources GHG emissions could be reduced...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} issue when modeling noise generation from rolling <b>tyres</b> using <b>the</b> orthotropic plate <b>tyre</b> model [1] {{is to find}} accurate Green’s functions for <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre.</b> These Green’s functions are used to solve the tyre/road contact problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rolling <b>tyre</b> in <b>the</b> time domain. For tyres with tread blocks, {{it is important to}} consider <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tread blocks on the response. It has previous been suggested that the tread blocks could be modeled as mass-spring systems [2]. Measurements of mobilies on a tyre with simple and regular tread blocks shows that this approach is unnecessary when modelling the response in radial direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> in <b>the</b> frequency range between 0 and 2500 Hz. Instead <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> may be modeled, using a plate tyre model, as a soft plate with slightly higher local deformation. The tread pattern may be modeled in the tyre/road contact model as a macro roughness, where points at the blocks may be in contact with the road while forces at points in the groves are set to zero...|$|R
