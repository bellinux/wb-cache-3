50|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{mineralizer}} is to facilitate the transport of insoluble “nutrient” to a seed crystal {{by means of a}} <b>reversible</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction.</b> Overtime, the seed crystal accumulates the material that was once in the nutrient and grows. Mineralizers are additives that aid the solubilization of the nutrient solid. When used in small quantities, mineralizers function as catalysts. Typically, a more stable solid is crystallized from a solution that consists of a less stable solid and a solvent. The process is done by dissolution-precipitation or crystallization process.|$|E
5000|$|In {{ordinary}} incandescent lamps, evaporated tungsten mostly deposits {{onto the}} inner {{surface of the}} bulb, causing the bulb to blacken and the filament to grow increasingly weak until it eventually breaks. The presence of the halogen, however, sets up a <b>reversible</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>reaction</b> cycle with this evaporated tungsten. The halogen cycle keeps the bulb clean and causes the light output to remain almost constant throughout the bulb's life. At moderate temperatures the halogen reacts with the evaporating tungsten, the halide formed being moved around in the inert gas filling. At some point, however, it will reach higher temperature regions within the bulb where it then dissociates, releasing tungsten back onto the filament and freeing the halogen to repeat the process. The overall bulb envelope temperature must be significantly higher than in conventional incandescent lamps for this reaction to succeed, however: it is only at temperatures of above 250 C {{on the inside of}} the glass envelope that the halogen vapor can combine with the tungsten and return it to the filament rather than the tungsten becoming deposited on the glass. [...] A 300 watt tubular halogen bulb operated at full power quickly reaches a temperature of about 540 C, while a 500 watt regular incandescent bulb operates at only 180 C and a 75 watt regular incandescent at only 130 C.|$|E
