40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the natural {{frequencies}} {{and the associated}} mode shapes of in-plane free vibration of a single-crystal silicon ring are analyzed. It is found that the Si(111) ring is two-dimensionally isotropic in the (111) plane for elastic constants but three-dimensionally anisotropic, while the Si(100) ring is fully anisotropic. Hamilton’s principle is used to derive the equations of vibration, which {{is a set of}} partial differential equations with coefficients being periodic in polar variable. Expressing the radial and tangential displacements in sinusoidal form with non-predetermined amplitudes, and through the integration with respect to the circumferential variable, the original governing equations in partial differential form can be converted into the amplitude equations in ordinary differential form. The exact expressions for frequencies and mode shapes are obtained. It is found that for Si(100) rings the frequencies of a pair of modes, which are equal for an isotropic <b>ring,</b> <b>split</b> due to the anisotropic effect only for the second in-plane vibration mode. The phenomena of frequency splitting and degenerate modes can be proved either based on the conservation of averaged mechanical energy or by the concept of crystallographic symmetry groups. When the single-crystal silicon is replaced by the polycrystalline silicon, which is isotropic in elastic constants, the derived equations for frequencies correctly predict the vanishing of the phenomenon of frequency splitting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{developing}} negative µ and negative refraction (NRI) 3 D isotropic <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials is addressed. First {{of all the}} necessary symmetries required to guar-antee an isotropic behavior are analyzed. Secondly an homogenization procedure taking into account spatial dispersion is developed for magnetic <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. It is shown that this homogenization also accounts for all kind of waves (electromagnetic and magnetoinductive) previously reported in negative-µ <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. Finally, the possibility of developing isotropic NRI metamaterials from chiral <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonators (SRRs) is discussed in detail In spite of many efforts in this direction (see e. g. [1], [2], [3]) the depelopment of practical 3 D isotropic metamaterials is still a challenging issue.

Cubic arrangements of such elements will be considered, and the necessary spatial symetries that guarantee an isotropic behavior in three dimensions will be discussed. From this analysis some proposals to develop periodic and isotropic negative-µ <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials will come out [4], [5].
