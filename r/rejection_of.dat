5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, clarity and {{precision}} and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot's 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in D. H. Lawrence's animal and flower pieces. The <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E
5|$|Christine Chism distinguishes racist or racialist {{elements}} in Tolkien's views and works as falling into three categories: intentional racism, unconscious Eurocentric bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> racist tendencies {{in his late}} work.|$|E

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the forward {{discount}} puzzle is primarily a statistical phenomenon and that statistical <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> Uncovered Interest Parity do not necessarily constitute valid <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> market efficiency. We find by using a Taylor expansion a theoretical negative bias in existing regressions of UIP. We propose two alternative tests for market efficiency, {{one of which is}} designed to measure the degree of market inefficiency. Our results from these tests indicate that for all four of the bilateral dollar parities studied the foreign exchange market is efficient despite decisive clear <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> UIP using the conventional regression approach...|$|R

40|$|Under general conditions, linear {{decision}} {{rules of}} agents with rational expectations are equivalent to restricted error corrections. However, empirical <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> rational expectation restrictions are the rule, {{rather than the}} exception, in macroeconomics. Rejections often are conditioned {{on the assumption that}} agents aim to smooth only the levels of actions or are subject to geometric random delays. Generalizations of dynamic frictions on agent activities are suggested that yield closed-form, higher-order decision rules with improved statistical fits and infrequent <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> rational expectations restrictions. Properties of these generalized "rational" error corrections are illustrated for producer pricing in manufacturing industries. Economics...|$|R

5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident.

5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key.

5|$|In 1868, Thomas Huxley {{published}} On {{the animals}} which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles, making {{a strong case}} for the bird-dinosaur ancestral link. Huxley's proposal that birds arose from dinosaurs – based primarily on his observation of the similarities between Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus – remained respectable and widespread in the paleontological community until the publication of The Origin of Birds. Heilmann more than anyone else was responsible for a widespread <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the dinosaur-bird link. His conclusions involved more than the mere <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> a dinosaurian ancestry for birds, however: for instance, he favored the arboreal origin of avian flight, he allied birds firmly with reptiles instead of mammals, and he was responsible for finally putting an end to the idea that birds descended from pterosaurs. Several aspects of his research have continued to be influential long after its publication.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} well a New Keynesian {{business}} cycle model can explain the observed behavior of nominal interest rates. We focus on two puzzles raised in previous literature. First, Donaldson, Johnsen, and Mehra (1990) show that while in the U. S. nominal term structure the interest rates are pro-cyclical and term spreads counter-cyclical the stochastic growth model predicts that the interest rates are counter-cyclical and term spreads pro-cyclical. Second, according to Backus, Gregory, and Zin (1989) the standard general equilibrium asset pricing model can account for neither the sign nor the magnitude of average risk premiums in forward prices. Hence, the standard model is unable to explain <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> the expectations hypothesis. We show that a New Keynesian model with habit-persistent preferences and a monetary policy feedback rule produces pro-cyclical interest rates, counter-cyclical term spreads, and creates enough volatility in the risk premium {{to account for the}} <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> expectations hypothesis. Moreover, unlike Buraschi and Jiltsov (2005), we identify the systematic monetary policy, not monetary policy shocks, as the key factor behind <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> expectations hypothesis.
