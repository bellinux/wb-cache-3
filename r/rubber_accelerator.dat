To develop a rubber condom suitable for use by rubber sensitive people, a "hypoallergenic" condom, which is washed in ammonia to reduce the residues of <b>rubber</b> <b>accelerators,</b> has been manufactured. Fifty patients allergic to various <b>rubber</b> <b>accelerators</b> were patch tested with an ordinary condom and the new washed condom. Fifty patients undergoing routine patch test investigation who were not allergic to rubber were also tested as controls. Twenty two of the rubber sensitive patients had a positive reaction to the new rubber condom compared with four of the control patients.

30|$|Chemical {{compounds}} for {{rubber industry}} contain carcinogenic nitrosamines, {{if they are}} obtained from the secondary amines like dimethyl amine, diethyl amine, morpholine, piperidine etc. In {{a recent survey by}} de Vocht et al. [9], it has been realized that exposure of N-nitrosamines namely, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) decreased on average two-to-five fold in the German rubber industry as compared to other European countries with regard to the concentration level. Although average levels are well below the current limits, exposure has not been eliminated and incidental high exposures do still occur [9]. A more general solution of the nitrosamine problem in rubber industry requires introducing new rubber chemicals which cannot be nitrosated or produce non-carcinogenic nitrosamines. The amines or amine derivatives which do not give rise to nitrosamines or which give rise to non-carcinogenic nitrosamines are the so-called ‘safe amines’. Eisenbrand et al. [10] have made a list of these ‘safe amines’. In this perspective, our main objective is to replace the unsafe <b>rubber</b> <b>accelerator</b> by the safe <b>rubber</b> <b>accelerator</b> without changing their major activity in the rubber vulcanization. With this in mind, in the present study we select some safe thiuram disulfides, e.g., Bis (N-ethyl piperazine) thiuram disulfide (EPTD) and Bis (N-phenyl piperazine) thiuram disulfide (PPTD) derived from safe N-substituted piperazine [5, 11] to introduce non-carcinogenic thiuram disulfide to the vulcanization of natural rubber. Synergistic activities of these thiuram disulfides in presence of dibenzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS) are considered in the gum natural rubber vulcanization. The effects of EPTD and PPTD separately with MBTS on the resultant vulcanizates are compared with the corresponding unsafe TMTD compounds in the light of mechanical properties to replace unsafe TMTD by newly synthesized thiuram disulfides. After choosing the better combinations of these thiuram disulfides-MBTS systems with respect to synergism, our aim is to test the effects of these binary accelerator systems in the carbon black-filled vulcanization of natural rubber. The applications of these accelerators are judged in the light of mechanical and aging resistance properties in the carbon black-filled natural rubber system.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} process of vulcanization {{is a type}} of cross-linking that changes rubber to the hard, durable material associated with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing; the term vulcanization comes from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. This is, however, a slower process. A typical car tire is cured for 15 minutes at 150 °C. However, the time can be reduced by the addition of accelerators such as 2-benzothiazolethiol or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. Both of these contain a sulfur atom in the molecule that initiates the reaction of the sulfur chains with the <b>rubber.</b> <b>Accelerators</b> increase the rate of cure by catalysing the addition of sulfur chains to the rubber molecules.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{incorporation}} {{of different types}} of accelerators i. e. TMTD, TMTM, DOTG and NPV/C on properties of NBR rubber was investigated. Without any organic accelerator it required long time to cure; tensile properties showed the least value but elasticity was the highest one and ageing properties were poor. Thiuram accelerators gave very fast cure; good tensile properties; high crosslinking density reflected on its resistance to organic solvents and gave the best ageing characteristics. Di -o- tolyl guanidine and vulcacit NPV/C thiourea gave slow onset of cure; long scorch time; high tensile; resilience properties, DOTG gave better ageing properties than NPV/C accelerator.

The synthetic rubber gives different properties from natural rubber in every aspect. The objectives of this research are to investigate the mechanical properties changes in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) filled with oil palm trunks as fillers and to check the differences in properties between the amounts of fillers used. The purpose of this research is to investigate the properties of styrene butadiene rubber blending with oil palm trunk fiber as filler. The research is based on experimental lab research. The contribution of oil palm trunk as a filler in rubber compound will decrease the burning activities and reducing environmental issues. Many researches have been done in rubber/natural filler blending in order to improve the properties of rubber with economically. The methods in this research are divided into three sections; mixing, molding, and testing. Mixing required two roll mills as a device blending <b>rubber</b> with filler, <b>accelerator</b> and vulcanizing agent. Molding required hot and cold press molding to form a sheet of product before testing. Testing required a universal testing machine to test the tensile properties of the rubber blend. Two chemical used in this swelling test; kerosene and diesel. The samples were put into two different bottles with kerosene inside one bottle and diesel inside another bottle. The time taken to complete the test was 24 hours – exactly one day. The result from testing showed that increasing amount of fillers will actually decrease the tensile strength, increase the tensile modulus and increase swelling behavior of the rubber blend. As conclusion, most of mechanical properties decrease with increasing of filler content. As recommendation, increasing the filler content might give the better result, and giving more information about capability of styrene butadiene rubber to consume more filler...|$|R
