Thus, <b>remote</b> <b>storage</b> must be already provisioned using other approaches, and the resulting logical unit number (LUN) made available to this agent.

40|$|Abstract—Both {{individuals}} and corporations increasingly rely on email to exchange important and, often sensitive, information. With {{the advent of}} ubiquitous computing and miniaturization of end-devices, many users leave email on remote servers, thus facilitating anywhere/anytime access from any networked device. Since private and sensitive information is often contained in email, {{it is very important}} to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. In this paper, we consider the problem of repeated intrusions of third-party email servers. We present IRRES: Intrusion-Resilient <b>Remote</b> Email <b>Storage</b> system that prevents email leakage in the presence of a powerful mobile adversary. IRRES eliminates sender compliance requirements by shifting encryption from email sender to email server. Incoming email messages are encrypted by the server with one-time keys obtained from an intrusion-resilient cooperative randomness generation process. Thus, even if the server is compromised twice, all email encrypted in the interim remains secure.
