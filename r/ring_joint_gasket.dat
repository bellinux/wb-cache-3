Commonly used gaskets are non-metallic (ASME B 16.21), spiral-wound (ASME B 16.20) and ring-joint (ASME B 16.20). Non-metallic gaskets are used with flat- or raised-face flanges. Spiral-wound gaskets are used with raised-face flanges, and ring-joint gaskets are used with ring-type joint (RTJ) flanges. Stress develops between an RTJ gasket and the flange groove when the gasket is bolted to a flange, leading to plastic deformation of the gasket.|$|R

40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the maximum RSRM igniter adapter-to-igniter chamber joint deflection at the crown of the inner joint primary seal. The deflection data was gathered to support igniter inner <b>joint</b> <b>gasket</b> resiliency predictions which led to launch commit criteria temperature determinations. The proximity (deflection) gage holes for the first test (Test No. 1) were incorrectly located; therefore, the test was declared a non-test. Prior to Test No. 2, test article configuration was modified with the correct proximity gage locations. Deflection data were successfully acquired during Test No. 2. However, the proximity gage deflection measurements were adversely affected by temperature increases. Deflections measured after the temperature rise at the proximity gages were considered unreliable. An analysis {{was performed}} to predict the maximum deflections based on the reliable data measured before the detectable temperature rise. Deflections to the primary seal crown location were adjusted to correspond {{to the time of}} maximum expected operating pressure (2, 159 psi) to account for proximity gage bias, and to account for maximum attach and special bolt relaxation. The maximum joint deflection for the igniter inner joint at the crown of the primary seal, accounting for all significant correction factors, was 0. 0031 in. (3. 1 mil). Since the predicted (0. 003 in.) and tested maximum deflection values were sufficiently close, the launch commit criteria was not changed {{as a result of this}} test.

40|$|Immersed tunnels are {{particularly}} sensitive to tensile and compressive deformations {{such as those}} imposed by a normal seismogenic fault rupturing underneath, and those generated by the dynamic response due to seismic waves. The paper investigates the response of a future 70 m deep immersed tunnel to the consecutive action of a major normal fault rupturing in an earthquake occurring in the basement rock underneath the tunnel, and a subsequent strong excitation from a different large-magnitude seismic event that may occur years later. Non-linear finite elements model the quasi-static fault rupture propagation through the thick soil deposit overlying the bedrock and the ensuing interaction of the rupture with the immersed tunnel. It is shown that despite imposed bedrock offset of 2 m, net tension or excessive compression between tunnel segments could be avoided with a suitable design of the <b>joint</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Then, the already deformed (""injured"") structure is subjected to strong asynchronous seismic shaking. The thick-walled tunnel is modelled as a 3 -D massive flexural beam connected to the soil through properly-calibrated nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, the supports of which are subjected to the free-field acceleration time histories. The latter, obtained with 1 -D wave propagation analysis, are then modified to account for wave passage effects. The joints between tunnel segments are modeled with special non-linear hyper-elastic elements, properly accounting for their 7 -bar longitudinal hydrostatic pre-stressing. Sliding is captured with special gap elements. The effect of segment length and joint properties is explored parametrically. A fascinating conclusion emerges in all analysed cases for the joints between segments that were differentially deformed after the quasi-static fault rupture: upon subsequent very strong seismic shaking, overstressed joints de-compress and understressed joints re-compress-a ""healing"" process {{that leads to a}} more uniform deformation profile along the tunnel. This is particularly beneficial for the precariously de-compressed <b>joint</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Hence, the safety of the immersed tunnel improves with ""subsequent"" strong seismic shaking! © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique.

40|$|Loss of {{pre-load}} with time, {{commonly known}} as ‘Relaxation’ is an established phenomena. Behaviour of a bolted joint depends upon the pre-load in the bolts in use, not the pre-load introduced by the mechanic. Loss of pre-load is expected due to the many factors such as embedment relaxation, gasket creep, elastic interactions, and vibration loosening or stress relaxation. In a <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint,</b> due to the gasket flexibility, relaxation is always substantial during preliminary passes, as 80 to 100 % loss is not uncommon in almost all the bolts, resulting in a dynamic behaviour. Pre-load in a <b>gasketed</b> <b>joint</b> is stabilized and retained to certain extent in the final passes only. In a non-gasketed joint, due to no gasket and no rotation its static behaviour is concluded.

40|$|Critical for {{the seismic}} safety of {{immersed}} tunnels is {{the magnitude of}} deformations developing in the segment joints, {{as a result of}} the combined longitudinal and lateral vibrations. Analysis and design against such vibrations is the main focus of this paper, with reference to a proposed 70 m-deep immersed tunnel in a highly seismic region, in Greece. The multisegment tunnel is modeled as a beam connected to the ground through properly calibrated interaction springs, dashpots, and sliders. Actual records of significant directivity-affected around motions, downscaled to 0. 24 g peak acceleration, form the basis of the basement excitation. Free-field acceleration time histories are computed from these records through one-dimensional wave propagation equivalent-linear and nonlinear analyses of parametrically different soil profiles along the tunnel; they are then applied as excitation at the support of the springs, with a suitable time lac, to conservatively approximate wave passage effects. The joints between the tunnel segments are modeled realistically with special nonlinear hyperelastic elements, while their longitudinal prestressing due to the great (7 bar) water pressure is also considered. Nonlinear dynamic transient analysis of the tunnel is performed without ignoring the inertia of the thick-walled tunnel, and the influence of segment length and joint properties is investigated parametrically. It is shown that despite ground excitation with acceleration levels exceeding 0. 50 g and velocity of about 80 cm/s at the base of the tunnel, net tension and excessive compression between the segments can be avoided with a suitable design of <b>joint</b> <b>gaskets</b> and a selection of relatively small segment lengths. Although this research was prompted by the needs of a specific project, the dynamic analysis methods, the proposed design concepts, and many of the conclusions of the study are sufficiently general and may apply in other immersed tunneling projects...|$|R

50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens.
