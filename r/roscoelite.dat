5000|$|A. B. Frenzel {{discovered}} vanadium-bearing sandstone near Placerville in {{the late}} 1890s. The ore was in strataform bodies in the Entrada Sandstone (Jurassic) east of the town. The principal mineral was <b>roscoelite,</b> with minor montroseite and carnotite. By the fall of 1899, development was described as [...] "of the most superficial character," [...] although Frenzel had driven one tunnel 18 feet into the rock. [...] By 1901-1902, Frenzel was excavating several thousand tons intended for shipment to Europe. [...] Most of the Placerville ore was less than 3% vanadium, too low grade to pay for shipment to Europe, so in 1905 the Vanadium Alloys Co. built an ore-processing mill southeast of Placerville to recover the metal as ferro-vanadium, which it sold. [...] At least five mines were active at one time, and by 1919 the two ore mills at Placerville were producing 30% of the world's vanadium. [...] Through 1940, the mines produced about 3.7 million pounds of vanadium. Although carnotite was recognized as a minor constituent of the ore since its discovery, the amount was small, and no assays were made of the uranium content of the ore until World War II. [...] Beginning about 1950, the small uranium content of the ore was also recovered from the ore.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{composition}} and origin of vanadium-bearing clayminerals in the Jurassic (Morrison and Entrada Formations) andstones ofthe Colorado Plateau are reassessed using microanalyses (microprobe and scanning electron microscope). The main V-clays are authigenic llite and chlorite of various petrologic habits: clay casts and matrix, pore lining, replacement ofdetrital grains. The chemical {{composition of the}} V-clays is similar in three different localities in the Morrison Formation separated by about 50 kin, suggesting that the V-clays {{are the result of}} a large regional event. In both illite and chlorite, A 1 and V are inversely correlated, showing that V replaces AI in the octahedral position. The chlorite contains a complex mixture of divalent and trivalent cations that cannot fit within a sudoite structure. A classification of V-micas is proposed that employs V 3 +/sum of the octahedral cations vs. the sum of the interlayer charges. V-illite and <b>roscoelite</b> from the Colorado Plateau are characteristic ofdiagenetic/hydrothermal environments.

This note records the occurrence of a single phase vanadium smectite which is found with pitchblende insmall pockets and lenses in a uranium mine {{in the northern part}} of Converse County, Wyoming at a depth of 150 feet in the Eocene Wasatch Formation. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the oriented < 2 #m fraction of the clay shows a very strong 15. 0 + 0. 1 A reflection and a series of higher orders. When the clay is saturated with Na, the smectite displays abasal spacing of 12. 6 _+ 0 -IA, which expands to 16. 7 _+ 0 - 1 ~ upon glycol saturation. A b-lattice parameter of 9. 02 _+ 0. 2 A was obtained from the 060 reflection of the randomly oriented powder, indicating the presence of a dioctahedral smectite. Scanning electron images of the sample show that it possesses the typical flaky micro-fabric of smectites (Fig. la).

40|$|The gold-silver {{telluride}} {{deposits of}} the Emperor mine (Vatukoula, Fiji) are fairly {{typical of the}} epithermal deposits found in association with Tertiary volcanic activity in the circum-Pacific belt. The mine produces about 60, 000 troy ounces of gold per annum, together with silver and tellurium. It lies on the western margin of a Pliocene caldera (the Tavua caldera or Tavua basin) and the host rocks for the mineralization are olivine basalt flows and andesite dykes. The olivine basalt sequence is about 2000 m thick and is probably underlain by mid-Tertiary calcareous sedimentary rocks. approximately 1500 m thick. The sedimentary rocks are probably underlain by early Tertiary andesitic rocks. Five phases of volcanic (and associated intrusive) activity have been recognised in the Tavua cauldron. The K-Ar dating indicates two major periods of igneous activity, Which commenced at about 10 m. y. with widespread eruptions of olivine basalt (phase I) and continued to about 7. 5 m. y. A period of quiescence followed. The later phases of volcanic activity (phases II to V) date between 5 and 4. 3 m. y. Phase II volcanism is represented by minor eruptions of trachybasalt., phase III by augite trachyandesite, phase IV by biotite trachyandesite and phase V by monzonite and trachyte. The later phases (phases III to V) are essentially intrusive in nature and are represented by cone • sheets, dykes and small plugs, and generally occur within. {{the limits of the}} caldera. Te 130 -Xe 130 dating on a telluride sample gave an age o f 7. 2 m. y. indicating that the bulk of the mineralization was probably associated with the first period of igneous activity (10 to 7. 5 m. y.). Initial hydrothermal activity resulted in widespread propylitization and carbonatization of basalt, and this was followed by limited K-silicate alteration and mineralization. The lodes are essentially fracture fillings with well-developed crustification textures and vugs. Ore-mineral, sulphide and carbonate precipitation appears to have been intermittent, whereas quartz precipitation was essentially uninterrupted, and continued after the cessation of oremineral precipitation. The ore-minerals are native gold, native tellurium and gold-silver tellurides. Paragenetic studies suggest ten stages of ore and gangue mineral precipitation, viz. stage IA: widespread propylitic alteration with the development of carbonate, chlorite, actinolite, epidote etc.; stage IB: fringe K-silicate alteration which includes K-feldspar, sericite, dolomite and sulphides; stage IIA: barren vein quartz deposition; stage IIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, <b>roscoelite,</b> native tellurium and goldrich tellurides; stage IIIA: barren vein-quartz deposition; stage IIIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, <b>roscoelite,</b> native gold • and silver-rich tellurides; stage IVA: white barren vein quartz; stage •VB: amber barren vein quartz; stage IVC: white barren quartz; and stage V: calcite deposition. The bulk of mineralization (stage IIB tellurides) is restricted to 12 level and above while stage IIIB tellurides and native gold are distributed throughout. Fluid-inclusion studies on quartz indicate a temperature range from 20. 5 to 317 °C during stage IIA and from 170 to 210 °C during stage IIIA. Temperatures during stage IVA, IVB and IVC ranged from 160 to 2400 C and peaked around 180 ° C. Fluid inclusions in stage V calcite are rare and very small, and generally lack a visible vapour phase; no temperature determinations were possible. Temperatures during stage IIA show an apparent increase with depth but no such changes are apparent during other stages. A number of inclusions from {{near the top of the}} mine show evidence that the fluids were boiling and it is possible to reconstruct dramatic variations in the water table during the vein formation which apparently overlapped caldera formation. Freezing temperatures of fluid inclusions indicate about 5. 5 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|The new mineral abellaite (IMA 2014 - 111), ideally NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH), is a {{supergene}} mineral {{that was}} found {{in one of the}} galleries of the long-disused Eureka mine, in the southern Pyrenees (Lleida province), Catalonia, Spain. Abellaite is found as sparse coatings {{on the surface of the}} primary mineralization, it forms subhedral crystals not larger than 10 mm as well as larger pseudohexagonal platelets up to ∼ 30 μm. Individual crystals commonly have a tabular to lamellar habit and form fairly disordered aggregates. The mineral is associated with a large number of primary minerals (<b>roscoelite,</b> pyrite, uraninite, coffinite, 'carbon', galena, sphalerite, nickeloan cobaltite, covellite, tennantite and chalcopyrite) and supergene minerals (hydrozincite, aragonite, gordaite, As-rich vanadinite andersonite, čejkaite, malachite and devilline). Abellaite is colourless to white, with a vitreous to nacreous lustre. The mineral is translucent, has a white streak and is non-fluorescent. The aggregates of microcrystals are highly friable. The calculated density using the ideal formula is 5. 93 g/cm 3. The chemical composition of the mineral (the mean of 10 electron microprobe analyses) is - Na 3. 88, Ca 0. 29, Pb 72. 03, C 4. 17, O 19. 47 and H 0. 17, total 100. 00 wt% (H, C and O by stoichiometry assuming the ideal formula). On the basis of 7 O atoms, the empirical formula of abellaite is Na 0. 96 Ca 0. 04 Pb 1. 98 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The simplified formula of the mineral is NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The mineral is hexagonal, space group P 63 mc, a = 5. 254 (2), c = 13. 450 (5) Å, V= 321. 5 (2) Å 3 and Z = 2. The strongest powder-diffraction lines [d in Å (I) (h k l) ] are: 3. 193 (100) (0 1 3), 2. 627 (84) (1 1 0), 2. 275 (29) (0 2 0), 2. 242 (65) (0 2 1, 0 0 6), 2. 029 (95) (0 2 3). Abellaite has a known synthetic analogue, and the crystal structure of the mineral was refined by using crystallographic data of the synthetic phase.

40|$|Vein, {{fracture}} and disseminated Au-As-Sb mineralisation at Brewery Creek is principally {{hosted by}} Tombstone Plutonic Suite (TPS) monzonite sills that have intruded Palaeozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Selwyn Basin and the Earn Group. The overall {{architecture of the}} property {{is that of a}} broad NNE trending arch of thrust sheets, with the rocks in each thrust sheet deformed into upright to steeply inclined, open to tight, variably NE, E, NW trending and plunging folds. Middle Cretaceous intrusive rocks including monzonite, syenite and hornblende gabbro cut the thrust faults and folds. The monzonite intrusive rocks crop out through the centre of the Brewery Creek property as a series of elongate, E oriented sills that have been subsequently deformed by numerous, variably oriented normal faults The paragenetic history of Brewery Creek can be resolved into three main stages: pre-, syn- and post- TPS intrusion. The pre-TPS intrusion stage encompasses sedimentary rock hosted disseminated and massive pyrite, carbonate veins and breccia infill, quartz veins, and stylolites. The TPS intrusion stage comprises the emplacement of TPS intrusions and the development of their contact aureoles and the post-TPS intrusion includes pyrite ± quartz ± carbonate ± <b>roscoelite</b> veins, quartz only veins, gold bearing arsenopyrite-quartz-carbonate veins, several stages of brecciation and stibnite ± quartz ± carbonate ± kaolinite veins. Gold assay analysis and vein measurements from the open pits along the Reserve Trend highlight two distinct mineralised orientations, E and NE. These orientations are paralleled by numerous metre-scale, steeply dipping post-TPS faults and mineralisation is bound at depth by a moderately dipping, E-striking normal fault, termed the Basal Fault. The observed normal displacement, which is evident on all of the post-TPS faults, combined with steeply dipping E-trending gold bearing veins is best explained by mineralisation occurring during a period of local extension. Gold mineralisation at Brewery Creek is characterised by an Au-As-Sb ± Ag, Pb geochemical signature with elevated As (> 1000 ppm) being the best indicator of Au > 1 ppm. High concentrations of Sb in intrusive rocks and elevated levels of Ag and Sb in sedimentary rocks provide further indication of Au. Alteration is characterised by enrichment of CO 2, K 2 O, MnO, and SO 3 and depletion of Na 2 O. This element mobility can be directly correlated to pervasive carbonate, pyrite and arsenopyrite alteration of feldspar and biotite in monzonite sills. CaO and Fe 2 O 3 are comparatively immobile, which suggests that the Ca and Fe required to form calcite and pyrite respectively was sourced from destruction of feldspars and biotite. The highest Au concentrations at Brewery Creek are hosted by arsenopyrite crystals with lower but significant levels of Au also found in arsenopyrite overgrowths on pyrite and pyrite overgrown by arsenopyrite. Gold is preferentially distributed into arsenopyrite and pyrite phases hosted by carbonate and clay altered wall rock. Veinhosted sulphide minerals are volumetrically minor and contain lower concentrations of gold. Hydrothermal fluids associated with mineralisation were reduced, CO 2 rich and near neutral in pH. Gold was likely to have been transported as a bisulphide complex and the predominance of Au-bearing wall rock arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite emphasise the importance of sulphidation reactions as a Au precipitation mechanism. Isotope data provide evidence for significant input of magmatic fluids into the mineralising system at Brewery Creek. The calculated fluid compositions are consistent with an initial mixed magmatic and crustal (sedimentary) source that is replaced over time by a mixed magmatic and evolved meteoric fluid source. A genetic model for mineralisation is described that is based on emplacement of felsic magma and subsequent cooling of the associated hydrothermal system...|$|E
