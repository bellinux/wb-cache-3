5000|$|The Paris Agreement has a 'bottom up' {{structure}} {{in contrast to}} most international environmental law treaties which are 'top down', characterised by standards and targets set internationally, for states to implement. Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, {{with its emphasis on}} consensus-building, allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets. The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of these goals are mandated under international law. This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an [...] "executive agreement rather than a treaty". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation from Congress for it to take effect.|$|E

50|$|The {{maintainability}} requirements {{address the}} costs of repairs as well as repair time. Testability (not {{to be confused with}} test requirements) requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes (on a particular system level), isolation levels, and the creation of diagnostics (procedures).As indicated above, reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development, testing, production, and operation. These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor. Reliability tasks include various analyses, planning, and failure reporting. Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost. A safety-critical system may require a formal failure <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> process throughout development, whereas a non-critical system may rely on final test reports. The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards, such as MIL-STD-785 and IEEE 1332. Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for product/process reliability monitoring.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{gap between}} {{research and practice}} {{in many areas of}} behavioral medicine. This gap {{is due in part to}} limitations in the capacity of the research database to address questions that are of central concern to clinicians, administrative decision makers, and policymakers. Thus, there has been a call for 2 ̆ 2 practical clinical trials 2 ̆ 2 that compare clinically viable alternative interventions and assess multiple outcomes important for clinical and policy decisions in diverse patient populations and settings. Such trials offer great potential, and they raise interesting challenges regarding optimal research design and source of funding. We discuss issues related to practical clinical trials in behavioral medicine, propose a need for practical behavioral trials (PBTs), and describe design features that will facilitate clinical and policy decision making. This type of PBT can help to close the gap between research and practice and advance the field of evidence-based behavioral medicine. We discuss potential challenges and objections to PBTs and conclude by providing recommendations for the design, conduct, <b>reporting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of practical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{restrictive}} {{nature of}} an Animal Biosafety Level 4 (ABSL 4) laboratory complicates even simple clinical evaluation including data capture. Typically, clinical data are recorded on paper during procedures, faxed {{out of the}} ABSL 4, and subsequently manually entered into a computer. This system has many disadvantages including transcriptional errors. Here, we describe {{the development of a}} highly customizable, tablet-PC-based computerized data-capture system, allowing reliable collection of observational and clinical data from experimental animals in a restrictive biocontainment setting. A multidisciplinary team with skills in containment laboratory animal science, database design, and software engineering collaborated on the development of this system. The goals were to design an easy-to-use and flexible user interface on a touch-screen tablet PC with user-supportable processes for recovery, full auditing capabilities, and cost effectiveness. The system simplifies data capture, reduces the necessary time in an ABSL 4 environment, offers timely <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> of data, facilitates statistical analysis, reduces potential of erroneous data entry, improves quality assurance of animal care, and advances the use and refinement of humane endpoints...|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol has {{an ambitious}} <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> system to assess nations’ {{compliance}} with their emission commitments. This system requires considerable resources {{to assure that}} the Parties report accurate emission inventory data. In spite of this, there is a danger that Parties consciously or unconsciously report erroneous data. The agreed upon review process will likely only detect large discrepancies. Because a more stringent review system would be more costly, {{there is a need to}} establish more precisely the needed accuracy to assess compliance. Emissions can alternatively be monitored by independent “top-down” methods; by measuring concentrations of gases in the atmosphere and employing meteorological models. However, all these means are as yet too imprecise to serve as independent alternatives to the emission inventories reported by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Still, they could be useful to monitor the success of the protocol. The top-down approaches might serve to some extent as useful supplements to the traditional emission inventories, in particular those dealing with fluorinated gases, and thereby provide input for improving the methods and guidelines of the emission inventories...|$|E

40|$|Objective. This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of reporting colonoscopy findings and the regular review of outcomes on adenoma detection rates. Methods. Patients who underwent colonoscopy from August 2013 to February 2014 were selected as the intervention group. The preintervention group included patients who underwent colonoscopy from January 2013 to July 2013, in which the procedure sheet for this group of patients was not accomplished. The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR), and secondary outcomes included the success rate of intubation and withdrawal time. Results. This study included 2, 467 cases: 1, 302 cases in the intervention group and 1, 165 cases in the preintervention group. There {{was no significant difference}} in demographic characteristics between the two groups. In the intervention group, withdrawal time of colonoscopy was longer (P< 0. 01), and the success rate of intubation (92. 5 % versus 89. 1 %, P< 0. 05) and detection rate of polyps (32. 6 % versus 27. 6 %, P< 0. 05) and adenomas (20. 0 % versus 16. 1 %, P< 0. 05) were higher. Significantly high detection rates for proximal adenomas, flat adenomas, and adenomas with a diameter < 5 [*]mm were observed in the intervention group (all P< 0. 01). Conclusion.
