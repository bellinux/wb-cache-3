Methods: Eighty-two myopic subjects (161 eyes; 22 males and 59 females; mean age, 26. 5 years, range 12 to 47 years) were recruited from the Tri-Service General Hospital and the Mackay Memorial Hospital.

40|$|Regulation {{of human}} renal {{adenocarcinoma}} cell growth by retinoic acid and its interactions with epidermal growth factor. Retinoic acid (RA) {{is a natural}} derivative of vitamin A which regulates the growth and differentiation of epithelia. We have previously proposed that RA participates in compensatory kidney growth and reported that RA inhibits rat mesangial cell growth. This paper describes the effects of RA on a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line (PAD) under different growth conditions, and its interactions with epidermal growth factor (EGF). PAD cells were shown to express RA receptors α and β by Northern blot analysis. In serum free cultures, addition of RA (10 - 7 M) markedly increased thymidine incorporation by PAD cells (155 ± 7 % mean ± se vs. control in 6 separate experiments; P < 0. 0001). RA also caused {{a significant increase in}} thymidine incorporation by PAD cells under conditions of rapid growth in serum supplemented medium (115 ± 2 % vs. control; P < 0. 001). RA by itself was unable to <b>reverse</b> <b>contact</b> inhibition of PAD cell growth (NS vs. control), but it synergistically enhanced the mitogenic effect of EGF on confluent monolayers (110 ± 0. 6 % vs. EGF alone; P < 0. 05). Northern blot analysis demonstrated that PAD cells express EGF receptor mRNA, and this was not significantly modified by the addition of RA. Growth arrested (serum starved) PAD cells expressed RAR-α mRNA which was up-regulated eightfold at three hours following the addition of 10 % FCS. Thus, our data show that RA is directly mitogenic for serum starved human renal adenocarcinoma cells and that it exerts complex modulation of cell growth in the presence of EGF and serum components...|$|R

To study the short-term corneal response to corneal refractive therapy for myopia and correlate it with corneal biomechanical properties as measured with the ocular response analyzer. METHODS: Eight eyes from 8 young subjects were fitted with a <b>reverse</b> geometry <b>contact</b> lens, attempting a myopic correction of - 4. 00 D. Corneal resistance factor and corneal hysteresis (CH) were measured before contact lens fitting with the ocular response analyzer. These parameters were correlated with the degree of change in apical curvature, simulated keratometry, and central corneal thickness after 3 hours of contact lens wear (effect) and 3 hours after lens removal (recovery). RESULTS: There was a trend toward a faster effect and faster recovery of the orthokeratologic effect for corneas with less resistance in terms of biomechanical properties. Corneal resistance factor did not correlate significantly, however, with any of the topographic and pachymetric parameters. Conversely, CH was significantly correlated with changes in steep keratometry (0. 758; P = 0. 029) and central corneal thickness (0. 755; P = 0. 030) during lens wear and with changes in steep keratometry (- 0. 835; P = 0. 010) during recovery. Overall, higher values of CH meant slower effect and recovery of the orthokeratologic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term response of human cornea to corneal refractive therapy is correlated with the biomechanical properties of the cornea. Of the different theories supporting such involvement of corneal response to <b>reverse</b> geometry <b>contact</b> lenses, the most likely one seems to be the one assuming a faster response and faster recovery for corneas with lower resistance.

Current-voltage spectra are recorded as the tip transitions from tunneling to point contact on surfaces prepared in three ways: (1) the clean 271 surface, (2) with a covalently bonded benzene overlayer, and (3) through nanoscale clean silicon windows formed within the benzene film. Contacts to the clean surface are more Ohmic than rectifying and show a surface leakage current that arises from partially occupied 3 ̆c 0 * states. Contacts to the benzene surface do not display a surface current and exhibit significant current rectification.

When activated, instead of rotating the crankshaft the starter used the generator coils on the shaft to rock it back and forth under the control of cams on the crankshaft. These cams closed contacts in the generator to trigger a reversing switch in the Control box that changed the crankshaft direction at the end of each swing. This gives the impression of the crankshaft continually bouncing back and forwards against compression, when operated. A separate set of ignition points fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter is released and the normal ignition system takes over.The advantage of this system is that the starter does not have to force the crankshaft to turn over against compression, so less power is required from the 6volt system.

By applying a method named <b>reverse</b> tooth <b>contact</b> analysis, the modified roll coefficients as well as parts of machine-tool settings for the face-milling of spiral bevel gears can be individually determined. Therefore, a predesigned seventh-order polynomial function of transmission error for spiral bevel gears can be obtained by the modified roll with high-order coefficients, and comparisons of the seventh-order polynomial and parabolic functions of transmission error are also performed. The achievement of spiral bevel gears with the seventh-order function of transmission error can be accomplished on a universal Cartesian-type hypoid gear generator or a numerically controlled cradle-style hypoid gear generator due to its simple generating motion of axes of the cradle and the work piece.

Structure–function studies indicate that the fingers subdomain in HIV- 1 <b>reverse</b> transcriptase <b>contacts</b> the template strand downstream of the primer terminus and is involved in strand displacement synthesis. Based on structural comparisons to the HIV- 1 enzyme, we made single amino acid substitutions at the Tyr- 64 and Leu- 99 positions in the fingers subdomain of the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase to ask whether this subdomain has a similar role in displacement synthesis. In vitro assays comparing non-displacement versus displacement synthesis revealed that substitution of alanine at Tyr- 64 generated a reverse transcriptase that was impaired in its capacity to carry out DNA and RNA displacement synthesis without affecting polymerase processivity or RNase H activity. However, substitution of Tyr- 64 with phenylalanine and a variety of substitutions at position Leu- 99 had no specific effect on displacement synthesis. The Y 64 A substitution prevented viral replication in vivo, and Y 64 A virus generated reduced levels of reverse transcription intermediates at all steps beyond the synthesis of minus strong stop DNA.

RVF is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) affecting humans and {{a wide range of}} animals.

During 2007 a large RVF outbreak occurred in Sudan with a total of 747 confirmed human cases including 230 deaths (case fatality 30. 8 %); although it has been estimated 75, 000 were infected. It was most severe in White Nile, El Gezira, and Sennar states near to the White Nile and the Blue Nile Rivers.

40|$|Electrowetting, the {{phenomena}} of changing interfacial energy of an interface, {{has been demonstrated}} to be an excellent actuation and pumping mechanism for microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip applications. Individual droplets can be moved and deformed on microchips using voltages as low as 15 V. In electrowetting, application of a voltage across the electrodes of a micro-droplet causes it to change the interfacial energy of solid-liquid interface which in turn changes the contact angle of the liquid on the solid. The contact angle {{is a measure of}} the extent of wetting of the liquid on the surface. In conventional electrowetting, it has been found that the polarity of the applied potential does not affect the contact angle change. However, our experimental results show that the change of polarity across the electrodes of a micro-droplet can <b>reverse</b> the <b>contact</b> angle change. We call this phenomenon &# 039;dewetting&# 039;. The actual physics behind this still remains unexplored.

A 60 nm silicon dioxide or a 1. 4 µm thickness strontium doped lead zirconium titanate (PSZT) layer was used as the dielectric and 380 nm of Teflon was used to make a hydrophobic surface. A platinum wire, which was inserted into the micro-droplet, formed the top electrode. The highest dewetting contact angle change was found to be 9 o for a 5 µl droplet at 60 V. This compared to a maximum of 41 o which we obtained for conventional electrowetting...|$|R
40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected, emerging, mosquito-borne {{disease with}} severe {{negative}} impact on human and animal health and economy. RVF is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) affecting humans and {{a wide range of}} animals. The virus is transmitted through bites from mosquitoes and exposure to viremic blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. During 2007 a large RVF outbreak occurred in Sudan with a total of 747 confirmed human cases including 230 deaths (case fatality 30. 8 %); although it has been estimated 75, 000 were infected. It was most severe in White Nile, El Gezira, and Sennar states near to the White Nile and the Blue Nile Rivers. Notably, RVF was not demonstrated in livestock until after the human cases appeared and unfortunately, there are no records or reports of the number of affected animals or deaths. Ideally, animals should serve as sentinels to prevent loss of human life, but the situation here was <b>reversed.</b> Animal <b>contact</b> seemed to be the most dominant risk factor followed by animal products and mosquito bites. The Sudan outbreak followed an unusually heavy rainfall in the country with severe flooding and previous studies on RVF in Sudan suggest that RVFV is endemic in parts of Sudan. An RVF outbreak results in human disease, but also large economic loss with an impact beyond the immediate influence on the directly affected agricultural producers. The outbreak emphasizes the need for collaboration between veterinary and health authorities, entomologists, environmental specialists, and biologists, as the best strategy towards the prevention and control of RVF...|$|R
40|$|We {{have devised}} a {{high-resolution}} protein footprinting methodology to dissect HIV- 1 <b>reverse</b> transcriptase (RT) <b>contacts</b> to the viral RNA:tRNA complex. The experimental strategy included modification of surface-exposed lysines in RT and RT-viral RNA:tRNA complexes by the primary amine selective reagent NHS-biotin, SDS/PAGE separation of p 66 and p 51 polypeptides, in gel proteolysis, and comparative mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments. The lysines modified in free RT but protected from biotinylation in the nucleoprotein complex were readily revealed by this approach. Results of a control experiment examining the RT-DNA:DNA complex were in excellent {{agreement with the}} crystal structure data on the identical complex. Probing the RT-viral RNA:tRNA complex revealed {{that a majority of}} protein contacts are located in the primer-template binding cleft in common with the RT-DNA:DNA and RT-RNA:DNA species. However, our footprinting data indicate that the p 66 fingers subdomain makes additional contacts to the viral RNA:tRNA specific for this complex and not detected with DNA:DNA. The protein footprinting method described herein has a generic application for high-resolution solution structural studies of multiprotein-nucleic acid contacts...|$|R
50|$|The Pentagon {{requires}} {{at least}} 600 mean miles before an essential function failure. The vehicle will {{be capable of}} traveling one terrain feature after having endured a single small caliber arms sized perforation to the fuel tank, engine oil reservoir, or coolant system. It {{will be able to}} run on two flat tires. The JLTV must also operate in altitudes from minus 500 feet to 12,000 feet and maintain full mission capability in temperatures from -40 to 125 F, according to established requirements. When temperatures drop well below zero, the JLTV must start within one minute with no external aids, kits or prior warming of the batteries. The vehicle must be capable of traveling 350 paved miles at 35 mph or 300 mi in operational terrain on a single tank of JP-8 fuel. Acceleration from 0 to 30 mph in seven seconds on dry, level, hard terrain is required, as is the ability to ford 60 in of saltwater without a fording kit, in forward and <b>reverse,</b> while maintaining <b>contact</b> with the ground.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To monitor {{changes in}} corneal {{structure}} {{and level of}} inflammatory mediators in tears of myopic patients following orthokeratology (OK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). METHODS: Sixty-two myopic subjects were analyzed in this prospective study. Thirty-two had worn Paragon CRT contact lenses and 30 underwent standard LASIK. Thirty-two control subjects were also recruited. Pachometry and corneal topography were performed 12 months after both interventions. Tears were collected and assayed using ELISA for IL- 6, IL- 8, matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). RESULTS: Corneal power decreased in the central area and increased in the paracentral area. Simultaneously, there was a central corneal thinning with mid-peripheral thickening for OK. No changes were observed for LASIK. In comparison with controls, IL- 6, IL- 8, MMP- 9, and EGF levels were increased significantly for OK (P < 0. 01). Only MMP- 9 (P < 0. 01) and EGF (P < 0. 01) were increased for LASIK. Pro-inflammatory response {{was found to be}} associated with the degree of myopia in the OK group. The MMP- 9 and EGF upregulation was linked to the presence of iron deposition in both groups, whereas increased levels of EGF were connected with the presence of myopic regression after LASIK. CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions involved important tissue reshaping. The physical presence of a <b>reverse</b> geometry <b>contact</b> lens caused certain markers to change significantly in comparison with no lens wear or LASIK in the long-term response. MMP- 9 was significantly higher in tears of subjects presenting iron deposition after OK or LASIK, and EGF levels seemed to play an important role in postoperative refractive outcomes after LASIK.

40|$|Most of the {{literature}} accepts, despite many controversial results, that during oxida-tion/reduction films of conducting polymers (CPs) move from electronic conductors to insulators. Thus, engineers and device’s designers are forced to use metallic supports to reoxidize the material for reversible device work. Electrochromic front experiments appear as main visual support of the claimed insulating nature of reduced CPs. Here, we present a different design of the biomimetic electrochromic front that corroborates the electronic and ionic conducting nature of deep reduced films. The direct contact PEDOT metal/electrolyte and film/electrolyte was prevented from electrolyte contact until 1 cm far from the metal contact with protecting Parafilm®. The deep reduced PEDOT film supports the flow of high currents promoting reaction induced electrochromic color changes beginning 1 cm far from the metal-polymer electrical contact and advancing, through the reduced film, toward the metal <b>contact.</b> <b>Reverse</b> color changes during oxidation/reduction always are initiated at the film/electrolyte contact advancing, under the protecting film, toward the film/metal contact.
