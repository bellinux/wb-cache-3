40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a flight management system (FMS) implemented as on-board intelligence for rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicles (RUAVs). This hierarchi-cal flight management system endows each vehicle with au-tonomy resembling sense-reason-act processes of intelligent agents in nature.

Intelligence based on probabilistic reasoning is provided by an on-board strategy planner.

5000|$|Tyrannosaurus has {{appeared}} in many media and is {{perhaps one of the}} most widely used dinosaurs in existence, and as such many products have been marketed using this dinosaur. Various incarnations of, and creatures based on T. rex have appeared in video games, and several game series have featured Tyrannosaurus a centerpiece.

40|$|Helicopters {{are often}} used to {{transport}} supplies and equipment. When a heavy load is carried via suspension cables below a helicopter, the load oscillates in response to helicopter motion and disturbance forces, such as wind. This oscillation is dangerous and adversely affects control of the helicopter, especially when carrying large or heavy loads. By adding input shaping to the helicopter's flight controller, the suspended load oscillation caused by helicopter motion is greatly reduced. A significant benefit {{of this approach is}} that it does not require measurement of the load position. This thesis contains derivations and analysis of simple planar helicopter-load dynamic models, and these models are verified using experimental data from model-scale, <b>radio-controlled</b> <b>helicopters.</b> The effectiveness of input shaping at eliminating suspended load oscillation is then demonstrated on this experimental hardware. In addition, the design of an attitude command, near-hover flight controller that combines input shaping and a common flight control architecture is illustrated using dynamic models of a Sikorsky S- 61 helicopter, and simulation results are shown for example lateral and longitudinal repositioning movements. Results show that applying input shaping to simulated pilot commands greatly improves performance when carrying a suspended load.

Aerial photographs of the river were taken from a RC helicopter equipped with a digital single-lens reflex camera and polarized filter. To quantify salmon density within the census area, the number of salmon per aerial photograph was counted using image-processing software. Salmon could be clearly identified in photographs taken from an altitude of ∼ 30 m. Salmon numbers estimated by aerial census and seine-netting were significantly related. The results indicate that a small RC helicopter {{can be used to}} generate adult salmon abundance data in Japanese rivers...|$|R
