These are applicable {{to a broad}} class of algorithms including most of those previously discussed in the literature. Three types of results are derived: an asymptotic stability <b>result</b> <b>for</b> networks with external disturbances but without time delays, an asymptotic stability <b>result</b> <b>for</b> a class of algorithms with a linear cost with both external disturbances and time delays, and a gain stability <b>result</b> <b>for</b> more general algorithms with both disturbances and time delays.

40|$|Paradan and Vergne {{generalised}} the quantisation commutes with reduction {{principle of}} Guillemin and Sternberg from symplectic to Spin$^c$-manifolds. We extend their result to noncompact groups and manifolds. This {{leads to a}} <b>result</b> <b>for</b> cocompact actions, and a <b>result</b> <b>for</b> non-cocompact actions for reduction at zero. The <b>result</b> <b>for</b> cocompact actions is {{stated in terms of}} $K$-theory of group $C^*$-algebras, and the <b>result</b> <b>for</b> non-cocompact actions is an equality of numerical indices. In the non-cocompact case, the result generalises to Spin$^c$-Dirac operators twisted by vector bundles. This yields an index formula for Braverman's analytic index of such operators, in terms of characteristic classes on reduced spaces. Comment: 61 pages. Added a result on Spin-c Dirac operators twisted by vector bundle...|$|R
