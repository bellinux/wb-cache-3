5000|$|The painted finch {{is within}} the genus Emblema which early studies placed four species inside of. [...] More recent {{research}} has since determined that this genus did not form a natural assemblage {{and three of the}} four species were segregated into the genus Stagonopleura. The species include S. bella (Beautiful <b>firetail),</b> S. oculata (<b>Red-eared</b> <b>firetail)</b> and S. guttata (Diamond <b>firetail).</b> The painted <b>finch</b> is now the only species present within the genus Emblema.|$|R
50|$|A large {{variety of}} bird species inhabit the park {{including}} many sea birds, <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetail,</b> white-breasted robin, rock parrot and emu. Native mammals {{that can be}} found within the park include southern brown bandicoots, western grey kangaroos, western ringtail possums and brush wallabies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetail</b> (Stagonopleura oculata) is {{a species}} of estrildid finch found in the forests and coastal {{thickets}} of south-western Australia. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 20,000 - 50,000 km2. The IUCN has classified the species as being of least concern.|$|R
50|$|With the bitterns, some forty waterbird {{species have}} been {{recorded}} at the swamp, with another five in the surrounding wetlands. Of these, ten breed in the area, including blue-billed ducks. Long-toed stints and Eurasian coots are known to use the swamp. Other birds include western rosellas, western thornbills, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) {{because it is the}} only breeding site for the western subspecies of Cape Barren goose known as the Recherche Cape Barren goose. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of flesh-footed shearwaters, sooty oystercatchers, fairy terns and, probably, white-faced storm-petrels. Rock parrots and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails</b> have also been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The three lakes, with a {{collective}} area of 434 ha, {{have been identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because they support a population of the endangered Australasian bittern, with up to ten breeding pairs present. [...] The IBA supports large numbers of little grassbirds, while western rosellas, red-capped parrots, red-winged fairy-wrens, western thornbills, western spinebills and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails</b> occur in the surrounding bushland.|$|R
50|$|The range {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of endangered short-billed black cockatoos and western whipbirds, and is visited by endangered long-billed black-cockatoos. Significant biome-restricted or range-restricted bird species found in the range include red-capped and regent parrots, western rosellas, rufous treecreepers, red-winged and blue-breasted fairywrens, purple-gaped honeyeaters, western spinebills, western thornbills, western yellow and white-breasted robins, and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it supports 4600-15,000 short-billed black cockatoos during their the non-breeding season, with {{a small number of}} breeding birds, forming the largest population of non-breeding birds in Australia. The IBA also supports small populations of western corellas, red-capped parrots, western rosellas, western spinebills and western thornbills. [...] Regent parrots, white-breasted and western yellow robins, and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails</b> have been occasionally recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an IBA because it supports about 800 long-billed black cockatoos, and up to 200 short-billed black cockatoos, in the non-breeding season. It also supports important populations of red-capped parrots, western rosellas, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills, western thornbills, western yellow and white-breasted robins, and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails.</b> [...] Rufous treecreepers and the forest redtail subspecies of red-tailed black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso) have been regularly recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports at least 1480 long-billed black cockatoos, and up to 450 short-billed black cockatoos, during the non-breeding season at roosts within range of feeding habitat. [...] The forest redtail subspecies of the red-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso) is a breeding resident. The IBA also contains populations of red-capped parrots, western rosellas, rufous treecreepers, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills, western thornbills, western yellow and white-breasted robins, and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetail</b> (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it contains almost the entire population of noisy scrub-birds, a large proportion of western bristlebirds and most of the western subspecies of western whipbirds. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of flesh-footed shearwaters and, probably, of great-winged petrels, as well as significant numbers of short-billed black cockatoos, Australasian bitterns, western rosellas, red-capped and rock parrots, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills, western thornbills, white-breasted robins and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetails.</b> [...] Hooded plovers are regularly seen. Mammals found in the IBA include Gilbert's potoroos, quokkas, western ringtail possums, honey possums, western brush wallabies and quendas.|$|R
5000|$|The reserve forms {{part of the}} Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species. [...] It supports a population of noisy scrub-birds, a species that {{was thought to be}} extinct until rediscovered in 1961. The population then was estimated at less than 100, while in 1994 it was thought to be around 1100 (of which 450 occur in the reserve). [...] Other threatened birds inhabiting the reserve are the western ground parrot, western bristlebird, western whipbird and Australasian bittern.Other threatened bird species that have been observed within the park include short-billed black cockatoo, peregrine falcon, hooded plover, little bittern and <b>red-eared</b> <b>firetail.</b> Seabirds nesting on the islands around the bay include the great-winged petrel and flesh-footed shearwater.|$|R
50|$|Most are {{sensitive}} to cold and require warm, usually tropical, habitats, although a few, such as the eastern alpine mannikin, mountain <b>firetail</b> and red-browed <b>finch,</b> and the genus Stagonopleura, have adapted to the cooler climates of southern Australia and the highlands of New Guinea.|$|R
