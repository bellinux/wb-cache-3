30|$|Bipolar {{electrical}} energy {{is in fact}} a monopolar cutting electrical current with the advantage that the current travels between two poles at some 8 -mm distance from one another. The distention medium is ionic.

Dilatation of the cervix up to Hegar 10.5 for the 27 -French <b>resectoscopes</b> is also needed here. There are no small barrel <b>resectoscopes</b> available, thus necessitating general anesthesia.

Isotonic fluids like sodium chloride used with bipolar <b>resectoscopes</b> may reduce complications related to electrolyte disturbances however similar principles of fluid management should be applied to all cases and the procedure terminated if excess fluid has been absorbed.|$|R

30|$|Operative hysteroscopic {{procedures}} are usually carried out using <b>resectoscopes</b> which are larger diameter, continuous flow operating hysteroscopes. They incorporate a working element that moves an electrically activated wire loop. These devices were initially developed to use monopolar current, which require non-electrolyte distending media such as glycine and sorbitol. Such solutions are however hypotonic so that excessive absorption {{can cause a}} number of complications including hyponatremia, a variable degree of hypo-osmolality, and certain solution-specific problems that are described below. Isotonic electrolyte-containing solutions cannot be used with monopolar energy because this leads to activation of ions that disperse the electric current and reduce the power density. Hence the heat generated in tissues is insufficient to destroy or have a tissue effect [2].|$|R
30|$|Preoperative {{treatment}} of large leiomyoma using GnRH agonists has been advocated [9, 10, 11], but the cost-efficacy ratio {{of this strategy}} has been discussed [12]. Use of glycine as a distension medium with this technique is associated with risks of fluid overload, hypoosmolality and hyponatriemia, first described as the transuretral resection of the prostate (TURP) syndrome [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This constitutes a risk of potentially fatal hyponatremic encephalopathy [20]. Recently, bipolar <b>resectoscopes</b> have been developed [21]. These devices allow the use of saline as a distension medium, which {{reduces the risk of}} fluid overload compared to glycine. Transcervical resection of intracavitary leiomyoma can be the source of peroperative bleeding by opening of radial veins around the myomas [3].

30|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two types of}} resectoscopes which differ in outer diameter: 7.5 and 9.2  mm. The 7.5 -mm <b>resectoscope</b> {{should be used in}} case of narrow cervical canal or difficult dilatation; the 9.2  mm <b>resectoscope</b> allows to perform major surgery [1].|$|E
30|$|The use of {{isotonic}} {{fluid in}} operative hysteroscopy is considered safer as fluid absorption {{does not cause}} hyponatraemia. However the exact volume of normal saline absorption that is safe is not known. In theory this could be higher than hypotonic solutions [32]. In a randomised study of 200 pre-menopausal women undergoing operative hysteroscopy with monopolar versus bipolar energy using glycine 1.5  % and normal saline respectively, the authors documented a statistically significant reduction of sodium from 138.7 to 133.8  mmol/L when glycine was used whereas there was {{no change in the}} sodium concentration in the saline group [33]. However they found the fluid deficit to be significantly higher in the normal saline group. They concluded that <b>resectoscopes</b> using bipolar energy have a safer profile than monopolar energy due to the unchanged sodium concentrations. The increased fluid deficit was not accompanied by any complications during or after the procedure. Similar findings were also noted in a prospective randomized study where 155 women undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy were randomized to 0.9  % saline versus 1.5  % Glycine. The authors found no change in the sodium levels or the osmolality in the women who underwent treatment with normal saline [34].|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{absorption}} is {{an unpredictable}} complication of endoscopic surgery. Absorption of {{small amounts of}} fluid (1 – 2 litre) occurs in 5 – 10 % of patients undergoing transurethral prostatic resection and results in an easily overlooked mild transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome. Large-scale fluid absorption is rare but leads to symptoms severe enough to require intensive care. Pathophysiological mechanisms consist of pharmacological effects of the irrigant solutes, the volume effect of the irrigant water, dilutional hyponatraemia and brain oedema. Other less widely known factors include absolute losses of sodium by urinary excretion and morphological changes in the heart muscle, both of which promote a hypokinetic circulation. Studies in animals, volun-teers and patients show that irrigation with glycine solution should be avoided. Preventive measures, such as low-pressure irrigation, might reduce the extent of fluid absorption but does not eliminate this complication. Monitoring the extent of absorption during surgery allows control of the fluid balance in the individual patient, but such monitoring is not used widely. However, the anaesthetist {{must be aware of}} the symptoms and be able to diagnose this com-plication. Treatment should be based on administration of hypertonic saline rather than on diuretics. New techniques, such as bipolar <b>resectoscopes</b> and vaporizing instead of resecting tissue, result in a continuous change of the prerequisites for fluid absorption and its consequences...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH) is {{the most}} common pathological condition of aged men which significantly impairs the quality of life status. Though pharmacotherapy with adrenoblockers and 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors markedly decreased the rate of surgical interventions, BPH surgery still constitutes the main workload (around ¼ of total) of urologists in the department. The results of the observational study performed by Barry et al. show that the probability of surgical treatment of BPH during the period of 4 years for subjects with mild symptoms equals to 10 %, and in case of moderate and severe symptoms - 24 % and 39 %, respectively. According to the data of large multicenter study performed with 7, 588 men in Asia and Australia, moderate and severe symptoms are present in 29 %, 40 %, and 56 % of men in their fifth, sixth, and seventh decade of life, respectively. Symptoms are the main driving force of BPH treatment, but their correlation with residual urine, objective findings of uroflowmetry and invasive urodynamics is only poor. The association of various parameters with the outcomes of surgical treatment is complicated and still not completely investigated. Therefore finding parameters that predict the outcome of surgical BPH treatment is important. According to the literature, unfavorable outcomes of transurethral resection are present in around 15 - 30 % of men with symptomatic BPH. This is mostly associated with inadequate preoperative evaluation, not fully clear prognostic factors, and lack of criteria for elective surgery. Studies show that good postoperative results can be achieved in up to 90 % of cases if only patients with urodynamically proved obstruction are operated on. TURP is effective in only 60 % of obstruction-free patients. Obstruction can be reliably proved by urodynamic investigation, but this investigation is invasive, time- and cost-consuming, and thus is not used universally. There is no complete agreement on whether invasive urodynamics and selection of patients based on its results could help to improve postoperative outcomes of BPH surgery. Prognostic methods of obstruction need to be developed and proved to be equal or better than urodynamics in terms of postoperative outcome. Clinical and urodynamic factors of surgically treated BPH patients are investigated and compared {{in the first part of}} this work. The second part is intended to investigate the clinical factors important for the prediction of bladder outlet obstruction. The predictive model is presented. The work has been accomplished at the Clinic of Urology, Kaunas University of Medicine. THE AIM AND OBJECTIVES The aim To determine clinical and urodynamic factors important to the outcomes of surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Objectives 1. 	To evaluate the results of surgical treatment of BPH. 2. 	To evaluate correlations of preoperative clinical and urodynamic factors with the outcomes of surgical treatment. 3. 	To determine preoperative prognostic factors for favorable outcomes of surgical treatment. 4. 	To evaluate correlations of clinical factors with urodynamic bladder outlet obstruction/BPH and to determine prognostic factors for bladder outlet obstruction. 5. 	To evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model. The novelty and originality of the study There is not completely clear whether urodynamic studies could help to improve the results of surgical treatment for BPH. Recently some authors have claimed that the outcomes of TURP are the same, whether routinely selected or only urodynamically obstructed subjects are operated on. Few data show that simple clinical parameters, e. g. flow rate or transition zone index, can be as much predictive as urodynamic studies, but this is still unclear. Further investigations are needed to confirm this. Our study was intended to investigate the relationship between the clinical and urodynamic factors with respect to TURP outcomes. We have no data indicating that similar studies have been performed in Lithuania. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred and forty men aged over 45 years with lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH were involved in this prospective study carried out during the period of March 2003 to June 2005. Subjects either applied themselves or were referred to our hospital by another institution. Study inclusion criteria were applied. Study activities were performed after obtaining the patients’ informed consent. General and targeted investigations were performed. After the collection of medical history, the symptoms were evaluated by self-filled IPSS questionnaire, including the QoL question. PSA was evaluated. The prostate was evaluated by digital rectal examination. Free urinary flow rate was investigated by uroflowmetry (Urodyn 1000). Transabdominal bladder scan was performed for residual urine, and prostate volume was estimated using transrectal ultrasound examination (Sonoline SI- 250, Siemens; Panther, B-K Medical; LOGIQ 200 Pro Series, GE Medical Systems). The total prostate and transitional zone volumes were calculated according to the ellipsoid formula: 0. 52 x transverse diameter x superoinferior diameter x anterioposterior diameter. Intravesical protrusion of prostate was indicated if it exceeded 1 cm. Invasive urodynamic investigation was carried out afterwards. Cystometry with pressure/flow (P/Q) study was performed (Duet®Logic, Medtronic), and obstruction grade as well as bladder contractility were evaluated. Patients were selected for elective surgical treatment by routinely used indications and irrespectively of the result of the urodynamic investigation. Transurethral resections (TURP) were performed using the standard technique, with resection started at the basis of prostate till verumontanum. All surgical procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia using 24 - 26 CH <b>resectoscopes</b> of Storz type, monopolar loops, and 90 - 110 W electric power. Resected tissues were weighted and investigated by pathologist. Postoperative investigations were performed 6 months after the treatment in the same way as preoperatively. Seventy-four prostate cancer-free subjects and subjects without strictures of urethra were treated in the final analysis of this case control study (the study group). The comparative group (retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data) consisted of 69 subjects with symptomatic BPH. These subjects were operated on by TURP and participated in previous prospective study where urodynamics was not applied. Enrollment and investigation of subjects was performed using the same criteria as in the recent study. Data from 130 urodynamically investigated patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH were used for the prediction of bladder outlet obstruction. Study inclusion criteria: 1. 	Age ≥ 45 years; 2. 	IPSS > 7; 3. 	Benign prostatic enlargement; 4. 	Written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: 1. 	Previous surgery on urinary bladder, prostate or urethra; 2. 	Cystitis, urinary bladder stones, carcinoma of urinary bladder, urethral stricture; 3. 	Clinically significant renal or hepatic failure; 4. 	Prostate cancer or PSA > 10 (unless excluded by prostate biopsy); 5. 	Small amounts of voided urine on uroflowmetry ( 40 or the zone “obstructed” in the ICS nomogram or III-VI grade of obstruction according to Schafer nomogram; ·	Equivocal (EQ) *: AG number 20 - 40 or the zone “equivocal” in the ICS nomogram or II grade of obstruction according to Schafer nomogram; ·	Non-obstructed (NOBS) : AG number < 20 or the zone “unobstructed” in the ICS nomogram or 0 -I grade of obstruction according to Schafer nomogram. *Equivocal was treated as non-obstructed in the final analysis. This approach is based on the data of literature and absence of significant differences between urodynamic parameters of NOBS and EQ categories as shown in our study. Detrusor contractility was classified as: ·	Weak: categories vw, w-, w+ according to Schafer or DECO < 1. ·	Normal/strong: categories n-, n+ and st according to Shafer or DECO ≥ 1.
