5|$|Following Romania's {{transition}} to a Socialist Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies {{of the royal family}} described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E
25|$|From {{early on}} in the news reports of the {{upcoming}} series through most of the summer, it was reported that along with Doherty and Garth, Tori Spelling would be reprising her role as an older alumni of West Beverly Hills High. After reading the script, Tori Spelling expressed interest returning, and the writers decided to give Donna her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. Backdrop retail store signage in the first several episodes during shopping excursions scenes and one setup line <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> role foreshadowed the role that would be unfulfilled. By August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E

50|$|Only two ancient sources make {{reference}} to her: the historian Tacitus and Strabo the Geographer. Tacitus <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Cotys’ widow and Strabo <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as the unnamed daughter of Polemon Pythodoros and the wife of Cotys.

500|$|Thelma Catherine Ryan {{was born}} in 1912 in the small mining town of Ely, Nevada. Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and truck farmer of Irish descent; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant. [...] "Pat" [...] was a {{nickname}} given to her by her father, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> birth date the day before Saint Patrick's Day and Irish ancestry. Upon enrolling in college in 1931 she dropped her first name of Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally rendering it as Patricia; the name change, however, was not a legal action, merely one of preference.|$|E
500|$|Under the new contract, in 1958, Cardinale {{was given}} a minor role with leading Italian actors Vittorio Gassman, Totò, Marcello Mastroianni, and Renato Salvatori in Mario Monicelli's internationally {{successful}} criminal comedy Big Deal on Madonna Street (I soliti ignoti). She portrayed Carmelita, a Sicilian girl virtually imprisoned in her home by her overpowering brother. The comedy was a huge success, making Cardinale instantly recognizable. Some newspapers were already <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "la fidanzata d'Italia" [...] (Italy's sweetheart). Later that year, she had a leading role opposite Yvonne Monlaur in Claudio Gora's romantic comedy Three Strangers in Rome.|$|E

[...] Nesbit enjoyed socializing with her staff and was frequently consulted by them for advice on personal matters.|$|R
500|$|The {{coming of}} Prince Albert led to {{significant}} changes in Victoria's household. Lehzen had opposed Coburg ambitions of Victoria marrying Albert, believing the princess to be a [...] "second Queen Elizabeth, virgin and independent of male influence." [...] Albert was well-educated, and had just completed a tour of Europe, preceded by years at the University of Bonn. Victoria's court dismayed his puritan German sensibilities. Lehzen and Albert soon developed a dislike for each other; she sought to thwart Albert's will in various ways and he found her personally repugnant and unworthy of befriending the queen, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "the hag" [...] and a [...] "crazy stupid intriguer".|$|E
500|$|The film {{underwent}} {{one final}} change in title: after Connery had finished filming Diamonds Are Forever he had pledged {{that he would}} [...] "never" [...] play Bond again. Connery's wife, Micheline, suggested the title Never Say Never Again, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's vow and the producers acknowledged her contribution by listing on the end credits [...] "Title [...] "Never Say Never Again" [...] by: Micheline Connery". A final attempt by Fleming's trustees to block the film {{was made in the}} High Court in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and Never Say Never Again was permitted to proceed.|$|E
500|$|They began dating, with Lennon now <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "Cyn". In {{the autumn}} of 1958, she ended her {{engagement}} to be with him, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. [...] His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when he slapped her across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, she broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology. Another time a cleaning woman at the college caught Lennon hitting her and suggested she stay away from him.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] is a hip hop and trap {{influenced}} track, {{made clear}} especially in Fetty Wap's rap verse. Lyrically, the song discusses someone's doubts {{while in a}} relationship, presumably Stefani <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> recent divorce from husband Gavin Rossdale. Upon release, [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] received mixed reviews from music critics. Some critics labeled the song as [...] "trippy" [...] and a [...] "club stomper", while others called it [...] "dated" [...] and questioned its [...] "awkward" [...] placement on [...] the album. The track was included on the set list for her 2016 concert series This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour.|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft {{appears as}} only a tourist in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, during her travels she was {{actually}} conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear why she had travelled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s historian Per Nyström uncovered documents in local Swedish and Norwegian archives that {{shed light on the}} purpose of her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in legal documents as [...] "Mrs. Mary Imlay, my best friend and wife", although the two were not married.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who {{was sitting}} beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and licked his plate. The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E

500|$|Fuller had angered fellow {{poet and}} critic James Russell Lowell when she {{reviewed}} his work, calling him [...] "absolutely wanting {{in the true}} spirit and tone of poesy... his verse is stereotyped, his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him." [...] In response, Lowell took revenge in his satirical A Fable for Critics, first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her {{what was called the}} [...] "most wholly negative characterization" [...] in the work. <b>Referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and [...] "when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose".|$|E
500|$|Avellone {{has said}} he felt he failed in {{creating}} a sympathetic Sith Lord, recalling buglists by QA testers <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "that crusty annoying lady," [...] and he considered the ending's explanations of her motivations more [...] "hamfisted" [...] than sympathetic. However, {{in an interview with}} 1UP.com he called Kreia, along with the Handmaiden, his favorite character after T3-M4, citing the mystery surrounding her. He called his favorite [...] "unexpected turn" [...] in the game the revelation of Kreia being neither fully good nor evil. In another interview, this time with Star Wars fansite EU Cantina, he called his favorite character either Kreia or T3, and called her scene where she explains her relationship with the Force one of his favorites in the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, Fulla is listed among eight ásynjur who attend an evening {{drinking}} banquet held for Ægir.

[...] In chapter 32, poetic expressions for gold are given, one of which includes [...] "Fulla's snood." [...] In chapter 36, a work by the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is cited that references Fulla's golden headgear ("the falling sun [...] of the plain [...] of Fulla's eyelashes shone on [...] "). Fulla receives a final mention in the Prose Edda in chapter 75, where Fulla appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and the yearning for a long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|Meredith is {{the narrator}} of the show and serves as the focal point for most episodes. Pompeo's {{connection}} with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd) is acclaimed as a high point of the series. Rhimes has characterized Meredith as not believing in good or bad, but instead doing what she thinks is right. Grey has been positively received by television critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". News of Pompeo leaving arose when it was made clear that her contract ended after the eighth season, {{and whether or not}} she would return to the series after her contract expires has been the centre of media speculation ever since. In 2016, Pompeo re-negotiated her contract and signed up for the thirteenth season of the show.|$|E
500|$|Van der Waerden's {{visit was}} part of a {{convergence}} of mathematicians {{from all over the world}} to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as der Noether, using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation. They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether [...] "the greatest woman mathematician of all time".|$|E
