5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic <b>repulsion</b> between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic <b>repulsion</b> is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
40|$|Self {{diffusion}} {{and mutual}} diffusion in two-dimensional membrane systems are analyzed. It is shown that interprotein interactions can produce markedly different density-dependent {{changes in the}} diffusion coefficients describing these two processes; the qualitative differences are illustrated by using a theoretical formalism valid for dilute solutions. Results are obtained for three analytical potentials: hard-core <b>repulsions,</b> soft <b>repulsions,</b> and soft <b>repulsions</b> with weak attractions. Self diffusion is inhibited by all three interactions. In contrast, mutual diffusion is inhibited by attractions but is enhanced by <b>repulsions.</b> It is shown that such interaction-dependent differences in self diffusion and mutual diffusion could underlie, among other things, the disparity in protein diffusion coefficients extracted from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and postelectrophoresis relaxation data...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} Ti–O Coulomb <b>repulsions</b> in the appearance of the ferroelectric state in BaTiO 3 as well as the role of the Zn–O Coulomb <b>repulsions</b> in BiZn 0. 5 Ti 0. 5 O 3, using a first-principles calculation with optimized structures. In tetragonal BaTiO 3, it is found that the Coulomb <b>repulsions</b> between Ti 3 s and 3 p states and O 2 s and 2 p states have an important role for the appearance of Ti ion displacement. In BiZn 0. 5 Ti 0. 5 O 3, on the other hand, the stronger Zn–O Coulomb <b>repulsions,</b> which are due to the 3 s, 3 p, and 3 d (d 10) states of the Zn ion, have more important role than the Ti–O Coulomb <b>repulsions</b> for the appearance of the tetragonal structure. Our suggestion is consistent with the other ferroelectric perovskite oxides ABO 3 in the appearance of tetragonal structures as well as rhombohedral structures...|$|R

5|$|The half-lives of {{mendelevium}} isotopes mostly increase smoothly from 245Md onwards, {{reaching a}} maximum at 258Md. Experiments and predictions {{suggest that the}} half-lives will then decrease, apart from 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode due to the mutual <b>repulsion</b> of the protons posing a limit to the island of relative stability of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual <b>repulsion</b> of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E

40|$|DNA bending is {{important}} for the packaging of genetic material, regulation of gene expression and interaction of nucleic acids with proteins. Consequently, it is of considerable interest to quantify the energetic factors that must be overcome to induce bending of DNA, such as base stacking and phosphate–phosphate <b>repulsions.</b> In the present work, the electrostatic contribution of phosphate–phosphate <b>repulsions</b> to the free energy of bending DNA is examined for 71 bp linear and bent-form model structures. The bent DNA model was based on the crystallographic structure of a full turn of DNA in a nucleosome core particle. A Green's function approach based on a linear-scaling smooth conductor-like screening model was applied to ascertain the contribution of individual phosphate–phosphate <b>repulsions</b> and overall electrostatic stabilization in aqueous solution. The effect of charge neutralization by site-bound ions was considered using Monte Carlo simulation to characterize the distribution of ion occupations and contribution of phosphate <b>repulsions</b> to the free energy of bending as a function of counterion load. The calculations predict that the phosphate–phosphate <b>repulsions</b> account for ∼ 30 % of the total free energy required to bend DNA from canonical linear B-form into the conformation found in the nucleosome core particle...|$|R

Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|The half-lives of {{nobelium}} isotopes increase smoothly from 250No to 253No. However, a dip {{appears at}} 254No, and beyond this the half-lives of even-even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes the dominant decay mode. For example, the half-life of 256No is almost three seconds, {{but that of}} 258No is only 1.2milliseconds. This shows that at nobelium, the mutual <b>repulsion</b> of protons poses a limit to the region of long-lived nuclei in the actinide series.

40|$|The {{generalized}} Stokes-Einstein {{equation is}} used, {{together with the}} two-dimensional pressure equation, to analyze mutual diffusion in concentrated membrane systems. These equations {{can be used to}} investigate the role that both direct and hydrodynamic interactions play in determining diffusive behavior. Here only direct interactions are explicitly incorporated into the theory at high densities; however, both direct and hydrodynamic interactions are analyzed for some dilute solutions. We look at diffusion in the presence of weak attractions, soft <b>repulsions,</b> and hard-core <b>repulsions.</b> It is found that, at low densities, attractions retard mutual diffusion while <b>repulsions</b> enhance it. Mechanistically, attractions tend to tether particles together and oppose the dissipation of gradients or fluctuations in concentration, while <b>repulsions</b> provide a driving force that pushes particles apart. At higher concentrations, changes {{in the structure of the}} fluid enhance mutual diffusion even in the presence of attractions. It is shown that the theoretical description of postelectrophoresis relaxation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments must be modified if interacting systems are studied. The effects of interactions on mutual diffusion coefficients have probably already been seen in postelectrophoresis relaxation experiments...|$|R

By increasing doping rate, we have also shown {{that the effects of}} the nearest-neighbor <b>repulsions</b> are reduced and the system exhibits a quantum phase transition into the d-wave-like (or rung-singlet) superconducting state. We derive the effective fermion theory which describes the critical {{properties of the}} transition point with the gapless excitation of magnon.

5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli <b>repulsion</b> (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.

An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb {{force from}} the ambient {{electric}} field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to {{be attracted to}} the original electron, while a created electron experiences a <b>repulsion.</b> This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator. Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for {{the mass of the}} electron.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager.

Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod <b>repulsion</b> between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the Gulf of Antalya, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809). Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the Carolingian Empire, while in 803, the Pax Nicephori recognized the de facto independence of Byzantine Venice, which was further entrenched by the <b>repulsion</b> of a Byzantine attack in 809. At the same time, in Ifriqiya, the new Aghlabid dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by the}} Umayyad Caliphate to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea, {{the capital of the}} Opsician Theme. Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire's capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the Caliphate had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 727, the Arab army, led by one of the Caliph's sons, penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea. Despite constant attacks for 40 days, the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the Caliphate. The successful <b>repulsion</b> of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy. The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids, as new threats and defeats on their far-flung frontiers diverted Umayyad strength elsewhere, while Byzantine power gradually recovered.|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric <b>repulsion</b> from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} the generalization of usual lattice model of multicomponent systems. The generalization {{is related to}} account the following factors: 1.

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{electric}} field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or <b>repulsion.</b> Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E
5|$|The <b>repulsion</b> of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea was an {{important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E
5|$|If the Venetians were idle, the Ottomans were not: {{with the}} signing of the Peace of Vasvár in 1664, they were able to focus their {{strength}} against Crete. Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed initiated large preparations in the winter of 1665/66, and dispatched 9,000 men to bolster the Ottoman forces in Crete. An Ottoman peace proposal, which would have allowed Venice to keep Candia against an annual payment of tribute was rejected, and in May 1666, the Ottoman army, under the personal leadership of the Grand Vizier, departed from Thrace for southern Greece, whence it would embark for Crete during the winter. In February 1667, the Venetians received significant reinforcements from France and Savoy, totaling 21 warships and some 6,000 men, but, as in past years, disagreements among the leaders of the various contingents over precedence (France, the Papal States, Malta, Naples, Sicily contributed ships and men) hampered operations. Francesco Morosini, now again Captain General, sought to engage the Ottomans, but they avoided battle, and using their superior resources and bases, they steadily kept their forces on Crete supplied.

40|$|AbstractTo {{precisely}} {{quantify the}} fundamental interactions between heterogeneous lipid membranes with coexisting liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains, we performed detailed osmotic stress small-angle x-ray scattering experiments by exploiting the domain alignment in raft-mimicking lipid multibilayers. Performing a Monte Carlo-based analysis {{allowed us to}} determine with high reliability the magnitude and functional dependence of interdomain forces concurrently with the bending elasticity moduli. In contrast to previous methodologies, this approach enabled us to consider the entropic undulation <b>repulsions</b> on a fundamental level, without having to take recourse to crudely justified mean-field-like additivity assumptions. Our detailed Hamaker-coefficient calculations indicated only small differences in the van der Waals attractions of coexisting Lo and Ld phases. In contrast, the repulsive hydration and undulation interactions differed significantly, with the latter dominating the overall <b>repulsions</b> in the Ld phase. Thus, alignment of like domains in multibilayers appears to originate from both, hydration and undulation <b>repulsions...</b>|$|R

Though the adsorption is usually very strong and irreversible when partial wetting conditions are fulfilled, electrostatic <b>repulsions</b> between charged solid particles act against the adsorption. The regime of weak adsorption was reached using charged silica nanoparticles at high pH and low ionic strength. O/w Pickering emulsions of the diisopropyl adipate oil were stabilized by colloidal nanoparticles of Ludox® AS 40 consisting of non-aggregated particles of bare silica (hydrophilic).
