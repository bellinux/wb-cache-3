25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and {{they are designed to}} produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer <b>rated</b> <b>life.</b> In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled {{compact fluorescent}} lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{adoption}} of a shareholder risk-reward mechanism by the California PUC for the investor owned utilities (IOUs) has left possible shareholder earnings or penalties highly dependent on inputs to the resource net benefit calculations, including savings, costs, and measure life estimates. This is especially true as the California IOU portfolios are heavily reliant on certain compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) measures. This paper focuses on how one critical cost-effectiveness input can affect the overall cost-effectiveness of a CFL program. A few years ago, the California DEER adopted a measure life estimation approach for screw-in CFL measures {{that is based on}} two parameters: manufacturer <b>rated</b> <b>life</b> and hours of operation. The lighting industry rates lamp life using a three hours “on ” and twenty minutes “off ” cycle. Consequently, the DEER rated life-based methodology is different from prior years’ retention data-based measure life estimates typically known as the effective useful life (EUL) 1. The DEER rated life-based estimate provides only a proxy EUL for CFLs, and does not account for other factors that can affect the measure life including “burn time ” (the length of on time per on/off cycle), lamp base orientation, placement in an open or closed fixture, use with timers, dimmers, and motion sensors, early removal, or burnout. This paper critiques the DEER rated life-based methodologies and shows that the length of on time per on/off cycle leads to a different “observed ” life expectancy for CFLs than the manufacturers ’ <b>rated</b> <b>life...</b>|$|E
