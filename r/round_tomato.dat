40|$|Greenhouse {{climate models}} are a {{powerful}} tool which allows the simulation of inside environmental conditions {{as a function of}} external conditions, construction and environmental control equipments characteristics. They also permit to evaluate the energy consumption necessary to obtain the predefined conditions. A theoretical study of the greenhouse energy requirements for all year <b>round</b> <b>tomato</b> production in Portugal and Spain is presented. A Greenhouse Climate Simulator (GCS) was used to analyse the energetic behaviour in different regions. GCS uses mensal mean weather data of several years of solar radiation, temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. A climate generator computes the mean hourly climatic data of a typical day for each month and location. As inputs GCS requires data related with the greenhouse characteristics, environmental control equipment and the crop. For the energy balance a static complex model is used which is based on the physics of heat and mass transfer. The results show the energy consumption due to the heating system in each of the studied locations, as well the heat dissipated by the cooling system along a characteristic year, for year round production in plastic greenhouses. This is used to estimate energy consumption indicators which allow generating predictive maps. It is an interesting tool which may contribute to the grower’s decision making and to the reduction of energy consumption, helping to lower production costs and environmental impacts...|$|E

Frequent organic amendments resulted in higher soil contents in the organic system without straw than in the other soil-bound systems, indicating that the organic systems were not yet stable in terms of nutrient availability after three years. A fruit quality index, based on the contents of compounds such as lycopene, ß-carotene and vitamin C, was similar in all cropping systems. The old cultivar had a significantly higher quality index, but a lower yield than the other cultivars. According to this study, high quality tomatoes can be obtained through proper adjustment of the quantity and the source of nitrogen fertilizers in organic and conventional cropping systems and the use of selected cultivars with a high nutrient use efficiency for organic systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{dependency}} on fossil fuels, the Dutch horticultural sector puts a lot of effort in the reduction of energy demand. By using multiple thermal screens, a modest temperature regime and allowing high humidities, the energy consumption of a greenhouse can be reduced substantially, but for additional savings, a considerable increase of the insulation is needed. In an earlier study (Hemming et al., 2009), we showed that newly developed coverings using anti-reflective coatings to increase light transmission and low-emission coatings to reduce energy losses resulted in minor light losses inside the greenhouse, which paves the way for double glazing with these materials. Such highly-insulating glass was integrated in a total greenhouse concept resulting in a 500 m 2 research facility, realised in summer 2010 at the research station of Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture in Bleiswijk. Besides increasing insulation value, the design of this facility also paid special attention to dehumidification. In general, three possible dehumidification systems can be used: a balanced ventilation system with heat recovery; condensation on a cold surface; and a hygroscopic fluid. The disadvantage of a balanced ventilation system is the loss of sensible heat during its operation. In the case where the greenhouse is dehumidified by internal moisture withdrawal, the loss of sensible heat via ventilation can be prevented. Condensation of moisture on an internal surface gathers latent heat associated with the excess moisture. Thus, internal condensation of excess humidity by means of a heat pump refrigeration cycle reduces the sensible heat loss of the greenhouse and regenerates (part of) the heat demand associated with the crop evaporation. For this facility, we decided on using a balanced system. Since the completion of the greenhouse, two years of year <b>round</b> <b>tomato</b> production resulted in energy savings of up to 60 % even with a higher rate of production, as compared with the practice in commercial greenhouses. The greenhouse showed a natural gas consumption of 460 MJ¿m- 2 and 6 kWh¿m- 2 for the balanced ventilation system compared with natural gas consumption of over 1100 MJ¿m- 2 in common practice...|$|E

Literature points to imported tomatoes as the cause of lower prices in the United States market (ERS-USDA 2016). This thesis analyzes the effects of fresh tomato volumes both imported from Mexico and shipped from Florida on their shipping point prices and on terminal market prices in the United States. It also investigates the influence of the tomato suspension agreement on shipping point prices and on fresh tomato volumes in the United States, and to what extent temperature and precipitation have an impact on fresh tomatoes volumes. This analysis utilizes historical information of 18 years (1998 – 2015) of tomato volumes in the United States market, prices free on board (F. O. B.) for point of origin sales, prices of wholesale market sales at three main terminal markets, gas prices, weather patterns in the main tomato growing regions of Florida and Mexico, and the Tomato Suspension Agreement floor prices for Mexican tomatoes. The findings of this research show that the volume of Mexican tomatoes have no effect on shipping point prices of <b>round</b> <b>tomatoes</b> from Florida, and even more, neither affect the terminal market prices of <b>round</b> <b>tomatoes</b> from Florida at its main markets (New York and Chicago terminal markets).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{increase}} the understanding of chlorophyll breakdown and lycopene synthesis at a quantitative level in Solanum lycopersicum fruit. To accomplish this, a kinetic model is proposed describing the transition from chloro- to chromoplast. Remittance VIS spectroscopy was used to assess chlorophyll and lycopene levels non-destructively in cocktail and <b>round</b> type <b>tomatoes.</b> Tomatoes were stored at constant temperatures between 4 and 24 °C, or at a stepwise changing temperature between 4 and 16 °C. Chlorophyll and lycopene levels were measured repeatedly over time and used to calibrate a kinetic model that describes how an autocatalytic enzyme system links chlorophyll breakdown to lycopene synthesis, including breakdown of lycopene precursor and lycopene itself. Increasing storage temperatures increased the reaction constant for lycopene synthesis more than that of chlorophyll breakdown for both tomato types. The reaction constants describing chlorophyll breakdown and lycopene synthesis were considerably larger, and the estimated enzyme levels lower for the round type. This allows <b>round</b> <b>tomatoes</b> to quickly resume lycopene synthesis after a cold storage period when enzyme levels are low. Lycopene breakdown was established for the round type while the cocktail type showed lycopene precursor breakdown. Chlorophyll breakdown and lycopene synthesis, as affected by storage temperature and tomato type, is covered well by the model for both tomato types. We hypothesise that the postulated enzyme system, responsible for the direct link between chlorophyll breakdown and lycopene synthesis, is due to STAY-GREEN proteins. Remittance VIS spectroscopy is, in combination with a parameter estimation tool, suited to screen tomato genotypes for intended colour transformation performance, or as tool in chloroplast to chromoplast transition studies...|$|R

Sustainability {{is one of}} {{the major}} aims in greenhouse horticulture. According to agreements between the Dutch grower association and the government, energy consumption and the use of chemical biocides have to be reduced. More advanced greenhouse technique is being developed to reach the target to decrease the energy efficiency-index by 65 % between 1980 and 2010. However, this could also be achieved with existing technology by using more advanced climate regimes. The present thesis aimed at that, through designing and analysing climate regimes while employing existing climate control possibilities. Theoretical temperature and humidity regimes were designed to decrease energy consumption and a photosynthesis maximisation procedure was implemented to maximise growth. The basis for a crop gross photosynthesis model for control purposes was created. Crop photosynthesis models were evaluated at conditions expected to occur with more sustainable climate regimes. It was shown with experimental evidence that theoretical assumptions on the temperature - CO 2 effects in a crop that are based on theoretically models scaling up leaf photosynthesis to the crop level are valid and that simplified existing models could be applied up to 28 ° C. With higher temperatures new designs are needed and this can probably be achieved with an improved stomata-resistance model. The well known temperature integration principle was modified with two nested time-frames (24 -hour and six days) and a temperature dose-response function. In a year <b>round</b> <b>tomato</b> cultivation, energy consumption was predicted to decrease with up to 9 % compared to regular temperature integration. The potential for energy saving with temperature integration is limited by humidity control when as usual fixed set points are maintained, because it counteracts temperature integration. Vents open at lower temperatures and heating is switched on at higher temperatures than required for optimal effects of temperature integration. A new approach to control relative humidity on the underlying processes (crop growth and development, plant water stress, calcium deficiencies and the major fungal diseases) by controlling relative humidity through maximum leaf wetness duration, minimum transpiration and transpiration integral was designed for cut chrysanthemum. This idea is based on earlier formulations to use set points for transpiration. In the current approach, general rules were formulated. From that, a control regime was designed. Simulations showed that with this humidity regime, yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18 % (compared to a fixed setpoint of 80 % relative humidity). When the two climate control principles, modified temperature integration and process based humidity control, were merged, annual energy consumption was predicted to decrease by more than 33 % and cut chrysanthemum plant dry weight increased with 39 % in experiments compared to a normal climate regime. Cut chrysanthemum was used as a central crop. Here, short compact stems {{is one of the}} main quality aspects. This is commonly controlled with chemical growth retardants. An alternative is to control temperature according to the DIF concept (difference between average day and average night temperature). A negative DIF value decreases stem elongation. Therefore, temperature integration without DIF restriction was extensively compared to temperature integration with DIF restriction. Energy consumption with different settings was quantified. It was shown that an optimisation problem existed in spring and summer. For that purpose, a joined temperature integration and DIF regime over several days was designed and tested. The use of an average DIF over several days rather than a DIF within 24 -hours was proposed. In times and climate regions when cold and warm days interchange, this approach can increase energy saving and decrease final plant stem length simultaneously. This however, was a compromise. An optimisation problem between the two regimes aiming at sustainable greenhouse horticulture remained (less energy consumption versus reduction in application of biocides). This can only be solved when detailed models for crop quality, development and growth will become available. The regimes could be applied in commercial greenhouses with only little adjustment. The only additional expense is a computer functioning as set point generator, and a suitable interface with the existing climate computer. In addition, the achieved degrees of freedom for two main states (temperature and humidity) form a promising perspective for future optimal greenhouse climate control. The regimes, however, were based on many arbitrary assumptions. More research is needed for parameterisation...|$|E
