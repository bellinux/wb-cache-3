40|$|Abstract—For {{cognitive}} radio (CR) networks with user hierar-chy, the sensing strategy with “listen-before-talk " (LBT) policy {{plays a key}} role in <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization</b> and primary user (PU) protection. However, existing sensing strategies do not handle satisfactorily the randomness of both user locations and channel conditions in the network environment, resulting in inefficient <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization.</b> To cope with such randomness, this paper develops three dynamic sensing strategies that can adaptively schedule the sensing slots/cycles according to the online link conditions without assuming knowledge of the PU traffic model. The proposed strategies can improve the efficiency of <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization</b> while being robust with respect to the uncertainty in the PU traffic pattern. To maximize <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilization,</b> the proposed strategies are formulated through closed-form expressions. Efficient methods are introduced to compute the optimal values of the parameters used in the strategies, such as sensing time and sensing threshold.
