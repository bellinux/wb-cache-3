40|$|ABSTRACT The {{steady state}} {{operation}} with high energy content foreseen for future generation of fusion devices will necessarily demand dedicated <b>real-time</b> <b>tools</b> and mechanisms for data handling and machine control. Consequently, the real-time systems for those devices should be carefully selected and their capabilities previously established. The Joint European Torus (JET) is undertaking an enhancement program, which includes tests of relevant <b>real-time</b> <b>tools</b> for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a key experiment for future fusion devices. In these enhancements is included a new Data AcQuisition (DAQ) system, with real-time processing capabilities, for the JET hard X-ray and gamma-ray profile monitor. The DAQ system is composed by dedicated digitizer modules with embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. The interface between the DAQ system, the JET Control and Data Acquisition System (CODAS) and the JET Real-Time Data Network (RTDN) {{is provided by the}} Multithreaded Application Real- Time executor (MARTe). This paper describes the real-time algorithms, developed for both digitizers’ FPGAs and MARTe application, capable of meeting the DAQ real-time requirements. The new DAQ system, including the embedded real-time features, was commissioned during the 2012 experiments. Results achieved with these real-time algorithms during experiments are presented...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAdvanced sensor and {{information}} technologies have made <b>real-time</b> <b>tool</b> data readily accessible to tool and process engineers. A {{significant number of}} tool parameters (SVID’s) is collected during wafer processing and {{a large amount of}} tool data is acquired and available for fault detection and classification (FDC). Many IC makers have substantially improved the process capabilities by implementing FDC. With the <b>real-time</b> <b>tool</b> data, one can also evaluate the overall tool condition so that tool maintenance can be more effectively scheduled and the post-maintenance tool condition can be more easily qualified. However, due to the frequent change of recipes and the diversity of operations, the overall tool health is very difficult to evaluate. In this paper, we propose a recipe-independent health indicator based on the generalized moving variance. It is shown that the indicator faithfully reveals the tool condition regardless of recipe/operation changes. With the tool health indicator, possible tool faults can be identified and proper maintenance measures can be scheduled accordingly. The proposed indicator will be demonstrated and validated through the case studies of a PECVD and a PVD tool from a local fab...|$|R

Methods: Sixty-two individuals were recruited, 48 individuals with IBD (24 with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively) and 14 controls. The disease activity was recorded, and urine samples were collected. The headspace (the air above the sample) was analyzed using the electronic nose and FAIMS instruments. Results: Electronic nose data analysis was conducted through (1) Principal Component Analysis (data were analyzed together without previous categorization); and (2) Discriminant Function Analysis (samples were precategorized [clinical groups]).
