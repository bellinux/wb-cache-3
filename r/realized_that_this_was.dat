5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years after}} {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival. Murray offered Hillenburg {{a job as}} a director of the series. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not considered creating his own series, but soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> his chance. Shortly after production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E

The captain of the fort, Lourenço Ferreira, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> just a diversionary attack and without committing additional troops he ordered the units defending that area to assist each other. As the amphibious attack was in progress, the Dutch vanguard and center mounted the main attack marking {{the beginning of the}} battle at the ramparts.|$|E

25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded {{only a few feet}} away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a place that he could make an opposed crossing.|$|E
25|$|Already in Autumn 1948, {{criticism}} {{came out}} in a joint statement by AB Atomenergi and Atom Commission. The FOA reports predicted a military monopoly over Swedish uranium resources to the detriment of civilian research, and that much larger resources were being assigned to plutonium production. The feasibility of the plutonium project was under question. That was the first sign of antagonism of interests between military and civilian nuclear proponents. The plans had been predicated on the idea that each nuclear device required 50kg rather than 6kg of plutonium. None of those involved in the project <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was,</b> in fact, an overestimation. Although the program was scaled to produce 5-10 weapons per year, given the estimated production of 1kg of Pu-239 per day, it was actually scaled to produce sixty.|$|E

25|$|The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) {{describe}} a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs {{for eight days}} before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter {{and thought it was}} punishment for his sin. He was afraid that the world was returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.|$|E
25|$|In 23 BC, Augustus (as Octavian {{now called}} himself) again {{attempted}} {{to reform the}} constitution, {{although it is not}} known why he chose to reform the constitution at this point. Four years had passed since his last reforms, and this may have given him the opportunity to discover the weaknesses in those reforms. In addition, he almost died in 23 BC, and thus he may have thought that his time left was short. To Augustus, one major weakness in his constitution was his status as Consul. While it is true that his prestige minimized the risk of obstruction {{at the hands of a}} co-Consul, this risk still existed. It was also unusual (and unprecedented) for an individual to be elected to the Consulship nine times in a row, as Augustus had been. In addition, tradition did subject the Consulship to certain restrictions, such as the traditional etiquette shown by the two Consuls towards each other. While Augustus did consider the possibility to making himself sole Consul, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> too radical of a departure from tradition. Therefore, as a 'concession', he gave up his Consulship, and modified both his Proconsular imperium and his Tribunician powers. It is not known exactly how Augustus modified his Proconsular imperium, but it is known that he was allowed to retain this imperium in the city of Rome. Normally, any magistrate had to surrender their imperium while they were inside the city. In addition, his Proconsular imperium was formally modified to give him both a status and an authority above even a Consul.|$|E

Goldstein witnessed his father openly using cocaine and marijuana throughout his childhood. Goldstein said he began overeating {{as a way of}} dealing with anger and depression, becoming obese by the age of 10. He also began experimenting with alcohol when he was 11.|$|E

Their script originally featured a heart-to-heart between Daisy Johnson and Phil Coulson, but executive producer Jed Whedon suggested that it instead be between Johnson and Melinda May, a change that Nora said [...] "made the episode sing". Lilla said this change allowed the scene to give insight on how important Coulson is for May.|$|E
500|$|The quantum Hall {{effect was}} {{discovered}} by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant [...](see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as system size and impurities. [...] In 1981, theorist Robert Laughlin proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau. [...] It also implied that the Hall conductance can be characterized {{in terms of a}} topological invariable called Chern number. Shortly after, in 1982, Horst Störmer and Daniel Tsui observed the fractional quantum Hall effect where the conductance was now a rational multiple of a constant. Laughlin, in 1983, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a consequence of quasiparticle interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational method solution, named the Laughlin wavefunction. The study of topological properties of the fractional Hall effect remains an active field of research.|$|E

500|$|... "Murder" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniels. Daniels particularly enjoyed directing both the cold open, {{as well as the}} closing tag, likening both to [...] "an action film". In regards to the latter, he referred to it as a sequence that director Quentin Tarantino would have thought up, and noted the importance of having the camera appear {{in the middle of the}} Mexican standoff to reveal Fischer. Wilson, Helms, and Carell enjoyed filming the scene, and were particularly exuberant when it came time to fake-kill each other. Several of the scenes, such as when Andy first asks Erin on a date, had to be re-shot so that the cameras were in more discreet places. Daniels later referred to these shots as [...] "spy shots". Initially, after Michael announces that [...] "there has been a murder", the show was supposed to have cut to a commercial break. However, the producers <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> too misleading, as it would have implied that a real homicide had taken place.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the crew}} of The X-Files were given the green-light to film on location in Las Vegas. This would make Las Vegas {{only one of the}} few cities to effectively [...] "play itself" [...] in the series. However, only two days were scheduled for Las Vegas, and most of the scenes were filmed in California at the Century Plaza and Park Hyatt, two hotels relatively close to the Fox studio. Furthermore, Gillian Anderson never had to leave Los Angeles to film the episode. Location manager Ilt Jones noted that The X-Files crew's desire to film on location at various hotels in Las Vegas caused a bidding war, [...] "We went down this list of forty or fifty hotels known to be film-friendly. [...] At first, the reaction was sort of lukewarm, {{then all of a sudden}} someone <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> The X-Files, for heavens sake, seen by I-can't-tell-you-how-many millions [...] then this huge bidding war broke out". Eventually, Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was selected for shooting. In exchange for a special billing denoting [...] "Production Assistance Provided by" [...] and several shots of the hotel's name appearing in the episode, The X-Files crew received fee-free permission to film anywhere in the hotel during day hours, as well as full access to the hotel's illuminated message board.|$|E
500|$|At 8 am, the outpost {{was set up}} by the Hessians at a cooper shop on Pennington Road {{about one}} mile north-west of Trenton. [...] Washington led the assault, riding in front of his soldiers. As the Hessian {{commander}} of the outpost, Lieutenant Andreas Wiederholdt, left the shop, an American fired at him but missed. [...] Wiederholdt shouted, [...] "Der Feind!" [...] (The Enemy!) and other Hessians came out. The Americans fired three volleys and the Hessians returned one of their own. [...] Washington ordered Edward Hand's Pennsylvania Riflemen and a battalion of German-speaking infantry to block the road that led to Princeton. [...] They attacked the Hessian outpost there. Wiederholdt soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> more than a raiding party; seeing other Hessians retreating from the outpost, he led his men to do the same. [...] Both Hessian detachments made organized retreats, firing as they fell back. [...] On the high ground {{at the north end of}} Trenton, they were joined by a duty company from the Lossberg Regiment. [...] They engaged the Americans, retreating slowly, keeping up continuous fire and using houses for cover. [...] Once in Trenton, they gained covering fire from other Hessian guard companies on the outskirts of the town. Another guard company nearer to the Delaware River rushed east to their aid, leaving open the River Road into Trenton. [...] Washington ordered the escape route to Princeton be cut off, sending infantry in battle formation to block it, while artillery formed at the head of King and Queen streets.|$|E
