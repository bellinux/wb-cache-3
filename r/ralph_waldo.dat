5|$|<b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Christie (30 August 1893 – 19 December 1987) was an admiral in the United States Navy {{who played}} a pivotal role in the {{development}} of torpedo technologies. During World War II, he commanded submarine operations out of the Australian ports of Brisbane and Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow often {{wrote in}} his first-floor study, {{formerly}} Washington's office, surrounded by portraits of his friends, including charcoal portraits by Eastman Johnson of Charles Sumner, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Cornelius Conway Felton. Longfellow would write either at the center table, at the desk, or in the armchair by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Although Massachusetts was {{the first}} slave-holding colony {{dating back to the}} early 1600s, in the years leading up to the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of progressivist and {{abolitionist}} activity. Horace Mann made the state's school system a national model. Henry David Thoreau and <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson made major contributions to American philosophy. Members of the transcendentalist movement emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, The Strand {{became a}} newly fashionable address and many avant-garde writers and thinkers {{gathered}} here, among them Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson and the scientist Thomas Henry Huxley. No.142 {{was the home}} of radical publisher and physician John Chapman, who published contemporary authors from this house during the 1850s and edited the journal Westminster Review from 1851. George Eliot lived at No.142 between 1851 and 1855. Virginia Woolf regularly travelled along the Strand, and a King's College building named after her is in nearby Kingsway.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{an early}} center of the Transcendentalist movement, which {{emphasized}} intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature. <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, {{who was born in}} Boston but spent much of his later life in Concord, largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work Nature, and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, Henry David Thoreau, who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby Walden Pond in the 1854 work Walden; or, Life in the Woods.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} {{similarities}} between this album {{and those of}} musicians and composers in several musical genres—from pop to contemporary classical, even show tunes and jazz-based time signatures. The lyrics and their rich thematic elements have been noted for their literary quality, earning comparisons to <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Carlos Williams, and Walt Whitman. Genre labels that have been applied to the album include indie folk, indie pop, baroque pop, indie rock, folk rock, , chamber folk, and lo-fi.|$|E
5|$|The first Hindu {{teacher to}} {{actively}} advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s. The reception which Swami Vivekananda received {{built on the}} active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England Transcendentalists, among them <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson (1803–1882), who drew on German Romanticism and the interest of philosophers and scholars like G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), Max Mueller (1823–1900), Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), and others who had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.|$|E
5|$|The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, {{established}} {{the first major}} American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders {{in the development of}} pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Augustus Willson {{was born}} on October 13, 1846 in Maysville, Kentucky, the second child of Hiram and Ann Colvin (née Ennis) Willson. A year {{following}} his birth, his father moved the family to Covington. In 1852, the family moved again, this time to New Albany, Indiana. In 1856, Willson's mother died. Three years later, his father also died, leaving him an orphan at age twelve. He and his younger sister {{went to live with}} their grandmother in Allegany County, New York. Willson then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to live with his brother Forceythe, a poet of some renown. There, he was exposed to men of letters such as <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell.|$|E
5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|In 1860, Edward {{undertook}} {{the first}} tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His genial good humour and confident bonhomie made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, {{and laid the}} cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, {{for the first time}} since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's in New York as well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{was elected}} the poet {{of the class}} of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an {{original}} poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838. He was suspended, however, and not allowed to participate. Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates. He had composed the poem in Concord, where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost because of his neglect of his studies. During his stay in Concord, he became friends with <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson and got to know the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day; abolitionists, Thomas Carlyle, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists were treated.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|Riley made {{occasional}} reading tours around Indiana, and in August 1880 {{was invited}} to perform at Asbury University. His performance there so impressed the local Phi Kappa Psi chapter, he {{was invited to}} join as an honorary member. Through the fraternity he met Robert Jones Burdette, a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area. Burdette {{was a member of the}} Redpath Lyceum Bureau of Boston, a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson. Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch. Riley's accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881, and he decided rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds. His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season, beginning in April 1881. He succeeded, drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{urbanization}} and industrialization in Europe and North America {{resulted in}} an opposing aesthetic transcendentalist movement characterized in New England by the art of Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, and other Hudson River School painters, the work of landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted, and the writings of philosophers such as Henry David Thoreau and <b>Ralph</b> <b>Waldo</b> Emerson. As was true of other scenic areas of New England, the philosophical, artistic, and environmental movement of transcendentalism transformed the Metacomet Ridge from a commercial resource to a recreational resource. Hotels, parks, and summer estates were built on the mountains from the mid-1880s to the early 20th century. Notable structures included summit hotels and inns on Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Mount Nonotuck. Parks and park structures such as Poet's Seat in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Hubbard Park (designed {{with the help of}} Frederick Law Olmsted) of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, Connecticut, were intended as respites from the urban areas they closely abutted. Estates such as Hill-Stead and Heublein Tower were built as mountain home retreats by local industrialists and commercial investors. Although public attention gradually shifted to more remote and less developed destinations with the advent of modern transportation and the westward expansion of the United States, the physical, cultural, and historic legacy of that early recreational interest in the Metacomet Ridge still supports modern conservation efforts. Estates became museums; old hotels and the lands they occupied, frequently subject to damaging fires, became state and municipal parkland through philanthropic donation, purchase, or confiscation for unpaid taxes. Nostalgia among former guests of hotels and estates contributed to the aesthetic of conservation.|$|E
