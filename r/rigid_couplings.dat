5000|$|Clamped or {{compression}} <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> come in {{two parts}} and fit together around the shafts to form a sleeve. They offer more flexibility than sleeved models, {{and can be used}} on shafts that are fixed in place. They generally are large enough so that screws can pass {{all the way through the}} coupling and into the second half to ensure a secure hold.Flanged <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> are designed for heavy loads or industrial equipment. They consist of short sleeves surrounded by a perpendicular flange. One coupling is placed on each shaft so the two flanges line up face to face. A series of screws or bolts can then be installed in the flanges to hold them together. Because of their size and durability, flanged units can be used to bring shafts into alignment before they are joined together.Rigid couplings are used when precise shaft alignment is required; shaft misalignment will affect the coupling's performance as well as its life.

40|$|In {{the search}} for {{producing}} a low ecological footprint, a lightweight and high-performing technology, bending-active approach has been proposed to be appropriate for kinetic and transformable structures. While traditional deployable structures base their transformability on their hinges topology, pliable structures {{are based on the}} elastic deformation of elements. This paper will focus on the feasibility and serviceability of timber pliable bending-active structures by presenting two systems based on <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> of coplanar flat planks. We discuss then their potential in simplifying manufacturing and assembling processes of kinetic systems by the enhancement of the elastic properties of the material, and efficient yet simple fabrication. This paper will present a topological classification of a variety of pliable structures based on <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings.</b> Furthermore it will discuss the implementation in architectural scale of one of the derived systems in a deployable fast-erected pavilion.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that softly broken theory is {{equivalent}} to a rigid theory in external spurion superfield. The singular part of effective action in a broken theory follows from a rigid one by a simple redefinition of the couplings. This gives an explicit relation between the soft and <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> renormalizations. As an illustration the renormalization group functions in the MSSM have been calculated. The method opens a possibility to construct a totally all loop finite N= 1 SUSY gauge theory, including the soft SUSY breaking terms. Explicit relations between the soft terms, which lead to a completely finite theory in any loop order, are given.

40|$|Coupling {{dynamics}} {{can produce}} either adverse or beneficial stability and controllability, {{depending on the}} characteristics of the aircraft. This report presents archival anecdotes and analyses of coupling problems experienced by the X-series, Century series, and Space Shuttle aircraft. The three catastrophic sequential coupling modes of the X- 2 airplane and the two simultaneous unstable modes of the X- 15 and Space Shuttle aircraft are discussed. In addition, the most complex of the coupling interactions, inertia roll coupling, is discussed for the X- 2, X- 3, F- 100 A, and YF- 102 aircraft. The mechanics of gyroscopics, centrifugal effect, and resonance in coupling dynamics are described. The coupling modes discussed are interacting multiple degrees of freedom of inertial and aerodynamic forces and moments. The aircraft are assumed to be <b>rigid</b> bodies. Structural <b>couplings</b> are not addressed. Various solutions for coupling instabilities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The LISA Technology Package (LTP) uses laser {{interferometry}} {{to measure the}} changes in relative displacement between two inertial test masses. The goals of the mission require a displacement measuring precision of 10 pm Hz− 1 / 2 at frequencies in the 3 – 30 mHz band. We report on progress with a prototype LTP interferometer optical bench in which fused silica mirrors and beamsplitters are fixed to a ZERODUR R © substrate using hydroxide catalysis bonding to form a <b>rigid</b> interferometer. The <b>couplings</b> to displacement noise of this interferometer of two expected noise sources—laser frequency noise and ambient temperature fluctuations—have been investigated, and an additional, unexpected, noise source has been identified. The additional noise is due to small amounts of signal at the heterodyne frequency arriving at the photodiode preamplifiers with a phase that quasistatically changes {{with respect to the}} optical signal. The phase shift is caused by differential changes in the external optical paths the beams travel before they reach the rigid interferometer. Two different external path length stabilization systems have been demonstrated and these allowed the performance of the overall system to meet the LTP displacement noise requirement.

40|$|AbstractShaft Mis{{alignment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of wind turbine drive train when <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> connect the shafts. Ideal alignment of the shaft is difficult to be obtained and the couplings attached to the shaft may present angular or parallel misalignment defined also as lateral and axially misalignment. Despite misalignment is often observed in the practice, there are relatively few studies on wind turbine shaft misalignment in the literature and their results are sometimes conflicting. The aim of this research is to use laser based metrology techniques to capture the positional changes of wind turbines in service and aligning drivelines in wind turbine. By using sets of lasers on a shaft alignment rig, and then determining the average and periodic amplitude from an ensemble averaged signal, the degree of misalignment can be found and the necessary corrective action found...|$|E
40|$|Misalignment {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sources of trouble of {{rotating}} machinery when <b>rigid</b> <b>couplings</b> connect the shafts. Ideal alignment of the shafts is difficult to be obtained and rotors may present angular and/or parallel misalignment (defined also as radial misalignment or offset). During a complete shaft revolution, a periodical change of the bearings load occurs in hyperstatic shaft-lines, if coupling misalignment between the shafts is excessive. If the rotating machine is equipped with fluid-film journal bearings, the change of the loads on the bearing causes also the variation of their instantaneous dynamic characteristics, i. e. damping and stiffness, and the complete system cannot be considered any longer as linear. Despite misalignment is often observed in the practice, there are relatively few studies about this phenomenon in literature and their results are sometimes conflicting. The authors aim at modeling accurately this phenomenon, for the first time in this paper, and giving pertinent diagnostic information. The proposed method is suitable for every type of shaft-line supported by journal bearings. A finite element model is used for the hyperstatic shaft-line, while bearing characteristics are calculated by integrating Reynolds equation as a function of the instantaneous load acting on the bearings, caused also by the coupling misalignment. The results obtained by applying the proposed method are shown by means of the simulation, in the time domain, of the dynamical response of a hyperstatic shaft-line. Nonlinear effects are highlighted and the spectral components of the system response are analyzed, in order to give diagnostic information about the signature of this type of fault...|$|E
40|$|Single-domain {{allostery}} {{has been}} postulated to occur through intramolecular pathways of signaling within a protein structure. We had previously investigated these pathways by introducing a local thermal perturbation and analyzed the anisotropic propagation of structural changes throughout the protein. Here, we develop an improved approach, the Rotamerically Induced Perturbation (RIP), that identifies strong couplings between residues {{by analyzing the}} pathways of heat-flow resulting from thermal excitation of rotameric rotations at individual residues. To explore {{the nature of these}} couplings, we calculate the complete coupling maps of 5 different PDZ domains. Although the PDZ domain is a well conserved structural fold that serves as a scaffold in many protein–protein complexes, different PDZ domains display unique patterns of conformational flexibility in response to ligand binding: some show a significant shift in a set of α-helices, while others do not. Analysis of the coupling maps suggests a simple relationship between the computed couplings and observed conformational flexibility. In domains where the α-helices are <b>rigid,</b> we find <b>couplings</b> of the α-helices to the body of the protein, whereas in domains having ligand-responsive α-helices, no couplings are found. This leads to a model where the α-helices are intrinsically dynamic but can be damped if sidechains interact at key tertiary contacts. These tertiary contacts correlate to high covariation contacts as identified by the statistical coupling analysis method. As these dynamic modules are exploited by various allosteric mechanisms, these tertiary contacts have been conserved by evolution...|$|R
