500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people used to do that they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars coming <b>right</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> ... My thought was, 'What would happen if ... music [...] all artificial?’” ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came <b>right</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E

5000|$|Like a festering sore or a {{criminal}} rap sheet, the Lower Class Brats won't go away. Formed in Austin, Texas in 1995, the Brats hit the scene like a gob of Lone Star loogie {{and have been}} spitting like cobras ever since. Brazenly unapologetic and frightfully in-your-face, the band's knuckle-busting brand of safety-pinned street punk has launched a legacy of hostility. After scraping and stealing (or worse) to release a handful of broke-budget, seven-inch singles, the Brats finally issued their rabidly devoured 1997 debut album, [...] "Rather Be Hated Than Ignored." [...] A promise {{as much as a}} threat, [...] "Hated" [...] became a rallying cry for Austin's underground punk scene and served as marching orders for the germinating LCB Army. It also became an Oi! classic. Eighteen years and multiple albums later (to say nothing of the untold beers, drugs, fights and vomit) the Brats and their tattooed Army remain a growing worldwide disease. Tours across Mexico, Europe, North America, Canada, Japan and elsewhere left a wake of wreckage and won countless new LCB recruits who proudly wear the band's clockwork skull mascot on tattered jackets and deep in their skin. Today, to the great dismay of polite society, the Brats refuse to slow down or sober up. With new music always ticking like a bomb, the next explosion of chaos, riot and ruin is <b>right</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> next piss-stained <b>corner.</b> Consider yourself warned … and invited! -- Metal Dave Glessner http://2fast2die.com/ ...|$|R
