5|$|In Europe, {{the common}} {{blackbird}} can {{be confused with}} the paler-winged first-winter <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> (Turdus torquatus) or the superficially similar European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). A number of similar Turdus thrushes exist far outside the range of the common blackbird, for example the South American Chiguanco thrush (Turdus chiguanco). The Indian blackbird, the Tibetan blackbird, and the Chinese blackbird were formerly considered subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the flora, there are relatively rare birds such as peregrine falcons, <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> and ravens. Sixteen species of butterfly have been recorded in the area.|$|R
50|$|The site is chalk {{grassland}} {{on a steep}} slope, and {{the wide variety of}} flowers include what may be the largest population of pignut in the country. Birds include wheatears, stonechat, whinchat and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Migrating and {{wintering}} birds often form loose {{flocks of}} 10 to 200 or more birds, often feeding together with fieldfares, common blackbirds, and starlings, sometimes also with mistle thrushes, song thrushes, and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels.</b> Unlike the song thrush, the more nomadic redwing does not tend to return regularly {{to the same}} wintering areas.|$|R
5|$|Wales’ {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets, Manx shearwater, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and razorbills. In comparison, with 60% of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel.</b> Birds of prey include the merlin, hen harrier and the red kite, a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy, including seasonal visitors.|$|E
5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides {{in remote}} areas, {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel.</b> Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E
25|$|Blackheath's {{heathland}} habitat {{was well}} known to early botanists – in the 18th century Carl Linnaeus {{is reported to have}} fallen to his knees to thank God when he first saw the gorse growing there (but this disputed account is more often attributed to Putney Heath). This environment supported both the flora and fauna of wild grassland. In 1859, Greenwich Natural History Society recorded a wide list of animal species, including natterjack toads, hares, common lizards, bats, quail, <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> and nightingale. Today, bats are still found on Blackheath and migrating <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> may occasionally be seen in spring.|$|E
40|$|Ring Ouzels (Turdus torqiuatus) {{are known}} to have been in decline across Wales since at least the 1970 s (Gibbons et al 1993; Tyler and Green 1994, Lovegrove et al 1994). A {{national}} survey in 1999 aimed to set a baseline for future monitoring of breeding <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> across the UK, and a decline of 39 – 43 % was recorded in tetrads known to have been occupied during the 1988 - 91 breeding atla...|$|R
5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), buzzards (Buteo buteo) and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> (Turdus torquatus) have all bred in the {{immediate}} area. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effects of the provision of supplementary food on aspects of avian reproductive success, but far fewer have gone on to examine the potential positive effects of food supplementation on the demographic rates which are key for population growth rate. Testing for potential effects of food shortage on vital rates is likely to be particularly important in species of high conservation concern, where populations are particularly small, isolated or decreasing rapidly. Here we test the effects of the provision of supplementary food on reproductive success, body condition at fledging and post-fledging survival of <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> (Turdus torquatus), a species of high conservation concern in the UK. However, food supplementation had no detectable effect on any of these parameters. There {{was no significant difference in}} return rates of fed and unfed fledglings in the year following hatching, and most post-fledging mortality was apparently caused by predation by raptors and mustelids. We conclude that the supply of invertebrate food sources for nestlings was not a major limiting factor in our study area, at least during this two-year study. Further studies are required to quantify the precise mix of habitats used by <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels,</b> at the appropriate scale, which provide concealment from predators and access to food supplies throughout the spring and summer months...|$|R
25|$|Animals are {{represented}} by 115 species of birds, 42 mammals, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. There are also many invertebrates. Notable ice age relicts are Branchinecta paludosa fairy shrimp, the three-toed woodpecker, <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel,</b> spotted nutcracker, and others.|$|E
25|$|The wooded slopes are host {{to their}} own bird species, in {{particular}} the <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel,</b> the common raven, and the golden eagle. More generally, the forests have Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, parrot crossbills, red crossbills, common redstarts , bramblings and Siberian jays, which last bird is {{the symbol of the}} park.|$|E
25|$|Where bracken is {{dominant}} it excludes most specialist heathland/moorland {{bird species}} of conservation concern, {{although there are}} a few species that may benefit from a certain proportion of bracken. Deeper bracken stands provide a good food site for many resident or breeding birds, such as threatened ground-nesting species skylark, yellowhammer, curlew and lapwing. Some British birds such as the whinchat and the nightjar use bracken as their preferred habitats. The nightjar may lay its eggs on the bare ground under the bracken. The skylark often nests in bracken and uses it for cover. Small stands of bracken provide nesting, feeding and roosting habitat for a variety of smaller birds, including the willow warbler (which will also use bracken to construct its nest), the tree pipit, the yellowhammer, the <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel,</b> the woodcock and the twite.|$|E
25|$|The acid {{soils and}} peat bogs are {{unsuitable}} for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles {{and the common}} shrew are absent on the moors. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders {{that live in the}} heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the moors and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.|$|R
50|$|Ben Lawers is {{designated}} as a National Nature Reserve due to the abundance of rare alpine plants. It is regarded by botanists {{as one of the}} richest areas for alpine flora in the UK, due to the schist rocks of the mountain which are situated at the correct altitude for the plants. The rocks supply an adequate amount of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and iron to the plants and breaks down to a clayish soil which retains moisture. Some of the plants found on Lawers include Alpine Forget-me-not, roseroot, Net-leaved Willow and most of the Saxifrages. The mountain is also of interest to zoologists. Some of the bird species include ravens, <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels,</b> red grouse, ptarmigan, dippers and curlews. Other rare species include the Viviparous lizard and the Wildcat.|$|R
5000|$|Sandstones erode {{slowly and}} form poor acid soils which are {{deficient}} in nutrients. They are less permeable to water, impeding drainage and encouraging {{the formation of}} bogs. Sphagnum moss bogs are common where there is abundant rain and poor drainage. Cotton grass is a distinctive plant which grows in the boggy areas. In the cold acid waters of peat bogs there is little decomposition of organic material {{with the result that}} the dead sphagnum moss gradually accumulates to form peat. This raises the levels of the bogs and they dry out. Heather then invades the area. Large areas of the moors are now covered in heather, bilberries and grasses growing on thick layers of peat.The acid soils and peat bogs are unsuitable for earthworms so species which usually feed on earthworms such as moles and the common shrew are absent on the moors. The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders that live in the heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the moors and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.About 20 per cent of the national park is covered in bracken. Few things can grow under its dense cover and it does not support many insects and is unpalatable to most animals. The bracken is extremely invasive.|$|R
25|$|The Lake District {{is home to}} a {{range of}} bird species, and the RSPB {{maintain}} a reserve in Haweswater. England's only nesting pair of golden eagles {{can be found in the}} Lake District. The female golden eagle has not been seen since 2004 although the male still remains. Conservationists believe he is now the only resident golden eagle in England. Following recolonisation attempts, a pair of ospreys nested in the Lake District for the first time in over 150 years near Bassenthwaite Lake during 2001. Ospreys now frequently migrate north from Africa in the spring to nest in the Lake District, and a total of 23 chicks have fledged in The Lakes since 2001. Another bird species which has had recolonisation attempts is the red kite which, as of 2012, have a population of approximately 90 in the dense forest areas near Grizedale. Conservationists hope the reintroduction will create a large red kite population in the Lake District and in North West England where the red kite population is low. Other bird species resident to the Lake District include the buzzard, dipper, peregrine and raven. Seasonal birds include the <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> and the redstart.|$|E
500|$|It may not {{immediately}} be clear why the name [...] "blackbird", first recorded in 1486, {{was applied to}} this species, but not {{to one of the}} various other common black English birds, such as the carrion crow, raven, rook, or jackdaw. However, in Old English, and in modern English up to about the 18th century, [...] "bird" [...] was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called [...] "fowl". At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous [...] "black bird" [...] in the British Isles. Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was ouzel, ousel or wosel (from Old English osle, cf. German Amsel). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, where Bottom refers to [...] "The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill". The ouzel usage survived later in poetry, and still occurs as the name of the closely related <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> (Turdus torquatus), and in water ouzel, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus).|$|E

Rarely the adder, otter [...] and red squirrel are seen. Pine marten, previously rare, are no longer seen in the valley. The tarn shore supports a population of great crested grebe and the dark green fritillary butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Both {{heavy rain}} and {{excessive}} heat can potentially kill nestlings, so golden eagles often place their nests {{to suit the}} local climate. In northern areas, such as Alaska, sun exposure (southern orientation) may help nesting success, while those nesting in hot, lowland Utah and arid regions of Israel were mainly northerly facing to keep the nest out of the hot glare of the sun. Almost all established breeding golden eagles build more than one nest. A typical range of nests per pair is between 2 and 5. In Sweden, pairs on average built 2.4 of them. There is {{an average of about}} 4.5 nests per pair in Scotland. In Idaho, there was an average of 6 nests per pair. In more exceptional cases, up to 13 nests have built by a single pair in Scotland and up to 12 by a single pair in Idaho. Some pairs utilize alternate nest sites every year, others apparently rarely use alternate nests. Some golden eagle pairs may not use a nest for up to six years after its construction. Golden eagle nests usually consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. As is typical of a large accipitrid, the nests of golden eagles are very large. However, they are smaller on average than bald eagle nests. In Kazakhstan, golden eagle nests were similar in size to white-tailed eagle nests. In the Isle of Mull in Scotland, however, white-tailed eagle nests were slightly larger as they used thicker, larger sticks lined with grass that make a more massive nest than the isle's golden eagle nests, which used thinner sticks or heather and lined their nest with woodrush. In Arizona, golden eagle nests averaged 175.7 cm in length (ranging from 121.9 to 264.2 cm), 119.8 cm in width (range of 83.8 - 203.2 cm), and 65.0 cm in height (range of 12.7 - 200.7 cm). The sticks used in the Arizona nests ranged up to a length of 185.4 cm, a diameter of 5.3 cm and a weight of 980 g. Nests in Scotland average 133 cm in length, 106 cm in width and 79 cm in depth. In Washington state, tree nests averaged 90 cm in depth and 1.2 to 1.5 m in diameter. Nests in Sweden averaged 140 cm in length, 140 cm in width and 110 cm in depth. Nests in Kazakhstan averaged 148.3 cm in length, 115.7 cm in diameter and 48 cm in depth. The nest of the golden eagle may weigh well over 250 kg. As the eagles use a nest repeatedly, they repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. The largest known golden eagle nest, located on a steep river butte along Sun River in Montana, was 6.1 m deep and 2.59 m in width. Certain other animals—too small to be of interest to the huge raptor—sometimes use the nest as shelter or even as a nest for themselves, for the incidental protection offered. This has mainly been associated with Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) in Europe, though has also been recorded remarkably with <b>ring</b> <b>ouzels</b> (Turdus torquatus) and pine martens, both of which have been recorded as prey for golden eagles elsewhere in Europe. In a similar situation, little curlews in northeastern Siberia apparently gain some protection from predators by nesting close to golden eagle eyries. In each case, the natural predators of these animals are just the right size for golden eagle prey, and therefore avoid active eyries. Related species such as eastern imperial and Bonelli’s eagles have been observed to nest in abandoned golden eagle nests, as well as distantly related or unrelated raptors including white-tailed eagles, lammergeiers, gyrfalcons and peregrine falcons.|$|R
2500|$|The Park {{boasts a}} wealth of bird life, and is of ornithological {{importance}} because it supports a diverse range of birds. 141 bird species have been recorded in the park, including upland, woodland and wintering waterfowl species. Several species which are otherwise rare in Ireland are present, notably the woodland species redstart (1–2 pairs), wood warbler (1–2 pairs), and garden warbler (possibly up to 10 pairs). The red grouse and <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> are on the IUCN Red List of species of high conservation concern (1–2 pairs each). The Greenland white-fronted goose, merlin, and peregrine are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. Other noteworthy species found in the park are the chough, nightjar, and osprey. The osprey sometimes passes through the park as it migrates between northern Africa and Scandinavia. Historical accounts and place names suggest that the osprey bred {{in the area in}} the past. Golden eagles once nested in the park, but were extirpated around 1900 as a result of disturbance, nest robbing, and persecution.|$|E

60|$|The {{well-known}} {{fact that}} smaller flies are required on the moors {{than in the}} lowlands, is easily {{explained by the fact}} that poorer soils and swifter streams produce smaller insects. The large Phryganeae, or true caperers, whose caddis-baits love still pools and stagnant ditches, are there rare; and the office of water-scavenger is fulfilled by the Rhyacophiles (torrent-lovers) and Hydropsyches, whose tiny pebble-houses are fixed to the stones to resist the violence of the summer floods. In and out of them the tiny larva runs to find food, making in addition, in some species, galleries of earth along the surface of the stones, in which he takes his walks abroad in full security. In any of the brown rivulets of Windsor forest, towards the middle of summer, the pebble-houses of these little creatures may be seen in millions, studding every stone. To the Hydropsyches (species montana? or variegata? of Pictet) belongs that curious little Welsh fly, known in Snowdon by the name of the Gwynnant, whose tesselated wing is best imitated by brown mallard feather, and who so swarms in the lower lakes of Snowdon, that it is often necessary to use three of them on the line at once, all other flies being useless. It is perhaps the abundance of these tesselated Hydropsyches which makes the mallard wing the most useful in mountain districts, as the abundance of the fawn and grey Phryganidae in the south of England makes the woodcock wing justly the favourite. The Rhyacophiles, on the other hand, are mostly of a shining soot-grey, or almost black. These may be seen buzzing in hundreds over the pools on a wet evening, and with them the sooty Mystacides, called silverhorns in Scotland, from their antennae, which are of preposterous length, and ringed prettily enough with black and white. These delicate fairies make moveable cases, or rather pipes, of the finest sand, generally curved, and resembling in shape the Dentalium shell. Guarded by these, they hang in myriads on the smooth ledges of rock, where the water runs gently a few inches deep. These are abundant everywhere: but I never saw so many of them as in the exquisite Cother brook, near Middleham, in Yorkshire. In that delicious glen, while wading up beneath the ash-fringed crags of limestone, out of which the great <b>ring</b> <b>ouzel</b> (too wild, it seemed, to be afraid of man) hopped down fearlessly to feed upon the strand, or past flower-banks where the golden globe-flower, and the great blue geranium, and the giant campanula bloomed beneath the white tassels of the bird-cherry, I could not tread upon the limestone slabs without crushing at every step hundreds of the delicate Mystacide tubes, which literally paved the. shallow edge of the stream, and which would have been metamorphosed in due time into small sooty moth-like fairies, best represented, I should say, by the soft black- hackle which Mr. Stewart recommends as the most deadly of North- country flies. Not to these, however, but to the Phryganeae (who, when sticks and pebbles fail, often make their tubes of sand, e.g. P. flava), should I refer the red-cow fly, which is almost the only autumn killer in the Dartmoor streams. A red cowhair body and a woodcock wing is his type, and let those who want West-country trout remember him.|$|E
