At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist {{in the direction of}} baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play.

40|$|International audienceTwelfth grade physics {{classes with}} 344 {{students}} participated in a quasi-experimental study comparing two small-group learning settings. In the jigsaw classroom, {{in contrast to the}} cyclical rotation method, teaching expectancy as well as resource interdependence is established. The study is based on the Self-Determination Theory of motivation which states that the satisfaction of the ‘basic needs' for experiencing autonomy, competence, and social relatedness is essential to promote intrinsic motivation. Regarding the experience of competence, a small effect in favour of the jigsaw classroom was found, whereas students in the cyclical <b>rotation</b> <b>setting</b> showed medium-sized benefits in experiencing autonomy. A path analysis revealed that these opposing effects balanced each other, that is, no effect from small-group method to intrinsic motivation was found.

This research investigates whether firms have adopted the real option approach to manage their human resources while they are faced with the risks affecting their human capital. The results of this study indicate: (1) When firms are concerned with the market risk and the technological risk, they will offer different levels of salary premiums to employees. This is consistent with what the real option theory predicts. (2) For employees with multiple skills or with newer skills, firms are more willing to offer higher salary premiums to them. On average, salary premiums for the employees having multiple skills are higher than those with newer skills. In addition, the growth option value of human capital is higher than the switching option value. (3) As for how different types of risks influence the real options value of human capital, we find that the technological risk has significant effect on salary premiums for multiple skills as well as on those with newer skills. However the market risk has no effect on them. (4) Last, in order to obtain higher flexibility value of human resources management, firms are willing to accept the increased costs from practicing job <b>rotation,</b> <b>setting</b> up employees communication channels and employee training.

40|$|Gravity-driven {{convection}} induced in {{the liquid}} by density gradients of temperature or composition disrupts uniform dendritic growth during controlled directional solidification and promotes severe macrosegregation. The solute-rich region about the dendrite tip appears {{to play a}} pivotal role in channel initiation. Allen and Hunt referred to this region as an "initial transient" or dynamic region constituting steep concentration gradients. Experimental investigation also point to the role the tip region plays in developing microstructure. Hellawell and co-workers showed that flow-through dendritic channels could be effectively disrupted, and segregation minimized, during the gradient freezing of bulk castings by rotating the melt through a slight angle with respect to Earth's gravity vector. Adapting this principle to controlled directional solidification, it has been shown" that segregation in dendritic alloys can be minimized, and properties improved, by processing the sample near horizontal in conjunction with a slow axial rotation of the crucible. It is postulated that the observed microstructural uniformity arises by maintaining the developing solute field about the dendrite tip. Solute rejected during vertical directional solidification will rise or sink parallel to the primary dendrite arms during axial <b>rotation</b> <b>setting</b> the stage for accumulation, instabilities, and segregation. In contrast, during horizontal growth, the rejected solute will sink or rise perpendicular to the primary dendrite. Now, {{in the presence of a}} slight axial rotation, solute that was initially sinking (or rising) will find itself above (or below) its parent dendrite, i. e., still about the tip region. The following is intended to experimentally demonstrate the viability of this concept in coordination with a model that gives predictive insight regarding solute distribution about growing dendrites. Alloys based on the lead-tin eutectic system were used in this study. The system is well characterized, the constituent metals are available in a very pure form, and the thermophysical properties are well known. During solidification of hypoeutectic alloys, e. g., 55 wt pct Pb, the primary dendrites reject the less dense tin, and for the hypereutectic alloys, e. g., 75 wt pct Sn, the primary dendrites reject denser lead. Alloys were prepared by melting appropriate amounts of lead and tin in a glass crucible after which the homogeneous liquid was sucked directly into 5 -mm i. d. glass tubes. The sample tube, containing approximately 30 cm of alloy, was then mechanically driven into the directional solidification furnace assembly and positioned such that approx. 20 cm of the sample was remelted. Subsequently, directional solidification was initiated by withdrawing the sample through a water-cooled jacket at a constant growth velocity of 2,microns/s. After 5 to 6 cm of growth, the sample was quickly removed from the furnace and quenched in a water bath to preserve the solid-liquid interface. Samples were directionally solidified vertically upward, nearly horizontally, and some in conjunction with an applied axial rotation of the crucible. Temperature gradients at the solid-liquid interface were measured with an in-siru K-type thermocouple. Solidified samples were cut perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction and conventionally prepared for microscopic examination...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{classification}} by Misiurewicz and Ziemian of elements in Homeo_ 0 (T^ 2) by their <b>rotation</b> <b>set</b> ρ, according to wether ρ is a point, a segment or a set with nonempty interior. A recent classification of nonwandering elements in Homeo_ 0 (T^ 2) by Koropecki and Tal has been given, {{according to the}} itrinsic underlying ambient where the dynamics takes place: planar, annular and strictly toral maps. We study the link between these two classifications, showing that, even abroad the nonwandering setting, annular maps are characterized by <b>rotation</b> <b>sets</b> which are rational segments. Also, we obtain information on the sublinear diffusion of orbits in the -not very well understood- case that ρ has nonempty interior. Comment: 62 pages, 23 figure...|$|R

We {{prove that}} if an area-preserving homeomorphism of the torus in the {{homotopy}} class of the identity has a <b>rotation</b> <b>set</b> which is a nonde-generate vertical segment containing the origin, then there exists an essential invariant annulus. In particular, some lift to the universal covering has uni-formly bounded displacement in the horizontal direction. 1...|$|R
