25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|E

2500|$|Violence against Palestinian Women and Girls, notes that, [...] "a {{significant}} number of women and girls in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) are victims of violence perpetrated by family members and intimate partners. While there is increasing recognition {{of the problem and}} some Palestinian Authority (PA) officials have indicated their support for a more forceful response, little action has been taken to seriously address these abuses. Indeed, there is some evidence the level of violence is getting worse while the remedies available to victims are being further eroded." [...] The report discusses spousal and child abuse, rape, incest, and [...] "honor" [...] crimes. [...] The report suggests that reasons for the PA's failure to respond to the violence include, [...] "discriminatory laws that condone and perpetuate such violence and the virtual absence of institutionalized policies to prevent violence, assist victims, and hold perpetrators accountable". [...] The report outlines Jordanian laws in force in the West Bank and Egyptian laws in Gaza, [...] "include provisions that provide a reduction in penalty to men who kill or attack female relatives committing adultery; relieve rapists who agree to marry their victims from any criminal prosecution; and allow only male relatives to file incest charges on behalf of minors". [...] In addition, HRW interviewed Palestinian police officers, including chiefs of police who, [...] "downplayed the severity of violence against women in the OPT and questioned the need for their involvement in the dissemination of potentially life-saving information to victims." [...] The report also noted that, [...] "police officers and clan leaders regularly [...] "mediate" [...] and [...] "resolve" [...] these cases, typically by returning the abused women to the [...] "care and protection" [...] of her attacker, without ever referring the case to the courts or the woman to social or other services she might need". While Human Rights Watch acknowledged, [...] "the severe constraints that the Israeli occupation imposes upon the PA," [...] they concluded that, [...] "notwithstanding these limitations, the PA holds ultimate <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> victims and holding perpetrators accountable...and that PA is failing to act diligently to prevent, investigate, and punish violence against women, putting women's health and lives in jeopardy. Ultimately, the PA is denying victims their rights under international human rights law to non-discrimination and an effective judicial remedy for abuse".|$|E

This article describes the advent and history of Victoria's differential response system, with a particular focus on the Child FIRST and IFS programme. This program entails a partnership arrangement between the Department of Human Services child protection services and community-based, not-for-profit agencies to provide a diverse range of early intervention and prevention services. The findings of a recent external service system evaluation, a judicial inquiry, and the large-scale Child and Family Services Outcomes Survey of parents/carers perspectives of their service experiences are used to critically examine {{the effectiveness of this}} differential response approach. Service-user perspectives of the health and wellbeing of children and families are identified, as well as the recognized implementation issues posing significant challenges for the goal of an integrated partnership system. The need for ongoing reform agendas is highlighted along with the policy, program and structural tensions that exist in differential response systems, which are reliant upon partnerships and shared <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> children and assisting vulnerable families.

40|$|Starting with {{imperfect}} {{laws and}} minimal management (whether {{by the state}} or by others), the Co-Management of Protected Areas (COMAP) Project helped put into place well-defined regulations and active participation by all key stakeholders at six protected areas (PAs). COMAP developed plans to give direction and focus to activities—plans that while consistent with national regulations are dynamic and able to be adjusted. COMAP’s systematic participatory training and communication approach reduced local people’s fear of speaking out against misuse of resources, and developed local constituencies able to speak out with confidence and professionalism. COMAP catalyzed NGO efforts to assume <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>protected</b> areas in Nicaragua and local people are taking responsibility and making decisions.

40|$|Information on visitor numbers, activities, {{expectations}} and satisfaction is vital <b>for</b> <b>protected</b> areas managers on two counts: {{to assist in}} the provision of the services and facilities that visitors need and want; and to determine if managers have been efficient and effective in meeting these demands. This paper builds on a recently completed national study in Australia of visitor data collection and usage, and the future visitor data needs, of protected area management agencies. Australia is a federation of states and provides a challenging backdrop for developing a national approach as most <b>responsibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>protected</b> areas rest with the states rather than the national government. Thus, the success of such an approach rests on cooperation rather than an overarching national regulatory responsibility. The study found that all protected area agencies collected visitor data, however, their approaches were highly variable in what was measured, how the measurements were applied and how data were managed and used. This variability was problematic because it becomes very difficult to determine issues of general importance <b>for</b> <b>protected</b> area management or to benchmark performance across areas. Based on these findings and knowledge of the institutional settings <b>for</b> <b>protected</b> area management in Australia, this paper poses some ideas for progressing a national approach for standardising the measures and measurement of key variables so that comparisons and benchmarking become possible and reliable. Core and supplementary visitor data variables can be identified, with the former being of national interest and hence requiring collection and storage under national coordination and guidance. Implementing such an approach will require working creatively and collaboratively within the current institutional settings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLocal {{rural and}} {{indigenous}} communities have assumed increasing <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> conservation {{within and between}} areas buffering the impacts of agricultural or resource-extraction zones and protected areas. Empowering local communities as central partners in conservation and climate-change mitigation has allowed many people {{to gain access to}} land and citizenship rights but has provided limited improvements in access to social services and economic opportunities even as expectation about their role as environmental stewards grows. These expectations, however, are inconsistent with reality. We conducted multiple field studies in Brazil since the mid- 1980 s to illustrate the discrepancies between conservation programs and local conditions and expectations. We suggest that public policies and conservation programs should not delegate <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> managing <b>protected</b> areas to local and indigenous communities without considering local needs and expectations and locals’ attitudes toward conservation. In other words, behavior that maintains or improves the environment should not be treated as traditional based on the expectations of outsiders.
