5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals {{would never be able to}} live in a cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to <b>read</b> <b>of</b> the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a <b>read</b> <b>of</b> the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} African-American newspapers in Omaha. The first was the Progress, established in 1889 by Ferdinand L. Barnett. Cyrus D. Bell, an ex-slave, established the Afro-American Sentinel in 1892. In 1893 George F. Franklin started publishing the Enterprise, later published by Thomas P. Mahammitt and edited by his wife, Ella Mahammitt. It was the longest lived {{of any of the}} early African-American newspapers published in Omaha. The best known and most widely <b>read</b> <b>of</b> all African-American newspapers in the city was the Omaha Monitor, established in 1915, edited and published by Reverend John Albert Williams. It stopped publishing in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Little {{thought was}} given to the Chinese {{reaction}} to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he <b>read</b> <b>of</b> it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.|$|E
5|$|Ranking fifth among NHL rookies {{in scoring}} by January 2012, he was {{selected}} as one of 12 first-year players {{to participate in the}} NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition in Ottawa, Ontario. He was designated to Team Chara during the All-Star Draft and went on to participate in one SuperSkills event, the shooting accuracy segment. Hitting all four targets in 20.929 seconds, he lost the rookie heat to Matt <b>Read</b> <b>of</b> the Philadelphia Flyers, who had a time of 14.011 seconds. Hodgson's time ranked fifth among the eight players who participated in the event. Canucks teammates Henrik Sedin, Daniel Sedin and Alexander Edler joined Hodgson in Ottawa as NHL All-Stars, though they competed against him in the SuperSkills Competition as part of Team Alfredsson. Following the NHL All-Star weekend, Hodgson was named the League's Rookie of the Month for January after having recorded ten points (six goals and four assists) over 11 games, first among Canucks and NHL first-year players.|$|E
5|$|The Season Nine DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include: more scenes from the Q panel; Pete discussing what he learned working at Dunder Mifflin; Angela's sister, Phyllis, and Andy giving toasts at the wedding; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories; and the office taking one of the potted plants outside and planting it in actual soil. The episode originally was scripted {{to begin with a}} different cold open; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim, in which Dwight is led to believe that he is actually living in the Matrix, a computer-simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name. The scene was either not filmed, or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes. A table <b>read</b> <b>of</b> it—along {{with the rest of the}} episode—was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD.|$|E

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank {{and access to}} females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, {{with a series of}} acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. <b>Read</b> <b>of</b> Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July, 2014, four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay.|$|E

50|$|Two {{readings}} {{were reported}} from 'Asim: The famous one is Hafs, {{the other one}} is Shu'ba. Hafs was 'Asim's step-son and it is believed that he didn't differ from him in his <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> the Quran. 'Asim also retained the <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> his teacher Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami and it reported that the latter had read the Quran out to the Commander of the Believers, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. The case can therefore be made that the <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> Hafs is exactly the same as the <b>reading</b> <b>of</b> 'Ali which he inherited from the Prophet to the very last dot.|$|R
