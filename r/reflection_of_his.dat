5|$|Edler {{plays in}} the style of an {{offensive}} defenseman. One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot. At the Canucks' 2008 SuperSkills event, he beat the team's reigning hardest shooter, Sami Salo, with a 99.3 mile-per-hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010, as well. He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck, allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards. Many within the Canucks organization, such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness, have asserted this as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> calm off-ice demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

5|$|Production did not recommence and the Hoover {{production}} line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles {{changed its name}} to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. £7.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which £7 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E

5|$|In Shahîd's judgment, the {{imprecision}} and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is {{the major}} cause {{of the lack of}} scholarly consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn a reflection of the special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work. A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' Historia to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of Licinius in the public memory (and official damnatio memoriae) after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the Historia incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the Council of Nicaea. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.|$|E
5|$|Macartney made 20 in {{the first}} innings and was unbeaten on 22, playing as an opener, as Australia {{completed}} a ten-wicket win in the First Test. It was Australia's sixth consecutive Test win over England. He failed to pass 20 {{in the next two}} county matches, but did take 2/19 against Middlesex, his first wickets on tour. This came in his 11th match on tour and was a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role as a specialist batsman in the post-war years. The next game against Gloucestershire heralded the start of a rich vein of run-scoring during the remainder of June. Macartney scored 149, in an Australian innings noted for elegant strokeplay and big hitting, after managing only 31 and eight in the eight-wicket win in the Second Test, hit three consecutive centuries.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{would later}} explain his comments, {{saying that it}} was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{feelings}} on white fighters, but simply said to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe.|$|E
5000|$|Much of Kupferman's music {{contains}} large {{gestures and}} short dramatic hooks {{which are a}} critical to his compositional technique (his [...] "gestalt form").

25|$|Couhig {{said that}} he had {{expected}} Livingston to support him in 1999 in return for the help that Couhig had rendered to Livingston in the 1977 election. Couhig said that his weak showing may have been a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inability to convince voters how his vision differed from the other Republican candidates. He noted that he spent $500,000 of his own money on the race despite bleak prospects.|$|E

He wittingly reveals aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> psyche with each piece, stating {{that his work}} is conceptually, materially and formally driven. The subjects and materials used in the show run thegamut, but all are connected by theme. <b>Reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> conservative upbringing in New England and current lifestyle are central to his inspiration. Swanson is a hunter and gatherer of media and identity." ...|$|R
25|$|According to David Eagleman, Nabokov {{named the}} title {{character}} in part after his favorite butterfly. An avid collector of butterflies, Nabokov was especially fond of one species with yellow wings and a black body. As a synesthete, he associated colors with each letter; A was connected to yellow, and D to black. Thus he saw a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> favorite butterfly (yellow-black-yellow) in the name Ada. This also makes sense because Ada {{wants to be a}} lepidopterist in the book.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, he {{suffered}} severe burns {{in a fire}} at the Copley Plaza hotel, in Boston, but survived after thirty hours of extensive surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. Though he was warned that he might {{never be able to}} live a normal life again, eight years later he was fit enough to insist on playing tennis nearly every day and to launch a hostile takeover of Viacom. Redstone has discussed the story of surviving the fire as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> strong determination and will to live.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare's very {{frequent}} {{references to}} Paganistic gods and concepts, such as Hymen bringing about {{the resolution of}} As You Like It, are not a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own belief but a necessary device to present deity on stage, where Christian figures were, {{in contrast to the}} presentation of the mystery plays of earlier times, prohibited. Some commonplace Christian allusions, involving no physical manifestation of religion, in Quarto editions of the history cycle were replaced with harmless references to pagan gods when the First Folio appeared.|$|E

25|$|In the lead-up to the 2008 presidential {{elections}} in Taiwan, the Kuomintang candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, pledged opening the Three Links at an accelerated rate {{should he be}} elected president. The ruling DPP has traditionally been reluctant to implement this, citing the PRC's refusal to negotiate unless the Taiwanese counterparty accepts the one-China principle under the 1992 consensus. In June 2007, DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh criticised Ma's plans as a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lack of experience in handling cross-strait affairs. He also stressed that while the direct links may benefit Taiwan economically, Taiwan's values must not be compromised as a result.|$|E
25|$|The play opens as an envoy from China arrives {{to paint}} a {{portrait}} of the emperor. The emperor is sick, however, and so a stand-in needs to be chosen; Shihei volunteers himself, an indication or <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own lofty goals, but at the suggestion of Kan Shōjō and the decision of the emperor, Prince Tokiyo is chosen. As Tokiyo's love, Kariya, is the adopted daughter of Kan Shōjō, Shihei sees this as favoritism, and is disturbed. The emperor also orders Kan Shōjō to pass on his secrets of calligraphy to a disciple of his choice.|$|E
