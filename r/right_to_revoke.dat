25|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} {{in the level of}} self-governance for the sub-regions of a member state. Most states, especially the smaller ones, are unitary states; meaning all major political power is concentrated at the national level. 10 states allocate power to more local levels of government. Austria, Belgium and Germany are full federations, meaning their regions have constitutional autonomies. Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands are federacies, meaning some regions have autonomy but most do not. Spain and Italy have system of devolution where regions have autonomy, but the national government retains the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> it. The United Kingdom has a system of asymmetric devolution, whereby Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland enjoy a degree of self-government.|$|E

The Siegel estate claims that the original [...] "Superboy" [...] character published by DC Comics is an independent creation that used ideas from Jerry Siegel's original rejected pitch and was created without his consent. On April 4, 2006, Federal judge Ronald S. W.

40|$|To {{what extent}} are water <b>rights</b> subject <b>to</b> {{restrictions}} based on ideas of stewardship? In England and Wales, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> water {{has traditionally been}} conceived as a property right, favouring existing landholders and neglecting responsibilities towards stewardship, or protecting the water environment from ecological harm. But there is much debate {{about the extent to}} which property ought to be subject to inherent stewardship obligations or whether there is already support for this, theoretically or in practice. The more that we can say that property rights are limited by stewardship duties, arguably the greater the scope for regulatory restrictions in the public interest. This brief looks critically at one particular law reform — section 27 of the Water Act 2003 — which enables abstraction <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> be <b>revoked</b> in order <b>to</b> protect the water environment from harm. Following analysis of the complex range of factors that impact on private water rights, the author calls into question the extent to which this reform to abstraction licensing law will recalibrate water <b>rights</b> from liberal <b>to</b> stewardship approaches. </p...|$|R

As a result, he formally outranked provincial governors and ordinary magistrates. He had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> enact or <b>revoke</b> sentences of capital punishment, was owed the obedience of private citizens (privati) and by the terms of the ius auxiliandi could save any plebeian from any patrician magistrate's decision. He could veto any act or proposal of any magistrate, including the tribunes of the people (ius intercedendi or ius intercessionis). His person was held to be sacrosanct.|$|R

The grant of the tithes and revenues from the fairs of Le Vieil-Dampierre to the abbey of Chatrices was confirmed by his father and ratified by Count Theobald IV of Champagne, their suzerain, in 1234. In 1218, Renard III, calling himself [...] "Jerusalem bound" [...] (Hierosolimam profecturus), granted the tithes of Remicourt and the produce (terrage) of Sommeille to the abbey of Monthiers-en-Argonne, specifying that if his father did not approve these gifts, then the Countess Blanche, who confirmed the grant, could make good on the gift out of her own lands.|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between a federation and a unitary state is often quite ambiguous. A unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and, while a central government may possess the theoretical <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> the autonomy of a self-governing region, it may be politically difficult for it {{to do so in}} practice. The self-governing regions of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations.

Examples include the option contract (in terms of which the grantor’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>revoke</b> his offer is restricted) and the preference contract (whereby the grantor gives a preferential right to conclude a specific contract should he decide to conclude this contract). An option contract constitutes two offers: a substantive offer and an undertaking or option to keep the offer open. If the option holder accepts the first offer by exercising the option, the main contract is created.|$|E

Restoration of rights meant that the rights were previously taken away, and rights retained were not functionally equivalent <b>to</b> <b>rights</b> <b>revoked</b> but later restored. Further, the other statutory basis for disregarding convictions involved convictions which were expunged or set aside, or for which the offender was pardoned, all of which were postconviction events which relieved consequences of the convictions, and there was no showing of any congressional intent to broaden the [...] "civil rights restored" [...] exemption to cover convictions attended by no loss of civil rights.|$|R
