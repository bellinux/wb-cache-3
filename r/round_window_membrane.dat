50|$|The {{round window}} {{is one of}} the two {{openings}} from the middle ear into the inner ear. It is sealed by the secondary tympanic membrane (<b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membrane),</b> which vibrates with opposite phase to vibrations entering the inner ear through the oval window. It allows fluid in the cochlea to move, which in turn ensures that hair cells of the basilar membrane will be stimulated and that audition will occur.|$|E
50|$|Topical skin {{preparations}} such as chlorhexidine and ethyl alcohol {{have the potential}} to be ototoxic should they enter the inner ear through the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membrane.</b> This potential was first noted after a small percentage of patients undergoing early myringoplasty operations experienced severe sensorineural hearing loss. It was found that in all operations involving this complication the preoperative sterilization was done with chlorhexidine. The ototoxicity of chlorhexidine was further confirmed by studies with animal models.|$|E

This usually occurs {{as a consequence of}} trauma, including barotrauma, and can give rise to vertigo as well as hearing loss.|$|R
50|$|Also {{located in}} the middle ear are the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles which protect the hearing {{mechanism}} through a stiffening reflex. The stapes transmits sound waves to the inner ear through the oval <b>window,</b> a flexible <b>membrane</b> separating the air-filled middle ear from the fluid-filled inner ear.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To {{evaluate}} the selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist (SEGRA) compound A, a potential novel therapeutic for inner ear disorders, for ototoxic effects. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory animal study. METHODS: Experimental guinea pigs were grouped as follows: Systemic application of compound A (1. 5 mg/kg and 4. 5 mg/kg; n[*]=[*] 6 /group) and intratympanic application of compound A (1 mM and 10 mM; n[*]=[*] 6 /group). Contralateral ears in topically treated animals served as controls. Hearing thresholds {{were determined by}} auditory brainstem response before and directly after the application of compound A, {{as well as on}} days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. At the end of the experiments, temporal bones were harvested for histological evaluation. RESULTS: Systemic administration of compound A (1. 5 mg/kg and 4. 5 mg/kg) did not cause hearing threshold shifts, whereas the intratympanic injection (1 mM and 10 mM) resulted in a hearing loss. Histological analysis of the middle and inner ears after topical compound A application showed alterations in the tympanic membranes, the auditory ossicles, and the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membranes,</b> whereas spiral ganglion cells and hair cells were not affected. CONCLUSION: SEGRAs such as compound A could provide novel therapeutic options for the treatment of inner ear disorders and reduce metabolic side effects. Whereas the intratympanic application of compound A resulted in a hearing loss, the systemic application of compound A merits evaluation for otoprotective effects in trauma models...|$|R
50|$|It {{is placed}} {{at the bottom of}} a funnel-shaped {{depression}} (the round window niche) and, in the macerated bone, opens into the cochlea of the internal ear; in the fresh state it is closed by a membrane, the secondary tympanic membrane (Latin: membrana tympani secundaria, or membrana fenestra cochleae)) or <b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membrane,</b> which is a complex saddle point shape. The visible central portion is concave (curved inwards) toward the tympanic cavity and convex (curved outwards) toward the cochlea; but towards the edges, where it is hidden in the round window niche, it curves the other way.|$|E
5000|$|Intratympanic {{administration}} - Gel formulations {{are under}} investigation {{to provide more}} consistent drug delivery to the inner ear. Local drug delivery can be accomplished through intratympanic administration, a minimally invasive procedure where the ear drum is anesthetized and a drug is administered into the middle ear. From the middle ear, a drug can diffuse across the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membrane</b> into the inner ear. Intratympanic administration of steroids may be effective for sudden sensorineural hearing loss for some patients, but high quality clinical data has not been generated. Intratympanic administration of an anti-apoptotic peptide (JNK inhibitor) is currently being evaluated in late-stage clinical development.|$|E
50|$|The stapes bone transmits {{movement}} to the oval window. As the stapes footplate moves into the oval window, the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> <b>membrane</b> moves out, and this allows movement of the fluid within the cochlea, leading to movement of the cochlear inner hair cells and thus hearing. If the round window were to be absent or rigidly fixed (as can happen in some congenital abnormalities), the stapes footplate would be pushing incompressible fluid against the unyielding walls of the cochlea. It would therefore not move to any useful degree leading to a hearing loss of about 60dB. This is, unsurprisingly, {{the same as for}} conditions where the stapes itself is fixed, such as otosclerosis.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest in the local delivery of drugs to the inner ear by applying them to the <b>round</b> <b>window</b> (RW) <b>membrane,</b> most drug application protocols have been empirically-based. As a result, consequences of changes in delivery method, applied drug concentration or even small alterations in treatment protocols {{have been difficult to}} predict. Since direct measurements of drug concentration time courses (as required in phase I clinical studies) are not presently possible in the human inner ear, computer simulations provide a valuable tool for estimating drug concentrations in the inner ear for phase II clinical studies. The ultimate goal is to simulate drug movements in the inner ear sized appropriately to the human after topical application to the RW membrane. In animal experiments it has been shown with ionic markers that following RW drug delivery, a concentration gradient is set up along the cochlea, with higher levels near the base and lower levels in more apical turns. Even after prolonged applications, a gradient will persist. 1 As these gradients are of fundamental scientific and clinical importance, it is necessary to experimentally demonstrate the existence of gradients for physiologically-relevant drugs...|$|R
40|$|The <b>round</b> <b>window</b> (RW) <b>membrane</b> {{provides}} {{pressure relief}} when the cochlea is excited by sound. Here, we report measurements of cochlear function from guinea pigs when the cochlea was stimulated at acoustic frequencies by movements of a miniature magnet which partially occluded the RW. Maximum cochlear sensitivity, corresponding to subnanometre magnet displacements at neural thresholds, was observed for frequencies around 20 kHz, {{which is similar}} to that for acoustic stimulation. Neural response latencies to acoustic and RW stimulation were similar and taken to indicate that both means of stimulation resulted in the generation of conventional travelling waves along the cochlear partition. It was concluded that the relatively high impedance of the ossicles, as seen from the cochlea, enabled the region of the RW not occluded by the magnet, to act as a pressure shunt during RW stimulation. We propose that travelling waves, similar to those owing to acoustic far-field pressure changes, are driven by a jet-like, near-field component of a complex pressure field, which is generated by the magnetically vibrated RW. Outcomes of research described here are theoretical and practical design principles for the development of new types of hearing aids, which use near-field, RW excitation of the cochlea. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Acute diffuse {{otitis externa}} (swimmer's ear), otomycosis, exostoses, {{traumatic}} eardrum perforation, middle ear infection, and barotraumas {{of the inner}} ear are common problems in swimmers and people engaged in aqua activities. The most common ear problem in swimmers is acute diffuse otitis externa, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common pathogen. The symptoms are itching, otalgia, otorrhea, and conductive hearing loss. The treatment includes frequent cleansing of the ear canal, pain control, oral or topical medications, acidification of the ear canal, and control of predisposing factors. Swimming in polluted waters and ear-canal cleaning with cotton-tip applicators should be avoided. Exostoses are usually seen in people who swim in cold water and present with symptoms of accumulated debris, otorrhea and conductive hearing loss. The treatment for exostoses is transmeatal surgical removal of the tumors. Traumatic eardrum perforations may occur during water skiing or scuba diving and present with symptoms of hearing loss, otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus and vertigo. Tympanoplasty might be needed if the perforations do not heal spontaneously. Patients with chronic otitis media with active drainage should avoid swimming, while patients who have undergone mastoidectomy and who have no cavity problems may swim. For children with ventilation tubes, surface swimming is safe in a clean, chlorinated swimming pool.
