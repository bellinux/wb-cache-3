The recent <b>reform</b> <b>in</b> Finland and the forthcoming <b>reform</b> <b>in</b> Norway should reduce significantly the pressure to increase pension contributions. One of the main factors in this respect is the pension adjustment based on the life expectancy.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin.

The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial <b>reforms</b> <b>in</b> the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{independent}} and united Armenia was the main goal of the Armenian national liberation movement during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. By the 1890s, a low-intensity armed conflict developed between the three major Armenian parties—the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak), Hnchak and Armenakan— and the Ottoman government. Calls from the great powers for <b>reforms</b> <b>in</b> the Armenian provinces and Armenian aspirations of independence resulted in the Hamidian massacres between 1894 and 1896, during which up to 300,000 Armenian civilians were slaughtered by the order of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, after whom the massacres were named. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, some Armenians felt that the situation would improve; however, a year later the Adana massacre took place and Turkish-Armenian relations deteriorated further. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, the Ottoman government was pushed to accept the <b>reforms</b> <b>in</b> the Armenian provinces in early 1914.|$|E
