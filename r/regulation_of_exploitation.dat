The factory workers, their subcontractor employers, intermediary vendors and even the MNCs seeking CoC commitments, have convergent interests in violating key aspects of the codes and deceiving their auditors. The analysis evaluates the residual value of CoCs in light of these constraints and the options for improving labour regulation, with particular reference to the plight of disadvantaged women workers...|$|R

However, their ability to ensure long-term survival of threatened andendangered species varies across countries, regions and landscapes.

We assessed the conservation value of one such reserve for a charismatic yet globally endangered species, the red panda Ailurus fulgens,in the light of on-going land-use transformation in Nepal. We conducted field surveys forindirect signs of red pandas along forest trails in 25 -km 2 sampling grid cells (n = 54) of Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and confronted a set of ecological hypotheses to the data using hierarchical occupancy models. We estimated overall occupancy at Ψ(SE) = 0. 41 (0. 007), with relatively high site-level detectability [p = 0. 93 (SE = 0. 001) ]. Our results show that despitebeing a subsistence form of small-scale resource use, extraction of bamboo and livestock grazing negatively affected panda occurrence, albeit at different intensities. The amount of bamboo cover,rather than the overall proportion of forest cover, had greater influence on the panda occurrence. Despite availability of bamboo cover, areas with bamboo extraction and anthropogenic disturbances {{were less likely to}} be occupied by pandas. Together, these results suggest that long-term persistence of red pandas in this reserve and elsewhere across the species' range will require preventing commercial extractionof bamboo, coupled with case-specific <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> anthropogenic <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> red panda habitats...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{a part of}} {{a larger}} {{research}} project that examined bio-based building materials that are underutilized in the construction of non-residential buildings, the presented mail survey was conducted in France and Gabon to determine how architects specify selected bio-based building materials. This study provides a preliminary assessment of the potential segments of architects in practice based on their attitudes to the use of wood in non-residential construction. France Among the most wooded countries, Russia ranks first (809 million hectares), then, Brazil (478 million hectares), Canada (310 million hectares), the United States (303 million hectares) [...] . In Europe, France occupies the fourth place-behind Sweden, Finland and Spain-with its 18 million hectares. It is a little less than 30 % of the French territory. The French forest is very diverse, with 136 different species of trees. The area of French hardwood forests is 11. 2 million hectares, or 71. 2 % of the forest. Private forest is dominated mainly by oaks, which occupy about 5 million hectares. Chestnut and poplar are specific species of the private forest. A little more than 4. 4 million hectares are made up of coniferous forests with a great diversity of species: maritime pine, Scots pine, fir, spruce, Douglas-fir [...] . The French forest employs 440, 000 people, more than the automobile industry. It has a turnover of 60 billion euros per year, or nearly 3 % of PIB (Produit Interieur Brut or GDP I think). The sector includes operators, sawmills, pulp mills, panel and furniture manufacturers, and firewood. A large part of the French forest is private: 3. 3 million owners share it. Gabon In Central Africa and particularly in equatorial region, the forest {{plays a key role in}} this regulation. In the year 2000, Gabon produced more than 4 million m 3 timber, of which 72 % was Aucoumea Klaineana Pierre (AKP). However, in 2004, only 1. 6 million m 3 was produced, of which 61 % was AKP. This decrease in lumber production was due to a new <b>regulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> trees. In 2009, after the prohibition by the Gabonese government of the exportation of logs, more structures focalised on the study and the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> wood were born. Since then, a particular attention is done on the mechanical characterization of some species which are usually used in timber structures. One of more those species is AKP which is an endemic specie in central Africa's forest which is a long time, associated at the life of locals. In the recent past, AKP represents 80 % of annual wood's production in this country and 90 % of this specie is exported all over the world and particularly in Europa and Asia. It is used largely for plywood in building, in veneer, finished or semi-finished products and in the design of the paper. Using the information obtained in this study will contribute to an understanding of the probability that bio-based building materials are chosen in residential and non-residential buildings and to an understanding of the drivers and barriers for increased use. Change is difficult – the barriers to wood are complex and the building industry is both averse to risk and slowed by inertia – but with the right focus, the wood industry can make a difference. The study is extended to selected European countries and the US, as well as to Central Africa. The study is extended to selected European countries and the US, as well as to Central Africa.

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the potential for impacts of ocean acidification on North Atlantic deep-sea ecosystems in response to IPCC AR 5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Deep-sea biota is likely highly vulnerable to changes in seawater chemistry and sensitive to moderate excursions in pH. Here we show, from seven fully coupled Earth system models, that for {{three out of four}} RCPs over 17 % of the seafloor area below 500 m depth in the North Atlantic sector will experience pH reductions exceeding − 0. 2 units by 2100. Increased stratification in response to climate change partially alleviates the impact of ocean acidification on deep benthic environments. We report on major pH reductions over the deep North Atlantic seafloor (depth > 500 m) and at important deep-sea features, such as seamounts and canyons. By 2100, and under the high CO 2 scenario RCP 8. 5, pH reductions exceeding − 0. 2 (− 0. 3) units are projected in close to 23 % (~ 15 %) of North Atlantic deep-sea canyons and ~ 8 % (3 %) of seamounts – including seamounts proposed as sites of marine protected areas. The spatial pattern of impacts reflects the depth of the pH perturbation and does not scale linearly with atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Impacts may cause negative changes of the same magnitude or exceeding the current target of 10 % of preservation of marine biomes set by the convention on biological diversity, implying that ocean acidification may offset benefits from conservation/management strategies relying on the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> resource <b>exploitation...</b>|$|R
