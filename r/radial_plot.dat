For example, the Egger test for publication bias is equivalent to testing the significance of the intercept in linear regression. In practice, both x- and y-coordinates of the points in a <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> are subject to sampling error, which may be correlated, and so the standard theory of least squares does not apply. For the Egger test, the actual significance levels are inflated, sometimes substantially so. We derive approximations to the sampling properties of the <b>radial</b> <b>plot,</b> assuming that the within- study sample sizes are large. This leads to an asymptotic bias correction for the Egger test.

For example, the least squares slope though the origin estimates the treatment effect, and a widely used test for publication bias is equivalent to testing the significance of the regression intercept.

This leads to extra variability in the points of the <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> which can lead to a marked distortion in inferences derived from these regression calculations.

40|$|Radial plots are bivariate (xj,yj) scatterplots where: (1) View the MathML source with zj a {{transformation}} of some data and σ(zj) the corresponding measurement uncertainty. For example, if zj = log(tj) then σ(zj) = σ(tj) /tj. z 0 is a convenient central value such as the weighted mean. The slope of a line connecting the origin (x = 0,y = 0) of a <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> with a data point (xj,yj) equals zj, and the horizontal distance along x-axis is a measure if its precision. Thus, the <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> simultaneously visualises a measurement's value and precision. No other graphical method achieves this goal with the same elegance (Galbraith, 1988). This makes the <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> the method of choice for visualising heteroscedastic data, i. e. data with (large and) variable measurement uncertainties. Traditional applications in the Earth Sciences are fission track and luminescence dating, which are governed by Poisson processes (e. g., [Galbraith, 1990] and [Galbraith et al., 1999]). In principle, however, radial plots {{can be used for}} any kind of data. RadialPlotter is a user-friendly application for generating radial plots. It has the following advantages over existing programs such as Trackkey or MacTrack. (1) The program was developed solely for radial plots and does not perform other functions for data reduction or interpretation. Therefore, <b>radial</b> <b>plot</b> functions are not buried deep inside the menu structure and the interface is very straightforward. (2) RadialPlotter was written in Java (version 5) and is, therefore, perfectly platform independent. (3) In addition to fission track radial plots, RadialPlotter also offers the possibility to generate radial plots for luminescence dating, or any other kind of data such as (U-Th) /He or 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages. RadialPlotter can be downloaded free of charge from [URL] The program consists of a single executable jar file (RadialPlotter. jar). This makes installation straightforward: it suffices to download and open this file to run RadialPlotter. For testing purposes, three example input files are provided on the website, one {{for each of the three}} possible input formats (‘Fission Tracks’, ‘Luminescence’ and ‘Other’). The graphical output can be saved as either bitmap or vector images, in a. png or. pdf format, respectively. RadialPlotter automatically performs a χ 2 -test for statistical homogeneity of fission track data. For populations that have failed this test, the program implements the mixture modeling algorithm of Galbraith and Green (1990) (Fig. 1). Data points can be colour-coded to show an additional variable such as chemical composition or a kinetic parameter. Colour-coding can also be a useful tool for double-dating, which is rapidly gaining popularity in detrital studies (e. g., Campbell et al., 2005 I. H. Campbell, P. W. Reiners, C. M. Allen, S. Nicolescu and R.

This study presents a rotationally invariant descriptor for textures with different orientations based on the Quaternion Representation. Approach: A novel Quaternion Photometric Stereo (QPS) was proposed for Rotation invariant classification of 3 D surface textures. QPS was constructed by placing each pixel of three images of same texture with different orientation into the three imaginary parts of the quaternion, leaving the real part zero.

Spatial analysis of CG lightning relative to both compass directions and the direction of motion were compiled. Additionally, a radial analysis of this data was performed within both a 300 km radius and a 50 km radius range. Finally, all analyses were stratified into all tropical cyclones and hurricane categories for further consideration. The National Lightning Detection Network recorded 307, 593 CG lightning flashes within 300 km of the storms in this study. Negative flashes had an average first stroke peak current of - 49 kA and a mean multiplicity of 2. 7. Positive flashes occurred at a rate of 5. 3 percent, with a mean peak current of 43 kA and 1. 2 multiplicity average. Detected CG lightning characteristics changed significantly with a network upgrade in 1994. CG lightning flashes for all tropical cyclones favored the area south and west of the cyclone center. However, taking into account storm relative motion, the majority of flashes shifts to the front and right sections of the storm. <b>Radial</b> <b>plots</b> indicated lightning frequency increased throughout the domain, with a maximum between 270 km and 300 km.

The fatty acid composition of oils is determined using gas chromatography of methyl esters obtained by transesterification of triacylglycerols with 2 M KOH/MeOH. Fourteen fatty acids and squalene are identified in all the samples. Oleic acid (18 : 1 ω 9), palmitic acid (16 : 0), linoleic acid (18 : 2 ω 6) and stearic acid (18 : 0) are the major fatty acids commonly found in olive oils. Palmitoleic acid (16 : 1 ω 7), hypogeic acid (16 : 1 ω 9), oleic acid (18 : 1 ω 9) and cis-vaccenic acid (18 : 1 ω 7) are considered as separate entities by the European regulation, unlike the Codex Alimentarius which identifies them as a single component. Six minor fatty acids namely margaric acid (17 : 0), margaroleic acid (17 : 1 ω 8), arachidic acid (20 : 0), gondoïque acid (20 : 1 ω 9), behenic acid (22 : 0) and lignoceric acid (24 : 0) are identified. These acids, although minor, are important for the characterization of cultivars. Oils of different cultivars are characterized by different fatty acid compositions.

40|$|Aims: Natural and {{anthropogenic}} {{changes in}} forests can have important influences on transpiration and water production. Understanding {{the effects of}} increasing disturbances, due for example to climate change and forest harvesting, requires detailed information on how forest density and structural attributes relate to transpiration. Mean annual transpiration of eucalypt forest communities is often strongly correlated with total cross-sectional sapwood area. Our aim was to test an efficient method for estimating sapwood area at 1. 3 m height (SA 1. 3) in {{a large number of}} trees to understand the spatial heterogeneity of tree and stand sapwood area within and between forest communities, and develop allometric relationships that predict SA 1. 3 with forest inventory data. We also apply tree competition models to determine {{the degree to which the}} relationship between SA 1. 3 and tree basal area at 1. 3 m height (BA 1. 3) is influenced by competition. Methods: We visited 25 recently harvested southeastern Australian forest sites consisting of 1379 trees and 5 Eucalyptus species to evaluate a new efficient data collection method for estimating SA 1. 3 with tree taper and stump dimensions data using mixed effects models. The locations of 784 stumps within one 5 -ha site were accurately mapped using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and four distance-dependent tree competition models were applied across the site to explain within-stand variation in the ratio of SA 1. 3 to BA 1. 3. Data from 24 additional sites, consisting of ten 15 m <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> per site, were used to analyse within-site variation in R Ha (the ratio of stand sapwood area SA Ha to stand basal area BA Ha). The <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> were merged within each site to evaluate between-site variations in R Ha across the landscape. For predicting SA Ha with forest inventory data, we computed the relationship between SA Ha and a new index of total stem perimeter per hectare, defined as √BA Ha N T, where N T is tree stocking density. Important Findings: Our 1379 measured stems represent the most comprehensive measure of sapwood area, surpassing the 757 measured stems in native eucalypt forests published in literature. The species-specific R Ha varied considerably across sites and therefore extrapolating SA Ha with spatially distributed BA Ha maps and a generalized R Ha would introduce local uncertainty. We found that the species-specific stem perimeter index was more effective at capturing variability in SA Ha across the landscape using forest composition, structure and density data (R²: 0. 72 – 0. 77). The strong correlation between tree SA 1. 3 and BA 1. 3 improved slightly using tree competition models (R² increased from 0. 86 to 0. 88). Relating SA Ha to routinely measured forest inventory attributes within permanent plots and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data may provide opportunities to map forest water use in time and space across large areas disturbed by wildfire and logging...|$|R

40|$|Large Eddy Simulations {{are used}} to model a {{turbulent}} confined coannular combustor and {{examine the effects of}} swirl on the flow field and mixing. Three separate simulations with relatively high mesh resolutions and different swirl numbers have been carried out using a finite volume method on a Cartesian non-uniform structured grid. A localised dynamic Smagorinsky model is used to parameterize the subgrid scale turbulence. The snapshots of the axial and swirl velocities and velocity vector fields show the complex flow patterns developing with increased swirl number and the rapid decay of axial momentum. Precessing vortex cores (PVC) were identified for all three cases and the mean axial velocity plots indicate that the upstream extremity of the vortex breakdown bubble shifts towards the inlet as the swirl number increases. The calculated power spectra indicate the distinct precession frequency for high swirl number. Probability density functions of axial velocity showed the changes of their distributions from approximately Gaussian to non-Gaussian with increased swirl number. The swirl has a large effect on the rate of decay of the axial velocity throughout the domain, whereas only has a significant effect on the decay of swirl velocity in the near field close to the jet inlet. The relation between swirl number and the axial extent of the recirculation zone is approximately linear. <b>Radial</b> <b>plots</b> of mean passive scalar and its variance also demonstrate an increase in the rate of mixing with increasing swirl number...|$|R

40|$|Coatings {{are added}} to {{components}} to provide enhanced protection from the surroundings or to recondition them after the surfaces have been damaged. But the change in conditions at the surface will often lead {{to a change in}} the resistance to fatigue loading. This investigation is focused on the behaviour of shouldered shafts electroplated with nickel, chromium and a cobalt/chromium carbide composite. Changes, in fatigue strength are demonstrated. Each of the materials has a unique effect on the behaviour of a shaft, although there is a similarity which can be utilised in design. Each can reduce the fatigue strength by a substantial amount, but it is possible to optimize the design of a new shaft so that its strength is not significantly different to that of an uncoated version. The composite coating has the least effect. Explanations for these effects are given, based on differences in the mechanical properties of the substrate and coating materials, the distribution of residual stresses within the materials, and the interaction of these factors with the applied stress profile. Recommendations and methods of analysis which can be used in the design of coated components are presented. The contribution of the manufacturing processes is discussed, and grinding is highlighted as a dominant factor. Gentle grinding procedures are shown to produce ideal conditions by inducing large compressive residual stresses in the surfaces. <b>Radial</b> <b>plots</b> of the residual stresses have been produced. These were obtained by techniques based on Sachs' method, using electrochemical machining and an extended analysis developed for use with coated parts. The stress distributions were not affected by fatigue limit loading, indicating that stress relief methods using amplitudes of this order are ineffective and unsafe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPM 2. 5 {{and other}} {{atmospheric}} pollutants were continuously monitored at high time resolution for 1 year at an urban–industrial location in Toronto, ON, Canada's largest city. The data collected for these pollutants were examined to determine seasonal trends and potential sources. Advanced receptor models including residence time weighted concentration (RTWC) and simplified quantitative transport bias analysis (sQTBA) trajectory ensemble models (TEM) and conditional probability function (CPF) {{were applied to}} these data to identify potential local and regional sources of pollution impacting this receptor site. Seasonal trends showed that concentrations of PM 2. 5 were more frequently high in winter {{than in any other}} season. Median concentrations of lead and arsenic were highest in fall while median levels of chromium were not significantly different over the four seasons. The black carbon–derived measurement commonly known as Delta C (i. e., BC 370 nm–BC 880 nm) had its greatest abundance in winter and lowest levels in summer. The seasonality of Delta C is indicative of the impact of residential wood combustion near the receptor site. CPF indicated that lead and iron had the most unidirectional <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> with sectors located west–southwest of the receptor being the most likely local source regions. Winter CPF for Delta C is almost of equal strengths in all directions suggestive of near–uniform isotropic local impacts. The sQTBA model provided the most satisfactory spatial representation of impacting sources. The strongest sources of PM 2. 5 identified by the sQTBA model were both local and transboundary in origin. More potential source regions were found in winter and summer than in spring and fall...|$|R

In particular, Cu_ 55 and Cu_ 35 have been deposited on a thin natural silica layer of a Si(100) wafer and have been investigated under both ultra-high vacuum and ambient air conditions. Pieces of evidence of an icosahedral structure of Cu_ 55 and a densely-packed compact fcc-like geometry of Cu_ 35 are concluded from a comparison of the magnitude EXAFS spectra and FEFF simulations of the geometry of the corresponding free clusters. The exceedingly small radial distances as revealed from the <b>radial</b> distribution <b>plots</b> of the pristine clusters can be explained by a severe increase (∼ 100...|$|R
40|$|Background: Image {{analysis}} is increasingly used in plant phenotyping. Among the various imaging techniques {{that can be}} used in plant phenotyping, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging allows imaging of the impact of biotic or abiotic stresses on leaves. Numerous chlorophyll fluorescence parameters may be measured or calculated, but only a few can produce a contrast in a given condition. Therefore, automated procedures that help screening chlorophyll fluorescence image datasets are needed, especially in the perspective of high-throughput plant phenotyping. Results: We developed an automatic procedure aiming at facilitating the identification of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters impacted on leaves by a stress. First, for each chlorophyll fluorescence parameter, the procedure provides an overview of the data by automatically creating contact sheets of images and/or histograms. Such contact sheets enable a fast comparison of the impact on leaves of various treatments, or of the contrast dynamics during the experiments. Second, based on the global intensity of each chlorophyll fluorescence parameter, the procedure automatically produces <b>radial</b> <b>plots</b> and box plots allowing the user to identify chlorophyll fluorescence parameters that discriminate between treatments. Moreover, basic statistical {{analysis is}} automatically generated. Third, for each chlorophyll fluorescence parameter the procedure automatically performs a clustering analysis based on the histograms. This analysis clusters images of plants according to their health status. We applied this procedure to monitor the impact of the inoculation of the root parasitic plant Phelipanche ramosa on Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Col- 0 and Ler. Conclusions: Using this automatic procedure, we identified eight chlorophyll fluorescence parameters discriminating between the two ecotypes of A. thaliana, and five impacted by the infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by P. ramosa. More generally, this procedure may help to identify chlorophyll fluorescence parameters impacted by various types of stresses. We implemented this procedure at [URL] freely accessible to users of the plant phenotyping community...|$|R

Five sediment samples were submitted to the luminescence laboratories at SUERC for dating. All samples were subjected to laboratory preparation of sand-sized quartz, and purity checked using scanning electron microscopy. Dose rates for the bulk sediment were evaluated using analyses of the uranium, thorium and potassium concentrations obtained by high resolution gamma spectrometry coupled with beta dose rate measurement using thick source beta counting, and in situ field gamma spectroscopy. Equivalent doses were determined by OSL from 32 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot-regenerative (SAR) procedure. The material exhibited good OSL sensitivity and produced acceptable SAR internal quality control performance. <b>Radial</b> <b>plotting</b> methods revealed good internal homogeneity in the dose distributions obtained for each sample. The chronology established for the sampled sands on the site spans from the mid 16 th century (AD 1540 ± 40; SUTL 2441) through to the early 19 th century (AD 1810 ± 25), with the dates falling within three clusters - the waning stages of the Little Ice Age, the mid 18 th century (AD 1730 ± 25 to 1760 ± 25) and the early 19 th century (AD 1810 ± 25). In the wider region, periods of sand movement and deposition in the mid 18 th century, and early to late 18 th century, are documented in sediment statigraphies sectioned at the Old Scatness Broch, Scatness...|$|R
