40|$|Each year, a {{significant}} number of pupils in Northern Ireland fail to engage with the curriculum because of the disability known as dyslexia. Some will develop high levels of anxiety following years of failure. It is suggested that schools typically employ mechanistic approaches to remediation, which in many cases, fail to address effectively the emotional and social needs of these pupils. Should these needs be ignored, pupils can then find themselves increasingly isolated and disaffected. This situation is exacerbated by the number of children whose first language is not English and who now reside in Northern Ireland. Some will have dyslexia, which may go unnoticed because of the emphasis placed on improving language and teaching word recognition skills. In September 2005 dyslexia became a <b>recognised</b> <b>disability</b> in Northern Ireland, placing greater responsibility upon schools {{to meet the needs of}} pupils with dyslexia, including those whose first language is not English...|$|E
40|$|Issues of usability, accessibility, {{and equity}} {{in college and}} {{university}} education, often focus on those learners who have a physical or intellectual disability. However, students without a <b>recognised</b> <b>disability</b> may also be disadvantaged. The requirement for online access may provide a disadvantage, due {{to a number of}} factors ranging from those of a socio-economic nature, to extreme geographic isolation, to difficult work environments. Educators and their parent institutions would be well advised to investigate ways and means to alleviate such problems, before they impinge upon the learning experience of the students. This paper introduces educators to some of the many disparate factors that can create anomalies between online external (and often distant) students and face-to-face students. These include issues relating to technology, expectations of computer literacy, the online presentation of materials, access to library facilities, and the art of good communication. The paper suggests some ways in which the potentially harmful effects of these anomalies can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on teacher attitudes {{and responses to}} inclusion has focused predominantly on the pedagogical challenges posed by {{students with disabilities in}} regular classrooms. The special education literature has been slow to recognise the significance of the impact of student diversity on the work of teachers and the reality that classrooms are populated with children who, while they may not have a <b>recognised</b> <b>disability,</b> nevertheless have a wide variety of special educational needs. This paper reports the findings of a study of the relative inclusive education challenges posed to primary teachers of a diverse group of students. Teachers were presented with 14 case descriptions of students in the form of vignettes. The students depicted where characterised has having special needs associated with such factors as disability, cultural background, dysfunctional family background, emotional/psychiatric condition, socio-economic disadvantage, mobility, homelessness etc. The teachers were asked to rate the students depicted in the vignettes on the level of difficulty they would have in providing an inclusive education for them and to identify what specific characteristics or attributes of the students they would find most challenging. This paper reports the findings of this survey and discusses the implications of the findings for both pre-service and in-service professional developmen...|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{categories}} of imposed and intrinsic relevances developed by Alfred Schutz, {{as well as}} on affirmative model definitions of impairment and disability, this article develops an argument proposing the usefulness of disability identity. Disability is not just about what people with impairments are prevented from doing and being, but about what they are required to do and be instead. Whether this involves taking on roles as passive recipients of others’ benevolence or involvement in demonstrations of the unimportance of impairment, either way negates the lived experience of impairment and signifies the desirability of normality. It is suggested that embracing rather than attempting to disassociate the impaired self from <b>disability</b> identity – <b>recognising</b> <b>disability</b> as oppression and absurdity and resolving to face this - enables this self to claim impairment as valid and ordinary human experience and to resist the invalidating requirements of the disabled role...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 9 th Nov. 2017. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} study was to understand and evaluate the effect of different factors including age, gender, disabilities and medical conditions on joint mobility. Joint mobility data {{from a group of}} 66 people from a previously existing database has been re-analysed. Twenty four participants had disabilities and 42 participants were considered to be ‘able bodied’ with no <b>recognised</b> <b>disability.</b> For each individual, 18 joint range of motion values were measured and an ANOVA test was employed to demonstrate the influence of the selected factors on joint range of motion. Post Hoc (Tukey) tests were also performed to gain deeper insight into significance levels and correlations between the factors. The results clearly indicate that joint ROM significantly decreases (p< 0. 05) with increasing age for arm abduction, arm medial and lateral rotation, wrist flexion and wrist adduction. Moreover, people with disabilities (wheelchair users and arthritis sufferers) showed a considerable decrease in joint mobility for arm flexion, arm abduction, arm lateral rotation, elbow flexion, elbow supination, wrist extension and wrist flexion. The results also highlight that designing products, equipment, services or workplaces against 5 th and 95 th percentile criteria is unable to provide appropriate and necessary support for achieving the objective of design inclusiveness. Rather designers should have a deep insight of the data variations at a predesign phase so that more appropriate and informed design decisions can be made that {{are more likely to be}} acceptable for a broad range of the population...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{legislation}} {{may have}} progressed internationally and nationally for disabled people, barriers continue to exist, of {{which one of}} the most pervasive and ingrained is attitudinal. Social attitudes are often rooted in a lack of knowledge and are perpetuated through erroneous stereotypes, and ultimately these legal and policy changes are ineffectual without a corresponding attitudinal change. This unique book provides a much needed, multifaceted exploration of changing social attitudes toward disability. Adopting a tripartite approach to examining disability, the book looks at historical, cultural, and education studies, broadly conceived, in order to provide a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach to the documentation and endorsement of changing social attitudes toward disability. Written by a selection of established and emerging scholars in the field, the book aims to break down some of the unhelpful boundaries between disciplines so that <b>disability</b> is <b>recognised</b> as an issue for all of us across all aspects of society, and to encourage readers to <b>recognise</b> <b>disability</b> in all its forms and within all its contexts. This truly multidimensional approach to changing social attitudes will be important reading for students and researchers of disability from education, cultural and disability studies, and all those interested in the questions and issues surrounding attitudes toward disability...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that 3. 4 % of university students in Finland have a diagnosed or observed illness or disability that affects their learning at the university level. The University of Jyväskylä Language Centre embarked on an organised, ongoing research and intervention project to enable appropriate teaching practices to suit the needs of all students. The process, thus far, has shown {{there is a need to}} clarify the rights and obligations of students and teachers to enable an atmosphere of mutual trust. A survey of the Language Centre teachers showed that all had taught students with disabilities during their university careers. Teachers wanted more information about disabilities, such as how to <b>recognise</b> <b>disabilities</b> if they have not been diagnosed or if students are not forthcoming with the information. Most importantly, they wanted to know the extent of their obligations as university teachers. Students also needed guidelines. They wanted to know if they could trust that their teachers would take them seriously or if disclosure of their disabilities would cause more difficulties. To date, university students and staff have been involved in the development of two websites, one for teachers and one for students, to clarify key areas for appropriate information and maximum suitability...|$|R

In 2004 the revised Disability Discrimination Act signified the end of the domination of art based on discrimination {{politics in}} the disability arts movement. A new generation of disabled people were less political and carried an agenda of integration. This combined with the carers movement highlighted a change in attitude that acknowledged the work of the disability arts movement to claim the term [...] "disability art" [...] but showed a movement away from the idea that only disabled people could make disability art.

40|$|Many {{readers of}} DCIDJ would {{be aware of}} the ongoing {{interest}} in, and activities aimed at, the revision of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015. In many countries, discussions are currently under way regarding the goals set almost 15 years ago, the outcomes achieved in that time, and the form that future goals should take. Readers would also be aware that disability concerns were largely excluded from the planning, structure and details of the original MDGs. It is clear that many international agencies, donors, governments and other development stakeholders did not <b>recognise</b> <b>disability</b> as a cross-cutting issue at that time, and gave its role low priority within the sphere of international development. It is encouraging to observe that this situation will not be repeated. A number of key international agencies, NGOs, and coalitions within the disability and development sphere are actively seeking to participate in the formulation of the new goals. It is to be hoped that these agencies will state the view that any current or future MDGs will not be achieved unless there is a sustained and comprehensive response to the needs of people with disabilities, their families and communities. They are likely to emphasise the clear link between poverty and disability, and that poverty reduction and development in general will not be achieved unless the rights and priorities of people with disabilities are addressed. Over the past decade, the importance of inclusive development is another issue that has been recognised in the field of disability and development. Indeed, the name of this Journal reflects the growing understanding that the active and comprehensive inclusion of people with disabilities and disability concerns, into mainstream development programmes, is vital. My concern is that these two priorities may increasingly become confused. I am aware of a few instances where discussion regarding post- 2015 MDGs has focused almost entirely on inclusive development. It appears that since the existing MDGs were so disappointingly exclusive of disability in development, many are of the view that our primary aim should be to establish disability inclusive development...|$|R

40|$|Disability {{and poverty}} are related: {{there is a}} higher risk of {{disabled}} people becoming poor and of poor people becoming disabled. Although this relationship is <b>recognised</b> within <b>disability</b> scholarship, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence particularly in the context of Latin America. Taking data from five Latin American Countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico), this study tests the hypothesis that households with disabled members have higher levels of poverty compared with other households. Two research designs were used: a small-N comparative variable-oriented design using most-different cases; and a cross sectional design. Secondary data analysis revealed that households with disabled members have higher levels of poverty using direct and indirect measures (e. g. income; subjective and multidimensional indices) compared with other households and that this held true across the five countries studied. The findings from this research have salience for policy makers internationally. The most important policy implication is that disabled people and their families need to be explicitly included in poverty reduction strategies and their extra needs should be recognised within these policies. Mitigating the risk of poverty for disabled people should be a universal policy goal. ...|$|R

40|$|With its {{spread of}} {{chapters}} covering key issues across {{the life cycle}} this text has established itself as the foundational primer for those studying the lived experiences of people with learning disabilities and their families, and outcomes achieved through services and support systems. <b>Recognising</b> learning <b>disability</b> as a lifelong disability, this accessible book is structured around the life cycle. The second edition is refreshed and expanded to include seven new chapters, covering: Aetiology, Breaking news (about disability) and early intervention, Transition to adulthood, The sexual lives of women, Employment, Personalisation, People with hidden identities. With contributions from respected figures {{from a range of}} disciplines, the book draws heavily upon multidisciplinary perspectives and is based on the latest research and evidence for practice. The text is informed by medical, social and legal models of learning disability, exploring how "learning disability" is produced, reproduced and understood. Extensive use is made of real-life case studies, designed to bring theory, values, policy and practice to life. Narrative chapters describe, in the words of people with learning disabilities themselves, their lives and aspirations. They helpfully show readers the kinds of roles played by families, advocates and services in supporting people with learning disabilities. New exercises and questions have been added to encourage discussion and reflection on practice. Learning Disability is core reading for students entering health and social care professions to work with people with learning disabilities. It is a compelling reference text for practitioners as it squarely addresses the challenges facing people with learning disability, their loved ones and the people supporting them...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{universities}} {{have been involved}} in developing new strategies to promote widening participation in higher education, and consequently they have been focusing on increasing the variety of support offered to students with disabilities for a more inclusive and widely accessible learning environment.

Such is still the case with dyslexia, a learning difference (term chosen here by the authors to describe a difficulty in the cognitive processing of information), which unlike most physical disabilities, is not always identified and therefore addressed with appropriate dyslexia-friendly learning materials and approaches. Furthermore, the staggering growth in the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education raises questions about how the new technologies can support an inclusive learning approach.

40|$|This policy audit {{examines}} the cultural, {{political and economic}} spheres in China {{from the perspective of}} people with disabilities. Through a series of case studies we argue that the heteronormative assumptions that underpin disability policies do not recognise the sexual desires and sexual needs of people with disabilities. Therefore, laws, families and society at large treat sexual behaviours among people with disabilities as abnormal, and the disabled as people who need to be arrested, invisible and even criminalised. Not only do the current laws and regulations fail to <b>recognise</b> people with <b>disabilities</b> as sexual beings and as having sexual needs, they also give power to guardians to have complete authority to control the sexuality of people with disabilities, {{all in the name of}} care, responsibility and law. These omissions in law result in lack of sex education, services and opportunities for people with disabilities, and leave little space for them to fulfil their sexual needs and desires, but too many chances to get infected with sexually transmitted diseases and/or HIV, and experience sexual frustration and devastation.

40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis considered the usefulness of measures of phonological awareness and rapid naming in predicting (i) future literacy skills, (ii) differences between those with and those without literacy deficits, and (iii) gains in literacy following remediation. Two longitudinal studies measured changes in the literacy-related skills of 100 children from reception class and year 1 through to year 2 SATs assessments. These studies indicated that rapid naming measures were a reliable predictor of future literacy amongst these cohorts, particularly when administered to beginning readers in comparison to pre-readers. Measures of temporal auditory processing, short-term memory and letter knowledge also presented as reliable predictors of future literacy skills. However, measures of phonological awareness, particularly an understanding of rhyme, did not predict variability in future literacy skills above that predicted by other screening measures. Two cross-sectional studies found evidence for measures of verbal fluency (particularly those that required processing {{at the level of}} the phoneme) and rapid naming (particularly of numeric stimuli) to differentiate between those with diagnosed literacy deficits and chronological-age matched controls across an age range that covered most of the compulsory education years. Two intervention studies, however, found little evidence for group interventions in phonological processing and rapid naming to improve literacy skills in those at risk of literacy deficits and those with <b>recognised</b> literacy <b>disabilities.</b> Overall, the findings inform educational practice in terms of potential screening measures that may be used to identify children at risk of literacy difficulties, indicating that some currently used measures may need to be modified for use across a wide age range of learners and proposing that measures of rapid naming may be usefully included in early screening procedures. Additionally, the research identifies the need for more specificity in theoretical models of literacy deficits that incorporate phonological awareness and rapid naming...|$|R
40|$|Initiatives that {{recognise}} {{diversity within}} {{the student population}} and understand the range of learner variation {{have been found to}} help institutions to better recognise and reduce barriers to learning for disabled people. This paper describes the development of a ???digital story??? designed to inform all students about the disability support services offered by the University of Hertfordshire. The development and utilisation of a digital story to inform students about disability related issues and services was also designed to foster a more informed and tolerant learning community. The findings of the pilot evaluation study have highlighted the digital story to have increased student understandings of what is <b>recognised</b> as a <b>disability.</b> It was also found to have increased the likelihood of them approaching their disabled student???s coordinator. However, it is notable that a majority of students expressed a desire for an in person talk on disability services. It is concluded that although technology is not necessarily a replacement for the ???personal touch???, new methods should be found to increase the personal feel of the digital story.

40|$|Overview In August, the Special Rapporteur on {{the rights}} of person with disabilities released a Questionnaire focused on “the right of persons with disabilities to {{participation}} in decision-making” – that is, decision making at a legislative, policy or organisational level, through consultation, engagement and involvement, either directly or through representative organisations. <b>Disability</b> organisations are <b>recognised</b> in the National <b>Disability</b> Strategy as “essential in promoting the rights of people with disability”.   Despite the UN Committee recommending (in their Concluding Observations in 2013) that Australia “take initiatives to increase the resources available for independent organisations of persons with disabilities” the scarce amount of funding allocated for representative organisations has beensubstantially reduced by the Federal Australian government. Independent advocacy, including self-advocacytraining, is crucial to ensuring all people with disabilities can actively contribute to and participate in decision making processes, yet continues to be grossly underfunded. There has also been a failure to incorporate the perspectives of people with disabilities through their appointment within government and in other leadership positions. In this Reply to the Special Rapporteur Advocacy for Inclusion underlined the need for governments to commit to leadership and decision making by people with disabilities, including through the commitment of resources. Until this commitment is made disabled people’s representative and advocacy organisations will continue to be called upon to retrofit and adjust policies and program development with their scarce resources. While some improvements have been made, they exist due to ad hoc processes. There is no current systemic commitment to ensure consistent and meaningful engagement and representation in line with the expectations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In 2002, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence {{concluded}} that the multiple sclerosis (MS) disease modifying therapies; interferon-β and glatiramer acetate, were not cost effective over the short term but <b>recognised</b> that reducing <b>disability</b> over the longer term might dramatically improve the cost effectiveness. The UK Risk-sharing Scheme (RSS) was established to ensure cost-effective provision by prospectively collecting disability-related data from UK-treated patients with MS and comparing findings to a natural history (untreated) cohort. However, deficiencies {{were found in the}} originally selected untreated cohort and the resulting analytical approach. This study aims to identify a more suitable natural history cohort and to develop a robust analytical approach using the new cohort. DESIGN: The Scientific Advisory Group, recommended the British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis (BCMS) database, Canada, as providing a more suitable natural history comparator cohort. Transition probabilities were derived and different Markov models (discrete and continuous) with and without baseline covariates were applied. SETTING: MS clinics in Canada and the UK. PARTICIPANTS: From the BCMS database, 898 'untreated' patients with MS considered eligible for drug treatment based on the UK's Association of British Neurologists criteria. OUTCOME MEASURE: The predicted Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was collected and assessed for goodness of fit when compared with actual outcome. RESULTS: The BCMS untreated cohort contributed 7335 EDSS scores over a median 6. 4 years (6357 EDSS 'transitions' recorded at consecutive visits) during the period 1980 - 1995. A continuous Markov model with 'onset age' as a binary covariate was deemed the most suitable model for future RSS analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A new untreated MS cohort from British Columbia has been selected and will be modelled using a continuous Markov model with onset age as a baseline covariate. This approach will now be applied to the treated UK RSS MS cohort for future price adjustment calculations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} public attitudes towards the sexuality {{of people with}} learning disabilities within a UK residing sample, and compare such attitudes between people from White Western and South Asian backgrounds. A mixed-method approach using an online questionnaire was employed. Three-hundred and thirty-one UK residing adults were recruited. Participants provided demographic details, completed five attitudes towards sexuality scales, in addition to measures of recognition and prior contact of {{a person with a}} mild learning disability. One of the sexual attitudes scales measured attitudes towards sexual openness in the typically developing men or women. The other four measured attitudes towards the sexuality of men or women with learning disabilities. These included four different aspects of sexuality (sexual rights, non-reproductive sexual behaviour, parenting and self-control). Participants completed either a male or female version of these scales. One open-ended question that asked about the sexuality of either men or women with learning disabilities was also included and responses to this question were analysed via a thematic analysis. Mean scores indicated that compared to White Westerners, South Asians had significantly more negative attitudes towards the sexual openness {{of men and women in}} the developing population and also towards the sexual rights of men and women with learning disabilities. Recognition was found to be poor in both ethnic groups, although White Westerners were found to be significantly more likely to be able to <b>recognise</b> mild learning <b>disabilities</b> compared to South Asians. These findings implicate the need to develop culturally sensitive interventions in improving knowledge and awareness of learning disabilities in addition to being aware of the differences in attitudes towards the sexuality of people with learning disabilities that may exist between different ethnic groups.

As it attempts to shed light on the educational and professional training needs in autistic persons, the study presented in the article takes account of the fact that autism, on the one hand, {{is an important part of}} an autistic person’s identity, and on the other, a concealed form of his or her disability. The study presented in the article used qualitative study methods and was carried out on a group of 20 autistic adults with either a moderate or a high <b>recognised</b> level of <b>disability.</b> It utilised both one-to-one and panel interviews, which overall amounted to around 40 hours of interviews and were carried out with the participants in the Project PI-PWP Edu – Autyzm nr WND-POKL. 07. 02. 02 - 12 - 022 / 11 following the recruitment process conducted by the Wspólnota Nadziei Foundation.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{range of}} principles and actions that the Australia Council has committed to over the next triennium to ensure people with disabilities have equal {{opportunity to participate in}} and contribute to the arts. Goals Our plan focuses on the following three goals: 	Leadership There are some strong leaders with disability who work within the arts and disability, Disability Arts and Deaf Arts spaces. The Australia Council acknowledge current leaders and will provide further opportunities and encouragement to people with disability to fulfill their potential as future leaders, to contribute both within and beyond the arts and disability sector. The Australia Council aspires to be a leader in the area of disability, arts and accessibility practices. We appreciate diversity and acknowledge the value of the representation of people with disability in leadership positions, across our workforce, governance and in our stakeholder groups. We are committed to removing barriers that people with disability face when accessing opportunities. We aim to be an example of good practice for other organisations to follow in terms of how we engage with people with disability and benefit from their expertise. 	Accessibility People with disability have rights to equal access and the Australia Council is committed to improving access across all areas of our organisation. As we embark on a significant period of change across our organisation, this is an opportune time to consider accessibility in the re-design of our funding structures, systems and processes, building space, human resources and communications approach. Over the next three years, we will be particularly focused on improving the following forms of access: physical, intellectual, attitudinal and communications. 	Arts Practice Australia is proud of our <b>recognised</b> artists with <b>disability</b> who are regularly invited to perform on the world stage. Our artists and companies are acknowledged locally, nationally and internationally as leaders in both the arts and disability fields across {{a range of}} different areas of artform practice. We are conscious of the different types of disability arts practices and how disability may influence work. The artistic resources, cultural capital and potential of artists with disability need to be fostered and unleashed to further contribute to Australia 2 ̆ 7 s cultural narrative. We aim to assist in doing this by increasing access to funding opportunities and awareness raising through promotion and advocacy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of potentially reversible locomotor disabilities in elderly subjects and the cost effectiveness of providing aids for daily living. DESIGN [...] Population based randomised controlled trial of subjects aged {{greater than or equal}} to 85 living independently in an inner London borough. SETTING [...] 21 Electoral wards of the London Borough of Hackney. SUBJECTS [...] 1255 Subjects aged {{greater than or equal to}} 85 living in their own home whose names were obtained from general practitioner lists and cross checked against the electoral register, 511 of whom were subsequently found to be ineligible. Of the 744 remaining, those with disability on screening were randomised and allocated to an intervention group (36) or a control group (43), in which intervention was postponed until four weeks, after the follow up assessment. Subjects with aids supplied previously were excluded from the intervention phase. INTERVENTIONS [...] Provision of raised toilet seat, teapot tipper, tap turner, shoe horn and elastic laces, and double handled saucepan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Degree of difficulty (grades 1 - 4) with specific tasks (getting on and off a toilet, pouring from a teapot into a cup, turning taps on and off, carrying a saucepan of standard weight, and putting on shoes) and time taken to perform them. RESULTS [...] 545 (73 %) Of the 744 eligible subjects assessed; 428 had no disability and 118 had difficulty with at least one task. Some had had their <b>disability</b> <b>recognised</b> before the study and already had aids, representing half of those with difficulty getting on and off the toilet but 24 % for putting on shoes and 13 % for pouring from a teapot and turning on a tap. The mean number of difficulties was similar between the groups (intervention group 1. 7, control group 1. 6). Time taken to complete the tasks corresponded with the observed grade of difficulty. All aids were associated with reduced difficulty according to observer assessment (% improvement intervention group v control group: raised toilet seat, 71 v 13 teapot tipper 100 v 33; tap turner 100 v 0; saucepan 88 v 0; shoe horn 50 v 13) and time taken to complete the tasks. A cost benefit analysis of this screening-intervention programme suggested a total cost of 32 pounds per individual benefit. CONCLUSIONS [...] Appreciable degrees of unrecognised locomotor disability are detected on screening of very elderly people living independently. Providing aids offers a feasible and cost effective means of improving function in such people...|$|R
40|$|Lay people’s {{understanding}} about a health condition and {{their perceptions of}} the condition can have far reaching consequences. Where ignorance, and misinformed beliefs about the condition or its causes prevail this may lead to stigma, prejudice and discrimination, and can have negative consequences for help seeking. These processes have been extensively studied in relation to mental illness, particularly schizophrenia and depression. In contrast, in the intellectual disability field empirical investigations have largely concentrated on the study of explicit attitudes. While the primary aim of this thesis was to increase our understanding of lay conceptualisations of intellectual disability and their consequences for stigma associated with intellectual disability, throughout comparisons are drawn with lay responses to schizophrenia to identify generic and disorder specific processes and to relate the findings to a larger body of evidence. A new measure, the Intellectual Disability Literacy Scale (IDLS), was developed. This assesses knowledge, beliefs about causes of, suitable interventions for, and social distance towards an individual presenting with symptoms of intellectual disability. It allows comparison with lay conceptualisations of schizophrenia, using diagnostically unlabelled vignettes. A large scale UK general population survey was conducted using the IDLS and the Community Living Attitude Scale-Intellectual Disability version (Henry, Keys, Balcazar & Jopp, 1996 a). Responses by 1002 lay people of working age were examined to assess the relationships between awareness, inclusion attitudes and social distance. Causal and intervention beliefs of 1752 lay people and the association between causal beliefs and social distance were investigated. The sample was ethnically and religiously diverse and close attention was paid throughout to participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, with a particular focus on the role of contact, ethnicity and religion. The findings indicate that awareness of intellectual disability and schizophrenia among the UK public is relatively low. When presented with an unlabelled vignette 28 % of lay people <b>recognised</b> intellectual <b>disability.</b> Recognition of schizophrenia was at a similar level, with 24 % identifying the condition in an unlabelled vignette and a further 44 % making reference to mental illness in general or to another psychiatric diagnosis. Awareness of both conditions was lower among participants from ethnic minorities. Contact with people with intellectual disability/ mental health problems was the strongest predictor of lay people’s ability to recognise the two conditions. There was support for the view that people with intellectual disabilities have similar life goals as people without disabilities and should not be segregated from society, but support for empowerment, i. e. choice and self-advocacy, was weaker. Correlations between inclusion attitudes and social distance were significant but modest. Social distance was lower for intellectual disability than for schizophrenia, but views on social contact with an individual with mild intellectual disability were no more than ambivalent. Lay people were most likely to endorse environmental causes for the intellectual disability vignette and biomedical and adversity causes for the schizophrenia one. Recognition of the condition was associated with reduced social distance, increased endorsement of biomedical causes and reduced endorsement of supernatural causes for both intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Belief in supernatural causes, which were associated with increased social distance, was low overall but more common among specific sections of the public, including people with low educational attainments, those who viewed religion as important in their lives, and Muslims. Expert help was much less likely to be recommended for intellectual disability than for schizophrenia. Beliefs about suitable sources of help showed fairly close correspondence with participants’ causal beliefs. Lay people who recognised the symptoms were more likely to favour expert help, and less likely to endorse lifestyle or religious/ spiritual help. Familiarity with someone with intellectual disability or mental illness did not influence causal beliefs, but was associated with endorsement of expert help. Overall the findings suggest that many of the relationships between awareness, causal beliefs, social distance, contact and socio-demographic factors are common to intellectual disability and schizophrenia, but vary in strength, while some are disorder specific. The findings indicate that people with intellectual disability or mental illness from ethnic minority backgrounds not only face racial discrimination and poorer access to appropriate assessment and treatment, but the additional challenge of increased stigma and lack of understanding among their own cultural communities. Raising awareness and tackling stigmatising attitudes and beliefs at general population level should go hand in hand. Public education and anti-stigma interventions that target certain sections of society in particular seem indicated...|$|R
40|$|People with {{long-term}} disabilities {{have become increasingly}} frustrated with the inadequate support services provided by the disability sector. In particular, people {{with long-term}} disabilities want to have support services which met their needs as well as greater choice and control in the decisions around them. Over {{the last five years}} the popularity of self-directed funding has increased significantly. In 2011 / 12 the Australian Government made a commitment to implement a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) as advised through an inquiry by the Productivity Commission to have full rollout country wide by 2018. Self-directed funding is used as a mechanism to promote self-determination and empowerment in people with long-term disabilities and to facilitate their living in the community independently. Self-directed funding can be provided by an individual package held by a provider, by an individual budget held by the person to spend through providers or by direct payments to spend on the open market. The implementation of self-directed funding models has been implemented in various forms {{over the past couple of}} decades, including the piloting of small scale programs and the introduction of larger scale programs by government bodies or departments in specific disability groups.   Self-directed funding models are strongly established in the UK, USA and Western Australia. The inclusion of infrastructure supports such as independent brokers, financial intermediaries and ongoing support for clients are beneficial features of established models, particularly for people with complex needs. Despite their popularity, there is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of self-directed funding models in practice, and no evidence comparing different models.  No single model has been demonstrated to be superior to another, likely in part because the cultural and political context in which a scheme is introduced has a strong influence on its design, implementation and outcomes. Despite this, there are consistent indications that offering flexible and creative options within models is the best approach for ensuring people with more complex and potentially unmet needs, have an opportunity to take up self-directed funding successfully. There are limited studies of the feasibility and impact of self-directed funding for people in the compensable sector with catastrophic injuries. Qualitative studies using interviews or questionnaires reveal that, generally, people with long-term <b>disabilities</b> <b>recognise</b> that self-directed funding should be one option among the range of options for receiving necessary support services; however, there is variability in the stated willingness to take on self-directed funding themselves. A lack of awareness of what is involved in self-directed funding and how it can be managed has been reported. In addition, it has been suggested that not all people have the skills, education or experience to manage self-directed funding, hence training and information sessions that are understandable and comprehensive are likely to be necessary in order to encourage uptake.   This NTRI Forum aims to consider the factors which influence the uptake of self-directed funding by the long-term disabled. Two questions were identified for deliberation in a Stakeholder Dialogue: 1. What are the barriers and facilitators to optimal implementation and uptake of self- directed funding in Australia and New Zealand? 2. How can knowledge of barriers and facilitators be used to address these challenges...|$|R
40|$|This study {{traces the}} {{development}} of social policy in New Zealand for people with learning disabilities. The study examines the social influences and the outcomes of past social policies which have shaped {{the development of}} an increasingly explicit social policy for disabled people. Integral to this analysis is a consideration of the impact of these policies upon the family. This study suggests that social policy, in establishing services which have moved people with learning disabilities progressively towards independence, has required a concomitant role of the family that has increasingly involved them in the lives of their dependants. Social policy for people whose learning capacity is impaired reflects society's movement towards an understanding of the condition as a "learning disability" 1. 1 The terms that recognise an impairment in intellectual functioning are subject to ongoing debate amongst the disabled community. Since this thesis was commenced, the term "intellectual disability" has returned to use alongside "learning disability". The term "intellectual disability" reflects disabled people's intent to have their <b>disability</b> <b>recognised</b> as a valid part of self. The term "learning disability" arises out of the notion of difference, which includes such 'otherness' as impaired intellectual functioning, within its continuum. The term "learning difficulty" extends this continuum further. The forms which recognise an impairment in Intellectual functioning have moved to increasingly positive modes, removing the stigma associated with other labels such as "mentally retarded". The study examines the changes in societal perceptions of learning disabled people which been fundamental in the construction of social policy, partnering changes in philosophies of care that in turn have shaped the nature of service delivery. Notions of deviancy. sickness, difference and partnership underpinned the development of social policy, as it related to people with learning disabilities, from the 1840 s. Services to people with learning disabilities have been delivered by both the State and the voluntary sector. The study contrasts the role of the State as a major service provider through the health, education and welfare sectors with the role established by voluntary agencies. A discussion of the development of service provision to people with learning disabilities provides an understanding of the changing relationship between the State and voluntary sectors. Ideologies of 'welfare' underpinned the provision of services through the period of this study and were themselves influenced by the wider political and economic environment. Laissez-faire ideologies in the settlement period of the nineteenth century, fabian socialism in the 1930 s and libertarian ideologies in the 1980 s are discussed as they relate to the formation of social policy for people with learning disabilities. The State's changing role in providing for the welfare needs of its citizens, including those with learning disabilities, is discussed against this background. The outcomes of past policies have been a major influence in the development of current social policy. Current policies are likely in their own turn to influence the nature of future social policy and services to those with learning disabilities. Some consideration is given to the implications they might hold for families who have dependants with learning disabilities, and for people with learning disabilities themselves...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{strategies and}} treatments found {{to help in}} addressing the {{harmful use of alcohol}} in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Foreword The consumption of alcohol at high risk levels is a national issue, however, the focus of this inquiry is the harmful use of alcohol in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Many reports and studies have recommended stemming the flow of alcohol to address the problems, but usually these works do not analyse why a person drinks at levels which cause them and their loved ones harm. The social and economic determinants of harmful alcohol use such as unemployment, poor housing, racism, trauma, poor education and peer pressure mean that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are overly impacted by the harm caused by alcohol consumed at high levels. A recent Amnesty reports note that it costs $ 440, 000 per year to keep one young person in detention in Australia. This report recommends that justice reinvestment strategies should redirect these resources to overcoming the deprivation and despair in so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This report addresses strategies and treatments found to help in addressing the harmful use of alcohol. Community led solutions are always the key to uptake and success. Unfortunately slow government processes, for example approving community produced alcohol management plans and the short length of project funding often frustrates community initiatives. The magnitude of the problem caused by high risk consumption of alcohol is often hidden by the lack of collection of useful data for example at the time of hospital admissions, when children are put into out of home care because of their neglect, when people are incarcerated because of alcohol related crime and when children are born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) at some of the highest rates in the world. The committee found examples of the world’s best practice at places like Groote Eylandt and Fitzroy Crossing. These communities, led by women’s initiatives, have demonstrated courage and determination to tackle alcohol harm to provide a safe environment for their families and community. The committee commends them and hopes that their strategies can be used as examples of a way forward for other communities. FASD or FAS is creating generations of children whose brain damage will reduce their potential to live lives full of promise and well-being. The rates of FAS and FASD in some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia are amongst {{the highest in the world}} and yet FAS and FASD are not <b>recognised</b> as a <b>disability</b> for many social security allowances and payments. The lack of knowledge about, and recognition of FASD and FAS extends beyond the failure to have it officially recognised for social security and NDIS purposes, it also needs to be understood in schools, the criminal justice system and in the health sector. The committee found that impacts of alcohol on children in communities represents a national tragedy as it is manifested in children growing up with fathers, and increasingly mothers, who are incarcerated, as the children’s abuse and neglect leads to the need for out of home care at record levels, missed schooling and too often ultimately become young alcohol addicts or abusers of other illicit substances. This committee urges adoption of these recommendations as a matter of urgency given the extent of harm and intergenerational afflictions when alcohol is consumed at such high risk levels...|$|R
