40|$|ITER is {{designed}} as an experimental tokamak fusion reactor {{in which the}} conditions for controlled fusion reactions will be created and maintained. The confinement {{and control of the}} reacting plasma is performed by superconducting magnets. Insulation faults are regarded from the ITER International Team as the most probable cause of fusion magnet failure. Considering the difficulties involved in the replacement of a toroidal field coil in the ITER magnet system and the different problems occurring during high voltage tests <b>of</b> the <b>ITER</b> model coils further improvements in several aspects of high voltage technology for the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ITER</b> magnets are indispensable. One of these aspects is the consideration of the transient electrical behaviour because {{it is well known that}} fast changes of voltages (e. g. lightning and switching impulses) may cause a non linear voltage distribution on the coil turns and possibly excite resonances within a large coil. Such high voltage stress can cause local overloading and irreversible destruction of the insulation system. This report presents the calculation of the terminal voltages within the ITER TF coil system and the voltage stress of the three insulation types (ground, radial plate and conductor insulation) within an individual ITER TF coil for the fast discharge and two fault cases. An electrical network model for the ITER TF coil is developed and simulated with the code PSpice. The internal inductances and capacitances as well as the capacitances to ground for the establishment of this network model are determined. Skin and proximity effect as well as the damping caused by eddy currents in the stainless steel radial plates, in which the conductor is embedded, are calculated by the FEM code Maxwell. For the complete TF circuit, composed of 18 TF coils and 9 fast discharge units, an additional network model is set up and implemented with the code PSpice. Due to the large size <b>of</b> the individual <b>ITER</b> TF magnets the resonance frequency is lower than for the TF model coil. It was also determined that the three types of insulation within a single TF coil are stressed with a nonlinear voltage distribution under a fast discharge condition. The non linear voltage distribution is enhanced in case of fast excitations applied in consequence of ground faults. Therefore the test voltages have to be defined in consideration of the stresses caused by fast discharges and realistic fault cases to ensure a reliable operation during the foreseen ITER lifetime. Proposals for the high voltage test procedures will be discussed based on the calculated voltage stress and the experiences gained during the ITER TF Model Coil test. Several acceptance criteria are suggested and recommendations are added to avoid unacceptable stress during the high voltage tests. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract The current {{situation}} and possible future developments for nuclear power—including fission and fusion processes—is presented. The fission nuclear power {{continues to be}} {{an essential part of the}} low-carbon electricity generation in the world for decades to come. There are breakthrough possibilities in the development of new generation nuclear reactors where the life-time of the nuclear waste can be reduced to some hundreds of years instead of the present time-scales of hundred thousand of years. Research on the fourth generation reactors is needed for the <b>realisation</b> <b>of</b> this development. For the fast nuclear reactors, a substantial research and development effort is required in many fields—from material sciences to safety demonstration—to attain the envisaged goals. Fusion provides a long-term vision for an efficient energy production. The fusion option for a nuclear reactor for efficient production of electricity has been set out in a focussed European programme including the international project <b>of</b> <b>ITER</b> after which a fusion electricity DEMO reactor is envisaged...|$|R
25|$|Supporters <b>of</b> <b>ITER</b> {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions <b>of</b> <b>ITER</b> and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>ITER</b> is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas. Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.|$|R
