A DNA library for any protein or small peptide of interest can be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis followed by PCR amplification. Usually, each member of this DNA library has a T7 RNA polymerase transcription site and a <b>ribosomal</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> at the 5’ end. The T7 promoter region allows large-scale in vitro T7 transcription to transcribe the DNA library into an mRNA library, which provides templates for the in vitro translation reaction later. The <b>ribosomal</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> in the 5’-untranslated region (5’ UTR) is designed according to the in vitro translation system to be used. There are two popular commercially available in vitro translation systems. One is E.

The amino-terminal end of the deduced protein sequence is similar to signal peptides described for other bacterial secretory proteins.

50|$|Attenuation is a {{regulatory}} feature found throughout Archaea and Bacteria causing premature termination of transcription. Attenuators are 5'-cis acting regulatory regions which fold {{into one of}} two alternative RNA structures which determine the success of transcription. The folding is modulated by a sensing mechanism producing either a Rho-independent terminator, resulting in interrupted transcription and a non-functional RNA product; or an anti-terminator structure, resulting in a functional RNA transcript. There are now many equivalent examples where the translation, not transcription, is terminated by sequestering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (<b>ribosomal</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site)</b> in a hairpin-loop structure. While not meeting the previous definition of (transcriptional) attenuation, these are now considered to be variants of the same phenomena and are included in this article. Attenuation is an ancient regulatory system, prevalent in many bacterial species providing fast and sensitive regulation of gene operons and is commonly used to repress genes {{in the presence of}} their own product (or a downstream metabolite).|$|E

Fusion proteins of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) with ribosomal proteins were expressed in S. cerevisae to produce in vivo recombinant ribosomes which have a ribonuclease tethered to specific sites.
