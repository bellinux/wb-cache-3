40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the following question: when should contract law permit parties to discontinue performance under a private security contract aimed to combat piracy? Piracy has been 2 ̆ 7 {{on the rise}} 2 ̆ 7 off Somalia and in East Asia, with serious attacks escalating. Some shipping companies have responded by drafting 2 ̆ 7 best management practices 2 ̆ 7, hiring security companies to advise on countering the threat and hiring armed or unarmed security protection. After presenting representative factual situations involving pirate attacks, the Article describes the traditional approach to defining the obligations of parties and the performance issues that arise during contractual performance. This approach takes into account interpretation through reasonable expectations, trade usage and public policy and would deny a party the right to excuse the failure of performance in instances where the particular risk might be categorized as foreseeable or is expressly or impliedly allocated to the contracting party. An excuse approach does not necessarily give the parties guidance as to when security forces onboard a ship attacked by pirates should not attempt to fulfill contractual obligations, perhaps because performance may escalate the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> of both parties due to the particular acts of the pirates. This uncertainty of obligation may lead to escalation {{of the dangers of}} piracy necessitating increased use of force or depriving a contracting party of a needed contractual out, leaving the non-performing security provider in breach. After describing and critiquing efforts to combat piracy, the Article provides a contractual analysis {{of the relationship between the}} private parties, shipper and security company. It then proposes a approach to the problem of performance that anticipates use of force - one that would hold parties to the security contracts in most circumstances where the response to piracy is likely to be effective, but would allow and perhaps encourage cessation of performance in situations that require a governmental response such that private ordering for use of force is less appropriate, could result in escalation with the pirates or could increase <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> or non-pirate third parties. Employing a comparison to domestic robbery, an interpretative approach that favors non resistance when pirates actually board should be not only permitted but encouraged where the risk associated with combating piracy requires a more governmental response and, therefore, responsibility should remain with the Government or international community as a whole.

40|$|Although {{hexachlorobutadiene}} (HCBD) {{was recently}} proposed {{as a candidate}} persistent organic pollutant (POP) under the Stockholm Convention, information about its environmental levels and distributions is still very limited. In this work, HCBD was determined in the sewage sludge from 37 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 23 cities and 17 soils near a chemical plant in China. Three chlorobenzenes (CBs) (1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene, and hexachlorobenzene) were simultaneously studied to help better understand the environmental behavior of HCBD. Concentrations of HCBD in sludge samples ranged from < 0. 03 to 74. 3 ng/g dry weight (dw) with a median value of 0. 30 ng/g dw, which was {{lower than those of}} the three CBs. Levels of HCBD were not correlated with capacity of the WWTPs and total organic sample within the plant, with a rapid decreasing concentration trend with the increase of distance from the plant. It was suspected that releasing as a byproduct during manufacturing of chlorinated chemicals was the primary source of HCBD in the studied location.

The introduction and maintenance of sun protective control measures in line with occupational hazard controls including: a. Engineering controls such as providing shade; b. Administrative controls such as rescheduling outdoor work tasks and using the SunSmart UV Alert * to inform workers when to use sun protection; and c. Personal protective equipment such as the provision and use of sun protective work clothing, sun protective hats, SPF 30 + sunscreen and sunglasses. 3. Providing education and training for all outdoor employees, safety officers, health and safety representatives, supervisors and managers to create awareness on how to work safely in the sun and encourage workers to examine their own skin. 4. Documenting the sun protection program, including control measures, in a written policy. Employers and employees should work together to develop this policy, which should include a process to monitor compliance. *The SunSmart UV Alert is based on the Global Solar UV Index, a rating system adopted from the World Health Organisation 1. It indicates the amount of solar UVR reaching the earth’s surface. The higher the number, the greater the potential for skin damage. The Bureau of Meteorology issues the SunSmart UV Alert when the UV Index is forecast to reach 3 or above. At 3 and above the level of solar UVR is strong enough to damage the skin, so workers need to use sun protection. Note: This statement is a summary of key sun protection information for workplaces.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{increasing}} unfunded pension liabilities {{of state and}} local governments has drawn increasing attentions in the last few years, especially after the 2008 stock market downturn. To maintain sustainability many state and local governments have put public pension reform {{at the top of their}} priority list. Previous research and practices provide two strategies to reform the current pension systems: Incremental changes to amend the existing defined benefit plans (DB plans), and the pension model switch from the DB model to defined contribution plans (DC plans). This study aims to uncover reform strategies to cope for public pension systems. It first examined the appropriateness of the incremental reform strategies by identifying the determinants of the financial solvency of DB plans, utilizing the existing panel data of 151 local DB plans in Florida municipalities. Second, it gathered the primary data through the surveys and interviews with the Finance and HR directors in Florida local governments to analyze their perceptions of public pension reform and reveal their readiness to conduct the public pension paradigm switch. These approaches revealed the critical interperiod equity issue along with the impact of the two-tier benefit structure during the recent pension reform. The results suggest that incremental reform strategies that reduce benefits and increase contributions are not effective in improving the financial solvency of public DB plans. The alternative reform approach—the DB-to-DC transition—is attractive to local governments because it will relieve the employer of the pension cost burden and transfer the investment <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> themselves. The transition is also politically palatable because the taxpayer sentiment is not supportive of what are perceived to be generous retirement benefit of public employees. Meanwhile, local governments are hesitant to implement the paradigm switch due to prohibitive transition costs, political pressure, and perhaps more importantly, the potential negative impacts to public recruitment and retention. Local officials do not perceive a reduction of morale with the two-tier benefit structure at the present time; they believe this issue will solve itself along the retirement of senior employees...|$|E
40|$|HIV/Aids {{is one of}} {{the largest}} risks facing Africa today. The disease has spread at a rapid rate {{throughout}} the continent and South Africa in particular. To date it remains an epidemic without any cure. It is systematically destroying the economic progress made over centuries. HIV/Aids is most prevalent in the economically active groups in South African society and could ultimately change the demographic, social and economic landscape in South Africa. Business is taking up the challenge and response strategies are being developed and implemented to contain and mitigate the risks posed by the disease. Stakeholders have a direct interest in being kept informed on both the risks and the responses to the disease. As such, information pertaining to HIV/Aids should be disclosed in the annual report of a company, and such information should be useful, relevant, reliable and comparable. HIV/Aids disclosure is currently voluntary and adheres to the characteristics of social accounting. Social accounting aims to inform beyond the traditional financial aspects and is increasing as stakeholders demand more information from reporting entities for decision-making purposes. In South Africa, a number of developments have increased the prominence of voluntary HIV/Aids disclosure in annual reports. These include the Second King Report on Corporate Governance, the Global Reporting Initiative’s proposals for HIV/Aids disclosure in South Africa and a joint disclosure project between the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants and the JSE Securities Exchange. This study investigates current practices related to HIV/Aids disclosure in an attempt to develop a framework for future disclosure practices through thematic content analysis. The study covered a six-year period from 1998 to 2003. The annual reports of all listed South African companies on the JSE Securities Exchange were investigated for that period. The study found that there was an increase in disclosure related to HIV/Aids over the period under review, but that by the end of 2003, still fewer than half of all JSE-listed companies disclosed HIV/Aids information. An upward trend in disclosure was identified, and it is expected that the number of reporting entities will continue to increase. The information disclosed varied considerably between the disclosing entities. This dilutes the usefulness and comparability of HIV/Aids information for stakeholders. Valuable information was obtained as to preferential themes and data related to HIV/Aids that are disclosed voluntarily in annual reports. The study concludes with a recommended framework based on the literature review and the results of the empirical study. The framework proposes minimum disclosure content focusing on two main risks, namely the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> and the South African community and the associated responses by the company. The framework also proposes the disclosure of current and future costs and losses related to HIV/Aids, where such information exists. The proposed framework aims to find a balance between the normative and the descriptive in HIV/Aids disclosure, and proposes that fewer issues be disclosed, thereby focusing on specific issues that will enable consistency and comparability in HIV/Aids disclosure practices.

40|$|Pensions are {{intricately}} {{linked to}} employees’ well-being {{in the latter}} part of their life and during their working life in that they provide a sense of financial security in retirement. Since the 1980 s, pension schemes have changed both in concept and detail with significant consequences for beneficiaries. This paper explores one of the major changes: the migration from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) pension schemes focusing on this change's interface with accounting. In exploring this shift from DB to DC schemes, the paper uses a critical perspective to reflect on this interface including how the change is accounted for in corporate reporting narrative. The key focus is on issues of political economy: it is found in this respect that while wealth is effectively distributed from pension holders efforts are made to legitimise or displace attention from pension changes. An analysis of narratives of corporate annual reports is undertaken to critically explore corporate communication to stakeholders vis-à-vis pension scheme changes. Findings suggest limited and problematic engagement with employees as per the corporate annual report narrative. We also point to a lack of appetite on the part of existing <b>employees</b> <b>to</b> engage employers on these changes. The change is framed to give workers an impression that they are taking responsibility for their future whilst an alternative view is that in actuality the organisation is decoupling from pension responsibility and devolving associated <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> for greater profitability.

40|$|Background: European Union Directive  2013 / 35 /UE {{provides}} for the implementation of EU regulations into national legislation. Our aim is to assess actual health hazards from radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF EMF) (range: 100  kHz –  300  GHz) and indicate workplaces with the highest <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>employee</b> health. Material and Methods: Data from measurements of RF EMF performed by the Laboratory of Electromagnetic Hazards in Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (Łódź, Poland) were analyzed. The analysis covered the results of electric field intensity (E) for over  450  selected items. The ranges of protection zones {{and the extent to}} which maximum admissible intensity (MAI) values were also analyzed. The determinations and measurements of EMF in the work environment met the requirements of Polish Standard, while Polish regulations on the MAI values were used as the criterion for the assessment of the exposure. Results: The highest values of E field intensity at workplaces were measured for: electrosurgery, to  400  V/m, and short-wave diathermy units, to  220  V/m, dielectric welders to  240  V/m, within the FM radio antenna systems, to  180  V/m. The widest protection zones were noted for prototype research instruments, short-wave diathermy units, and dielectric welders. The most excessive (up to  12 -fold MAI) values were recorded for dielectric welders, short-wave diathermy units (up to  11 -fold) and microwave diathermy units (up to  8 -fold). Conclusions: Our results have confirmed the high RF EMF values for physiotherapists, operators of dielectric welders, and mast maintenance workers in radio communication facilities (especially radio and TV broadcasting stations).

The question of what constituted 'reasonable' depended on the particular circumstances of the employee, but included factors such as any <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> the <b>employee's</b> health or safety, the hours worked by the employee in the previous four weeks, the notice given by the employer of the requirement to work the additional hours, and the notice given by the employee of the refusal to work those hours, and the operational requirements of the business.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether a}} welfare reform policy intended to empower disabled persons by moving them from dependency on welfare {{benefits to the}} independence of employment may instead exacerbate social exclusion. It argues that potential conflicts between employers' responsibilities under health and safety law and a duty of non-discrimination introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 must be resolved if this outcome is to be avoided. An interpretation of statutory duties to reconcile health and safety protectionism with a principle of non-discrimination for disabled persons is examined. The analysis suggests that protectionism {{gives rise to a}} potential for paternalistic decision-making on the part of employers who may refuse <b>to</b> accept residual <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> <b>employees</b> 'in their own best interests' or those of others. The standard of acceptable risk as evolved within the context of health and safety law is analysed, and found to allow paternalistic protectionism and commercial interest <b>to</b> override an <b>employee's</b> autonomous choice <b>to</b> accept <b>risk,</b> even where acceptance offers a disabled person the only opportunity to work. The article argues that this is inappropriate in the newly created context of non-discrimination and proposes development of the concept of reasonable practicability within which a standard of acceptable risk resides. An autonomy model of reasonable practicability is advocated as a mechanism for recognising the interests of all parties affected by decisions on the acceptability health and safety risk. Although the focus is primarily on persons who meet the definition of disability given in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, many other people who fall outside it face exclusion from work on the grounds of health and safety risk. The article concludes that adoption of an autonomy model of reasonable practicability plays a necessary part in ending the social exclusion faced by all persons, disabled and non-disabled, who attempt to enter the workplace only to find their access barred by the seemingly insurmountable barriers of health and safety <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> themselves or others...|$|R

In 2011, there were 99. 491 incidents or on average 414 work accidents cases per day. In 2010 there were 98. 711 work accidents, 96. 314 cases in 2009, 94. 736 cases in 2008 and 83. 714 cases in 2007. This reserch is intended to asses the possible major risk of Occupational Health and Safety for The Ciputra World Jakarta building Project, and offer solutions to deal with any unexpected risk. This research was conducted with a descriptive and qualitative method. Survey was carried out to get opinions from respondents on Occupational Health & Safety risks during the construction of the Ciputra World Jakarta. There are Seventy eight (78) high risks were identified with the most being Tower Crane operation job, installation of steel column, beam, and wall with 5 risks. The 2 extreme risks were found in column casting and screeding exterior wall with 1 risk. Suggestion given is to organise training relation to Occupational Health and Safety <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> every <b>employee,</b> introduve shift system, allocate alternate day off <b>to</b> <b>employees,</b> provide health/medical check up, and eliminate high risk and dengerous work environment. </p...|$|R
