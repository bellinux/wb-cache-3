25|$|While Napoleon was stalled {{by having}} to cross the Marne, Blücher planned to launch Yorck and Kaptzevich across the Ourcq at Crouy. Yorck found the Crouy bridge {{destroyed}} so he marched north to cross at Fulaines. Sacken was drawn into a noisy skirmish at Lizy and unable to lend support. Finding that his plans were not being carried out, at 6:00 pm Blücher ordered Kaptzevich to force a crossing at Gesvres. Despite being opposed by Doumerc's cavalry, the Russian corps commander pushed his leading elements onto the west bank. Marmont swiftly brought up his infantry and, after a stiff fight, overran Kaptzevich's small bridgehead, capturing 280–300 Russians. Kleist's attack also failed, leaving {{both sides in the}} same position as before. That night Poret de Morvan's division marched into the French camp accompanied by the <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> 48 guns and loud cheers. Despite their great numerical advantage, the morale of the Allied soldiers sank.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the Velvet Underground's {{production}} and the direct approach of punk rock band Ramones, the miking scheme for the drum kit included only three microphones: one above it, one for the bass drum, {{and one in the}} corner of the studio. It was crafted to capture [...] "a compressed, explosive sound". On Moretti's advice, the transfer from the two loud guitars and the <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> the bass picked up by the drum-kit microphones was not eliminated. The guitars were recorded more simply; Hammond and Valensi both used Fender DeVille amps on opposite sides of the room, while Raphael positioned a mic on each. The sound was then fed directly into a preamp with no equalization. Valensi commented that guitar teacher and mentor Bowersock was invaluable because he was articulating things to the producer that the group could not. While the rest of the Strokes played to a click track, Casablancas sang through a small Peavey practice amp to retain a sense of low fidelity on the album. Raphael mixed as he went along to maintain control of the record until the final mastering stage; the producer aimed to show the Strokes a final product as soon as the band finished performing a track.|$|E
2500|$|Following this, {{he picked}} up a {{unanimous}} decision win over Igor Mihaljević at a show in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina on October 29.

2500|$|Criticism of Sămănătorist traditionalism and its {{presence}} in various contexts was also voiced in later years. In one such case, historian Mihai Sorin Rădulescu argued that such tendencies had {{made their way into}} Romanian museology: [...] "the Museum of the Romanian Peasant [...] and the Village Museum both show Romanians in accordance with Semănătorist tradition". In a 2007 article critical of Romania's educational policy, textbook author Dumitriţa Stoica described as an anachronism the presence of topics on Sămănătorism within the standard baccalaureate examination, noting that such subjects had already been stripped from the regular curriculum. In his 2008 book Iluziile literaturii române ("Illusions in Romanian Literature"), literary historian and theorist Eugen Negrici linked the perpetuation of neo-Sămănătorist guidelines with another nationalist current, Protochronism, discussing them as equally negative phenomena: [...] "Even though I feel no pleasure, I must admit that the ideological-literary movements of a Sămănătorist and Protochronist type appear to be durable, being strictly motivated by the ways in which Romanian society has evolved. They stand for both the protective impulse and the compensatory one [...] At the first sign of a major peril, we shall be hearing the magmatic <b>rumble</b> <b>of</b> myths rising up again from the deep".|$|E
