25|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
25|$|Electronic devices {{operated}} by infrared <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> can interpret the infrared light emitted by CFLs as a signal; this may limit {{the use of}} CFLs near televisions, <b>radios,</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> or mobile phones. Energy Star certified CFLs must meet FCC standards, and so are required to list all known incompatibilities on the package.|$|R

25|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> system {{commonly}} has two parts: transmit and receive. The transmitter part {{is divided}} into two parts, the RF <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> and the transmitter module. This allows the transmitter module {{to be used as a}} component in a larger application. The transmitter module is small, but users must have detailed knowledge to use it; combined with the RF <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> it is much simpler to use.|$|R
50|$|The first two-way <b>radio</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> {{utilized}} {{a harness}} of wires extending speaker, microphone, and controls for options such as channel selection or CTCSS switches. This limited a base station to being within tens {{to hundreds of}} feet from the user's workstation. Early systems often had volume unit meters, clocks, and switchboard keys.|$|R
