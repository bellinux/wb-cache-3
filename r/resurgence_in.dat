5|$|As of the {{election}} of Vincent Schoemehl as the city's youngest mayor ever in 1981, St. Louis's problems were more significant than many other rustbelt cities. Several major development projects incomplete and the city's economic base crumbling. However, Schoemehl developed two projects early in his three terms in office that assisted St. Louis: Operation Brightside provided city beautification through plantings and graffiti cleanup. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address crime, known as Operation SafeStreet, which blocked access to certain through streets and provided low-cost security measures to homeowners. Crime declined starting in 1984, and despite a small <b>resurgence</b> <b>in</b> 1989, continued to decline through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Cope {{had little}} formal {{scientific}} training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular {{trips to the}} American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often {{as a member of}} United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a <b>resurgence</b> <b>in</b> his career {{toward the end of his}} life before dying on April 12, 1897.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this <b>resurgence</b> <b>in</b> appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E

He was a popular figure; besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent, witty, and intelligent man, using satire to comment on the nation's past, present, and future. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has always been considered as much more than a mere entertainer. Stańczyk's fame and legend were strong in his own time and enjoyed a <b>resurgence</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century, and he remains well-known to this day.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s saw a <b>resurgence</b> <b>in</b> {{the use of}} {{livestock}} guardian dogs {{and the development of}} new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
