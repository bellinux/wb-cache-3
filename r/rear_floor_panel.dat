40|$|Raised access <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these raised access <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the raised access <b>floor</b> <b>panel’s</b> mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre filled epoxy of <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software. A material weight reduction of the glass fibre filled epoxy <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> was achieved by optimised design of the panes using an evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method and the introduction of panel ribs. The lighter weight of new raised <b>floors</b> <b>panel</b> would {{have a significant impact on}} the loadings of buildings foundation and allow architects to reduce the carbon footprint of a building resulting in reduced construction costs. In addition, a reduction in the weight of the new raised access <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> would reduce the transportation costs of the panels...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} natural {{frequency}} and damping coefficient of Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) composite <b>flooring</b> <b>panel</b> system. The PSSDB composite <b>flooring</b> <b>panel</b> consists of dry board {{attached to the}} top surface of profiled steel sheet by self-drilling and self-tapping screws. This PSSDB composite panel has been used successfully as flooring system in few construction projects within Malaysia. As a lightweight flooring system, human induced vibration is becoming increasingly vital serviceability and safety issues for such panel when it is covering relatively longer span or area. Therefore, {{it is important to}} evaluate the factors affecting the serviceability performance and hence, to consider the effects of vibration in building such flooring system. This research is focused mainly on the fundamental frequency and damping coefficient of such <b>floor</b> <b>panel.</b> The influence of span length, board thickness, and connectors spacing on fundamental frequency are evaluated. It is shown that for the panels considered in this paper; up to the span length of 3. 5 m the fundamental frequency is above the limiting minimum value of 8 Hz and hence, it can be concluded that such composite <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> with practical span length will be comfortable to the occupants of building in terms of human induced vibration...|$|R
40|$|Previously, the Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board System (PSSDB) {{which is}} made up of its {{components}} of profiled steel sheeting, dry boards and screw connectors are brought separately to the site, pre-arranged and fitted together to form units in a building structure. However, {{to meet the needs of}} the Industrialised Building System (IBS) in full, the PSSDB system must be developed into a prefabricated system. The goal of this research is to develop the PSSDB system as prefabricated <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> system installed at site that meets the characteristics of a more comprehensive IBS construction. The objective of this research is firstly; to develop a more robust <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> system, secondly, to investigate and get the stiffness characteristics of the PSSDB <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> connector screws; thirdly; to develop a finite element model to predict the stiffness and produce the design guidelines of PSSDB <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> and lastly; to develop the PSSDB prefabricated floor system practically.

Heat treatment of tubes after weld overlay process is shown to be beneficial, since tubes develop a compressive axial stress at the tube fireside crown after welding with membrane to make the <b>floor</b> <b>panels.</b> A localized temperature excursion at the tube crown can cause the axial stress to become tensile, although cracks forming on the fireside surface would still stop before reaching the tube inside surface. Tensile axial stress in the membrane may cause cracks that have formed on the top surface to proceed past the interface through the carbon steel.

The reinforced concrete {{was attached to the}} CLT panels with interface connections, and different types of interface connections were tested. Throughout this project, there are 31 tests with composite CLT <b>floor</b> <b>panels.</b> Described in this report are: • Eight 2 ft. by 10 ft. 8 inch composite <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> with different interface shear connections. All these 2 ft. by 10 ft. 8 inch panels were tested to failure in positive bending moment under simply-supported conditions. • Three 8 ft. by 8 ft. composite <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> with inclined self-tapping screws. The panels were tested to estimate the initial stiffness in strong and weak axis bending, under positive and negative bending moments. In addition, two-way bending flexural (warping) stiffness values were obtained from testing results. Lastly, the <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> were tested to failure under weak-axis direction, positive moment bending, and in strong and weak axis bending under negative moment bending. • One 37. 5 ft. long by 8 ft. test specimen with inclined self-tapping screws was tested to failure. • One 20 ft. by 4 ft. specimen and one 13. 5 ft. by 4 ft. specimen under positive and negative bending moment, respectively, tested under creep loading. These tests aided in the determination of effective stiffness values {{that can be used for}} design of <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> that have a total thickness of 9 inches, including a 2 - 1 / 4 inch concrete lamina, over a five-ply CLT panel. In addition, estimates of failure loads and moments presented in this thesis provide information needed for future structural designs of the CLT concrete composite floor systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{sandwich}} {{materials in}} automobile body panels is investigated in this study. In the first part, floor, luggage, firewall and rear wheel panels {{of a car}} body-in-white are replaced with panels made of sandwich materials {{in order to reduce}} the weight. Final sandwich material configurations are obtained through a trial and error based optimization approach where weights of the panels are minimized while keeping bending stiffness performances of the panels same. In the second part, the use of sandwich materials in laminated steel form as light weight alternatives to free layer surface damping treatments attached to <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> is investigated. Free layer damping treatments are applied to body panels to decrease primarily the structure-borne noise inside the cabin. This effect is achieved by increasing structural damping in the panel structures. It has been demonstrated that, same level of vibration damping increase in a <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> can be achieved using a sandwich material in laminated steel form with a lesser amount of weight addition to the original sheet metal <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> compared to a free layer surface damping treatment...|$|R
