5|$|All <b>runways</b> {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are <b>runways</b> 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of parallel <b>runways</b> was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. <b>Runways</b> 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The <b>runways</b> were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep <b>runways</b> free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the <b>runways</b> instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.|$|E
5|$|Note: Prior to 1941, the <b>runways</b> did {{not have}} {{numerical}} designations. The runway now designated 13C/31C was designated 13R/31L from 1941 until 1989, when a new Runway 13R/31L was built. <b>Runways</b> 27L, 27R, 36L and 36R were closed by 1973.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a single}} <b>runway,</b> {{designated}} 09/27. <b>Runway</b> 09 is the eastbound take-off <b>runway</b> and <b>runway</b> 27 the westbound. The landing distance available LDA in both directions 09/27 is 1463m. The take-off <b>runway</b> available TORA on <b>runway</b> 09 is 1463m. However, on <b>runway</b> 27 only, the take-off <b>runway</b> available TORA is 1583m.|$|R
50|$|The airport has {{a single}} <b>runway,</b> <b>runway</b> 18/36. Previously, the airport had an {{additional}} <b>runway,</b> <b>runway</b> 15/33. This <b>runway</b> is currently closed and unusable.|$|R
5000|$|At 61 m {{above sea}} level, the airport has two runways: <b>Runway</b> 1 {{measures}} 3350 m {{in length and}} <b>Runway</b> 2 measures 1260 m in length. <b>Runway</b> 1 {{is also known as}} <b>Runway</b> 03/21, while <b>Runway</b> 2 is also known as <b>Runway</b> 15/33. <b>Runway</b> 1 is equipped with an ILS (Instrument Landing System).|$|R
5|$|With {{a history}} {{stretching}} {{to the time}} following World War I, Roanoke Regional Airport has evolved {{from a pair of}} dirt <b>runways</b> and a single hangar to a fully equipped, modern airport serving multiple commercial airlines. Today the airport features a terminal building completed in 1989, a pair of asphalt <b>runways,</b> and a control tower completed in 2005 that serves the residents of the greater Roanoke Valley.|$|E
5|$|The diagram on the February 1951 Coast & Geodetic Survey instrument-approach chart shows <b>runways</b> 006/186 3550ft long, 052/232 4400ft, 096/276 4500ft, and 127/307 5030ft.|$|E
5|$|Airport <b>runways</b> {{are also}} de-iced by {{sprayers}} fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are {{wide enough to}} cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
50|$|The December 1951 C&GS chart shows 5497-ft <b>runway</b> 3, 3801-ft <b>runway</b> 8, 5652-ft <b>runway</b> 12 and 5100-ft <b>runway</b> 17.|$|R
50|$|<b>Runway</b> 3-21 is {{equipped}} with medium intensity <b>runway</b> edge lighting. Both <b>runway</b> ends have <b>runway</b> end identifier lights. <b>Runway</b> 21 {{is equipped}} with precision approach path indicators, having replaced the older VASIs.|$|R

5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced <b>runways,</b> full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level <b>runways</b> are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass <b>runways</b> with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples. They do not feature on OS maps, and are owned by private clubs or, more commonly, individuals.|$|E
5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four <b>runways</b> remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Avinor sees {{a problem}} in getting new {{aircraft}} {{of the size of}} the Dash 8-100 (39 seats) which can use the 800 meter <b>runways,</b> so they plan to use smaller planes with 19 seats when the Dash 8-100 retire.|$|E
25|$|The February 1953 C diagram shows <b>runway</b> 7 (4301ft), <b>runway</b> 13 (6201ft) and <b>runway</b> 18 (5202ft). On June 1, 1954 <b>Runway</b> 7/25 was closed; it {{was later}} removed to allow {{terminal}} expansion. Love Field then had two runways: <b>Runway</b> 13/31, the main <b>runway,</b> and the shorter 18/36.|$|R
50|$|<b>Runway</b> 09/27 was {{the primary}} {{commercial}} <b>runway</b> for aircraft in the 1950s and early 1960s. The <b>runway</b> was deactivated after <b>runway</b> 05/23 was constructed and activated in 1964. In the mid-1970s, <b>runway</b> 09/27 was rehabilitated, repaved and reactivated as <b>runway</b> 08/26 with 3,800 ft (length) by 100 ft (width) {{to function as a}} secondary <b>runway</b> and taxiway. <b>Runway</b> 08/26 is widely used today by air taxi operators flying to Apia (Fagali'i and Faleolo), Ofu or Tau.|$|R
50|$|NAIA has {{a primary}} <b>runway</b> that is 3737 m long running at 061°/241° (designated as <b>Runway</b> 06/24), and a {{secondary}} <b>runway</b> that is 2367 m long, running at 136°/316° (designated as <b>Runway</b> 13/31). The primary <b>runway</b> was oriented at 06/24 {{in order to}} harness the Southeast and Southwest winds. <b>Runway</b> 13/31 is the <b>runway</b> of a former USAF base known today as Villamor Air Base. On May 26, 2012, The <b>Runway</b> 06/24 was partially closed for {{the replacement of the}} threshold lightning system on the end of <b>Runway</b> 06. The <b>Runway</b> 13/31 was closed to give way for its renovation/expansion and reopened on May 29, 2013. The <b>runway</b> upgraded its length from 1900 m to 2367 m. Out of the 550 planes that fly on NAIA daily, 100 of them take the secondary <b>runway.</b> It mostly caters small private planes and acts as the main <b>runway</b> of the NAIA Terminal 4.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the size}} and layout of its <b>runways,</b> the airport has been rated among the top ten {{airports}} {{within a couple of}} hours of Andrews Air Force Base for training pilots in the 89th Operations Group. This group is responsible for piloting Air Force One as the Special Air Mission fleet for the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing <b>runways</b> could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both <b>runways</b> for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar {{was used to}} test the aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised <b>runways</b> might be the only <b>runways</b> left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.|$|E
50|$|The February 1953 C&GS diagram shows <b>runway</b> 7 (4301 ft), <b>runway</b> 13 (6201 ft) and <b>runway</b> 18 (5202 ft). On June 1, 1954 <b>Runway</b> 7/25 was closed; it {{was later}} removed to allow {{terminal}} expansion. Love Field then had two runways: <b>Runway</b> 13/31, the main <b>runway,</b> and the shorter 18/36.|$|R
25|$|Airlines usually use <b>Runway</b> 11L. In {{occasional}} trade winds, commercial airliners use <b>Runway</b> 29R, {{and even}} rarer, with south winds, <b>Runway</b> 21. <b>Runway</b> 11R-29L is too narrow for most commercial jet aircraft, {{but they can}} use <b>Runway</b> 3.|$|R
50|$|<b>Runway</b> 4-22 is Forks Municipal Airport's sole <b>runway.</b> This <b>runway</b> is 2400 ft long, 75 ft wide, is {{equipped}} with medium intensity <b>runway</b> lighting, and has an asphalt surface. Approaches to both ends of this <b>runway</b> are visual.|$|R
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of the}} transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's <b>runways,</b> destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two <b>runways</b> to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.|$|E
5|$|The 79th Rescue Squadron {{operates}} the HC-130J Combat King II and provides combat rescue forces to theater commanders worldwide. It conducts helicopter air refueling, airdrop, and landing of pararescue personnel on unimproved <b>runways,</b> {{and equipment to}} recover combat personnel. Its crews fly low-level operations and perform these missions day or night.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} with triangular <b>runways</b> in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden <b>runways.</b> It {{was taken over by}} the NoRAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. It opened in 1963 and was largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Scandinavian Airlines operated out of the airport to the other primary airports in Finnmark and to Tromsø and Oslo. The runway was extended in 1968. From 1990, flights were taken over by SAS Commuter and the direct flights to Oslo were halted. From the mid-1990s there have been occasional charter flights out of Banak. Widerøe took over SAS' services in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Tower {{personnel}} {{observed the}} flight approach <b>Runway</b> 18 {{from the north}} in a shallow descent that visibly steepened near the approach end of the <b>runway.</b> The flight continued airborne just above the <b>runway</b> until the intersection of <b>Runway</b> 18 with the east-west <b>runway</b> (now removed) where it touched down with only 1,500 feet (457 m) of <b>runway</b> remaining. As {{it became obvious that}} the flight was going to continue off the <b>runway,</b> tower personnel notified rescuers who immediately responded to <b>Runway</b> 18.|$|R
5|$|<b>Runway</b> 8/26 on Blue Grass Airport {{was closed}} on March 2009, {{and the new}} 4000 foot <b>runway,</b> <b>runway</b> 9/27, opened on August 4, 2010. This <b>runway</b> has been built on a {{separate}} location not connected to the <b>runway</b> 22.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 {{a second}} east-west <b>runway,</b> 26L/8R, was built, necessitating {{the removal of}} the old NE-SW <b>runway</b> 4/22. Remnants of the 4/22 <b>runway</b> are visible in the present-day taxiways. With the {{completion}} of the new <b>runway,</b> the existing <b>runway</b> 25/7 became 26R/8L. In 1985, the city of Los Angeles acquired Ontario International Airport outright from the city of Ontario. In 1987, <b>Runway</b> 26R/8L was extended to the east to bring the two <b>runway</b> thresholds side by side, so aircraft would be higher over neighborhoods. 26R/8L became the main departing <b>runway</b> and 26L/8R the main arrival <b>runway.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was first}} built with triangular <b>runways</b> in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden <b>runways.</b> Banak {{was taken over by}} the RNoAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. Plans for re-opening emerged in 1955, but uncertainty regarding its value in a war caused a prolonged debate about financing. The air station was largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and was opened on 4 May 1963, along with a civilian terminal. During the Cold War, Norway did not allow allies peacetime use of the airfield. The runway was extended in 1968 and the 330 Squadron was established in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mission of}} the 96th was {{patching}} Jackson Drome's <b>runways</b> after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. This would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, {{which had to be}} compacted, rolled and re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the <b>runways</b> that could cause punctures and blowouts in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each bombing raid.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} voalavo probably largely {{lives on}} the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which it moves using <b>runways</b> and natural tunnels. The species is nocturnal (active during the night), is solitary, probably eats fruits and seeds, and bears up to three young per litter.|$|E
50|$|The August 1955 diagram shows <b>Runway</b> 17 4480 ft {{along the}} west side of the field, <b>Runway</b> 18 5071 ft, <b>Runway</b> 4 5422 ft, <b>Runway</b> 10R 5313 ft (still called 10R, though 10L was closed) and <b>Runway</b> 13 5568 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport was}} {{commissioned}} by the FAA in July 1964 with a 3000 ft primary <b>runway</b> (<b>Runway</b> 13-31) and a 2100 ft turf <b>runway</b> (<b>Runway</b> 4-22).|$|R
50|$|The former <b>runway</b> {{was closed}} several year later {{after the opening}} of 03/21. The <b>runway</b> is not {{numbered}} as per International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards but it {{is parallel to the}} main <b>runway.</b> The <b>runway</b> has been marked with several white crosses to inform landing aircraft that the <b>runway</b> is no longer operational. The <b>runway</b> is still however used by the general aviation and military aircraft for taxing to the main <b>runway.</b>|$|R
