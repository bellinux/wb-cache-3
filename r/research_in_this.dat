5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, much of the <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of <b>research.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period concerned models of animal decision-making.|$|E
5|$|His {{expertise}} {{resulted in}} his being invited by Charles Close, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey (OS), to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer. Accepting the position, Crawford moved to Southampton and began {{work at the}} project in October 1920. His arrival at the OS generated some resentment, with co-workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant. His job entailed correcting and updating information about archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised, and involved him undertaking much fieldwork, travelling across the British landscape to check the location of previously recorded sites and discover new ones. He began in Gloucestershire in late 1920, visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map. Based on his <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region, in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, Moser sought to clarify the taxonomic {{identity}} of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. Moser, working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world. Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{primitive}} matriarchal religions, which {{derived from the}} work of the Swiss lawyer Johann Jakob Bachofen, was popular in Gardner's day, both among academics (e.g., Erich Neumann, Margaret Murray) and amateurs (e.g. Robert Graves).

Matriarchal interpretations of the archaeological record and the criticism of such work continue to be matters of academic debate. Some academics carry on <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area (such as the 2003 World Congress on Matriarchal Studies).
