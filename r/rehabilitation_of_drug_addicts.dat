This was to include the college Department of Hotel Technology's hotel training school, a working hotel where students could gain practical experience. Although the foreshore and the eastern slope of Clarence Hill were to be designated a botanical and biological preserve, the campus plan was protested by the Admiralty House Park Association, which included local residents, and by the organisations already based on the property. The protests were ultimately successful as the hotel training school, originally titled Stonington Beach, was instead placed on the South Shore in Paget (the main campus of the college was situated separately at the former Prospect Camp, until moving to the same site in Paget in the 1990s).

40|$|Pcychoactive drug {{addiction}} treatment and rehabilitation programmes world wide are facing with the difficulty of successfully treating and rehabilitating drug dependents because this rate of success is very much determined by the rate of slips, lapse and relapse (recidivism). The success rate for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> dependent ranges from 50 to 70 percents, and specifically,in the case of Malaysia,around 60 %. Popular current treatment modalities have been employed in Malaysia since 1983, namely detoxification, physical, pyschososial and psychological treatment via various modes such as full time in-house treatment schedules (the serenti programme),therapeutic community,and the out-patient programmes. The only modality being excluded or being practiced is the methadone maintainance programme and other similar treatment procedures using substitute mood altering agents. However, another treatment approach which has been neglected by research is the traditional modality such as the homeopathy approach, the religious (Islamic-spiritual) method and other spiritual approaches, since the number <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> being rehabilitated at these centres are small, and where approaches and procedures differ greatly from one centre to the next.

40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> individuals exhibit impaired performance on executive function tests but {{a few studies have}} been conducted on executive functions <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in Iran. To contribute to this understanding, the present study was designed to assess some domains related to executive functions including cognitive flexibility, attention and speed of mental processing in a sample <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in comparison with a sample of non-drug addicts. Methods: 155 male addicts between 25 to 35 years of age were selected from outpatient addiction clinics in Karaj, Iran. This group consisted of 3 subgroups of opium (n= 40), hydrochloride heroin (n= 63), and methamphetamine (n= 52) addicts. A control group was selected matching the <b>drug</b> <b>addicts</b> in gender, age, education and scio-economic status and included 130 healthy non-drug taking males. A battery of standardized executive function tests including the Color trail making test, Stroop color word test, and Symbol digit modalities test were administered. Data analysis was conducted by performing Co-variance (MANCOVA) in SPSS. v. 16. 0. Results: The study findings indicated that the group <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects performed significantly worse compared with the controls on all executive measures. There were also significant differences among the 3 subgroups. The hydrochloride group had the worst performance compared the methamphetamine and opium groups respectively. <b>Drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with longer duration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction were much worse on all measures in comparison with <b>drug</b> <b>addicted</b> subjects with shorter duration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction.
