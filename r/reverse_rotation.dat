To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air-conditioning) and new [...] "direct air" [...] heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan. A large, green-painted <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> version of the standard GM Frigidaire air conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of angular {{spectrum}} representation, the reversed propagation dynamics of Laguerre-Gaussian beam in left-handed materials (LHMs) is presented. We show that negative phase velocity {{gives rise to a}} reversed screw of wave-front, and ultimately leads to a <b>reversed</b> <b>rotation</b> of optical vortex. Furthermore, negative Gouy-phase shift causes an inverse spiral of Poynting vector. It is found that the Laguerre-Gaussian beam in LHMs will present the same propagation characteristics as the counterpart with opposite topological charges in regular right-handed materials (RHMs). The momentum conservation theorem insures that the tangential component of the wave momentum at the RHM-LHM boundary is conserved. It is shown that although the linear momentum reverses its direction, the angular momentum remains unchanged. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|The wagon-wheel effect (alternatively, stagecoach-wheel effect, {{stroboscopic}} effect) is {{an optical}} illusion {{in which a}} spoked wheel appears to rotate differently from its true rotation.

50|$|By {{increasing}} the temperature to 20 °C these methyl groups convert back exothermally to the (P,P) cis axial groups (3) in a helix inversion. Because the axial isomer is {{more stable than}} the equatorial isomer, <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> is blocked. A second photoisomerization converts (P,P) cis 3 into (M,M) trans 4, again with accompanying formation of sterically unfavorable equatorial methyl groups. A thermal isomerization process at 60 °C closes the 360° cycle back to the axial positions.|$|E
50|$|Pair lifts {{are mostly}} overhead, rotational, and require ice coverage, i.e. to travel a {{distance}} across the ice.

Optional features to increase one's score include performing a difficult entry or dismount, a release to one hand, changes of position during the lift, stopping the rotation, turning a carry lift into rotational one, or <b>reversing</b> <b>rotation</b> (i.e. both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions).|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} jet fan {{which has a}} single stage rotor was proposed.

5000|$|Mu-negative media (MNG) {{display a}} {{positive}} εr [...] and negative µr. Gyrotropic or gyromagnetic materials exhibit this characteristic. A gyrotropic material {{is one that}} has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field, enabling a magneto-optic effect. A magneto-optic effect is a phenomenon in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through such a medium. In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not {{to be confused with the}} nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with <b>reversed</b> <b>rotation</b> directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers.|$|R
50|$|The hand-crank {{method was}} {{commonly}} used to start engines, but it was inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous. The behavior of an engine during starting is not always predictable. The engine can kick back, causing sudden <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation.</b> Many manual starters included a one-directional slip or release provision so that once engine rotation began, the starter would disengage from the engine. In {{the event of a}} kickback, the <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> of the engine could suddenly engage the starter, causing the crank to unexpectedly and violently jerk, possibly injuring the operator. For cord-wound starters, a kickback could pull the operator towards the engine or machine, or swing the starter cord and handle at high speed around the starter pulley. Even though cranks had an overrun mechanism, when the engine started, the crank could begin to spin along with the crankshaft and potentially strike the person cranking the engine. Additionally, care had to be taken to retard the spark in order to prevent backfiring; with an advanced spark setting, the engine could kick back (run in reverse), pulling the crank with it, because the overrun safety mechanism works in one direction only.|$|E

50|$|If {{the glass}} is cooled quickly {{in the absence of}} a strong light source by putting ice on the glass or placing it in the freezer with the door almost closed, it turns {{backwards}} (i.e. the silver sides trail). This demonstrates black-body radiation from the black sides of the vanes rather than black-body absorption. The wheel turns backwards because the net exchange of heat between the black sides and the environment initially cools the black sides faster than the white sides.
