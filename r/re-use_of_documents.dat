40|$|Digital Libraries {{have been}} the subject of more than a decade of {{attention}} by researchers anddevelopers, and yet in all this time the implementations have not matched the promises. By far the majority ofsystems have concentrated on content and provided limited or basic functions for users. In this article weoffer a new look at what can be expected from a digital library system based on contemporary developmentsin Information and Communications Systems and Technology. First, we sketch out the basic functions whichare provided to support finding and accessing material by a reader. Next we explain some extended functionswhich support the use and <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> - links and annotations – and the need to support learners inaddition to readers and writers. Finally, we present our visions for a modern digital library and e-Learningportal system which includes for example intelligent and conceptual search support including resultsvisualization, white lists, and adaptive user interfaces...|$|E

40|$|Software Architecture {{has been}} {{established}} as a viable level <b>of</b> representation for <b>re-use</b> in practical software engineering efforts. The main {{reason for this is}} that an architectural view of software is sufficiently abstract to have many instantiations. Even with technologies such as CORBA and JavaBeans, which emphasize <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> components, the realization <b>of</b> widespread <b>re-use</b> has been severely limited. While architectural re-use has been successful, it has thus far suffered from an ad-hoc semantics, and even savvy architecture practitioners are unsure precisely what is being re-used. We have been engaged in research into <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> software <b>documents,</b> such as design <b>documents,</b> statements <b>of</b> work, contracts, etc., that capture and re-use archtectural level knowledge of software solutions. We have found that, given a sufficiently robust knowledge-based tool for maintaining documents, a formal ontology or meta-model for software architectures is required to achieve <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> these architecture-level <b>documents.</b> We present such an ontology here...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{maintenance}} of digital libraries often passes through physical paper forms. Such forms are tedious to handle for both senders and receivers. Several commercial solutions {{exist for the}} digitization of forms. However, {{most of them are}} proprietary, expensive, centralized, or require software installation. With this demo, we propose a free, secure, and lightweight framework for digital forms. It is based on HTML documents with embedded JavaScript, it uses exclusively open standards, and it does not require a centralized architecture. Our forms can be digitally signed with the OpenPGP standard, and they contain machine-readable RDFa. Thus, they allow for the semantic analysis, sharing, <b>re-use,</b> or merger <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> across users or institutions...|$|R
40|$|Narratives {{enable the}} {{formation}} of personal and community identities, {{and the construction of}} meanings. Although increasingly popular, digital storytelling still faces some critical challenges: creation of content on tangible and intangible heritage, classification and <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>documents</b> and clips, cooperative and coordinated production of new content. Moreover, for effective exploratory paths and a more analytical approach to browsing material, contents must be set in the overall perspective of the narrations, to ensure coherent and effective narrations. Finally, validation and dissemination of related outcomes must respect scientific standards. This chapter describes a prototype of a web application supporting multimedia narratives. So far, it implements the engine for creating and managing the activity ‘networks-of-stories’, to create nonlinear and open multimedia narrations. It has tools that: support educators, also in contrasting learning difficulties, in developing inclusive and collaborative educational practices; support museums' curators; facilitate crowd sourcing; create a personal web repository of contents and connections; share contents to be published, if approved by the administrator; create a network of contents and applications, at different levels for different users and specific needs. Our web application has two key innovative functions: recording and retrieval of users' activities; narratives presented through a set of related clips (videos, albums, texts) are seen in a conceptual map...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the new law regulation concerning the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> the public information, which has been introduced into the Polish Act on Access to Public Information from 2001. New regulation results from {{the implementation of the}} Directive 2003 / 98 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> public sector information into Polish legal order. Re-use means the use by persons or legal entities <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> held by public sector bodies, for commercial or non-commercial purposes other than the initial purpose within the public task for which the documents were produced. As a general rule, everyone has the right to <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> public information. Moreover, the information is made available without conditions and no charges are made for the re-use. The exceptions to this general rule are made, as the public sector bodies may impose conditions <b>of</b> the <b>re-use,</b> determine the manner <b>of</b> <b>re-use,</b> charge a re-use fee, as well as refuse the e-use of the information. The refusal {{takes the form of a}} decision. An appeal against a refusal decision or a complaint can be filed to the administrative court...|$|R

50|$|All {{of these}} issues tend to put {{pressure}} on the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> grave sites within cemeteries. The <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> graves already used for burial can cause considerable upset to family members. Although the authorities might declare that the grave is sufficiently old {{that there will be no}} human remains still present, nonetheless many people regard the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> graves (particularly their family's graves) as a desecration. Also <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> a used grave involves the removal of any monuments and headstones, which may cause further distress to families (although families will typically be allowed to take away the monuments and headstones if they wish).|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{the decree}} 2011-577 of May 26 {{relative}} to the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> public sector information sets forth the principle <b>of</b> gratuity <b>of</b> <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> public sector data and documents. Under this decree, an administrative agency may envisage to apply licence fees to the <b>re-use</b> <b>of</b> the State's immaterial property such as data, but this decision must be published by decree after consultation of the Public edition and Administrative Information Council.|$|R
