A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the <b>reamed</b> <b>hole,</b> and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and <b>reamed</b> <b>hole.</b> A subsidiary objective is to design the form milling cutter that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer aided drill point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer aided drill point geometry analysis...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Reamed</b> <b>holes</b> {{are used}} to create holes of precise {{circularity}} and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008") This will allow the force fitting of locating dowel pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them.

This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large diameter reamer), and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of used and new reamer systems for both hemispherical and minimally invasive (MIS) acetabular reamers. MethodsNew and used hemispherical and MIS acetabular reamers were tested on a computer numerical control machine to <b>ream</b> <b>holes</b> in special machinable wax blocks. Each reamer was tested 3 times in sizes 48 mm through 55 mm. ResultsThe used reamers significantly underreamed by an average of 1. 33 vs 0. 28 mm compared to new reamers. Hemispherical reamers underreamed significantly more than MIS reamers, with a mean difference of 0. 99 vs 0. 63 mm, respectively. Used hemispherical reamers showed an average ream undersize of 1. 61 vs 0. 37 mm, compared to new hemispherical reamers. Used MIS reamers showed an average ream undersize of 1. 06 vs 0. 20 mm for the new MIS reamers. ConclusionsFor a manufacturer-specified reamer size, both hemispherical and MIS reamers underream. Newer reamers cut truer to expected values than used ones. MIS reamers performed more accurately than hemispherical reamers. Used acetabular reamer systems may negatively affect the sizing of prepared acetabular beds; therefore, awareness of this potential inaccuracy should be considered when performing total hip arthroplasty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} one of the {{difficulties}} that high-precision thin hole is machined. The supersonic vibration reaming acoustic system is installed in the lathe. The supersonic wave energy applies to reamer to create pulse power on the cutting process. The separating vibration cutting is achieved to make the pulse force. The tests on reaming surface quality and precision are carried. The quality of surface and accuracy machined by this method is more than that by grinding. The reaming process is stability. The cutting force is greatly reduced. The cutting temperature is at room temperature. The tool life is greatly increased. Surface quality and shape precision is greatly improved. The regulations of the ultrasonic vibration <b>reaming</b> thin <b>hole</b> in hardened steel are also summarized. The test results show that the ultrasonic vibration reaming by reamer is of very superior cutting mechanism. It is efficient cutting methods for high-precision thin-hole machining of hardened materials...|$|R

The side cutting displacement increased gradually with increasing depth of drilling and side force.

40|$|Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Washcore 147 - 895 D- 10 W is {{the last}} core taken in Hole 895 D. It {{represents}} accidental recovery of drilling rubble during <b>hole</b> <b>reaming,</b> and therefore represents a mix of lithologies {{that could have been}} derived from 0 to 93. 7 meters below seafloor (mbsf). It consists of 15 distinct pieces of serpentinized ultramafic and gabbroic rocks, with numerous gravel-sized pieces of mixed ultramafic material with small amounts of clay occurring {{at the bottom of the}} core. More uncurated rubble was sampled when trying to <b>ream</b> the <b>hole.</b> This uncurated rubble is not described in the Initial Reports volume, but was collected by one of the authors (H. P.). Petrographic inspection of the uncurated rubble showed it to be serpentinized olivine with margins of chrysotile asbestos, small amounts of spinels and gabbroic fragments. It was expected that the rubble composition represents well peridotites of the marine mantle, especially in relation to platinum group elements (PGE) (Prichard et al., this volume). It was decided by the shipboard party to use this uncurated material as a reference for post-cruise geochemical analysis. On board, approximately 4 kg of the uncurated material (Sample 147 - 895 D- 10 WReference 1) was washed clay-free with demineralized water, dried at 110 °C, and then ground in a motor-driven agate mortar. Because the grain size was not yet suitable after this procedure for preparing powder pellets aboard ship for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) trace-element analysis, three small splits were ground in tungsten carbide containers in a shatter box. The results of shipboard XRF-analysis with an Applied Research Laboratories (ARL) machine gave preliminary trace elements only. The data are given in Table 1. At the end of the cruise, small samples of approximately 200 g of 147 - 895 D- 10 W-Reference 1 were distributed to interested cruise participants. H. Puchelt received additionally about 6 kg of uncurated rubble (Sample 147 - 895 D- 10 W-Reference 2) for grinding and analysis at Karlsruhe.

40|$|Background: Vascular injury during {{minimally}} invasive {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) is uncommon, yet a well-recognized and serious issue. It emerges because of non-visibility of vascular structures proximal to the pelvic bone during <b>reaming,</b> drilling <b>holes,</b> and fixing of screws. Numerous {{studies have found that}} screw fixation during cementless THA is beneficial for the initial stability of cup; yet, no anatomical guidelines support angular eccentric screw fixation. Materials and Methods: In this study, we obtained the pelvic arterial-phase computed tomographic data of thirty eight humans and reconstructed the three-dimensional models of osseous and vessel structures. We performed the surgical simulation to fix these structures with cementless cups and screws with angular eccentricities. Results: The effect of screw eccentricities (angular eccentricities of ± 17 ° and ± 34 °) on the vascular injury was determined. Measurement between screw and adjoining vessels was performed and analyzed statistically to ascertain a comparative risk study for blood vessels that are not visible during surgery. Conclusion: Authors similarly discussed the significant absence of appreciation of quadrant systems proposed by Wasielewski et al. on eccentric screws. Adjustment of quadrant systems provided by Wasielewski et al. is required for acetabular implants with eccentric holes for fixation of acetabular screws...|$|R
50|$|The process {{starts with}} the {{receiving}} hole and entrance pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (<b>reaming)</b> enlarges the <b>hole</b> by passing a larger cutting tool known as the back reamer. The reamer's diameter depends {{on the size of}} the pipe to be pulled back through the bore hole. The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter or the conduit and to achieve optimal production. The third stage places the product or casing pipe in the enlarged hole by way of the drill stem; it is pulled behind the reamer to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the development of a dynamic force model for drilling and reaming. It can predict the static forces, dynamic forces and vibrations under various cutting conditions. In this model, the cutting forces during drilling are determined by modeling the drill to consist of two distinct regions: the cutting lips and the chisel edge. The cutting forces due to the drill lips are modeled based on Oblique cutting mechanics. The tool vibrations are modeled based on the mechanistic approach and the effects of tool vibrations on the cutting forces are also modeled. Using this new force model, the chatter limits can be determined for the cutting process. The reaming model is then developed for reamers and it can estimate the static and dynamic cutting forces during <b>reaming</b> of <b>holes.</b> The <b>reaming</b> model can also model the forces at entry when holes have chamfer. The model for both drilling and reaming account for the effects of tool offset and tool asymmetry on the cutting forces. The model is robust and can be modified to accommodate other rotary machining processes such as milling. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

Drilling is conducted in both the vertical and horizontal direction and can be steered within limits, dependent upon subsurface conditions. HDD can install utilities from 1 " to 48 " in diameter and up to 6000 feet in length. The major utilities (gas, electric, telecommunications and water/sewer) can be installed with this technology. The construction process (pilot <b>hole,</b> <b>reaming</b> and pullback) along with the major components (drill rig, drill pipe, slurry, slurry recycling, survey equipment, drill bits, reamers and pipeline materials) will be discussed.

The challenges of proper soils information, subsurface conditions, training and knowledge, drilling fluids and binding of the drill pipe and reamer/bit will be discussed.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{of a hole}} drilled in metal by a twist drill may not be accurate enough (close enough to a true cylinder of a certain precise diameter) and {{may not have the}} required smooth surface finish for certain engineering applications. Although modern twist drills can perform excellently in many cases—usually producing sufficiently accurate holes for most applications—sometimes the stringency of the requirements for the hole's geometry and finish necessitate two operations: a drilling to slightly undersize, followed by reaming with a reamer. The planned difference between the drill diameter and the reamer diameter is called an allowance. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.) The allowance should be < 0.2 mm (.008 in) for soft materials and < 0.13 mm (.005 in) for hard materials. Larger allowances can damage the reamer. The drilled hole should not be enlarged by more than 5% of the drilled diameter. Drilling followed by <b>reaming</b> generally produces <b>hole</b> geometry and finish that is as close to theoretical perfection as possible. (The other methods of hole creation that approach nearest to perfection under certain conditions are boring single-point boring and internal cylindrical grinding.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of Subglacial Lake Ellsworth {{is a high}} profile project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. Clean access to the lake will be provided by a hot-water drilling (HWD) system developed by the British Antarctic Survey. The HWD system {{is designed to provide}} a 36 cm diameter borehole through 3. 2 km of ice. Drilling to this depth with the HWD system has never been attempted before. This report aims to quantify the risks of the HWD system deployment. A formal assessment of the technical risks is presented. Our analysis was conducted in two parts. First we estimated the probability of failure for all components and processes that take part in each phase of the deployment. In the second part we estimate the availability of the HWD system in light of all potential failure modes. Availability is the probability of the system being available given that it is needed at a given moment. Seventy five potential failure modes have been identified. The assessments for all these failure modes are presented in this report. The probabilities of failure for the top three critical failure modes are: • Boiler failure at 0. 048; • Damaged surface hydraulic pipes at 0. 0185; • Driller reeler human error at 0. 0168. Our availability analysis concluded that, once water circulation has been established, the probability of successfully creating the main hole is 0. 83. This will enable the deployment of the probe. Once the main hole has been created, the probability of successfully <b>reaming</b> the main <b>hole,</b> enabling the deployment of the second probe, is 0. 89. This is a very high probability of success. These figures take into account the drilling rate and the uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of the drilling process. The current HWD system design has incorporated design changes to avoid previous weaknesses identified during field campaigns. In particular, the current design does not contain hose couplings. This decision has reduced the risk of not achieving the target depth by 15...|$|R
40|$|Drilling with casing and liner are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A casing or liner string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the hole cleaning have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve hole cleaning also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the hole cleaning of the candidate wells. The simulations of hole cleaning and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for hole cleaning in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for hole cleaning {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a pilot bottom hole assembly and an underreamer to <b>ream</b> the <b>hole</b> to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the hole cleaning in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|R
