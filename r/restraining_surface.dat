50|$|The Kelvin-Helmholtz {{instability}} (KHI) is {{an application}} of hydrodynamic stability {{that can be seen}} in nature. It occurs when there are two fluids flowing at different velocities. The difference in velocity of the fluids causes a shear velocity at the interface of the two layers. The shear velocity of one fluid moving induces a shear stress on the other which, if greater than the <b>restraining</b> <b>surface</b> tension, then results in an instability along the interface between them. This motion causes the appearance of a series of overturning ocean waves, a characteristic of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Indeed, the apparent ocean wave-like nature is an example of vortex formation, which are formed when a fluid is rotating about some axis, and is often associated with this phenomenon.|$|E

Based on the law of influence of conical pits on nucleation, the research also shows that there are three ways of how solid surface roughness influence nucleation rate: changing the apparent contact angle, forming the surface of ice-base mixed and increasing the surface area.

Low temperature cracking represents {{a significant problem}} in asphalt pavements built in Northern US and Canada. As temperature decreases rapidly, thermal stresses develop in the <b>restrained</b> <b>surface</b> layer and, when the temperature reaches a critical temperature, cracking occurs. In this thesis, statical analyses were used to compare thermal stresses that develop in an idealized asphalt pavement layer calculated from experimental data obtained with three different test methods: 1) Asphalt mixture creep test using Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) 2) Asphalt mixture testing using Indirect Tensile Test (IDT) 3) Asphalt binder creep test using BBR and an empirical Pavement Constant Thermal stresses calculated using mixture BBR and mixture IDT data were reasonably identical. Thermal stresses calculated using binder BBR data and an empirical Pavement Constant were significantly different than the other calculated thermal stresses.

The high surface impedance and a frequency gap are used to reduce RCS(radar cross section) across needed frequency range (3. 7 – 4. 5 GHz). Because the high <b>surface</b> impedance <b>restrains</b> the <b>surface</b> waves, the obtained results show that RCSis reduced by 15 dB at resonance frequency and radiation characteristics of the antenna at operating frequencies are improved.

This painting shows Metzinger on the verge of adopting a more naturalistic stance. Space is increasingly recessive, surface fracturing is more subdued.

30|$|In summary, {{the melting}} point and thermal {{expansion}} stress originating from different CTE {{plays an important}} role on the FePt/X (5  nm, X[*]=[*]Ag, Ru) bilayer annealing process. The Ag cap layer segregates from the FePt/Ag bilayer, lowers the FePt ordering temperature, promotes the FePt thin films to form an island structure, and enhances the coercivity. The Ru cap layer increasing the FePt ordering temperature helps to maintain smooth continuous <b>surface,</b> <b>restrains</b> the FePt (001) orientation and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The effects become much more pronounced for the 3 -nm-thick FePt thin films. The effects can be mainly attributed to the low melting point and positive thermal expansion stress originating from the Ag cap layer and the high melting point and negative thermal expansion stress originating from the Ru cap layer.|$|R

The system's density of state and free energy are convergent in the neighborhood of horizon. The small-mass approximation is determined by the asymptotic behavior of metric function near horizons.

40|$|Abstract. During the {{pre-forming}} {{stage of}} the RTM process, large deformations can occur, especially for double-curved shapes. Knowing the mechanical behaviour and the actual geometry of fibrous reinforcements at the mesoscopic scale is of great importance for several applications like permeability evaluations. As such, forming modeling is particularly demanding {{on the quality of}} geometric modeling and on the mesh associated. Indeed, analysis of the internal structure of materials in general, and woven materials especially, recently led to major advances. X-ray Micro Tomography (XRMT or µCT) allows detailed and accurate 3 D observations inside the sample, which is not possible with the standard microscopy techniques <b>restrained</b> to <b>surface</b> observations. It distinguishes the yarns and even the fibers that define the directions of anisotropy of the material. A FE model is generated from the processed tomography images. It has been chosen in this study to use hypoelasticity behaviour law. Indeed, the yarns are submitted to large deformations, so that the orientation of the material is significantly modified and the fiber direction has to be strictly followed in order to fulfil the principle of objectivity. A way to retrieve the neutral composite reinforcement axis by skeletonization is proposed in order to know the privileged direction of the yarn and thus implement it in the constitutive law. A comparison between experimental and simulations obtained from µCT and idealized geometry of a transverse compression test on the G 0986 is presented...|$|R

40|$|Large {{and small}} nanospheres, {{large and small}} nanoplates, {{nanorods}} and nanostars have been synthesized and fabricated into SERS substrates consisting of sandwiched and aggregated structure. Using 633 nm laser as excitation, individual SERS spectra of each labeling molecules, benzenethiol, 4 -nitrobenzenethiol and 4 -quinolinethiol, have been successfully obtained and {{the combination of these}} three molecules have the least amount of overlapping and can all be identified from the reference multiplexed spectra. Among all the substrates that have analyzed, the substrate made from nanospheres with sandwiched structure is able to produce multiplexed SERS spectra with more details and higher reproducibility. Although multiplexed SERS spectra can also be observed from substrates made from small nanoplates, nanostars and nanorods substrates with sandwiched structures, the unique peaks representing the labeling molecules are less consistent in their intensity. In addition, substrates with micro sized plates in sandwiched configuration are found to exhibit much lower SERS activities and this can be due {{to the size of the}} plate being much greater than the light source, <b>restraining</b> the <b>surface</b> plasmon resonance effect. Most of the substrates fabricated with aggregated nanoparticles have very low reproducibilities and saturated signals with 633 nm excitation. The spectra peaks are much easier to identify and are much more reproducible when 785 nm excitation have been adopted. This can be due to the size of the aggregated nanoparticles are much bulkier which a deeper penetrating light source is required to induce more molecules labels to exhibit SERS activities. A novel SERS substrate has been fabricated with nanoparticle-thiol-microplate sandwiched configuration by using a double ended thiol molecules, benzenedithiol, to strongly connect nanospheres and the plates together. However, the measurement of the SERS activity is limited by the overpowering of the light source, which has frequently melted and evaporated the plate samples once they have been exposed to the excitation radiation. In addition, instead of spreading evenly on the microplate surfaces, the nanoparticles have appeared to be aggregated which may have increased the difficulty in obtaining SERS activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{fabrication}} of vertical three-dimensional micro-Fresnel lenses with polysili-con materials by surface micromachining technique. Micro-Fresnel lenses {{play a very}} important role in micro-optics because of their thin film structures and their ability to achieve very short fo-cal lengths. Although micro-Fresnel lenses have been studied and well understood [11, the lens planes usually are <b>restrained</b> on the <b>surface</b> of the substrate. Therefore, their abilities of integra-tion with other optoelectronic components in micro-optics are limited. In this paper, we present a vertical three-dimensional binary-phase micro-Fresnel lens which overcomes the disadvantage of conventional micro-fresnel lenses and is able to rotate out of the plane and stands perpendicular to the substrate. This lens and other similarly constructed micro-optical elements can shrink the whole free-space optical system to a single micro-chip. They have applications in free-space opti-cal interconnect, packaging and optical storage. The fabrication of the vertical micro-Fresnel lens has been reported [2]. The lens plate is sup-ported by micro-hinges and spring latches [3]. In this paper, we report the coupling experiments of semiconductor laser diodes and optical fibers using the vertical micro-Fresnel lens.

40|$|International audienceMolecular {{interactions}} in thin liquid films, {{such as the}} disjoining pressure, are involved in interfacial phenomena such as emulsion and foam stabilization. In this article we show that through light stimulation we can control remotely the disjoining pressure in a thin liquid film stabilized by a photosurfactant. We stabilize a horizontal thin liquid film using a cationic photosurfactant, AzoTAB, bearing an azobenzene moiety on the hydrophobic tail which can switch from a trans to a cis conformation upon light stimulation. As the film is illuminated at specific wavelengths the AzoTAB molecules switch continuously their conformation and consequently their interface affinity. The main consequence of stimulating the film with light is increasing the ratio of cis in the film. This provokes a desorption flux, {{and an increase in}} the concentration of free surfactants, as the CMC of the cis isomer is higher than that of the trans isomer. Therefore the electrostatic repulsion between the surfactant layers that stabilize the film decreases, inducing an instability in the film thickness. For films with a thickness between 20 nm and 60 nm, we observe the formation of spherical caps up to 100 μm wide, whose shape is controlled by the competition between surface tension and disjoining pressure. The motion of these caps in the film is <b>restrained</b> by the <b>surface</b> viscosity of the surfactant layers. In addition, for thicknesses below 40 nm and depending on light intensity, we can observe flat stratified islands up to 100 μm wide, with thickness steps corresponding {{to the size of a}} surfactant micelle. We suggest that this second instability is due to the oscillation of the disjoining pressure isotherm under light...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A soft-shelled {{non-indigenous}} clam, Nuttallia obscurata, has invaded coastal soft-sediment habitats of {{the northeastern}} Pacific. In {{a survey of}} 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, Nuttallia was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams (> 1 m above mean lower low water). The distinctive distribution of Nuttallia suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. I tethered Nuttallia for 24 h in the high intertidal where it is typically found and in the low intertidal at an elevation where it was never found. Clams <b>restrained</b> to the <b>surface</b> suffered high mortality from crab predation at both tidal heights, whereas control clams with unrestricted burrowing movement exhibited high mortality rates only in the low intertidal. In a second experiment, I transplanted sediment within and between the two intertidal heights to measure effects of tidal height and sediment type on survival and burial depth of Nuttallia. At both tidal heights all clams placed on mud-cobble substrate, naturally common in the low intertidal, suffered high mortality rates (> 60 % in 24 h). Nuttallia on loosely packed sand substrate, naturally found in the upper intertidal, survived much better, however, because they buried deeper than in the tightly packed mud. Caged control clams at both tidal heights suffered no mortality. Apparently native predators are mitigating community level impacts of an invader by excluding Nuttallia completely from some beaches with improper sediment characteristics or relegating it in others to a zone not often inhabited by native species, thereby reducing potential competitive interactions. These findings show that a physical habitat characteristic can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and thus control invasion success and community-level impacts. Generally, such physical-biological interactions may {{explain some of the}} reported site-to-site variability in invasion success, as well as the patchy distribution of many soft-sediment infaunal species...|$|R

Thompson 2; 1 Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; 2 Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of ankle position on passive torque (PT), range of motion (ROM), and electromyography (EMG) of the posterior hip and thigh muscles during a passive straight-leg raise (SLR) assessment. METHODS: Thirteen healthy participants (mean±SD age= 23 ± 2 yr; mass= 69 ± 15 kg; height= 169 ± 10 cm) performed six randomly ordered passive SLR assessments involving two assessments at each condition, which included the ankle positioned in dorsiflexion (DF), plantar flexion (PF), and a neutral (NTRL) position. All SLRs were performed using an isokinetic dynamometer programmed in passive mode to move the foot toward the head at 5 °·s- 1. For each SLR, participants laid in a supine position, with the knee braced in full-extension and the ankle immobilized in either 10 ° of DF, 10 ° of PF, or a NTRL (0 °) position using an adjustable, custom-built stabilizing apparatus. All assessments were conducted on the right leg, while the left thigh and ankle were secured with <b>restraining</b> straps. Bipolar <b>surface</b> EMG amplitude of the biceps femoris was sampled during each SLR and expressed {{as a percentage of}} the maximal EMG amplitude that was corrected for initial baseline noise. PT and EMG amplitude were determined at four common joint angles (θ) separated by 5 ° during the final common 15 ° ROM for each participant. RESULTS: Maximum ROM was lower for the DF than the NTRL (P= 0. 003) and PF (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) conditions. PT was greater for the DF than the NTRL and PF conditions at θ 3 (P= 0. 001) and was greater for the DF than the NTRL condition at θ 4 (P= 0. 003) but was not different between conditions at θ 1 and θ 2 (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) (Figure 1). PT also increased with joint angle for the DF, PF, and NTRL conditions (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). There were no joint angle or condition-related differences (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for EMG. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the SLRs performed with the ankle positioned in DF elicited greater PT and lower ROM of the posterior hip and thigh muscles than the SLRs with the ankle positioned in PF or a NTRL position...|$|R
