5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a <b>royal</b> <b>blue</b> version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E

25|$|The club colours of Rangers F.C. are <b>royal</b> <b>blue,</b> {{white and}} red. However, for the {{majority}} of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with <b>royal</b> <b>blue</b> and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to <b>royal</b> <b>blue</b> in 1921, and have had a <b>royal</b> <b>blue</b> home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with <b>royal</b> <b>blue</b> shorts and socks.|$|E

50|$|After {{learning}} {{that there would}} be no Division 1 football this season, another BML season it was and it would turn out to be the start of things to come for the Blues. This year any team from four could have been tipped for the championship and after a very close battle with rivals Carnegies FC, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Blues</b> were crowned BML champions after losing only 1 match and a result that all the players deserved. Finally the pieces were starting to come together and with a mixture of player ability, commitment and desire, the development of the team was plain to see. The <b>Royal</b> <b>Blues</b> identity was growing and so too their wanting of developing football across the whole of the country. So what does a developing club need next? One who has a kid’s academy and licensed coaches who also wish to build the sport at grassroots level...... their own managed training pitch and facility.|$|R
