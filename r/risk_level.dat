25|$|The current {{recommendations}} for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1µg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal <b>Risk</b> <b>Level)</b> for chronic exposure is 0.2µg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal <b>Risk</b> <b>Level)</b> is {{an estimate of}} the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2µg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.|$|E

40|$|One {{problem in}} {{implementing}} risk regulation {{has to do}} with asymmetries in information between regulators and licensees. A possible solution is to provide incentives (e. g., more lenient standards) if violations (e. g., <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> above some specified standard) are disclosed voluntarily by regulated firms, rather than being discovered through the regulator's monitoring efforts. This study adapts game-theoretic work in regulatory economics (where firms are usually viewed as being either compliant or non-compliant) to apply to the case of risk regulation (where firms can be described by continuously varying <b>risk</b> <b>levels).</b> This article derives equilibrium solutions for the self-reporting mechanism under different model formulations, and discusses the conditions under which these solutions are better than a traditional direct-monitoring regulatory scheme. For example, when firms can benefit (in the form of reduced costs) by increasing their <b>risk</b> <b>levels,</b> the results show that offering a loosened standard to encourage voluntary disclosure of <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> is worthwhile only when a sufficiently large proportion of firms is believed to have high <b>risk</b> <b>levels.</b> Risk-informed regulation Self-reporting Game theory Optimization...|$|R
40|$|Choice {{probability}} {{and choice}} response time {{data from a}} risk-taking decision-making task were compared with predictions made by a sequential sampling model. The behavioral data, consistent with the model, showed that participants {{were less likely to}} take an action as <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> increased, and that time pressure did not have a uniform effect on choice probability. Under time pressure, participants were more conservative at the lower <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> but were more prone to take risks at the higher <b>levels</b> of <b>risk.</b> This crossover interaction reflected a reduction of the threshold within a single decision strategy rather than a switching of decision strategies. Response time data, as predicted by the model, showed that participants took more time to make decisions at the moderate <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> and that time pressure reduced response time across all <b>risk</b> <b>levels,</b> but particularly at the those <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> that took longer time with no pressure. Finally, response time data were used to rule out the hypothesis that time pressure effects could be explained by a fast-guess strategy...|$|R

25|$|The Asilomar Conference {{also gave}} {{recommendations}} for matching {{the types of}} containment necessary for different types of experiments. These recommendations {{were based on the}} different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels of containment. These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal <b>risk</b> <b>level</b> of containment was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate <b>risk</b> <b>level</b> of containment was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.|$|E

On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal <b>Risk</b> <b>Level</b> (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.

First, transport routes are divided into smaller route segments. Second, likelihood scores of security-related accidents in which dangerous freight is involved and possibly causing fatalities in the surrounding population, are determined per route segment. Third, the consequences of accident scenarios (using reference products and spatial plans) are calculated {{in terms of the}} number of people within the 1 % lethality distance of the accident center. Fourth, using these likelihood scores and consequence figures, transport route security <b>risk</b> <b>levels</b> are determined. Fifth, transshipment risks are considered for determining the final transport route security <b>risk</b> <b>levels.</b> This leads to a multi-modal user-friendly security threat assessment tool which can be used by policy makers as well as by industrialists (shippers or Logistics Service Providers).
