Homogeneous spiking neural P systems are a variant of spiking neural P systems, where each neuron has the same set <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> The <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> homogeneous spiking neural P systems without delays is investigated and proved.

50|$|Feminist {{philosophers}} critique traditional ethics as pre-eminently {{focusing on}} men's perspective {{with little regard}} for women's viewpoints. Caring and the moral issues of private life and family responsibilities were traditionally regarded as trivial matters. Generally, women are portrayed as ethically immature and shallow in comparison to men. Traditional ethics prizes masculine cultural traits like “independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death,” and gives less weight to culturally feminine traits like “interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life.” Traditional ethics has a “male” orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> rights, <b>universality,</b> and impartiality. The “female” approaches to moral reasoning emphasise relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality.|$|R

In order to establish robust systems against the environmental factors, a special class of SN P systems, called time-free SN P systems, is introduced, which always produce the same computation result indepen-dent of the execution times <b>of</b> the <b>rules.</b> The <b>universality</b> <b>of</b> time-free SN P systems is investigated. It is proved that these P systems with extended rules (several spikes can be produced by a rule) are equivalent to regis-ter machines. However, if the number of spikes present in the system is bounded, then the power of time-free SN P systems falls, and in this case, a characterization of semilinear sets of natural numbers is obtained. ...|$|R

This article examines the dialectics of democracy and theocracy with special reference to past and present processes of secularization. In this connection a distinction is made between ‘secularization’ {{as a process of}} separating the secular from the sacred, and ‘secularism’ as an ideology restricting religion purely to the private realm. Rather than in orthodoxy or even fundamentalis the theocratic threat to democracy and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law appears to lie in exceptionalism {{in the sense of a}} religiously motivated exemption from democratic decision-making and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. This type of threat is not confined to extremist attitudes grounded in religion however; in respect of the international legal order it is state-based exceptionalism that abounds. Notably, international human rights standards imply semi-autonomy rather than full autonomy for states and religious institutions alike. Prior to arithmetic <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> decision-making it is in the transcendental principles <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> and human dignity that society finds protection against exceptionalist threats to democracy and the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R

We believe that this fact {{is due to the}} crisis <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> that interests many aspects of actual Western society and invests its criteria of truth, values and, in general, references and ideal tensions. But it is just in the idea <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> that the link between mathematics and Western society resides: since the beginning, mathematical truth becomes necessary for the “universe ” of considered objects, a prototype of rationality and a chance of discovery. In some historical times this interconnection is so deep that we can say, by freely inspiring to Ricoeur’s philosophy, that mathematics becomes a text to read some characteristics of society and to individuate the ways of its tension to the universal...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{insolvency law}} {{is based on}} two main principles – the principle <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> and the principle of territoriality. Under the principle of territoriality, the insolvency proceedings shall {{be limited to the}} assets located in the state in which the proceedings were opened. In light of the principle <b>of</b> <b>universality,</b> there is one single insolvency proceeding which shall affect all assets of the debtor and shall be governed by one national law. The universalism ensures efficiency and economy of the insolvency proceedings. On the other hand, due to widely differing national insolvency laws the application <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> without exception may cause difficulties. Therefore, European insolvency law is based on the modified universality which is a compromise between these two main principles. The article aims to outline the theoretical basis of these principles and analyze their concrete manifestations within cross-border insolvency proceedings...|$|R
40|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> in {{international}} law has faced many challenges, both in theory and in practice. Among them, the theoretical construction of ‘rogue’ and ‘failed’ states {{has been identified as}} a challenge to the classic notion <b>of</b> <b>universality,</b> which refers to international law’s universal applicability. However, the issue of how the discourse on failed, collapsed, outlaw, rogue or pariah states questions specifically the principle <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> has not yet been clarified. The analysis through the lens of international law is particularly relevant {{at a time when the}} current turn of events in some states poses both theoretical and practical challenges in terms of humanitarian assistance, flows of refugees and economic stability around the world. This article addresses this issue, first by outlining the main elements of the concept of failed and rogue states and of semantically relevant terms. It, then, proceeds to inquire how the discourse about these states challenges the principle <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> along with the traditional state-centric view of international law. In so doing, it attempts to illustrate specific aspects of the principle <b>of</b> <b>universality</b> {{in international}} law which are challenged by such theoretical constructions which are based on the premise that fundamental principles enshrined in the UN Charter should only be respected when a state is first a secure (liberal, democratic) place to live in. In this respect, the question of cosmopolitanism {{in international law}} comes into play and the article concludes by examining whether the theory of failed or rogue states is a representative expression of global cosmopolitan law...|$|R
