25|$|Farms were in disrepair, and the prewar {{stock of}} horses, mules and cattle was much depleted; two-fifths, or 40%, of the South's {{livestock}} had been killed. The South's farms were not highly mechanized, but {{the value of}} farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million and was reduced by two-fifths, or 40%, by 1870. The transportation infrastructure lay in ruins, with little railroad or riverboat service available to move crops and animals to market. Railroad mileage was located mostly in rural areas and over two-thirds of the South's rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what they could. Even in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone ensured the system would be ruined at war's end. Restoring the infrastructure—especially the railroad system—became {{a high priority for}} Reconstruction state governments.|$|E

The new KUFO-FM became a popular album-oriented rock station. The manager and chief architect was Frank Hall. The Program Director was J. Michael Scott.

50|$|The Beechcraft King Air, C-12B, C-12C, and C-12M {{maritime}} surveillance aircraft are all medium-range, twin turbo-prop aircraft used by CBP’s Air and Marine Operations.

Their secondary mission is the logistical <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> personnel, <b>equipment,</b> or evidence that is time critical to investigation and enforcement actions.

5000|$|Nikolai Baibakov, {{a citizen}} of Baku, {{was in charge of}} a special {{headquarters}} coordinating the supply of military units with fuel. In 1942, he {{became a member of the}} State Defense Committee in destruction of oil wells and oil-producing enterprises in the Caucasus. He utilized scorched earth tactics: in the time of the enemy’s approach, all valuable equipment was demolished and sent back to the east of the country; stripped wells were immediately destroyed, but ones with significant productivity were continually used and only wrecked in the certainty of their seizure by the enemies. As a result, Germans were unable to use the resources of Krasnodar oil fields. Later, Baibakov became a representative of the State Defense Committee in <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> oilmen and <b>equipment</b> <b>of</b> the Caucasian regions to the East. In 1941, The State Defense Committee decided to relocate parts of the oil enterprises of Baku, evacuate residents, and reorganize transportation flows. According to Baibakov, [...] "A Great Resettlement of Baku oilmen is happening". More than 10,000 people were sent to Krasnovodsk with their families and oil equipment on steamships and tankers, then further ferried on to un-populated regions by trains.|$|R
40|$|Going on foot is {{the most}} viable option when {{emergency}} responders fail {{to show up in}} disaster zones at the quickest and most reasonable time. In the Philippines, the efficacy of disaster management offices is hampered by factors such as, but not limited to, lack <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and personnel, distance, and/or poor road networks and traffic systems. In several instances, emergency response times exceed acceptable norms. This study explores the hazard susceptibility, particularly to fire, flood, and landslides, of neighborhoods vis-à-vis their proximity to safety facilities in Silay City, Philippines. Imbang River exposes communities in the city to flooding while the mountainous terrain makes the city landslide prone. Building extraction was done to get the possible human settlements in the city. The building structures were extracted through image processing using a ruleset-based approach in the process of segmentation and classification of LiDAR derivatives and ortho-photos. Neighborhoods were then identified whether they have low to high susceptibility to disaster risks in terms of floods and landslides based on the hazards maps obtained from the Philippines' Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB). Service area analyses were performed to determine the safety facilities available to different neighborhoods at varying running times. Locations which are inaccessible or are difficult to run to because of distance and corresponding hazards were determined. Recommendations are given in the form <b>of</b> infrastructure installation, <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> facilities, safety <b>equipment</b> and vehicle procurement, and policy changes for specific areas in Silay City...|$|R

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is an {{important}} foodborne pathogen responsible for the disease listeriosis, {{and can be found}} throughout the environment, in many foods and in food processing facilities. The main cause of listeriosis is consumption of food contaminated from sources in food processing environments. Persistence in food processing facilities has previously been shown for the L. monocytogenes sequence type (ST) 8 subtype. In the current study, five ST 8 strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and compared with five additionally available ST 8 genomes, allowing comparison of strains from salmon, poultry and cheese industry, in addition to a human clinical isolate. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confirmed that almost identical strains were detected in a Danish salmon processing plant in 1996 and in a Norwegian salmon processing plant in 2001 and 2011. Furthermore, we show that L. monocytogenes ST 8 was likely to have been transferred between two poultry processing plants as a result <b>of</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> processing <b>equipment.</b> The SNP data were used to infer the phylogeny of the ST 8 strains, separating them into two main genetic groups. Within each group, the plasmid and prophage content was almost entirely conserved, but between groups, these sequences showed strong divergence. The accessory genome of the ST 8 strains harbored genetic elements which could be involved in rendering the ST 8 strains resilient to incoming mobile genetic elements. These included two restriction-modification loci, one of which was predicted to show phase variable recognition sequence specificity through site-specific domain shuffling. Analysis indicated that the ST 8 strains harbor all important known L. monocytogenes virulence factors, and ST 8 strains are commonly identified as the causative agents of invasive listeriosis. Therefore, the persistence of this L. monocytogenes subtype in food processing facilities poses a significant concern for food safety...|$|R
