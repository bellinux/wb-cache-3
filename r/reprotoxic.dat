40|$|International audienceFollowing the French {{health and}} {{environment}} action plan, the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety {{set up a}} workgroup to standardise a method of deriving toxicity reference values (TRVs). Over the last few decades, there has been increasing concern {{about the effect of}} exposure to chemicals on reproductive function, leading the group to take an interest in <b>reprotoxic</b> effects. This article presents the recommendations of the workgroup regarding specific <b>reprotoxic</b> effects. Abnormal development of foetuses and infants, together with impairment of reproduction were considered to be critical effects. Where critical windows of exposure were concerned, quantitative analysis suggested the need for several types of toxicity reference value, as a function of exposure duration: <b>reprotoxic</b> effects may result from acute or chronic exposure at any time of life, whilst developmental effects may occur after exposure during the pregnancy or during the lactation period. The choice of a critical study is based on epidemiological or toxicological quality criteria. The working group recommends the use of the benchmark dose approach in estimating the critical dose.

Study design: A cohort study was conducted using two postnatal units in France. Women hospitalized in postnatal units were requested to complete a self-administered two part questionnaire. The first part gathered information about the patient's socio-professional level and the type of pregnancy follow-up. The second part examined the information the patient received regarding daily products containing the following known <b>reprotoxic</b> agents: bisphenol A, toluene, n-hexane, cis-chloroallyl-triaza-azonia-adamantane-chloride and O-phenyl-phenol. The women cited the sources of information. We combined the employment status and educational level to separate the women into two groups. The groups were then compared using the Chi Square test or Fisher's exact test. Result(s) : There were 390 women in this study. Our results showed the women received information regarding the following: 21. 6 % (n= 84) regarding tin cans, 21. 9 % (n = 85) concerning plastic meal boxes when heated in microwave ovens, 8. 8 % (n= 32) about water in gas-bottles, 27. 4 % (n= 106) about non organic foods, 39. 3 % (n= 152) about hair dyes, 17 % (n = 66) about nail polishes, 23. 4 % (n = 103) about insect repellents, 34. 4 % (n= 133) about “do-it-yourself” products, 2. 1 % (n= 8) about gardening products, 26. 7 % (n= 103) about electric plug-in repellents, 21. 1 % (n= 81) about housekeeping products, and 6. 8 % (n= 26) about register receipts. Women with a higher level of education and a qualified occupation were better informed about these daily products. These women were more likely to learn the information on their own (internet, media).

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} gonad {{development}} in two freshwater gastropod prosobranch snail species (Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Valvata piscinalis). These biological {{models have been}} shown to be sensitive to various <b>reprotoxic</b> substances and are known to be relevant organisms for studying endocrine-disrupting substances. Therefore we took up a histological study of their anatomy and the gametogenesis of the two species in order to key into biological elements potentially useful for <b>reprotoxic</b> stress studies. Knowing that P. antipodarum is parthenogenetic, we studied all their gonadogenetic stages, taking caution to clearly describe the different oocyte developmental stages leading to the formation of the copulatory bursa, characterizing neighboring glands. As for V. piscinalis, a hermaphrodite species, all the spermatogenesis development stages were described (spermatocytogenesis and spermiogenesis) as well as specification of nourishing cells and support cells, the objective being to define the species’ reproduction mechanism. This studied was carried out by observing the development of young P. antipodarum and V. picinalis, exposing them to the same experimental conditions for 6 months.

40|$|International audiencePeople {{spend most}} of their time indoors. Dust settled in the home may be {{contaminated}} by semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Exposure to these compounds is of great concern, in particular for infants. Their number is large so arose the question of which ones should be selected for dust ingestion exposure assessment. This work proposes a health ranking of SVOCs ingested through settled dust. This ranking is based on the toxicity and contamination of SVOCs in dust. Data on compounds and contamination was retrieved from a bibliographic review. Where possible, toxicity data was retrieved from databases, otherwise it was calculated from raw data. One hundred and fifty-six SVOCs were selected, 66 of which were prioritized. Forty-two could not be prioritized because contamination data was below the limit of detection, and 48 could not be prioritized because there was no contamination or toxicity data. The top-ranked compounds were phthalates, pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins, PBDEs, PFCs, organotins, PCBs, and PAHs. As most of these have <b>reprotoxic</b> and neurotoxic properties, an integrated multi-pollutants approach to exposure is required and simultaneous measurement methods should be developed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The large number of compounds identified in settled dust in recent years should be considered for the assessment of exposure to dust ingestion. This work provides a health ranking of SVOCs ingested through settled dust. Most of the top-ranked compounds have <b>reprotoxic</b> and neurotoxic properties, and particular attention should, therefore, be paid to them in future studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} legislation of the EU, Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), {{stipulates that}} about 30 [*] 000 chemical substances {{are to be}} assessed on their possible risks. Toxicological evaluation of these compounds will at least partly be based on animal testing. In particular, the assessment of reproductive toxicity is a very complicated, time-consuming and animal-demanding process. Introducing microarray-based technologies can potentially refine in vivo toxicity testing. If compounds of a distinct chemical class induce reproducible gene-expression responses with a recognizable overlap, these gene-expression signatures may indicate intrinsic features of certain compounds, including specific toxicity. In the present study, we have set out the first steps towards this approach for the reproductive toxicity of phthalates. Male rats were treated with a single dose of either <b>reprotoxic</b> or non-reprotoxic phthalates, and were analyzed 24 [*]h afterwards. Subsequently, histopathological and gene-expression profiling analyses were performed. Despite ambiguous histopathological observations, {{we were able to}} identify genes with differential expression profiles between the <b>reprotoxic</b> phthalates and the non-reprotoxic counterparts. This shows that differences in gene-expression profiles, indicative of the type of exposure, may be detected earlier, or at lower doses, than classical pathological endpoints. These findings are promising for ‘early warning’ biomarker analyses and for using toxicogenomics in a category approach. Ultimately, this could lead to a more cost-effective approach for prioritizing the toxicity testing of large numbers of chemicals {{in a short period of}} time in hazard assessment of chemicals, which is one of the objectives of the REACH chemical legislation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGlycol ethers (GE) are {{chemicals}} used since the 1930 s as solvents in paints, inks, varnishes, and cleaning agents, mainly in water-based products, cosmetics, and drugs. World production approximates 1 million tons. Nineteen GE are produced or imported each year; over 1000 tons in European Union (EU) have been classified as high production volume chemicals (HPVCs). First animal data {{were published in}} 1971 and 1979 showing severe reprotoxicity for some GE. Two alerts were launched in the United States in 1982 and 1983, but the first partial GE regulation only occurred in 1993 in the EU. Although these chemicals may expose a very large population, basic toxicity data, more especially carcinogenicity, are still lacking (3 / 32 GE). However, experimental data were sufficient to lead developmental toxicity risk assessment since the;early 1980 s. Risk indices over 1000 have been calculated for consumers and workers exposed to <b>reprotoxic</b> GE in domestic and industrial activities. The first ban was decided in 1999 in France, but was only for drugs and cosmetics. Not surprisingly, since the late 1980 s, human studies have found results {{similar to those in}} animal data: spontaneous abortions, malformations, testicular toxicity, and hematotoxicity. Despite this highly coherent set of data, and although substitution products are available, <b>reprotoxic</b> GE have been and still remain widely used in the world.

40|$|International audienceBeside {{cytotoxic}} drugs, {{other drugs}} can impact men's fertility through various mechanisms. Via the {{modification of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones or by non-hormonal mechanisms, drugs may directly and indirectly induce sexual dysfunction and spermatogenesis impairment and alteration of epididymal maturation. This systematic literature review summarizes existing data about the negative impact and associations of pharmacological treatments on male fertility (excluding cytotoxic drugs), {{with a view to}} making these data more readily available for medical staff. In most cases, these effects on spermatogenesis/sperm maturation/sexual function are reversible after the discontinuation of the drug. When a <b>reprotoxic</b> treatment cannot be stopped and/or when the impact on semen parameters/sperm DNA is potentially irreversible (Sulfasalazine Azathioprine, Mycophenolate mofetil and Methotrexate), the cryopreservation of spermatozoa before treatment must be proposed.

40|$|Obesity is {{a current}} {{epidemic}} in the United States. Greater than {{one third of}} adults and nearly one fifth of children are classified as obese (Ogden, 2014). Increased awareness of this problem has triggered interest into the potentially causal agents in our environment. These agents, termed obesogens, are a type of teratogen hypothesized to work during embryonic development by programming offspring to store excess fat. A type of teratogen, obesogens are also typically <b>reprotoxic,</b> affecting germline development and embryonic viability. These noxious teratogens span {{a variety of different}} chemical classes including estrogen mimics, metals and metalloids, biocides, and even voluntary exposures like cigarette smoke. The goal of this work is to use the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans to model the <b>reprotoxic</b> and obesogenic events that take place as a result of chronic, low-dose exposure to these agents. C. elegans is especially well suited to this end. The organism has a straightforward biology, a short lifespan on the order of days, and relevant lipid metabolic gene homology to humans. We characterize here the resultant effects on egg-laying, hatching, and embryo viability after chronic parental exposure to obesogens. Through this, we are able to best recapitulate the low-dose exposure for our obesogen screen. Here, chronic, sub-lethal parental exposure to the obesogens screened yielded viable offspring that exhibited increased percentages of body area lipid stained and induced differences in stained lipid localization. Reduced pharyngeal pumping rates in two of our offspring groups highlights the potential for lasting changes on behavioral phenotype as well. Lastly, we employed phylogenetic guided analysis to functionally assess putative C. elegans nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) to human Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs). These human PPARs have implications in lipid metabolism and obesity. We report here novel findings that NHR- 85 and SEX- 1 may act to repress lipid storage in the nematode, thereby serving as potential homologs of human PPARα. The results presented in this study highlight the lasting effects of chronic parental exposure to noxious environmental teratogens on the function of the reproductive system. Furthermore, the nematode can be used as an in vivo model to screen sublethal doses of these teratogens for their potential to act as obesogens. Bioinformatics guided analysis of C. elegans NHR homologs to human NHRs can continue to yield novel insight on this fat storage and its regulation in the nematode...|$|E
40|$|Although {{worldwide}} {{concerns have}} emerged about environmental factors that display carcinogenic and <b>reprotoxic</b> effects, {{little is known}} about the mechanism(s) by which these chemicals alter testicular function. Using the 42 GPA 9 Sertoli cell line, we recently reported that one widely used lipid-soluble pesticide, Lindane impairs gap junctional intercellular communication by promoting the intracellular localization of Connexin 43 (Cx 43), a tumor suppressor. We showed here that this chemical triggered the accumulation of Cx 43 within Rab 5 positive endosomes. Interestingly, evidence is provided that Lindane-induced Cx 43 endocytosis did not stem on alteration of Cx 43 partition in lipid rafts. Lindane induced concomitantly Cx 43 phosphorylation and activation of ERK but not of JNK and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Inhibition of ERK pathway by PD 98059, a MEK 1 -specific inhibitor, prevented Lindane-induced Cx 43 phosphorylation, restored Cx 43 membranous localization and gap junction coupling. Altogether, these findings provide the first evidence that Lindane-altered Cx 43 endocytosis requires ERK activation. Such inappropriate activation of the mitogenic MAPK pathway and inactivation of the tumor suppressor Cx 43 by Lindane may participate in the promotion of neoplastic cell growth...|$|E

The main objective {{of this study was}} to propose a new method using 1 H NMR spectroscopy to determine and quantify these seven plasticizers in PVC sheets, standard infusion tubings, and commercially available medical devices. Two techniques were compared: dissolution in deuterated tetrahydrofuran and extraction by deuterated chloroform. Plasticizer 1 H NMR spectra were very similar in both deuterated solvents; dissolution and extraction provided similar results. The sensitivity of this method enabled us to detect and quantify the presence of minor plasticizers in PVC. In nine commercially available samples, the major plasticizer was identified and quantified by 1 H NMR. In six samples, one, two, or three minor plasticizers were identified and also quantified. DEHP was detected in only one tubing. NMR is therefore very convenient for studying plasticizers contained in medical devices. Only small quantities of solvents and sample are required.

The present study monitored the risk for cancer and adverse reproductive outcome among Danish nurses handling ADs. No increased risks were found for miscarriages, malformations, low birth weight, or preterm birth among the offspring of nurses handling ADs during pregnancy. The sex ratio was normal. The relative risk (RR) for leukaemia was significantly increased (10. 65) but based on only two cases, one of acute myeloblastic and one of chronic myeloid leukaemia. From the available exposure data occupational exposures to ADs were apparently higher in the studies that have reported increased risks for miscarriages and malformations than in the present one. Regarding reproductive outcome the study gives some confidence that the safety measures which were implemented in the oncology departments around 1980 can protect the health personnel against adverse effects of ADs on reproduction.

In a lesser extent, volatile organic compounds (such as aldehydes) that have mainly respiratory effects are still studied. Assessing exposure to metals is still of concern, with increasing interest in bioaccessibility. Most of the papers on microbial exposure focused on respiratory tract infections, especially asthma linked to allergens and bio-aerosols. Physical exposure includes noise and electromagnetic fields, and articles dealt with the auditory and non auditory effects of noise. Articles on radiofrequency electromagnetic fields mainly concerned questions about non-thermal effects and papers on extremely low-frequency magnetic fields focused on the characterization of exposure. The impact of the indoor environment on children's health cannot be assessed merely by considering the effect of these different types of exposure: this review highlights new findings and also discusses the interactions between agents in indoor environments and also with social aspects...|$|E
40|$|Background: Phthalates {{have been}} shown to have <b>reprotoxic</b> effects in rodents and human during fetal life. Previous studies {{indicate}} that some members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamilly potentially mediate phthalate effects. This study aimed to assess if expression of these nuclear receptors are modulated in the response to MEHP exposure on the human fetal gonads in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings: Testes and ovaries from 7 to 12 gestational weeks human fetuses were exposed to 1024 M MEHP for 72 h in vitro. Transcriptional level of NRs and of downstream genes was then investigated using TLDA (TaqMan Low Density Array) and qPCR approaches. To determine whether somatic or germ cells of the testis are involved in the response to MEHP exposure, we developed a highly efficient cytometric germ cell sorting approach. In vitro exposure of fetal testes and ovaries to MEHP up-regulated the expression of LXRa, SREBP members and of downstream genes involved in the lipid and cholesterol synthesis in the whole gonad. In sorted testicular cells, this effect is only observable in somatic cells but not in the gonocytes. Moreover, the germ cell loss induced by MEHP exposure, that we previously described, is restricted to the male gonad as oogonia density is not affected in vitro. Conclusions/Significance: We evidenced {{for the first time that}} phthalate increases the levels of mRNA for LXRa, and SREBP members potentially deregulating lipids/cholesterol synthesis in human fetal gonads. Interestingly, this novel effect i...|$|E
40|$|Glyphosate {{is one of}} {{the most}} common active {{ingredients}} in plant protection products used to prevent unwanted plant growth in plant cultivation and to accelerate the maturation process of crops (desiccation). Glyphosate inhibits a plant enzyme which is essential for the biosynthesis of certain amino acids. This enzyme is not found in animals or humans. The approval procedure for glyphosate as an active ingredient is currently being revised at the European level. Germany is hereby the Rapporteur Member State (RMS). For the purpose of reassessing the health implications of this active substance, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has, in its capacity as the competent federal institute, examined and evaluated more than 150 new and original toxicological studies conducted in accordance with the OECD guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and over 900 new studies published in scientific journals, which included the analysis of numerous documents not previously considered. This investigation did not provide any indications that glyphosate has carcinogenic, <b>reprotoxic</b> or teratogenic effects on test animals, nor did the documents give any cause for substantially changing the health-based limit values. The first draft of the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) was issued at the end of 2013 and subsequently submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL). Adopting a peer review system, public consultation with experts and stakeholders was completed under the guidance of EFSA in 2014...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 {{individual}} fish {{samples were}} found to have elevated levels of perfluorinated surfac-tants (PS). Consequently, in the following two years certain foods were examined for their levels of PS {{within the framework of the}} nationwide monitoring plan and special monitoring programmes of the federal states. BfR has now evaluated the data submitted regarding health risks for con-sumers. However, the data only cover selected foods and the random samples are not rep-resentative. Hence they do not constitute the foundation for a reliable estimation of the health risk from the consumption of all foods. The main representatives of PSs are perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). They are extremely stable and can be detected everywhere in the environment. PFOS can accumulate in the food chain. After absorption PFOS and PFOA remain for a long time in the human organism. Both substances have demonstrated hepatotoxic, carcinogenic and <b>reprotoxic</b> properties in animal experiments. The result of the BfR evaluation was that, based on the latest scientific findings available, a health risk from the dietary intake of PFOS and PFOA is unlikely in conjunction with the lev-els in foods detected up to now. BfR is nonetheless of the opinion that the presence of PFOS in food should not be tolerated in the long-term. Based on the data available the main source of dietary intake of PFOS by consumers is saltwater or freshwater fish. BfR recommends collecting representative data on PFOS and PFOA levels in food...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{highlights}} {{the usefulness of}} gastropods for water quality monitoring. Gastropods were caged upstream and downstream of an effluent discharge. Exposure was assessed by measurement of organic contaminants in water. Contamination of the Potamopyrgus antipodarum mudsnail was also measured using innovative techniques {{at the end of}} the 42 days of exposure. Biological effects were measured at the individual level (growth, reproduction) and subindividual level (energy reserves, vitellin-like proteins, steroid levels, expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling pathways), thus providing a better understanding of <b>reprotoxic</b> effects. The effluent was mainly contaminated by pharmaceutical compounds, as was the mudsnail. The highest concentrations were measured for oxazepam and were higher than 2 mg/kg downstream of the effluent discharge. Alkylphenols, bisphenol A, and vertebrate-like sex-steroid hormones were also bioaccumulated by the mudsnail downstream of the effluent. The combined use of water and snail contamination provided a complete exposure assessment. Exposure was further linked to biological effects. The mudsnail was shown to be a better adapted species for in situ exposures than Valvata piscinalis. Reproduction was sharply decreased after 6 weeks of exposure in the mudsnail. Feeding issues were excluded, confirming the toxic origin. These effects were related to estrogen signaling pathways using genomic analysis. Genes coding for proteins involved in nongenomic signaling pathways were inhibited, and those of genomic pathway repressors were induced. These results suggest that the chemical contamination due to the effluent discharge altered steroid control of reproduction and blocked the transition between oocyte and unshelled embryo, resulting in a drastic decrease of embryo production, while survival was not affected...|$|E
