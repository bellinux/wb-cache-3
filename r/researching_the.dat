40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was {{to offer the}} simplistic model that can be {{implemented}} to provide customer satisfaction. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> implemented <b>the</b> descriptive qualitative methodology. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> design was Meta-analysis. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> finding indicated that product quality, customer services and trust positively affected the customer’s satisfaction. The product price affected the customer satisfaction in both negative and positive ways. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> relies on <b>the</b> analysis of quantitative and qualitative journals. The lack of quantitative <b>research</b> undermines <b>the</b> generalization level for <b>the</b> <b>research</b> findings. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> allows <b>the</b> provision of a customer satisfaction model that can be implemented in <b>the</b> <b>research</b> of <b>the</b> organization’s position. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> allows <b>the</b> provision of a customer satisfaction model that can be implemented is <b>the</b> <b>research</b> of <b>the</b> organization’s position...|$|R

5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. <b>Researching</b> <b>the</b> 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began <b>researching</b> <b>the</b> project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E

5|$|Considerable {{scholarship}} has been concentrated on <b>researching</b> <b>the</b> level of living standards during the Song dynasty.

Per capita consumption of grain and silk respectively was estimated by Cheng to be around 8 jin (about 400 g each) a day and 2 bolts a year, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while <b>researching</b> <b>the</b> Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|Gerolmo {{began work}} on the {{original}} script in 1985, after <b>researching</b> <b>the</b> 1964 murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. He and producer Frederick Zollo took the script to Orion Pictures, and Parker was subsequently hired by the studio to direct the film. Both the writer and director had disputes over the script, which resulted in Orion allowing Parker to make uncredited rewrites. Principal photography commenced in March 1988 and concluded in May of that year with a budget of $15 million. The film was shot {{in a number of}} locales in Mississippi and Alabama.|$|E

Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R.

5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment.

The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth.
