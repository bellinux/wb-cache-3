Microstructural changes induced by fatigue were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) and electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) techniques. Neutron diffraction and magnetic induction method were adopted for quantification of martensite content. Deformation-induced martensite formation in the bulk of material was evidenced for low temperature cyclic straining under various conditions. <b>Room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling,</b> even with high plastic strain amplitudes, results in a local very limited martensite formation in areas closely linked with the long fatigue crack growth...|$|E
40|$|We {{report that}} the <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> of CoO/Li cells {{involving}} two processes, the reduction of CoO → Co 0 {{and the growth of}} a polymer/gel-like film at high and low potentials, respectively, is extremely sensitive to cycling voltage ranges with the best results obtained when the cells are fully discharged. The low-voltage process is quite reversible over the 0. 02 to 1. 8 V range with a sustained capacity of about 150 mAh/g over a few hundred cycles. Within such a range of potential the polymer/gel-like is barely evolving while it vanishes as the oxidation potential is increased above 2 V. From the cyclic-voltammogram profiles we conclude that the origin of the low-voltage capacity is nested in the pseudocapacitive character of the in situ made polymeric/gel film. Tentative explanations based on comparisons with existing literature are made to explain such an unusual finding. © 2002 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|E

In {{order to address}} this issue, a structural and electrochemical study of LiMn 2 O 4 -based systems at room and elevated temperatures were undertaken. Some of the spinel material characteristics such as morphology, defects, surface area, structural instability, single-versus two-phase lithium-insertion processes, cation and oxygen stoichiometry, and manganese solubility were investigated. We found that the sample surface area, which also influences the manganese dissolution and electrolyte oxidation, {{is one of the}} most critical parameters in controlling the rate of irreversible self-discharge, with the lowest irreversible self-discharge being observed for samples with the lowest surface area.

The sensitivity of these fluctuations {{to the underlying}} disorder potential has only recently been fully realized. We exploit this sensitivity to obtain a novel tool for better understanding the role that background impurities play in the electrical properties of high-mobility AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures and nanoscale devices.

40|$|Solid {{lubricants}} possessing {{low friction}} coefficients, low wear rates, and long wear lives are vital for significantly increasing {{the life span}} of instruments undergoing extreme frictional wear due to harsh environments. Solid lubricants currently used in high temperatures or excess humidity, such as MoS 2, WS 2, graphite, or noble metals, are unable to sustain superior frictional qualities over extended amounts of time or in changing environments. To ameliorate these limiting properties, a composite solid lubricant is produced to enable the favorable frictional properties of one lubricant to overcome the lacking frictional properties of the other. This composite uses the combined materials to produce a solid lubricant that can sustain a low friction coefficient and wear rate for a longer amount of time than each individual material. MoS 2 electrodeposited on to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has a lower friction coefficient in humid (~ 0. 16), non-humid (~ 0. 05) and non-humid/humid cycled (~ 0. 075 - 0. 2) environments than either bare MoS 2 or bare CNTs. Similarly, silver deposited on CNTs, by electrodeposition, electroless deposition, and sputter coating, performs better in <b>room</b> <b>temperature,</b> high temperature (500 °C), and <b>room</b> temperature/high <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> environments than either of its individual materials. Using the techniques used to produce these solid lubricant composite coatings with appealing frictional properties will provide a variety of tribological applications involving high temperature and/or high humidity environments with necessary solutions and further facilitate the improvement of solid lubricants used in other extreme environments...|$|R

40|$|Statement of Problem. Resin-based cements {{have become}} {{increasingly}} more popular for the cementation of prefabricated endodontic dowels due to their superior retention. The manufacturer of Panavia F 2. 0 suggests that the product be stored under refrigerated conditions while not in use, however, there is no literature to support such a rationale. It is possible that these storage/use <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> events may have a deleterious effect on the retention of prefabricated endodontic dowels. Purpose. The purpose of this in-vitro {{study was to investigate}} the retention of Panavia F 2. 0 used to lute prefabricated endodontic dowels after the Panavia F 2. 0 system has been kept under different storage conditions. Material and Methods. Sixty-four extracted human central incisors were selected to undergo root canal therapy and dowel retention testing. Four separate Panavia F 2. 0 cement systems were placed under 4 different storage conditions for a period of 6 months, until retention testing was initiated. In the first group, the Panavia F 2. 0 was stored under the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s suggested refrigerated conditions, at a constant temperature of 40 °F. In the second group, the Panavia F 2. 0 was stored under a constant 90 °F temperature. In the third group, the Panavia F 2. 0 was stored under <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions of 70 °F. The fourth group attempted to mimic clinical usage conditions with the Panavia F 2. 0 being cycled from refrigeration at 40 °F for 22 hours/day to 2 hours/day of <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> at 70 °F 5 days per week {{for the duration of the}} 6 -month storage condition period. Results. Stress values were analyzed using 1 -way ANOVA. A Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD multiple comparison analysis of the dowel retention strengths indicated that the group stored at 90 °F resulted in the lowest retention. This group was significantly lower than all other groups 2 ̆ 7 retention strength (p Conclusions. Within the limitations of this study, the storage of Panavia F 2. 0 at either <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> or <b>cycling</b> between refrigeration and <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> yields similar dowel retention values. However, the storage of Panavia F 2. 0 at temperatures of 90 °F for prolonged periods causes poor dowel retention.

However, the storage of the Panavia F 2. 0 cementation system at temperatures of 90 °F for prolonged periods will affect dowel retention and is therefore not advisable...|$|R

The solder ball strength and the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> reliability of reballed components were independent of the reballing method. The <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> reliability of mixed assemblies was equivalent to that of lead-free assemblies. Microstructure differences in lead-free, mixed and reballed tin-lead assemblies were investigated to explain the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> reliability results. Lead-free and mixed assemblies were subjected to the rework process. <b>Temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> test was used to evaluate the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> reliability of reworked assemblies. Cu over-consumption, Cu pad dissolution and thick interfacial intermetallic layer were found in the reworked assemblies. Microstructural investigation and geometry analysis were used to analyze the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> reliability degradation in the reworked assemblies after multiples rework processes...|$|R

40|$|Neutron powder {{diffraction}} at {{pressures to}} 6 kbar in gaseous Ne {{has been used}} to study the pressure-induced phase transition and compressibilities of Na{sub 2 }CsC{sub 60 }. The pressure-induced phase can be achieved by compression to about 5 kbar at <b>room</b> <b>temperature.</b> If cooled, this phase can be retained below 200 K upon release of the pressure. The structure is orthorhombic as previously reported (but may differ in its detailed crystal structure) with lattice constants near 80 K and ambient pressure of a= 9. 385 A, b= 10. 06 A, and c= 14. 36 A. Corresponding linear compressibilities are 0. 0004, 0014, and 0. 0017 kbar{sup - 1 }, respectively. Identical pressure <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> results in a superconductor with an unexpectedly low pressure dependence for {Tc} while in this phase. Models for the superconducting behavior of this compound are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> {{in power}} ICs is a {{reliability}} hazard, {{even more so}} when electromigration is playing a role as well. The frequency of the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> is in the audio domain, which {{makes it impossible to}} test in environmental chambers. In the paper, the design and application of a novel test chip to study fast <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling,</b> electromigration and their interaction in multilevel interconnection systems is reported. Incorporated into the test chip are a heating element, a temperature sensor, and extrusion monitors. Simulation was used to study the initial stress distributions after processing and local temperature distributions in the test chip during the temperature transient. First experimental results have been obtained in the area of fast <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> experiments (by using internal heating only) and electromigration experiments. Failure distributions and failure modes are discussed. Results indicate that on-chip cycling is a powerful tool to study reliability of power ICs under realistic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Flip-chip {{interconnect}} electronic package boards {{have been}} assembled, underlilled, non-destructively evaluated and subsequently subjected to extreme <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycling</b> {{to assess the}} reliability of this advanced packaging interconnect technology for future deep space, long-term, extreme temperature missions. ill this very preliminary study, the employed temperature range covers military specifications (- 5 SoC to 100 °C), extreme cold Martian (- 120 °C to 115 °C) and asteroid Nereus (- 180 °C to 25 °C) environments. The resistance of daisy-chained, flip-chip interconnects were measured at <b>room</b> <b>temperature</b> and at various intervals {{as a function of}}extreme <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycling.</b> Electrical resistance measurements are reported and the tests to date have not shown significant change in resistance as a function of extreme <b>temperature</b> thermal <b>cycling.</b> However, the change in interconnect resistance becomes more noticeable with increasing number of thennal cycles. Further research work has been carried out to understand the reliability of flip-chip interconnect packages under extreme temperature applications (- 1900 C to 85 oC) via continuously monitoring the daisy chain resistance. Adaptation of suitable diagnostic techniques to identify the failure mechanisms is in progress. This presentation will describe the experimental test results of flip-chip testing under extreme temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether the behaviour of thermophilic bacteria growing as biofilms would change after being subjected to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling.</b> It was used to test the practicality of a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> method for use in the heat transfer sections (milk pre-heaters and evaporators) of dairy plants for reducing the biofilm growth of thermophilic bacteria. Biofilms may protect bacterial cells from cleaning-in-place operations (CIP). CIP is the standard technique for cleaning dairy plant in New Zealand (AS/NZS 2541, 1998). If the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> method is used in the heat transfer sections of dairy plants, surviving thermophilic bacteria in the form of biofilms may be continuously exposed to the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> environment; thus a sub-population which is resistant to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> may adhere in greater numbers or grow more efficiently under the selective conditions. Wild-type strains of Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Anoxybacillus flavithermus were isolated from a commercial milk powder sample obtained from a milk powder production plant in New Zealand. These two wild-type strains were subjected to a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> regime consisting of 55 ºC for 15 minutes then 35 ºC for 35 minutes for 192 hours using a modified Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) thermocycler and hexagonal flat stainless steel reactors. At the end of each of four serial experiments, sub-population isolates for both species were obtained from the effluent milk. Wild-type strains and the sub-population strains of these two organisms were tested for the ability to adhere and grow as biofilms on stainless steel surfaces by using a Centre for Disease Control (CDC) biofilm reactor. The cell counts per unit area of adhesion, maximum specific growth rates (μmax) of the biofilms, and cells released in out-flowing milk were measured. The analysed data of the wild-type strain and the sub-population strain of each organism were compared by using p-value of 2 samples t-test statistical analysis to check whether the strains had adapted to the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> treatment. The results showed that the ability of planktonic cells of the wild-type A. flavithermus strain to adhere to stainless steel surfaces was significantly changed with p-value = 0. 001 (0. 05). In contrast, the sub-population of G. stearothermophilus was significantly different from the wild-type after being subjected to 192 hours <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling.</b> The G. stearothermophilus sub-population strain was more resistant to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling,</b> having a greater ability to adhere (p-value = 0. 000 < 0. 05) and grow as a biofilm (p-value = 0. 008 < 0. 05) than the wild-type strain. Since G. stearothermophilus is a common contaminant in dairy plants, the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycling</b> method may not be a viable long-term solution for dairy plants for reducing the growth rates of thermophilic bacteria, and further studies, such as different temperature profiles both in terms of magnitude and duration, are required...|$|R
