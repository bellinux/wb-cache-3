5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E
25|$|The coal used in {{the next}} step must be low in {{nitrogen}} to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, {{in the form of}} limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> at about 1000°C.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, this method was gradually superseded by <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> smelting, which used higher temperatures and powdered anthracite as fuel and had the advantage of not requiring a forced draught of air. The smelting house at Eylesbarrow tin mine which was in operation {{during the first half of}} the 19th century had two furnaces, one of each type.|$|E

50|$|While <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{have very}} low copper losses to slag, {{they are not}} very {{energy-efficient}} and the low concentrations of sulfur dioxide in their offgases make its capture uneconomic. Consequently, smelter operators devoted {{a lot of money}} in the 1970s and 1980s to developing new, more efficient copper smelting processes. In addition, flash smelting technologies had been developed in earlier years and began to replace <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces.</b> By 2002, 20 of the 30 <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> still operating in 1994 had been shut down.|$|R

25|$|Mill No.5, {{which had}} the smelter attached, was {{completed}} by 1822. The smelting house (shown here as it looks today) had two furnaces. There was a <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> —the large squared block in the foreground was part of this; and an older-style blast furnace, similar in design to a blowing house, but with a unique flue running up the hillside behind to a short stack. The two large standing and three fallen granite blocks towards {{the back of the}} building are the remains of this furnace.|$|E
25|$|The final liquor {{is treated}} by blowing carbon dioxide through it. This {{precipitates}} dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H2S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding zinc hydroxide. The liquor {{is separated from}} the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace.</b> The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids that fail to dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.|$|E
25|$|The cupola was a <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace.</b> The fuel {{was burned}} in a {{combustion}} chamber {{at the side}} of the furnace, separate from the “charge” of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.|$|E

50|$|The <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> were {{replaced}} with a single BBOC with a charge capacity of 6 t of feed. The cycle time was reduced to 50 hours. The use of the BBOC reduced the energy consumption from 74 GJ/t to 27 GJ/t and also had better bismuth elimination than the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{were perhaps}} in the medieval period, and were used for melting bronze for casting bells. They were first applied to {{smelting}} metals in the late 17th century. Sir Clement Clerke and his son Talbot built cupolas or <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> in the Avon Gorge below Bristol in about 1678. In 1687, while obstructed from smelting lead (by litigation), they moved on to copper. In the following decades, <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> were widely adopted for smelting these metals and also tin. They had the advantage over older methods that the fuel was mineral coal, not charcoal or 'white coal' (chopped dried wood).|$|R
25|$|Completion of the Low Horse Level in the 1840s {{meant that}} new ore {{dressing}} facilities were needed {{at a lower}} level than at the old High Mill. A new Low Mill was built near the smelt mill, with a self-acting incline to lower wagons of ore to the new mill. There it was crushed, washed, and the concentrated ore was delivered to the smelt mill. Leats from Glenridding Beck brought a plentiful supply of water to operate the machinery at the mill. Increased ore production in the 1840s also meant that the smelting capacity had to be increased. One <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> {{seems to have been}} installed in 1844, with more in 1851. These could process much larger amounts of lead ore, but were expensive to run, consuming large amounts to coal, and needing frequent replacements of their fireclay brick linings. They were soon abandoned and a number of the simpler ore hearths were installed in 1855. Since these produced greater quantities of lead dust and fumes, the flue was extended {{at the same time to}} the new chimney.|$|E
25|$|The most {{distinctive}} landmark {{to the north}} of the summit is the ruins of the flue chimney of the former lead works at Ballycorus. Open-cast mining began at this site, just below the western side of the flue chimney, around 1807 and the site was taken over by the Mining Company of Ireland (MCI) in 1826 who undertook underground mining in the area intermittently up until 1863. Two veins of lead and a vein of silver were worked during this period. However, most of the activity at Ballycorus occurred at the smelting facility constructed by MCI in the valley below the mine workings. Here, lead from Ballycorus, as well as lead from mines in counties Donegal, Wicklow and Wexford, was processed using a <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace.</b> After the mine was exhausted in the 1860s, the smelting facilities continued to receive and process ore from MCI's mines at Glendalough, County Wicklow. In the 1880s it was no longer commercially viable to process Irish ores and the smelter was put to work processing ore from the Great Laxey mine in the Isle of Man up until closure in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Things only became {{worse when}} the English {{figured out how}} to cast the more {{economical}} iron cannons (1547), following on their feat of becoming the armorers of the European continent's powers by having been leading producers brass and bronze guns, and eventually by various acts of Parliament, gradually banned or restricted the further cutting of trees for charcoal in larger and larger regions in the United Kingdom. In 1611, a consortium led by courtier Edward Zouch was granted a patent for the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace,</b> a furnace using coal, not precious national timber reserves, which was immediately employed in glass making. An early politically connected and wealthy Robber Baron figure Sir Robert Mansell bought his way into the fledgling furnace company wrested control of it, and by 1615 managed to have James I issued a proclamation forbidding the use of wood to produce glass, giving his families extensive coal holdings a monopoly on both source and means of production for nearly half-a-century. Abraham Darby a century later relocated to Bristol where he had established a building brass and bronze industry by importing Dutch workers and using them to raid Dutch techniques. Both materials were considered superior to iron for cannon, and machines as they were better understood. But Darby would change the world in several key ways.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the copper ISASMELT {{demonstration}} plant was integrated into copper smelter operations and {{justified by the}} 20% (30,000 t/y) increase in copper production that it provided. It quickly treated the entire backlog of converter slag concentrate, {{which could not be}} treated at high rates in the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> without generating magnetite ("Fe3O4") accretions that would necessitate shutting down the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> for their removal.|$|R
500|$|In 1678 Clement Clerke {{introduced}} the coal-powered <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace,</b> greatly increasing {{the quantity of}} metal extractable from ore. The Mines Royal Act 1689 ended Crown ownership of Cornwall's mines, allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations. At the same time, the Nine Years' War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) caused high demand for metals. As a consequence the Midlands, with easy river and canal access to the coal mines of Wales and northern England and to the metal mines of Cornwall, became a major centre for metallurgy. Ore was shipped from Cornwall up the River Severn to smelters in Gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to the factories surrounding Birmingham. Financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising the mines of Cornwall. With a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly-populated Cornwall, and with a prevalent belief that {{women and children were}} best suited to ore separation (which required dexterity and good observation skills but {{little in the way of}} physical strength), the large-scale recruitment of women and girls to the mines began. It is around this time that the term [...] "bal maiden" [...] appears to have come into common usage, derived from the Old Cornish [...] (mine). A significant proportion of Cornwall's young women quickly became involved in mining; by 1736 the vicar of Ludgvan was complaining that he was unable to hire servants as the young women of the town were [...] "employed about copper".|$|E

2500|$|Puddling {{produced}} a structural grade iron {{at a relatively}} low cost. Puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod. [...] The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler. [...] When the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it. [...] Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work. [...] Few puddlers lived to be 40. [...] Puddling was done in a <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace,</b> allowing coal or coke {{to be used as}} fuel. [...] The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel. [...] Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised.|$|E

50|$|In 1884 the Frampton United Company {{was formed}} {{in an attempt to}} {{establish}} a chlorination plant but the following year Wattle Creek on which the crushing operations depended dried up and crushing operations were halted. In 1886 five <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> were set up at the Frampton United Company lease, to be operated in conjunction with a chlorination plant for gold retrieval. Frampton United Company then erected a barrel chlorination plant and with the 5 <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> achieved a throughput capacity of 60 tons per week at a cost of £3,000.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{smelting}} {{and refining}} of iron, coal {{and to a}} lesser degree coke produced inferior iron than charcoal because the impurities in coal, at least until solutions to contamination were developed. Use of coal in smelting started somewhat before the Industrial Revolution, based on innovations by Sir Clement Clerke and others from 1678, using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas. These were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture, reducing the oxide to metal. This has the advantage that impurities (such as sulphur ash) in the coal do not migrate into the metal. This technology was applied to lead from 1678 and to copper from 1687. It was also applied to iron foundry work in the 1690s, but in this case the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> was known as an air furnace. (The foundry cupola is a different (and later) innovation.) ...|$|E
50|$|The ASARCO Amarillo copper {{refinery}} switched in 1991 from <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> {{treatment of}} anode slimes to a BBOC {{to reduce the}} gold inventory. The original <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> had a 15 t capacity. The production cycle of the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> was typically 7-10 days, with the final doré production being about 8 t per cycle.|$|E
50|$|In March 1971, the {{practice}} of returning converter slag to the reverberatory furnaces to recover the contained copper was discontinued. The slag return was a problem {{because of the high}} level of magnetite ("Fe3O4") in the slag. Magnetite has a higher liquidus temperature than the iron oxide ("FeO") normally found in the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace</b> slag and it precipitated, causing a growing accretion in the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace,</b> thus reducing the storage capacity of the furnace. MIM changed its converter slag copper-recovery practice in 1971, and instead of returning all the hot converter slag to the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace,</b> allowed some of the slag to cool slowly and then treated it in the copper concentrator to produce a converter slag concentrate. This improved operating conditions within the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Anode slimes are {{composed}} of the solid particles that do not dissolve in the electrolyte in the refining cells. This includes the gold and silver present in the copper anodes that are being refined. As with recovering silver in lead smelting, <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> are often used in the copper refining industry for the purification and recovery of gold and silver from anode slimes. [...] However, the <b>reverberatory</b> <b>furnaces</b> suffer from similar disadvantages in copper anode doré production {{as they do in}} lead refineries, including resulting in a large inventory of gold in the system.
