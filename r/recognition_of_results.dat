40|$|Abstract − Technical {{barrier to}} trade (TBT) {{has become one of}} the {{significant}} non-tariff measures with the advent of the WTO system in 1995. The key issue in TBT is that technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment should not be used as barriers to trade. Regarding conformity assessment, the WTO/TBT Agreement recommends members to enter into negotiations for the mutual <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> of each other’s conformity assessment, as well as to permit participation of conformity assessment bodies located in other members. In this paper, it will be reviewed why the role of measurement science is important in terms of international effort to eliminate technical barriers to trade particularly in the area of conformity assessment...|$|E

Yet, the results of action research often remain restricted to an organization’s context. In order {{to allow for a}} generalization and broader <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> we abstract patterns of teaching/learning activities, organize them in a reusable, conceptual framework, and complement them with useful parameters as well as results from their application. Our proceeding is guided by the Person-Centered Approach that we adopt for blended learning and project work. This paper describes the pattern repository on PCeL (Person-Centered e-Learning) as the central structure within our action research framework and discusses means of generalizing and objectifying our findings...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the most useful}} findings of gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3. 0 Tesla (T) MRI for differentiating focal eosinophilic infiltration (FEI) from hepatic metastasis with verification of their usefulness. Materials and Methods: Pathologically or clinically proven 39 FEIs from 25 patients and 79 hepatic metastases from 51 patients {{were included in the}} study. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3. 0 T MRI was performed in all cancer patients. Size differences measured between T 2 -weighted and hepatobiliary-phase images for lesions> 1 cm and morphologic findings (margin, shape, signal intensity on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images, enhancement pattern on dynamic images, and target appearance on hepatobiliary-phase images) were compared between two groups via Student’s t test as well as univariate and multivariate analyses. Diagnostic predictive values of two observers for differentiating two groups were assessed before (session 1) and after (session 2) <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Results: Mean size difference (2. 1 mm) in FEIs between the two images was significantly greater than for metastases (0. 7 mm) (p < 0. 05). An ill-defined margin and isointensity on T 1 -weighted images were independently significant morphologic findings (p < 0. 05) for differentiating the two groups. All observers achieved a higher diagnostic accuracy in session 2 (97 % and 98 %) than session 1 (92 % and 89 %) with statistical significance in observer 2 (p < 0. 05). All observers had significantly higher sensitivities (95 %) and negative predictive values (NPVs) (98 %) in session 2 than in session 1 (sensitivity, 74 % in two observers; NPV, 89 % and 88 %) (p < 0. 05) ...|$|E
