Generally, the miscibility between the refrigerant and refrigeration oil must be assured, because the oil needs to return to the compressor from the refrigeration cycle and lubricate the sliding parts. Alternative oils with good miscibility with HFCs have been developed, because mineral oil, the primary oil used with R- 22, has low miscibility with HFC. The chlorine atoms which make up R- 22 create excellent extreme pressure performance on the sliding parts in compressors; however, they are the cause of the depletion of the ozone layer. Because HFC does not have any chlorine atoms in its molecular structure, it is essential to prevent the sliding parts from scuffing (seizing) and wearing when using HFC in the compressors,. Therefore, anti-wear additives are added to the oils, and alternative sliding materials and surface treatments have been used in rotary, swing and scroll compressors which are fitted to <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners</b> in Japan.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{developing}} optimized control algorithm for room air-conditioners to ensure their energy efficiency, a short time interval (i. e., one minute) simulation of building thermal performance is necessary because the sampling time interval for <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> control is one minute in general. This paper studies the short-time interval room air temperature simulation method using the response factor method. Using the simulated room air temperature, an air-conditioner's running time can be known so that its energy consumption can be estimated accurately. In order to verify the simulation accuracy, an actual room equipped with a gas-engine heat pump (GHP) air-conditioning system is studied by both simulation and measurement. The cooling amount produced by the GHP is calculated using measured refrigerant pressure and temperature at condenser and evaporator respectively. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between measured cooling amount and simulated cooling load is 18. 9 percent of the average measured value. The profile of simulated room air temperature in both air-conditioned daytime and nighttime without air-conditioning can match the measured room air temperature. With respect to the estimated energy consumption, the profile of simulated energy consumption can match the measured data. The simulation accuracy of room air temperature and energy consumption during the air-conditioner start-up period is not good {{and needs to be}} improved in future research.

In a multi-family building in New Jersey, thirteen room air conditioners were instrumented in eight apartments, and the residents were interviewed about their cooling needs, decisions about when to turn on their air-conditioning, and their conceptions and operations of the units. Residents were not billed separately for electricity. They nevertheless limited their use of air-conditioning on the basis of many non-economic factors, including: daily schedule, folk theories about how air conditioners function and the body 2 ̆ 7 s heat tolerance, personal strategies for dealing with all machines, and beliefs and preferences concerning health, thermal comport, and alternative cooling strategies. Across physically similar apartments, seasonal air-conditioner energy consumption varied by two to three orders of magnitude while interior temperature varied by only 2. 4 °C to 3. 7 °C (4. 3 – 6. 7 °F). The least-frequent users were effectively achieving comport at greatly reduced energy consumption, but they were not reducing peak demand since they ran their units only on peak hours of the hottest days of the summer. Three-quarters of the residents did not use their thermostats, controlling cooling instead by switching their units on and off manually. Only one resident consistently let his air conditioner operate thermostatically, and many were not aware that their units had thermostats.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} strategic responses of Indian <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> (RAC) manufacturers to changes in the business environment, specifically those brought about by economic liberalisation, market reform, and new foreign competition post 1991. Strategic management literature is replete with appeals for examining developing economy industries in a state of transition, yet very little data exist pertaining to the strategic responses of firms as they adjust to increasing competitive pressures, both domestic and foreign, within the Indian market. Using an emerging market- strategic factor - corporate strategy conceptual model developed by the researcher from strategic management literature, this research investigates how Indian RAC firms have been responding to the changes brought about by liberalisation and reform. Information was gathered by means of semi-structured interviews with respondents at three different levels within the domestic <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> industry. These included industry experts, RAC manufacturers, and dealers of RACs. In addition, secondary data was also collected in order to examine the strategic behaviour of RAC manufacturers over the past fifteen years, thereby providing a contextual/historical background to the primary data. The strategic analysis undertaken of the Indian RAC industry and the capture of rich data, obtained from the in-depth interviews in particular, make a major contribution to strategic management knowledge - specifically within an emerging market context such as India. The research findings show that liberalisation and reforms have increased foreign and domestic competition within the Indian RAC industry and substantially raised consumer demand levels. The results demonstrate that the institutional environment, and the RAC industry structure and market settings have {{had a significant impact on}} domestic organisations' strategy. Firm-specific resources and network/relationship capabilities, however, have exerted a smaller influence since the onset of economic reforms. Yet, the importance of the resource and relational perspectives can beseen in Indian RAC firms' responses to the changing environment.

40|$|Mandatory energy {{codes to}} curb energy use of {{residential}} buildings have been formally launched in China {{for more than}} two decades but little has been publicized in literature. Similar codes are not available for residential buildings in Hong Kong, but most residential buildings in Hong Kong, especially public housing estates, are HK-BEAM certified to demonstrate their compliance with regulatory and basic design requirements. Given HK-BEAM is internationally recognized and there are doubts about the effectiveness of the China codes, how the energy efficiency of the HK-BEAM certified buildings compare with buildings in compliance with the China codes is of interest to most building designers and policy makers. This paper describes how the energy efficiency of a case study building in compliance with the China codes compare with the one in compliance with HK-BEAM. The energy simulation by HTB 2 and BECRES reveal that the case study building in compliance with the China codes is 51. 1 % better in energy use. In the study, the relative impact of each compliance criterion on energy use and cooling load has been quantified by sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity values indicate that energy use is most sensitive to air-conditioning operation hours, indoor design temperature, coefficient of performance (COP) of the <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners</b> (RAC) units, and the envelop characteristics. The results of this study indicate that a HK-BEAM certified building cannot satisfy the China codes requirements.

40|$|China {{is already}} the second's largest energy {{consumer}} in the world after the United States, and its demand for energy {{is expected to continue}} to grow rapidly in the foreseeable future, due to its fast economic growth and its low level of energy use per capita. From 2001 to 2005, the growth rate of energy consumption in China has exceeded the growth rate of its economy (NBS, 2006), raising serious concerns about the consequences of such energy use on local environment and global climate. It is widely expected that China is likely to overtake the US in energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{during the first half of}} the 21 st century. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the international community in searching for options that may help China slow down its growth in energy consumption and GHG emissions through improving energy efficiency and adopting more environmentally friendly fuel supplies such as renewable energy. This study examines the energy saving potential of three major residential energy end uses: household refrigeration, air-conditioning, and water heating.

Sales of household refrigerators, <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners,</b> and water heaters are growing rapidly due to rising incomes and booming housing market.

Therefore, the potential for energy savings through improving appliance efficiency is substantial.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BSE 2016 Jiaxxii, 157 pages :illustrations (some color) In {{subtropical}} climates such as Hong Kong's, air-conditioning {{and domestic}} water heating are two dominant energy end-uses in residential buildings. Local {{statistics show that}} out of the total energy consumption of the residential sector, 23 % goes to air-conditioning and 19 % goes to water heating. These figures clearly show that a technology that can simultaneously reduce energy use for space cooling and water heating is highly valuable. Water heating utilizing condenser heat rejected from a refrigeration cycle is considered to be an energy efficient measure for domestic hot water production due to the associated heating efficiency is always higher than unity. On this basis, heat pump water heater is widely investigated for use in residential buildings. However, a majority of previous studies focused only on its heating capacity at the condenser. The cooling performance at the evaporator under various operation conditions was seldom studied. This is because heat pump water heaters are often used as stand-alone water heating appliances with evaporator leaving air discharged to outdoors and thus the associated cooling effect is unexploited. Economic barrier also exists to limit its use in residential buildings, since a considerable investment must be made in the heat pump by the user. Therefore, a technology that allows a <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> to serve the combined purpose of space cooling and water heating is preferred, {{due to the fact that}} air-conditioners are commonly equipped in Hong Kong households to combat the hot and humid summer. However, considering the differences between a heat pump and a <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner,</b> relevant research works are limited in public domain. In view of this, a storage-enhanced heat recovery <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> (SEHRAC) was proposed. Besides space cooling, this installation can also provide water heating utilizing recovered condenser heat. In this study, the effectiveness, energy performance, operation characteristics, and performance improvement of SEHRAC when used for combined space cooling and water heating were investigated. For the application of SEHRAC, a major concern is whether or not the amount of recoverable heat can meet the household water heating demand. The concern is particularly prominent in Hong Kong because most local residential units are small but the occupancy density is high (average living space is 12. 9 m²/person). The small space cooling load and thus the small amount of recoverable heat may not be sufficient to offset the high water heating demand. To address the concern, a typical residential estate in Hong Kong was chosen for a supply and demand analysis. The analysis was based on hour-by-hour simulations using actual building characteristics and realistic equipment performance data. It was found that if a water tank was used for thermal energy storage, the daily cumulative recoverable heat far exceeded the daily household water heating demand, confirming the effective use of SEHRAC in Hong Kong. Further, for optimal design of the water tank of SEHRAC, its design requirements including the minimum required heat storage capacity and heat transfer effectiveness were also determined and discussed. Room air-conditioners are often sized for satisfying peak cooling loads. At part load conditions, most air-conditioners operate intermittently to regulate their cooling outputs for maintaining the indoor set-point temperature. Intermittent operation of SEHRAC can lead to significant fluctuations in operating parameters on the refrigerant side. Adding that capillary tube is often used as the expansion device to magnify the fluctuations, whether SEHRAC can still operate satisfactorily in practice is of concern. Further, as operation of SEHRAC is affected by outdoor temperature and space cooling load, their influences on the energy performance of SEHRAC also need to be ascertained. In view of this, a prototype SEHRAC was designed and setup for laboratory experiments. The experimental results confirmed the satisfactory operation of SEHRAC. Its overall coefficient of performance (COP) was also found better than conventional <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> for a range of outdoor temperatures and space cooling load conditions. On this basis, a prediction model was developed for evaluating the sole use of SEHRAC for water heating in the entire air-conditioned season. The potential water heating energy saving on wider application of SEHRAC was estimated to be 9. 1 % of the overall energy consumption of the residential sector in Hong Kong. Considering the significant refrigerant pressure fluctuations during the operation of SEHRAC, the selection of a suitable type of expansion device that can function properly despite the fluctuations is very important. In this study, the use of capillary tube (CT) and thermostatic expansion valve (TEV) in SEHRAC were side-by-side compared with the aim of optimizing the system configuration of SEHRAC. A prototype SEHRAC, which could be switched between the CT and TEV systems, was used for two identical sets of experiments. For each set of experiments, a series of tests under different outdoor temperatures were conducted. It was found that TEV could better regulate the refrigerant flow, maintain a stable evaporator superheat, and minimize the rise in refrigerant vapor content at the evaporator inlet during the operation of SEHRAC. The space cooling and water heating capacities for the TEV system were on average 16. 3 % to 19. 4 % and 18. 5 % to 23. 4 %, respectively, larger than the CT system. Its overall COP was also found 12. 5 % to 20. 9 % higher for the range of outdoor temperatures. Accumulation of heat in the water tank of SEHRAC can result in an increase in tank water temperature, which will unavoidably affect the space cooling and water heating performances of SEHRAC. Measures to enhance the heat storage capacity of the water tank will thus be beneficial to the overall performance of SEHRAC. For achieving this objective, the use of phase change material (PCM) in the water tank was proposed in this study. To confirm and quantify the resultant performance improvement, laboratory experiments were conducted with and without the use of PCM (abbreviated as wPCM and woPCM scenarios). It was confirmed that the PCM could function as an internal heat sink to lower the rate of water temperature increase and to enhance the heat storage capacity of the water tank. As a result, the space cooling and water heating capacities for the wPCM scenario, as compared to the woPCM scenario, were 5. 4 % and 16. 1 % larger, respectively. The overall COP was therefore found 6. 9 % to 9. 8 % higher. It was also revealed that the use of PCM could extend the heat retention time of the tank water by 21. 1 %. From the above, the academic contributions of this thesis can be summarized into four aspects. First, the effectiveness of SEHRAC in satisfying the daily space cooling and water heating demands of Hong Kong households was confirmed.

40|$|Air-conditioning {{system is}} {{important}} in nowadays life style due to it is capable to maintain the level of life in comfort level. Due to its functions, which are to maintain {{the temperature in the}} room, also to control the cleanness in <b>room,</b> <b>air-conditioner</b> is among the popular device that been use around the world. It’s having been use widely in houses, office rooms, supermarkets and cars. This thesis represents the analysis of air-conditioning system in Waja car, which is common car use by Malaysian. The objective of this thesis is to analysis the relationship of performance of air-conditioning system and speed of compressor with period of time. The thesis describes the fundamental of air-conditioning system, the way the system works and briefly explanation of each component involved in air-conditioning system. The experiment procedures are explained to obtain the important parameters and data. Finally, manual calculation is used to calculate the coefficient of performance of the system. The acquired results indicate the performance is decrease due to higher speed of compressor and the longer the system running. The obtained results show the performance decrease slightly in low speed of compressor compared than in high sped of compressor. The results concluded that the system at the unsteady state in low speed of compressor and it is become steady state at high speed of compressor. However the experiment is done with no velocity of winds outside the system. The results maybe change if the car is moving in high speed because the winds can help in heat transfer in condenser. The results can significantly reduce the cost of fuel when the car in standstill state...|$|E
40|$|Air-conditioning {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{consumers}} of electrical energy in many parts of the world today and already today air-conditioning causes energy shortage in for example China. The demand can be expected to increase because of changing working times, increased comfort expectations and global warming. Air-conditioning systems in use are most often built around a vapor compression systems driven by grid-electricity. However, most ways of generating the electricity today, as weil as the refrigerants being used in traditional vapor compression systems, have negative impact on the environment, Solar air-conditioning might be a way to reduce the demand for electricity. In addition many solar air-conditioning systems are constructed in ways that eliminate the need for CFC, HCFC or HFC refrigerants. Alternatives to using solar energy are to use waste heat from different industrial processes such as refineries, garbage treatment facilities etc. Even driving the airconditioning systems directly with fossil fuels might in some cases be a more environmental friendly alternative than using electricity This report deals with a wide range of components, from <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners</b> to solar collectors, which can be used as subcomponents in a solar air-conditioning system. However, most of the components and subsystems covered are not only suitable for solar air-conditioning. Some components are used for electrically, mechanically or heat driven airconditioning, And of course other sources of mechanical energy or heat could be used for powering these components. Other components are used for solar energy collection and storage, which can be used in solar energy system with other purposes than just driving a solar air-conditioning system. An aim of the report is to describe and explain the working principles of the components and subsystem in such general terms that the report is usable not only to those specifically interested in solar air conditioning, but to anyone interested in air conditioning, heat driven air-conditioning and solar energy. The last section of the report briefly deals with how the components can be combined to form a complete solar air-conditioning system...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{efficient}} energy utilization {{becomes an}} essential requirement for data centers, especially in data centers of world-leading companies, where "Green Data Center" defines a new term for an environment-concerned data center. Solutions to change existing a data center {{to the green}} one may vary. In the big company, high-cost approaches including re-planning server <b>rooms,</b> changing <b>air-conditioners,</b> buying low-powered servers, and equipping sophisticating environmental control equipments are possible, but not for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and academic sectors which have limited budget. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SENVM, used to monitor and control air temperature in a server room to be in appropriate condition, not too cold, where very unnecessary cooling leads to unnecessary extra electricity expenses, and also inefficient in energy utilization. With implementing on an emerging technology, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Green Data Center is feasible to every small data center with no wiring installation, easy deployment, and low maintenance fee. In addition, the prototype of the system has been tested, and {{the first phase of}} the project is deployed in a real-world data center. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{we present}} {{the results of an}} {{analytical}} cost/benefit study of residential smart appliances from a utility/grid perspective in support of a joint stakeholder petition to the ENERGY STAR program within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy (DOE). The goal of the petition is in part to provide appliance manufacturers incentives to hasten the production of smart appliances. The underlying hypothesis is that smart appliances can {{play a critical role in}} addressing some of the societal challenges, such as anthropogenic global warming, associated with increased electricity demand, and facilitate increased penetration of renewable sources of power. The appliances we consider include refrigerator/freezers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners,</b> and dishwashers. The petition requests the recognition that providing an appliance with smart grid capability, i. e., products that meet the definition of a smart appliance, is at least equivalent to a corresponding five percent in operational machine efficiencies. It is then expected that given sufficient incentives and value propositions, and suitable automation capabilities built into smart appliances, residential consumers will be adopting these smart appliances and will be willing participants in addressing the aforementioned societal challenges by more effectively managing their home electricity consumption. The analytical model we utilize in our cost/benefit analysis consists of a set of user-definable assumptions such as the definition of on-peak (hours of day, days of week, months of year), the expected percentage of normal consumer electricity consumption (also referred to as appliance loads) that can shifted from peak hours to off-peak hours, the average power rating of each appliance, etc. Based on these assumptions, we then formulate what the wholesale grid operating-cost savings, or benefits, would be if the smart capabilities of appliances were invoked, and some percentage of appliance loads were shifted away from peak hours to run during off-peak hours, and appliance loads served power-system balancing needs such as spinning reserves that would otherwise have to be provided by generators. The rationale is that appliance loads can be curtailed for about ten minutes or less in response to a grid contingency without any diminution in the quality of service to the consumer. We then estimate the wholesale grid operating-cost savings based on historical wholesale-market clearing prices (location marginal and spinning reserve) from major wholesale power markets in the United States. The savings derived from the smart grid capabilities of an appliance are then compared to the savings derived from a five percent increase in traditional operational machine efficiencies, referred to as cost in this report, to determine whether the savings in grid operating costs (benefits) are at least as high as or higher than the operational machine efficiency credit (cost) ...|$|R
40|$|China first adopted minimum energy {{performance}} standards (MEPS) in 1989. Today, there are standards {{for a wide}} range of domestic, commercial and selected industrial equipment. In 1999, China launched a voluntary endorsement label, which has grown to cover over 40 products including water-saving products (See Figure 1). Further, in 2005, China started a mandatory energy information label (also referred to as the 'Energy Label'). Today, the Energy Label is applied to four products including: air conditioners; household refrigerators; clothes washers; and unitary air conditioners (See Figure 2). MEPS and the voluntary endorsement labeling specifications have been updated and revised in order to reflect technology improvements to those products in the market. These programs have had an important impact in reducing energy consumption of appliances in China. Indeed, China has built up a strong infrastructure to develop and implement product standards. Historically, however, the government's primary focus has been on the technical requirements for efficiency performance. Less attention has been paid to monitoring and enforcement with a minimal commitment of resources and little expansion of administrative capacity in this area. Thus, market compliance with both mandatory standards and labeling programs has been questionable and actual energy savings may have been undermined as a result. The establishment of a regularized monitoring system for tracking compliance with the mandatory standard and energy information label in China is a major area for program improvement. Over the years, the Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP) has partnered with several Chinese institutions to promote energy-efficient products in China. CLASP, together with its implementing partner Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), has assisted China in developing and updating the above-mentioned standards and labeling programs. Because of the increasing need for the development of a monitoring system to track compliance with standards and labeling, CLASP, with support from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), has expanded its ongoing collaboration with the China National Institute of Standards (CNIS) to include enforcement and monitoring. CNIS has already begun working on the issue of compliance. CNIS has conducted modest sample testing in 2006 for refrigerators, freezers and <b>room</b> <b>air-conditioners,</b> and repeated the same task in 2007 with a similar sample size for three products (refrigerators, freezers, air-conditioners and clothes washers). And, CNIS, with technical support from LBNL, has analyzed the data collected through testing. At the same time, parallel effort has also been paid to look at the potential impact of the label to 2020. In conjunction with CNIS, CLASP technical experts reviewed the standards development timeline of the four products currently subject to the mandatory energy information label. CLASP, with the support of METI/IEEJ, collaborated with CNIS to develop the efficiency grades, providing: technical input to the process; comment and advice on particular technical issues; as well as evaluation of the results. In addition, in order to effectively evaluate the impact of the label on China's market, CLASP further provided assistance to CNIS to collect data on both the efficiency distribution and product volume distribution of refrigerators on the market. This short report summarizes the status of Standards and Labeling program, current enforcement and monitoring mechanism in China, and states the importance of international collaborations...|$|R
40|$|Cold load pickup (CLPU) is the {{well-known}} problem defined as excessive inrush current drawn by loads when the distribution circuits are re-energized after extended outages. During extreme weather conditions, these currents can be {{high enough to}} appear as faults or overload. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} cold load pickup because the power supply has been unavailable {{for a period of time}} so that the load has reached a “cold” state before being re-energized.

For sustainable development in a country, there is need to identify impacts {{of climate change}} and the necessary adaptation and mitigation strategies to adopt. To simulate the effect of global warming on the power consumption of refrigerators, a (model No. 150) THERMOCOOL refrigerator filled with twenty-five 750 cl packaged water bottleswas run in an air-conditioned room, in a <b>room</b> with the <b>air-conditioner</b> switched off and near an oven in a bakery.

40|$|Recessed {{spaces are}} {{essential}} for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. During the summer, they allow the discharge of heat from residential air-conditioners; throughout the year, they enable natural lighting and natural ventilation. Investigations are reported on the dynamic flow inside a 30 -story-high recessed space for different amounts of waste heat (different sizes of cooled <b>rooms)</b> by window-type <b>air-conditioners.</b> Predictions based on a computational fluid dynamics code showed that when waste heat per air-conditioner is R = 2 kW, mechanical cooling is efficient (coefficient of performance, COP ≅ 3. 1). However, when the waste heat increases, a buoyant air stream inside the recessed space becomes hotter and more powerful. Condenser units draw hotter air from this air stream, and their efficiency drops. In addition, this air stream strongly obstructs airflows through condenser units and natural ventilation through flats. The usability, efficiency and comfort of buildings will benefit from an enhanced understanding of the dynamic relationships between {{the configuration of the}} recessed exterior space, the amounts of waste heat discharged into it and the configuration of internal rooms.

40|$|One of {{the great}} {{influential}} feature on room temperature distribution is the insulation quality of the room. Each room of the typical Japanese modern house has a low heat capacity, high insulation quality and large windows which are less insulated. Temperature near the window is naturally low. These factors make the thermal insulation of the room strongly uneven. When heating the room, {{the location of the}} heat source largely affects room temperature distribution as well. This kind of distribution will be emphasized using an <b>air-conditioner.</b> <b>Room</b> air temperature using heating equipment such as this has both a high temperature area due to the air jet discharged from the outlet and several low temperature areas due to drafts from the window. Such a wide temperature distribution does not contribute to the comfort of the occupants at all. On the other hand, the location of the heat source also influences the heat loss of the room. Thus, an appropriate location for the heat source will produce good thermal conditions and save on heating energy. In this paper, the distribution properties of room air temperature, velocity and heat loss are discussed experimentally and analytically. Measurements under heating condition were made in a full-scale model room in order to investigate the influence air-conditioner location has on velocit...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the relationship between thermal conditions and indoor air quality during summer in a new unit-type nursing home. Almost all occupants {{in the nursing home}} spend the daytime in the nursing home’s common space area. We set out to examine how the indoor environment changes and what influence the thermal environment has on odor, and therefore took readings in the common space for room temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 concentration and odor levels. There was no correlation found between odor and <b>room</b> temperature because <b>air-conditioners</b> were running continuously in the common space. There was, however, correlation found between odor and CO 2 concentration. The authors suspected that odor from the number of human bodies, CO 2 concentration and relative humidity would mutually influence each other. But the odor level did not change according to the number of occupants in the common space, although the CO 2 concentration rose along with the number of occupants and their length of stay. Instead, the amount of odor increased mainly from meals. Since vinyl cloth covers the walls in the private rooms, formaldehyde levels were measured. There was a definite correlation found between the concentration of formaldehyde with both the wall and roo...|$|R
