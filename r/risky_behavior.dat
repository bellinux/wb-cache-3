5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect <b>risky</b> <b>behavior</b> in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E
5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and <b>risky</b> <b>behavior.</b> Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Adolescence is {{a period}} of {{evolution}} that there is the incidence probability of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as drug abuse, <b>risky</b> sexual <b>behavior</b> and compatibility problems. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence rate of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> among students of Dezful University of Medical Sciences in 2014. Method: This is a descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study, which cluster random sampling were used to selecting subjects. Young's Risk Behaviors Scale (YRBS) was used to evaluate <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> and factors affecting it. The mean, standard deviation, Chi-square tests, t-tests and ANOVA were used to analysis of data. Results: The study was included 150 (50 %) female and 150 (50 %) male. The most frequency was the age group of 20 - 24 years old. There was a statistically significant difference between average scores of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> among female and male students (p˂ 0. 05). The results of study showed that the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors,</b> high speed in driving and drug consumption is different in various fields of study (p˂ 0. 05).

40|$|I {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} self-perceived religiosity and the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> being measured included promiscuous sex, binge drinking, and recreational drug use. There were One hundred and eighteen participants {{who participated in the}} study by answering survey questions concerning the prevalence of their participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> as well as there church participation and perception of their religiosity. I predicted that there would be negative correlations between the defined <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> and self-perceived religiosity. The survey information was then input into a statistical analysis program to gather data. After interpreting the data, it was found that there was a significant negative relationship between self perceived religiosity and binge drinking. The same significant negative correlation was found between self-perceived religiosity and promiscuous sex. A significant negative correlation was also found between self perceived religiosity and recreational drug use. This indicates that the more religious an individual perceives himself or herself to be, the less likely they are to participate in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> I continued utilizing the data to suggest that the presence of a religious identity can greatly reduce <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> I then made suggestions for potential action and reform in society to offset the prevalence of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
25|$|People {{with low}} {{self-esteem}} {{are more likely}} to minimize the consequences of <b>risky</b> <b>behavior,</b> rationalize decisions, and remain convinced that certain behaviors will cause no harm to themselves, nor to others. This may contribute to behaviors like drinking, taking drugs and engaging in early sexual intercourse as well as other risk taking behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning. This {{has important implications}} for engaging in <b>risky</b> <b>behavior</b> such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future. This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli economy {{withstood}} the late-2000s recession, registering positive GDP {{growth in}} 2009 and ending the decade with an unemployment rate {{lower than that}} of many western countries. There are several reasons behind this economic resilience, for example, the fact, as stated above, that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative macro-economic policies. Two policies in particular can be cited, one is the refusal of the government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their <b>risky</b> <b>behavior.</b> The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the banks' depository and investment banking activities, contrary to the then-opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions which had the effect of encouraging more risk-taking in the financial systems of those countries.|$|E

2500|$|Because most {{injuries}} {{sustained by}} adolescents {{are related to}} <b>risky</b> <b>behavior</b> (car crashes, alcohol, unprotected sex), {{a great deal of}} research has been done on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking.

2500|$|Adaptationist {{hypotheses}} regarding why {{an organism}} should engage in such <b>risky</b> <b>behavior</b> {{have been suggested}} by Eberhard Curio, including advertising their physical fitness and hence uncatchability (much like stotting behavior in gazelles), distracting predators from finding their offspring, warning their offspring, luring the predator away, allowing offspring to learn to recognize the predator species, directly injuring the predator or attracting a predator of the predator itself. The much lower frequency of attacks between nesting seasons suggests such behavior may have evolved due to its benefit for the mobber's young.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of the influence of individual characteristics and school climate on the participation in deviant behaviors. The literature review provides a review of adolescent development and theories that guide the understanding of the different social and environmental factors that influence an adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s participation in deviant behavior. Additionally, the impact of adolescent participation in deviant behavior will be reviewed. Using data gathered from Middle and High School students who completed surveys administered by a large, Midwestern, urban school district, the influence of gender, ethnicity, age, school level free/reduced lunch status, school level performance on standardized testing, and school level perception of school climate on the participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> were examined. For the purpose of this study, 2 different samples were used. The first sample included 15, 299 Middle School students and 16, 390 High School students. For the second sample, the student reported data was aggregated to the school level representing each of 42 schools. One multiple regression was used to examine the extent to which student level data of gender, ethnicity, and age predicted student participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Another multiple regression examined the extent to which student data aggregated to the school level of school level status (middle or high school), school level perception of school climate, school performance on standardized testing, and free/reduced lunch status predicted students 2 ̆ 7 self report of <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results reflected that gender, ethnicity, and age were significant predictors of participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> such that males more frequently participated in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> than females, whites more frequently participated in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> than racial and ethnic minorities, and older students more frequently participated in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors</b> than younger students.

School level status was shown to be the only significant predictor of participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, because of high correlations between the free/reduced lunch status and standardized test scores variables a second set of analyses was conducted in which standardized test scores were removed. This regression equation reflected that school level status and school climate were significant predictors of participation in <b>risky</b> <b>behaviors.</b> These results are consistent with prior research...|$|R

The main hypothesis tested in this research is that psychopathy is an important predictor of <b>risky</b> sexual <b>behaviors</b> beyond and above the knowledge {{about the consequences of}} <b>risky</b> sexual <b>behavior</b> and personality traits. The results show that HIV-transmission knowledge predicts only overall <b>risky</b> sexual <b>behaviors</b> on the sample of men.
