40|$|Abstract. The usual {{theory of}} plasma relaxation, {{based on the}} {{selective}} decay of magnetic energy over the (global) magnetic helicity, predicts a force-free state for a plasma. Such a force-free state is inadequate to describe most realistic plasma systems occurring in laboratory and space plasmas as it produces a zero pressure gradient and cannot couple magnetic fields with flow. A different theory of relaxation has been proposed by many authors, based on a well-known principle of irreversible thermodynamics, the principle of minimum entropy production rate which {{is equivalent to the}} minimum dissipation rate (MDR) of energy. We demonstrate the applicability of minimum dissipative <b>relaxed</b> <b>states</b> to various self-organized systems of magnetically confined plasma in the laboratory and in the astrophysical context.

In this study, the photovoltaic performance of the flexible DSCs under bending and <b>relaxed</b> <b>states</b> is investigated to understand the degradation and recovery of the photovoltaic performance.

Most interestingly, when the bending DSCs are relaxed, the photovoltaic performance is found to be completely recovered. The microstructure observation shows that the direct contact between TiO 2 film and counter electrode (CE) occurred at the bending radius of 8 mm, which should be the main reason for their low photovoltaic performance in the bending state. Finally, a modified equivalent circuit model is proposed for the flexible DSCs under bending condition...|$|R

Both dry relaxed and wash-and-dry <b>relaxed</b> <b>states</b> of fabric spirality are studied. In total, six parameters are investigated, in which three parameters are derived from yarn and fabric, {{and the other three}} parameters are from the knitted condition. The three yarn and fabric parameters used are yarn twist liveliness, tightness factor and dyeing method, and the three knitting parameters are the number of feeders, rotational direction and gauge. Genetic programming is adopted to formulize the mathematical relationships between above the six parameters and two states of fabric spirality, respectively. For a comparison, a multiple linear regression approach is studied as well. The formulas generated by genetic programming and multiple regression for two states of spirality are comprehensively investigated and compared. Experimental results show that genetic programming, which can model non-linear mathematical relationships, obtains more accurate expressions than multiple regression for both dry relaxed and wash-and-dry <b>relaxed</b> <b>states</b> of spirality, demonstrating that genetic programming is a promising alternative for the mathematical formulation of fabric spirality.

2500|$|The {{nervous system}} {{is the part of}} an animal that {{coordinates}} its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body. Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent. Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, [...] autonomic, and [...] enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement. The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a <b>relaxed</b> <b>state.</b> The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.|$|E
