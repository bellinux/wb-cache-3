5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (<b>rice</b> <b>pudding</b> with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The satiating {{effect of}} animal vs plant {{proteins}} remains unknown. The present {{study examined the}} effects of breakfasts containing animal proteins [milk (AP) ], a blend of plant proteins [oat, pea and potato (VP) ] or 50 : 50 mixture of the two (MP) compared with a carbohydrate-rich meal (CHO) on appetite, energy intake (EI) and metabolic measures. Methods: A total of 28 males [mean age 27. 4 (±SD 4. 2) years, BMI 23. 4 (± 2. 1) kg/m 2] consumed three isoenergetic (1674 kJ) <b>rice</b> <b>puddings</b> matched for energy density and macronutrient content as breakfast (25 % E from protein) in a single-blind, randomised, cross over design. Appetite ratings and blood samples were collected and assessed at baseline and every 30 and 60 min, respectively, until an ad libitum test meal was served 3. 5 h later. Free-living appetite was recorded hourly and EI in weighed food records {{for the remainder of the}} day. Results: No differences in subjective appetite ratings were observed after consumption of the AP, VP and MP. Furthermore, there were no differences between the AP, VP, MP and CHO breakfasts in ad libitum EI and self-reported EI during the remainder of the day. Although insulin metabolism was not affected, CHO induced a higher glucose response (P = 0. 001) and total amino acids concentration was in the order of AP = MP > VP > CHO breakfast (P = 0. 001). Conclusion: Manipulating the protein source of foods consumed as breakfast, elicited comparable effects on appetite and EI at both laboratory and free-living environment in healthy men...|$|R

25|$|The {{varieties}} of rice are typically classified as long-, medium-, and short-grained. The grains of long-grain rice (high in amylose) tend {{to remain intact}} after cooking; medium-grain rice (high in amylopectin) becomes more sticky. Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for risotto in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as arròs negre, in Spain. Some {{varieties of}} long-grain rice that are high in amylopectin, known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed. A stickier medium-grain rice is used for sushi; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for <b>rice</b> <b>pudding.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of the country milk is offered along with {{crystallized}} sugar, <b>rice</b> <b>pudding</b> (kheer in local parlance). A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor with a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes {{to come out of the}} anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.|$|E
50|$|When {{made in the}} oven, the <b>pudding</b> <b>rice</b> {{is placed}} into a baking dish, and the milk, cream and sugar are mixed in.

While cooking, the pudding may develop a thick crust, which adds an interesting texture to the pudding.|$|R
5000|$|The stamens can be {{dried and}} {{made into a}} {{fragrant}} herbal tea called liánhuā cha (...) in Chinese, or (particularly in Vietnam) used to impart a scent to tea leaves. This Vietnamese lotus tea is called trà sen, chè sen, or chè ướp sen. The lotus seeds or nuts (called liánzĭ, 蓮子; or xiān liánzĭ, 鲜莲子, in Chinese) are quite versatile, and can be eaten raw or dried and popped like popcorn, phool makhana. They can also be boiled until soft and made into a paste, or boiled with dried longans and rock sugar to make a tong sui (sweet soup). Combined with sugar, lotus seed paste becomes {{one of the most}} common ingredients used in pastries such as mooncakes, daifuku, and <b>rice</b> flour <b>pudding.</b>|$|R
50|$|The small yellow grain {{was seldom}} ground into flour but {{was made into}} a type of {{porridge}} known as gurts. Pillas gurts were prepared by damping the grain and leaving it to stand in a warm place until it started to cheeny (sprout). It was then put in an baker (iron pan) and stirred over a slow fire until completely dry and a little scroached (scorched). The grain was then left to cool spread out on a cloth before being crushed a handful at a time in a small granite trough with a large round bowel (pebble). As well as being made into porridge with milk the gurts were often used in place of flour or <b>rice</b> in <b>puddings.</b> A small amount was also added by the old housewives to the malt when extra strong ale was required. It was for that latter use that old women were threatened with fines by the excisemen if they continued to put their grain to cheeny.|$|R
25|$|The Mexican Spanish word “paste” (pronounced PAH-steh) {{come from}} the Cornish word pasties, which is {{basically}} a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made {{a good way to}} bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as {{there was no way to}} wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken “tinga,” pineapple, <b>rice</b> <b>pudding</b> and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.|$|E
500|$|In 1836 the Poor Law Commission {{distributed}} six diets for workhouse inmates, one {{of which}} was to be chosen by each Poor Law Union depending on its local circumstances. [...] Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. [...] Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. [...] They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. [...] For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or <b>rice</b> <b>pudding.</b> [...] Supper was normally bread, cheese and broth, and sometimes butter or potatoes.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's dinners became legendary and it appears, from {{evidence}} {{collected from}} diaries, {{that a large}} number of people attended each one. Although there were few regulars, except perhaps for Johnson's close London friends (Fuseli, Bonnycastle and, later, Godwin), the large number of luminaries, such as Thomas Paine, who attended attests to the reputation of these dinners. The enjoyment and intellectual stimulation that these dinners provided is evidenced by the numerous references to them in diaries and letters. Barbauld wrote to her brother in 1784 that [...] "our evenings, particularly at Johnson's, were so truly social and lively, that we protracted them sometimes till—but I am not telling tales." [...] At one dinner in 1791, Godwin records that the conversation focused on [...] "monarch, Tooke, [...] Johnson, Voltaire, pursuits, and religion" [...] Although the conversation was stimulating, Johnson apparently only served his guests simple meals, such as boiled cod, veal, vegetables, and <b>rice</b> <b>pudding.</b> Many of the people that met at these dinners became fast friends, as did Fuseli and Bonnycastle; Godwin and Wollstonecraft eventually married.|$|E
