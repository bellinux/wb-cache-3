5|$|Starting in June 2006, {{petroleum}} <b>refiners</b> {{were required}} by the EPA to begin producing ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel, which has 97% less sulfur than the previous low sulfur diesel fuel. When fuel containing sulfur is burned, sulfur dioxide is produced, a main component of acid rain. ULSD, together with new air pollution control technologies required in trucks (starting with model year 2007), will reduce harmful emissions by 90%.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an approach, implemented {{in a system}} named <b>REFINER,</b> to combining Boolean information retrieval and content-based navigation with concept lattices. When <b>REFINER</b> i s presented with a Boolean query, it builds and displays {{a portion of the}} concept lattice associated with the documents being searched centered around the user query. The cluster network displayed by <b>REFINER</b> shows the result of the query along with a set of minimal query refinements/enlargements. <b>REFINER</b> has two main advantages. The first i s that {{it can be used to}} improve the effectiveness of Boolean retrieval, because it allows content-driven query reformulation with controlled amount of output. The second is that it has potentials for information exploration, because the displayed network is navigatable. We compared information retrieval using <b>REFINER</b> with conventional Boolean retrieval. The results of an experiment conducted on a medium-sized bibliographic database showed that the performance of <b>REFINER</b> was better than unrefined Boolean retrieval...|$|R

The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1871-72, Pratt and Company and other <b>refiners</b> became {{involved}} in a conflict with John D. Rockefeller, Samuel Andrews, and Henry M. Flagler (of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, a Cleveland-based refining company) and the South Improvement Company. In developing what would become Standard Oil, Rockefeller, a manager of extraordinary abilities, and Flagler, an exceptional marketer, recognized that the costs {{and control of the}} shipment of crude oil would be key elements in competition with other <b>refiners.</b> With its combination of clever market manipulation, and hard-nosed dealings with the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), the South Improvement scheme was an example of the type of business tactics which Rockefeller and his associates used to become successful. Although Rockefeller became the target of many who decried Standard Oil's ruthlessness in subsequent years, the South Improvement rebate scheme was Flagler's idea.|$|E

25|$|Spent {{sulfuric acid}} is {{regenerated}} by thermal decomposition outside the battery {{limits of the}} sulfuric acid alkylation unit. This may be accomplished on the refinery site in sulfuric acid regeneration equipment operated by the refinery or in a commercial sulfuric acid regeneration plant which serves several <b>refiners.</b> The choice between these two options is site specific and usually depends on capital versus operating cost considerations and {{the proximity of the}} refinery to an existing commercial regeneration plant.|$|E
25|$|In the US it {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyl lead as an antiknock (octane rating) additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most <b>refiners</b> had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, Rockefeller {{approached}} Pratt {{with a plan}} {{to cooperate}} and consolidate their businesses. Pratt discussed it with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. Rockefeller had apparently learned a lot about Rogers' talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. He quietly accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out. In this manner, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important independent <b>refiners</b> to join the Standard Oil Trust.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{were quick}} to {{publicize}} the issue. The injustice of the South Improvement scheme outraged many independent oil producers and owners of refineries. Rogers led the opposition among the New York <b>refiners.</b> The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872 sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers' Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and the New York delegation managed to forge {{an agreement with the}} railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open their rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{lighting}} started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in {{the late}} 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and <b>refiners</b> invented methods to increase the output of gasoline, while decreasing the output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.|$|E

25|$|Aqua regia {{was also}} used for parting. It was made by adding sal {{ammoniac}} to nitric acid which produced a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. This acid dissolved the gold to a soluble chloride and the silver was attacked and precipitated as an insoluble chloride. Silver was removed by filtering and gold was then recovered by evaporating the liquid and heating the residue. Nitric acid was suitable for separating small quantities of gold from silver and Aqua regia used to separate small quantities of silver from gold. Aqua regia acid process is used by <b>refiners</b> of scrap gold used in jewelry manufacturing. This process is also well suited to recycling consumers' used or broken jewelry directly back onto the global market 24kt inventory.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian {{government}} {{had already begun}} to change its energy policy. Inflation had become a national problem and oil prices were rising, and on September 4, 1973 Pierre Trudeau asked the western provinces to agree to a voluntary freeze on oil prices. Nine days later, his government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of exported Canadian oil. The tax equalled the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize imports for eastern <b>refiners.</b> At a stroke, Ottawa began subsidizing eastern consumers while reducing the revenues available to producing provinces and the petroleum industry. Alberta premier Peter Lougheed soon announced that his government would revise its royalty policy in favour of a system linked to international oil prices.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{multiple}} sequence alignments {{of proteins}} {{are very important}} in computational biology today. Despite the numerous efforts made in this field, all alignment strategies have certain shortcomings resulting in alignments that are not always correct. Refinement of existing alignment can prove to be an intelligent choice considering the increasing importance of high quality alignments in large scale high-throughput analysis. Results We provide an extensive comparison {{of the performance of}} the alignment refinement algorithms. The accuracy and efficiency of the refinement programs are compared using the 3 D structure-based alignments in the BAliBASE benchmark database as well as manually curated high quality alignments from Conserved Domain Database (CDD). Conclusion Comparison of performance for refined alignments revealed that despite the absence of dramatic improvements, our refinement method, <b>REFINER,</b> which uses conserved regions as constraints performs better in improving the alignments generated by different alignment algorithms. In most cases <b>REFINER</b> produces a higher-scoring, modestly improved alignment that does not deteriorate the well-conserved regions of the original alignment. </p...|$|R
