5|$|According to investigations, {{the attackers}} {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|The next front {{action for}} Ledbury came later on that day, at 08:20, when the {{destroyer}} began signalling, 'Eight air torpedo-bombers 210 degrees, five miles', {{and then two}} minutes later, 'for eight read ten'. Suddenly after Ledburys signals, all the escorts seemed to be blinking morse-signals at once. The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching... there's six of them... there's twelve... there's eighteen... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I {{do not think it}} worth it.' The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury. The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven.|$|E
25|$|With all {{survivors}} {{floating on}} the water with no life vests, co-pilot Carlton suddenly noticed that a Mrs Thorburn was hanging on to a raft still in its case. Fearing the bright yellow rubber raft might {{attract the attention of}} PLAAF fighters, it took Carlton twenty minutes to finally inflate the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> and lift all nine passengers in. Once all were on the dinghy, concern remained that the attacking planes might return; some of the dazed, injured passengers, with their clothes in shreds, hid under a plastic sunshade covering the edges of the dinghy. Although Blown and passenger Peter Thacher kept watch, the attacking planes never returned.|$|E

50|$|Also {{causing a}} stir was the Investorenbejubeln (Investors' Celebration), a {{demonstration}} {{on the river}} Spree in which protestors used <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and paddle boats to follow a boat-cruise of Mediaspree investors, which was then broken off prematurely.|$|R
50|$|Dabur-class boats first battle engagements {{were made}} in the October 1973 Yom Kippur War.

500|$|Among the [...] "special" [...] {{equipment}} of the Ju 87 C was a two-seat <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> with signal {{ammunition and}} emergency ammunition. A quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable 750L (200US gal) bags in each wing and a further two 500L (130US gal) {{bags in the}} fuselage enabled the Ju 87 C to remain afloat {{for up to three}} days in calm seas.|$|E
500|$|The Earl was {{frequently}} {{depicted in the}} British tabloids for his drug use, wild parties and homosexuality. In May 1983, he was arrested on suspicion of trafficking $4 million of heroin and moved from New York back to Ickworth House. While there, {{on at least one}} occasion, the Earl piloted his helicopter without radar while snorting cocaine off the map he was using for navigation. On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding to use the phone while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> {{into the middle of the}} lake at Ickworth and then shot at it with an air rifle, sinking it. On another, he was accused of opening a fridge door to retrieve a bottle of champagne by blasting it with a shotgun. He once drove along the hard shoulder of the M11 motorway at [...] to avoid traffic congestion.|$|E
2500|$|Director of Criminal Police of the General Directorate of State Police, Mr. Sokol Bizhga, attested in his {{testimony}} for the Prosecution of Vlorë that another inflatable boat was found {{a few hours before}} Guardia di Finanza's watercraft rescued the 11 survivors: “At the dawn of 10 January, around 06:30 we noticed at a distance about four miles from Gjiri i Dafinës (Laurel bay [...] ) a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> We distinguished that there were people on it, but didn't notice whether they were moving. I contacted the operating room of Vlora and after thirty minutes a watercraft, probably of the Interforce unit came to place. Ten minutes later a helicopter arrived. When they reached the dinghy, I was confirmed that there were dead people, but I couldn't go there because there was no place on the vessel for me..." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 10 May, 12 Heinkel He 59 {{seaplanes}} landed on the Nieuwe Maas. <b>Rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> were launched. Each could carry six soldiers and their equipment; about 80 German soldiers landed on both banks of the river and an island. The Germans quickly seized some of the bridges, which were not guarded. The only resistance they met was from some Dutch policemen.|$|R
500|$|In 1992, Hewson {{participated in}} Greenpeace {{protests against the}} Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England.

40|$|The third {{inventory}} of the demersal fish fauna by NIOZ took place in 1974. Main goal of these cruises in the Marsdiep basin was the habitat selection and depth distribution of juvenile plaice. The programme was supervised by dr. Jenne J. Zijlstra and beam trawl sampling took place with <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> in the intertidal and in deeper waters with RV Ephyra. All the fish were identified and measured on board. In total 8 cruises each of about 20 hauls were carried out...|$|R
2500|$|The U-boat sailed for {{her third}} and final war patrol on 7 July 1943 from La Pallice. She headed south to the West African coast. There on 11 August, she was {{attacked}} and sunk by a B-24 Liberator from 200 Squadron RAF, south-west of Dakar in position [...] The U-boat's flak hit the aircraft several times {{and set it on}} fire, but the Liberator continued to attack and dropped six depth charges before crashing into the sea, killing all eight crewmen aboard. Two depth charges fell very close to the U-boat with devastating effect. U-468 sank within 10 minutes and less than half the crew managed to abandon ship. Many were injured or poisoned by chlorine gas, and drowned, died of exhaustion, or were killed by sharks. Only the commander and six crewmen managed to haul themselves into a <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> that floated free from the aircraft wreck, and were picked up by the corvette [...] on 13 August.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep leaning over the counter to do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!" [...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E

40|$|In 2015, EU {{countries}} {{assembled a}} naval force charged with saving {{the lives of}} refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean. Mollie Gerver states that while the EU’s efforts under this operation – named ‘Operation Sophia’ – have saved many refugees’ lives at sea, they have also led smugglers to switch to <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> instead of the relatively secure boats that were employed earlier. Based on a recent House of Lord report, she highlights overlooked humanitarian concerns and suggests a new approach that would improve conditions for refugees...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of October 15, 750 of Colonel Matt's paratroopers crossed the canal in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies.</b> They were soon joined by tanks ferried on {{motorized}} rafts and additional infantry. The force encountered no resistance initially and fanned out in raiding parties, attacking supply convoys, SAM sites, logistic centers and anything of military value, with priority given to the SAMs. Attacks on SAM sites punched {{a hole in the}} Egyptian anti-aircraft screen and enabled the Israeli Air Force to strike Egyptian ground targets more aggressively.|$|R
50|$|The {{airborne}} lifeboat {{was developed}} to provide downed airmen with a more navigable and seaworthy vessel that could be sailed greater distances than the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy.</b> One of the reasons necessitating this was that when ditching or abandoning an aircraft near enemy-held territory, often the tides and winds would propel the <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghy</b> toward shore, {{despite the efforts of}} the occupants to paddle away, resulting in their eventual capture.|$|E

50|$|U-1277 {{is unusual}} in {{so much that it}} either did not receive Dönitz’s {{surrender}} order on 8 May 1945, or chose to ignore it. What is known is that she continued her patrol in the North Atlantic for a further month, her crew finally scuttling her on 3 June 1945 off the northern coast of Portugal. All 47 crew disembarked safely from their sinking boat in <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> and made their way ashore, landing on the beach at Angeiras, Portugal. There they were interned by the Portuguese authorities, and handed over to a British warship a few days later. The crew were not released from a POW camp until 1947.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were prepared}} {{with a number}} of modifications from standard specification. Hulls and wingtip floats were finished with white enamel and larger engine radiators, oil tanks and top-plane fuel tanks were fitted. In addition, there were internal changes to provide more space and support facilities for the crew, who had to live on board for periods during the trip. Metal, instead of wooden, airscrews were fitted to the aircraft during the flight. [...] Specially designed collapsible <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> were also carried. No automatic pilots or blind flying aids were fitted, and only two of the four aircraft had radio sets - communication between aircraft in the air being by lamp or hand-signals.|$|R

This cruises were carried out accoding to the same protocols with similar equipment {{and at the same}} locations as the EMOWAD programme in 1986 : bimonthly demersal fish survey were carried out in the intertidal, subtidal and tidal gullies in the Marsdiep and Vlie basin of the western Dutch Wadden Sea in 2009 and in the Marsdiep basin only in 2010. Sampling took place with <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> in the intertidal and in deeper waters with RV Navicula. All the fish were identified and measured on board. The programme lasted for two year covering 2009 and 2010...|$|R
5000|$|BBC war {{correspondent}} Robert Barr {{described the}} scene as paratroopers prepared to board their aircraft: Their faces were darkened with cocoa; sheathed knives were strapped to their ankles; tommy guns strapped to their waists; bandoliers and hand grenades, coils of rope, pick handles, spades, <b>rubber</b> <b>dinghies</b> hung around them, and a few personal oddments, like the lad who was taking a newspaper to read on the plane ... There was an easy familiar touch {{about the way they}} were getting ready, as though they had done it often before. Well, yes, they had kitted up and climbed aboard often just like this - twenty, thirty, forty times some of them, but it had never been quite like this before. This was the first combat jump for every one of them.|$|R
5000|$|Following the war Dagnall founded his own company, {{which has}} since become famous for {{pneumatic}} dinghies and barrage balloons. The RFD name is now synonymous with [...] "Rapid Floatation Device" [...] and the supply of marine and aviation safety equipment.
