50|$|There {{are very}} few similar engines. Opposed-piston diesel engines are rare enough at this size, the <b>rocker</b> <b>lever</b> {{arrangement}} was almost unheard of. Probably the only engine using a similar arrangement was the pre-war Sulzer ZG9. This was an opposed-piston engine {{with a choice of}} two, three and four cylinders (2ZG9, 3ZG9, 4ZG9); the two-cylinder version developed 120 bhp. Its layout was very similar to the Commer engines, but it used a piston scavenge pump rather than a Roots blower. This was mounted vertically above one rocker, driven by a bellcrank from the main rockers. This engine is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the Commer design.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} unusual in being an {{opposed piston engine}} where each {{horizontal}} cylinder contains two pistons, one at each end, that move in opposition to each other. Even more unusually, both sets of pistons drove only a single crankshaft; most opposed piston engines have a separate crankshaft {{at each end of}} the cylinder. The TS3 engine used a single crankshaft beneath the cylinders, each piston driving it through a connecting rod, a <b>rocker</b> <b>lever</b> and a second connecting rod. The crankshaft had six crankpins and there were six rockers. The engine was a two-stroke, compression-ignition diesel engine with uniflow-ported cylinders. Scavenging was performed by a Roots blower. which was mounted on the front of the engine and driven by a long quill shaft from a chain drive at the rear of the engine. Although the engines gained a reputation for good performance, this quill shaft was somewhat prone to breaking if over-worked.|$|E
40|$|Push rod type {{valve train}} is still widely used for low and medium speed engines. This paper {{describes}} the methodology followed for design of valve train for new 6 cylinder turbocharged dies el engine for generating set and industrial applications. Advanced prediction tools like GT power and Matlab program {{were used to}} optimize the design. Air requirement was calculated considering air fuel ratio and thermal efficiency. Inlet valve size was finalized based on gulp factor for optimum volumetric efficiency. Valve timing was optimized to get best fuel economy and optimum emission levels using GT power model. Poly dyne cam was used for minimizing vibrations and valve jump. Ramp height is calculated using cold valve clearance and static deflection of pushrod, <b>rocker</b> <b>lever,</b> rocker shaft, rocker support and cylinder head. Valve spring was designed {{to take care of}} valve jump. Finally camshaft was designed considering torque and bending load from valve train...|$|E
50|$|The Compact series {{had four}} models. On the Compact Duo dual manual organs, tone and volume were {{regulated}} by {{controls on the}} F/AR combination preamp, reverb and power supply unit. On most other models the tone controls and a bass section volume were located on an indented panel on {{the rear of the}} keyboard. Underneath the keyboards, a knee-high lever could be actuated for the tone boost feature, turned on by <b>rocker</b> <b>levers</b> on the console. All models had reverb except for the mini-compact. Optional feature: 13-note bass pedals (not for the mini-compact).|$|R
50|$|The engine has {{a single}} {{overhead}} camshaft (SOHC), driven by a chain. The vertical hanging valves are arranged in two rows, operated by <b>rocker</b> <b>levers.</b> As with the M115, inlet and outlet both {{are on the right}} side of the engine. Within the cylinder head there is (on the left side of the engine) a recessed combustion chamber (with a flat piston crown), in which the exhaust valve and the spark plug are located while the remaining area (on the right side) forms a squish area that is intended to swirl the fuel-air-mixture in the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} separate <b>rocker</b> arm (<b>lever</b> tappets). Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|R
