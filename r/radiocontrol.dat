For radio control problem decision it is necessary to describe the dynamics of process in generalize form. It is possible in conditions when the principal method is macroscopic analysis. In this method it is actual the discount of task fulfillment probability and information quantity. It is necessary to find out the dependence between information quantity, relative error and dynamic characters of systems. Theoretical results.

The Germans never used the term Blitzkrieg in any precise sense, and almost never used it outside of quotations. It simply meant a rapid and decisive victory (lightning war)... The Germans didn’t invent anything new in the interwar period, but rather used new technologies like tanks and air and <b>radiocontrolled</b> command to restore an old way of war that they still found to be valid, Bewegungskrieg.|$|R
40|$|The {{remote control}} of vehicles, {{typically}} useful in hazardous situations, {{is a difficult}} and skilled task. Users experience great difficulty in performing relatively simple operations, such as avoiding obstacles and maintaining control of the device. This contrasts strongly with high user performance when controlling a local vehicle. We suggest that {{one reason for this}} is the absence of haptic feedback conveying the physical experiences of the vehicle, the forces that act upon it as it moves. To investigate this issue we have augmented a <b>radiocontrolled</b> car with sensors, and constructed a novel control handset that uses ungrounded haptic feedback to display the forces and torques experienced by the car as it is driven. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] paper addresses {{the development of a}} vision-based target tracking system for a small unmanned air vehicle. The algorithm performs autonomous tracking of a moving target, while simultaneously estimating geographic coordinates, speed, and heading of the target. Tight real-time integration of unmanned air vehicle’s video and telemetry data streams with georeferenced database allows for reliable target identiﬁcation, increased precision, and shortened time of target motion estimation. A low-cost off-the-shelf system is used, with a modiﬁed <b>radiocontrolled</b> aircraft airframe, gas engine, and servos. Tracking is enabled using a low-cost, miniature pan-tilt gimbal. The control algorithm provides rapid target acquisition and tracking capability. A target motion estimator was designed and shown in multiple ﬂight tests to provide reasonable targeting accuracy. The impact of tracking loss events on the control and estimation algorithms is analyzed in detail. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM...|$|R

40|$|Iceberg calving is an {{efficient}} ablation process which introduces mechanical instability to glacier systems {{and can cause}} non-linear climatic response. This thesis uses glaciological and limnological data to examine the relative contributions of calving and melting to mass loss at glacier termini, and the interplay between glaciological and limnological processes. Calving dynamics are investigated at two lake-terminating glaciers; Glaciar Leon in Chile and Fjallsjokull in Iceland. Glaciar Leon, a temperate, grounded outlet of the North Patagonian Icefield, terminates at an active but stable calving margin in Lago Leones. The calving rate of 880 m a- 1 in a mean water depth of 65 m is high for lake-calving glaciers. Detailed survey of the physical limnology of Lago Leones, important for considering heat transfer to the subaqueous ice face, revealed thermocline development towards the terminus between spring and summer. Melting at the waterline along the glacier terminus facilitates calving by undercutting the subaerial calving cliff, and accounts for around a quarter of mass loss at the terminus. Waterline melting {{is also an important}} rate-controlling process for calving at Fjallsjokull. Precise quantification of melt rates (subaerial, waterline and subaqueous) at the termini of calving glaciers is difficult and hazardous, but this study has demonstrated the value of two techniques: (1) detailed survey of melt notch growth, and (2) use of a <b>radiocontrolled</b> boat to record water temperatures at the ice-water interface. Continuous automated monitoring showed that lake-level fluctuations are integral to calving behaviour, influencing calving event timing and size over diurnal and hourly timescales. Fjallsjokull is sensitive to climatic forcing whereas Glaciar Leon, which exhibits larger seasonal than annual fluctuations, is less sensitive. Additional controls on calving at both sites are (1) buoyancy, (2) longitudinal stretching, and (3) the force balance at the ice-water interface. Calving operates along a continuum defined by the relative importance of interacting calving mechanisms, to which the climatic response of calving glaciers is sensitive.
