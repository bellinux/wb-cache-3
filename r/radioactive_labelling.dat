40|$|Previous {{studies by}} Roth & Majerus [J. Clin. Invest. (1975) 56, 624 - 632] showed that {{exposure}} of platelets to [acetyl- 14 C]aspirin {{resulted in the}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> of three polypeptides, two of which were in the cytosol and not saturable, whilst the third was located in particulate material, and was saturated at 30 microM-aspirin. By using high voltage free flow electrophoresis to separate a platelet mixed membrane fraction into highly purified surface and intracellular membrane subfractions, we have confirmed that the major polypeptide acetylated after exposing whole platelets to [acetyl- 14 C]aspirin is almost exclusively associated with intracellular membrane structures. We have shown previously that these intracellular membranes are the major site for prostanoid biosynthesis [Carey, Menashi & Crawford (1982) Biochem. J. 204, 847 - 851] and {{in the present study}} the extent of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> correlated well with inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase activity in these intracellular membranes. In sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis the [14 C]acetylated component, which appears to be a dimer, migrates with a mobility corresponding to 72 kDa. Although cyclo-oxygenase is inhibited, there is no discernible <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> when the platelets are exposed to aromatic-ring-labelled [14 C]aspirin. We suggest that the site or sites for aspirin acetylation and cyclo-oxygenase activity are structurally associated in the platelet's intracellular membranes referred to by electron microscopists as the dense tubular membrane system...|$|E

Two techniques were used: (1) immunoperoxidase staining performed on histological sections and (2) Ia glycoproteins were isolated as follows: firstly by <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling</b> of isolated cells, then by filtration on Sephadex G 25, followed by Lens culinaris chromatography, and immune complex formation and then elution on protein A-Sepharose.

30|$|Monocytes are {{attractive}} targets {{for use in}} cellular imaging and for cell therapies as they play important roles in vascular repair and cardiovascular diseases. Both concepts require the ex vivo modification of cells prior to their application in vivo. An intermediate freezing step may be very beneficial to preserve cells for timely and standardised application in order to optimise imaging experiments, e.g. by avoiding imaging during off hours. For this, we sought to investigate whether freezing and thawing of circulating primary human monocytes affects the functional phenotype of these cells and their suitability for <b>radioactive</b> <b>labelling.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hydrolysis of Leu-enkephalin and {{association}} to {{cells of the}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> carried by this peptide have been studied on the K 562 (S) erythroleukaemic cell subline. Data obtained indicate that {{in the presence of}} these cells Leu-enkephalin is rapidly hydrolyzed and that the peptide's <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> is partially associated to the cells. Both phenomena are characterized by distinctly diphasic kinetics, and are oppositely modified by cells' stimulated erythroid differentiation. In the presence of proteolysis inhibitors, hydrolysis of Leu-enkephalin and {{association to}} cells of its <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> are reduced. These data, indicating that enkephalin hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the association of the radiolabel to cells, are consistent with those obtained with other cell lines of different origins and with human mononucleate cells. The modifications induced by differentiation of cells on hydrolysis, association and membrane conductance can be interpreted as an indication of extensive modifications of the membrane structures responsible for the mechanisms controlling those phenomena...|$|R

This report describes the optimisation of 6 -fluorotryptophan incorporation in a His-tagged human serum retinol-binding protein (RBP), a disulphide bonded beta-barrel protein.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{quantitative study}} of pyrimidine metabolism in exponentially growing rat pheochromocytoma PC- 12 cells has been performed. The sizes of ribonucleotide pools have been analysed and the pathways and {{the rates of}} metabolism of uridine, cytidine and aspartic acid have been determined, based on the incorporation of <b>radioactive</b> <b>label.</b> The fluxes of <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> through uridine-cytidine kinase, cytidine deaminase. CTP synthetase, nucleoside monophosphate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase were obtained, {{as well as the}} flux through the pyrimidine de novo pathway. Also, the fluxes of <b>radioactive</b> <b>label</b> towards UDP-sugars, CDP-compounds, DNA and RNA were quantified in situ under steady-state conditions in intact PC- 12 cells. From these fluxes of radioactivity, distribution ratios at the branch points of the metabolism were obtained. The pyrimidines synthesised via the de novo pathway were preferentially used for the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and UDP-hexoses, whereas the salvage of precursors from the medium contributed, to a large extent, to the synthesis of RNA. Therefore, we postulate that at least two different UTP pools exist in these cancer cells derived from the neural crest. Furthermore, after metabolism of radiolabeled cytidine and uridine into UTP, radiolabel was distributed in a similar manner from UTP towards UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, UDP-hexoses and RNA-UMP. Uridine, as well as cytidine, was channelled towards nucleic acids via small compartmented ribonucleotide pool...|$|R
