40|$|BACKGROUND: Theoretically, {{individual}} work performance (IWP) {{can be divided}} into four dimensions: task performance, contextual performance, adaptive performance, and counterproductive work behavior. However, there is no consensus on the indicators used to measure these dimensions. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to (1) identify indicators for each dimension, (2) select the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators,</b> and (3) determine the relative weight of each dimension in ratings of work performance. METHODS: IWP indicators were identified from multiple research disciplines, via literature, existing questionnaires, and expert interviews. Subsequently, experts selected the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> per dimension and scored the relative weight of each dimension in ratings of IWP. RESULTS: In total, 128 unique indicators were identified. Twenty-three of these indicators were selected by experts as most relevant for measuring IWP. Task performance determined 36 % of the work performance rating, while the other three dimensions respectively determined 22 %, 20 % and 21 % of the rating. CONCLUSIONS: Notable consensus was found on <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> of IWP, reducing the number from 128 to 23 <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators.</b> This provides an important step towards the development of a standardized, generic and short measurement instrument for assessing IWP...|$|R

40|$|We assess {{threats to}} {{environmental}} sustainability {{by examining the}} trends in three measures of the ecological footprint (EF) — the total EF, the per capita EF, and the EF intensity of the economy (EF/GDP) — for China, India, Japan, and the United States. from 1961 to 2003. The EF, {{an estimate of the}} land area needed to sustain use of the environment, is the most comprehensive measure of anthropogenic pressure on the environment available and is growing in use. We argue that the total EF is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> for assessing threats to nature’s capital and services, that per capita EF is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> of global inequalities, and that EF intensity is the most <b>relevant</b> <b>indicator</b> of economic benefits from environmental exploitation. We find in all four nations that the ecological intensity of the economy declined (i. e., efficiency improved) over this period, but the total national EF increased substantially. This is a demonstration of the Jevons paradox, where efficiency does not appear to reduce resource consumption, but rather escalates consumption thereby increasing threats to environmental sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of geochemical indicators for nitrogen (N), acidity, and metals in soil and water (soil solution, ground water and surface water) in view of their impacts on different endpoints (tree growth/health, human health, soil biodiversity etc.). <b>Relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> for N are the soil C/N ratio, nitrate (NO 3) concentration in ground water and total N concentration in soil and surface water. For acidity the most <b>relevant</b> endpoint <b>indicators</b> are the exchangeable base cation pool or base saturation in the soil, the ratio of aluminium (Al) to base cation (Bc) in soil solution, the total Al concentration in ground water and the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in surface water. <b>Relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> for metals are the total or reactive metal concentration in the soil and the free or total metal ion concentration in water. Using critical limits for those endpoint indicators, it is possible to assess critical loads for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on geochemical modelling. An overview is given of the derivation of those limits, mostly under laboratory circumstances, and a critical evaluation of their relevance in the field situation...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{acceptance of}} sustainability {{as the ultimate}} goal of forest management, perspectives about its meaning, significance, and <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> may still differ. This paper examines local perspectives on sustainability, and evaluates their similarities and differences. A systematic procedure based on criteria of proximity, pre-existing rights, dependency, knowledge of forest management, forestry spirit, daily activity, and legal rights was used to identify a small group of relevant stakeholders representing different groups, institutions, and organizations. Using participatory action research (PAR), stakeholders were asked to identify <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> of sustainable forest management. The indicators identified by each stakeholder were then compared to a consolidated list assembled by field facilitators with respect to whether <b>relevant</b> <b>indicators</b> are present or not. Based on the resulting presence/absence matrix, a statistical tool called the simple matching coefficient was used to estimate the similarity measures among the stakeholders' perspectives. In addition, cluster analysis was used to classify groups of stakeholders depending on their similarities to each other. Finally, hypotheses related to the ‘closeness’ of perspectives among local communities, non-governmental organizations, a timber company, and government organizations, as revealed by their selection of indicators, were tested. Results show that: (a) local communities have different perceptions {{in terms of what they}} consider to be important indicators compared to the NGOs, (b) there are significantly different perceptions between the government and the timber companies, and (c) there are also different perceptions between urban and field-based personnel of the same organization...|$|R
