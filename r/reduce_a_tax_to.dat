In the first study, we investigate {{conditions under which}} lobbying can improve social welfare and show {{that this type of}} lobbying will be undersupplied from society’s perspective. We take a case for lobbying which <b>reduces</b> <b>an</b> excise <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> achieve this purpose. In the second study, we examine the effect of generic advertising on a firm’s brand advertising and profits. Some producers argue that generic advertising is harmful because it will reduce perceived product differentiation and thus will make differentiated products look similar to consumers. Using duopoly models of vertical and horizontal product differentiation, we argue that this argument is not necessarily correct. Also, we model the relationship between generic advertising and brand advertising in markets with n firms regardless of the type of product differentiation via supermodular game (Milgrom and Roberts (1990)). In the third study, we scrutinize conditions under which there is a positive relationship between advertising and price. Theoretical work demonstrates that the welfare effect of advertising in imperfectly competitive markets depends upon the relationship between advertising and price. Applying the result of Milgrom and Roberts, we show that supermodularity is a condition under which advertising raise price. However, we show with models of vertical and horizontal product differentiation that this is a sufficient but not necessary condition. To address this issue empirically, we estimate <b>a</b> <b>reduced</b> form price equation using firm level data in the U. S. brewing industry. Our empirical results show that advertising raises price and is oversupplied in the U. S. brewing...|$|R

5000|$|A 2017 {{study in}} the Journal of Public Economics found that [...] "that <b>a</b> VMT <b>tax</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> increase highway spending $55 billion per year increases annual welfare by $10.5 billion or nearly 20% more than <b>a</b> gasoline <b>tax</b> does because: (1) the differentiated VMT tax {{is better than the}} gasoline tax at targeting its <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> and affecting the behavior of those drivers who create the greatest externalities, and (2) the greater fuel economy that results from a higher CAFE standard effectively <b>reduces</b> <b>a</b> gasoline <b>tax</b> and its benefits, but has less effect on <b>a</b> VMT <b>tax</b> and its benefits. Our empirical findings therefore indicate that implementing <b>a</b> VMT <b>tax</b> is <b>a</b> more efficient policy than raising the gasoline <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> improve the financial and economic condition of the highway system. Importantly, we also identify considerations that suggest that <b>a</b> VMT <b>tax</b> is likely <b>to</b> be more politically attractive to policymakers than is raising the gasoline tax." ...|$|R

5000|$|In May 1917, a {{group of}} around 30 {{automobile}} dealers in Chicago met and formed an association in Washington, D.C., following a proposed 5 percent federal sales tax increase on all vehicles. Their goal was to convince members of Congress that automobiles were [...] "mass consumers goods", not luxury items, and therefore contributed {{to the health of}} the U.S. economy. They successfully persuaded Congress <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>a</b> proposed luxury <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> 3 percent from 5 percent, and prevented vehicle manufacturing facilities from being converted to defense factories during World War I. Recognizing the need for ongoing representation, in July 1917, 130 industry leaders gathered in Chicago and elected Milwaukee dealer George Browne the organization's first president. Members focused on membership growth and distributed invitations to around 100 vehicle manufacturers. The first NADA-sponsored federal legislation, known as the National Motor Vehicle Theft Law, passed in 1919, which made motor vehicle theft involving the crossing of U.S. state boundaries a federal crime. NADA also advocated for automobile finance reforms. NADA began studying used car values in 1922. In 1928, the association's fixed amount membership dues were converted to a sliding scale based on the dealership's gross sales from the preceding year. However, members were still unable to afford dues, and by 1932 the Great Depression had nearly caused NADA to fail. The organization's leadership took measures to save costs, which included relocating the organization's headquarters to reduce rent expenditures. In 1933, NADA published its first [...] "Official Used Car Guide", providing used car values for 21 regions of the United States to 40,000 subscribers. NADA's membership was 30,000 by 1934. During Prohibition, the association advocated on behalf of dealers who were affected by vehicle repossessions of liquor law violators, and in the mid 1930s, NADA established a standard for used car appraising and began educating dealers on used car sales. During World War II, NADA worked to reduce rationing and helped recruit mechanics. The association's 1943 convention was canceled because of a temporary ban on gatherings of 50 or more people. NADA was unable to hold large meetings until the 1947 conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where 6,500 attendees represented 32,000 member dealers. During the Korean War, NADA fought against price controls and a 7 percent excise tax on new vehicles. In an effort to improve the public perception of dealers, NADA initiated a campaign encouraging dealers to adopt ethical codes during the 1950s. Ground broke on the NADA Automotive Education Center, on the Northwood University campus in Midland, Michigan, in October 1971. The center, which was dedicated on May 18, 1973, was funded by NADA members and features a hotel, offices, classrooms, a kitchen, dining facilities, and is used as a primary meeting and community space on campus. The Ford Courtyard and Commons were dedicated in October 1996 and October 2004, respectively. In mid 2009, NADA, Chrysler, and General Motors dealers worked to prevent dealerships from closing as the result of the automotive industry crisis of 2008-10; the association purchased advertisements in major publications asking President Barack Obama [...] "to choose Main Street over Wall Street". In September, the association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce requested a review of the Environmental Protection Agency's waiver permitting California to regulate tailpipe emissions. NADA spearheaded a grassroots campaign in 2010 to support the Campbell Amendment, which would make automobile dealers exempt from the Consumer Protection Agency. In mid 2015, NADA sold its 82-year-old [...] "Used Car Guide" [...] business to J.D. Power and Associates. In January 2017, NADA launched an information website to educate the public about the role of dealers and describe their economic impact.|$|R
