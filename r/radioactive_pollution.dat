The theme of the work is modeling of radionuclide migration process in the system of biological ponds on the example of the Pivdennoukrainska nuclear power plant using chamber models method. Typical water ecosystem consisting of three chambers (chamber-water, chamber-biota and chamber-bed silt) was the basis taken by the authors.

50|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the {{increase}} in population and advances made in technology have increased the relevance of water justice. Water pollution has many different causes {{and this is one}} of the reasons why it is a difficult problem to solve. Surface waters and groundwater are the two types of water resources that pollution affects the most. If pollution comes from a single location, it is known as point source pollution. A great deal of water pollution happens not from one single source but from many different scattered sources. This is called non-point source pollution. Among the different sources of both point and non-point water contamination, nutrients, waste water, sewage, chemical waste, <b>radioactive</b> waste, oil <b>pollution</b> and plastics are the most common, for example.|$|R
50|$|St. Gallen {{is notable}} for {{reporting}} the highest maximum radioactivity measurements of any Swiss city, as {{published in the}} 2009 yearly report by the Federal Office of Public Health. While the daily average level of gamma-ray radioactivity in the city is unremarkable at 105 nSv/h, the maximum can reach 195 nSv/h, {{as high as the}} average for Jungfraujoch, the location with the highest reported level of radioactivity in Switzerland, due to its high elevation and therefore greater exposure to cosmic rays. The same report explains that the unusually high spikes of radioactivity measured in St. Gallen are due to radioactive products of radon gas being washed to the ground during heavy storms, but does not explain where the sufficient quantities of radon gas and its products to account for the anomaly would come from. The yearly report for 2009 on risks associated with radon published by the same governmental agency shows St. Gallen to lie in an area of the lowest level of radon exposure.

40|$|Several {{aquatic animal}} and plant species (e. g., mol-luscs, fish, macrophytes) are {{referred}} to as bioindicators of accumulation because they can concentrate even toxic pollutants in their bodies without suffering any apparent damage. This ability has been used to establish a ratio between the pollutant concentration in the organism and that in the water. The use of this ratio, known as the con-centration factor (C. F.), shows clearly that a number of species concentrate pollutants (e. g., radioisotopes, bio-cides, metals) in their bodies up to 103 - 105 times the con-centrations in the water in which they live.

Environmental isotopes are the most important tools to provide this support (Aggarwal et al. 2009; Surinaidu et al. 2014).
