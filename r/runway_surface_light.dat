40|$|The {{proficiency}} {{with which}} pilots can make takeoffs and landings using a periscope {{as the only}} source of outside visibility was studied under various conditions of flight. A detailed de-termination was made of the effects of variations in image magnification upon landing ac-curacy. Speed of transition to flight by periscope was related to flight experience. Effects of various weather, <b>runway</b> <b>surface,</b> and ambient <b>lighting</b> conditions upon flight by periscope were investigated...|$|R
50|$|During World War II {{the federal}} {{government}} took over the airport: From 1938 until 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps and the California National Guard used 218 acres as an aerial observation training center; In 1940 the War Department added hard <b>surface</b> <b>runways</b> and <b>lights,</b> barracks, hangars, and mechanic shops. In 1940 and 1941, 183 private pilots and 20 advanced students were trained here though a federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program for armed services fliers. In 1943, the Navy began using the airport as a training center for the Pacific Fleet.|$|R

The bulldozer was used to extend the runway and over-run area and some levelling of the berms along the runway length was accomplished. This was done in order to increase runway safety.|$|R
5000|$|When a plane lands, {{the tires}} are not spinning. The {{time it takes}} for the tires to get up to speed is {{referred}} to as [...] "spin up time" [...] (Speidel, 2002). During this time the tires are effectively dragging on the runway as well as being put under pressure by the weight of the airplane. This {{can be seen in the}} slight puff of smoke that comes from a landing aircraft's tires as they first touch the <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b> The friction built up causes the rubber to polymerize and harden to the <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
40|$|The characteristics, {{which include}} the cornering-force and drag-force {{friction}} coefficients and self-alining torque, were obtained on dry, damp, and flooded <b>runway</b> <b>surfaces</b> over a range of yaw angles from 0 deg to 12 deg and at ground speeds from approximately 5 to 90 knots. The results indicate that a tread pattern with pinholes in the ribs reduces the tire cornering capability at high yaw angles on a damp surface but improves cornering on a dry surface. A tread pattern which has transverse grooves across the entire width of the tread improves the tire cornering performance slightly at high speeds on the flooded <b>runway</b> <b>surface.</b> The cornering capability of all the tires is degraded at high ground speeds by thin film lubrication and/or tire hydroplaning effects. Alterations to the conventional tread pattern provide only marginal improvements in the tire cornering capability which suggests that <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> treatments {{may be a more}} effective way of improving aircraft ground performance during wet operations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tire spin-up wear tests on a simulated Kennedy Space Center (KSC) runway that were carried out to investigate the tire wear problem for Space Shuttle landings on the KSC runway and to test several modifications of the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> designed to alleviate the problem. It was found that the <b>runway</b> <b>surface</b> produced by a concrete smoothing machine using cutters spaced one and three-quarters blades per centimeter provided adequate wet cornering while limiting spin-up wear. Based on the test results, the KSC runway was smoothed for about 1066 m at each end, leaving the original high friction surface, for better wet steering and braking, in the 2438 -m central section...|$|R
