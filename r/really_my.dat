But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was <b>really</b> <b>my</b> right hand writing the series, and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E

There's this fighter in me that kind of needs to be put to rest a little bit. I don't need to be so tough to protect myself." [...] While speaking to Vanity Fair at the premiere of her film Obsessed, Larter spoke about her own obsessions, [...] "I love to cook. I spend weekends reading cookbooks—it's <b>really</b> <b>my</b> relaxation." [...] She has ranked Scarface, The Bourne Identity, Best in Show, Blue Sky and Grey Gardens as her favorite films.|$|E

500|$|After Digital, Love {{worked on}} her first {{commercial}} game project, Love and Order, a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso. She did writing and design work for the game, set in the Crown attorney's office in Montreal, which was released in February 2011. Love describes the game as [...] "not <b>really</b> <b>my</b> best work", as dating simulations are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the game were enough to support her financially for a while, and showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be a full-time profession. In 2011, she spent the month of March working on another visual novel: Don't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story, which was released as a free download on 4 April 2011. A spiritual sequel to Digital, the game follows John Rook, a private school literary teacher in 2027, {{over the course of}} a semester. He can see students' private messages at any time via the school's social network. Don't Take It Personally deals with themes of internet privacy and relationships in the future. The game was again widely praised by critics, with The Daily Telegraph awarding the game for [...] "Best Script" [...] in its video game awards of 2011.|$|E

Recording sessions began in October 2001 and initially {{she intended to}} record in Chicago, Illinois, but those plans were later abandoned. Although each session had individual engineers, Auf der Maur and Chris Goss were primary producers of the project. Auf der Maur also financed the recording sessions herself, as she was not signed to a record label at the time. She also self-financed the sessions to [...] "secure creative control" [...] as she [...] "wanted the foundation of it to be really pure." [...] Describing the recording process, Auf der Maur said: [...] "The L.A. section of the record is the prettier, more ethereal stuff [...] the dark, rock stuff actually –– which is <b>really</b> <b>my</b> main route and the muscle of the record –– was recorded in Canada. And then in Chicago we're recording some songs with James and Chris that are more mid-dissonant pop –– mid-tempo, mid-volume." ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce was high-minded {{and ambitious}} in setting an agenda as prime {{minister}} he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose {{solutions to the problem}} of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition for these efforts. Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and [...] "forever buying into things that aren't <b>really</b> <b>my</b> concern". But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both {{as prime minister}} and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir John Cockcroft to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was [...] "probably the outstanding Australian of our time". The Melbourne Sun agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was [...] "probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers".|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t <b>really</b> <b>my</b> cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one day last summer {{and she told me}} about her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led to the idea of doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E

Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't <b>really</b> <b>my</b> kind of music. Steve Winwood had so much credibility, and when he started playing one, I thought, oh, if he can do it, I can do it". The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos.
