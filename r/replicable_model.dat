Ecuador's Yasuní-ITT Initiative to keep nearly 900 million barrels of oil underground in exchange for global contributions for avoided emissions presents an alternative norm for global environmental governance in line with the indigenous concept of buen vivir, or the good life. This means living in harmony with nature, and is embodied in the Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008. These changes, however, are not without pressures and inconsistencies at the domestic and international levels.

She founded the Independent Transportation Network (ITN) in 1995, and developed the model over time as she refined the service through research and experience.

50|$|The main {{findings}} {{of the study were}} {{that the majority of the}} area was not irrigated due to depletion in the groundwater table. Farmers were exploiting the groundwater with the help of tube well having average depth of 300 feet. There was nobody thinking about the groundwater recharge. There was no groundwater, and farmers were wasting their money by digging tube wells. Before starting the work of deep CCT, Gramsabha passed the resolution of the ‘Groundwater Regulation and Management’ which prohibited the villagers from digging tube wells (the main cause of the groundwater depletion). These helped to recharge the groundwater. It was found that due to Deep CCT structures water availability became major asset in the village which result in increase in the crop production and productivity. And farmers are shift toward cultivation of cash crops. Similarly due to availability of the water for the cultivation of fodder crops, dairy became a profitable enterprise. Thus a deep CCT structure has great success in the transformation of village Pimpari Gavali in very short span. It is definitely a <b>replicable</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there have been a}} number of {{approaches}} for recruiting minorities to enter teaching careers. One such program has been that of the Consortium for Minorities in Teaching Careers (CMTC). CMTC uses several <b>replicable</b> <b>models</b> to encourage minority high school students' interest in teaching careers. At all CMTC sites, the following components are found: (1) mentoring; (2) peer support; and (3) value change. Some sites also use training and practice to provide opportunities for students. The University of Iowa has been responsible for evaluating CMTC programs. A nonproportional stratified sampling procedure was used in 1995 and 1996 to select program participants from seven sites. A random sample of 139 participants was drawn, and 76 were interviewed either as high school or college students, or as high school graduates who were not going to college. Average participants in CMTC programs were not students who would normally go to college or even necessarily finish high school. Many participated in th...|$|R
40|$|Successful Strategies for Long-term Planning in the Education Departments of Science Museums??? {{centers around}} how {{education}} departments establish long-term goals and benchmarks for their departments. The three main categories of inquiry {{in this study}} are the impact of informal science education on science literacy, the structure and programming efforts of museum education departments, and the contributions of education departments to institutional strategic planning. The methods for this thesis were two-fold: a review of the primary literature concerning public science education and interviews with content experts. The ultimate result {{of this study is that}} there are practical, <b>replicable</b> <b>models</b> for science education planning that can be adapted to suit the needs of any informal education center, regardless of discipline.
