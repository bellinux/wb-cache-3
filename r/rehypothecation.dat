50|$|Following the Lehman collapse, large {{hedge funds}} in {{particular}} became more wary of allowing their collateral to be rehypothecated, {{and even in}} the UK they would insist on contracts that limit the amount of their assets that can be reposted, or even prohibit <b>rehypothecation</b> completely. In 2009 the IMF estimated that the funds available to US banks due to <b>rehypothecation</b> had declined by more than half to $2.1 trillion - due to both less original collateral being available for <b>rehypothecation</b> {{in the first place and}} a lower churn factor.|$|E
50|$|Where {{collateral}} is pledged {{in prime}} brokerage transactions, {{it is common}} for the broker to rehypothecate the collateral. Concerns remained, however, that because the <b>rehypothecation</b> might theoretically mean that the lender could lose title to the collateral, and thereby possibly be unable to reconvey it to the primary customer, it was speculated that such <b>rehypothecation</b> is possibly unlawful.|$|E
50|$|However, because <b>rehypothecation</b> is {{not allowed}} in Canada, the Canadian {{customers}} of MF Global were able to recover all their funds within 10 days.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, <b>rehypothecation</b> {{accounted}} {{for half the}} activity in the shadow banking system. Because the collateral is not cash it does not show up on conventional balance sheet accounting. Before the Lehman collapse, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that US banks were receiving over $4 trillion worth of funding by <b>rehypothecation,</b> much of it sourced from the UK {{where there are no}} statutory limits governing the reuse of a client's collateral. It is estimated that only $1 trillion of original collateral was being used, meaning that collateral was being rehypothecated several times over, with an estimated churn factor of 4.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rehypothecation</b> occurs {{mainly in}} the {{financial}} markets, where financial firms re-use the collateral to secure their own borrowing. For the creditor the collateral does not only mitigate the credit risk but also allows to refinance more easily or at lower rates; in initial hypothecation contract however, the debtor can restrict such re-use of the collateral.|$|E
50|$|The {{full extent}} of the shadow banking system was not widely {{recognised}} until work was published in 2010 by Manmohan Singh and James Aitken of the International Monetary Fund, showing that when the role of <b>rehypothecation</b> was considered, in the U.S. the SBS had grown to over $10 trillion, about twice as much as previous estimates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{possible}} role of <b>rehypothecation</b> in {{the financial}} crisis of 2007-2010 and in the shadow banking system was largely overlooked by the mainstream financial press, until Dr. Gillian Tett of the Financial Times drew attention in August 2010 [...] to a paper from Manmohan Singh and James Aitken of the International Monetary Fund which examined the issue.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} complex repos have been {{described}} as a wrong-way $6.3 billion bet MF Global made on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe’s most indebted nations. Failure of the repo positions helped cause the liquidity crisis at the firm. The sudden disappearance of so much liquidity may indicate a scandal and crisis related to the widespread practice among US and UK brokers of <b>rehypothecation</b> of customer collateral.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} a form known as repo 105 following the Lehman collapse, as it was alleged that repo 105s had been used as an accounting trick to hide Lehman's worsening financial health. Another controversial form of repurchase order is the [...] "internal repo" [...] which first came to prominence in 2005. In 2011 {{it was suggested that}} repos used to finance risky trades in sovereign European bonds may have been the mechanism by which MF Global put at risk some several hundred million dollars of client funds, before its bankruptcy in October 2011. Much of the collateral for the repos is understood to have been obtained by the <b>rehypothecation</b> of other collateral belonging to the clients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rehypothecation</b> can be {{involved}} in repurchase agreements, commonly called repos. In a two-party repurchase agreement, one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight repurchase agreements, the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a repurchase that reverses the transaction the next day. Term repurchase agreements, less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term repurchase agreements are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The seller of the security who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a reverse repurchase agreement. Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, the economic effect of a repurchase agreement is that of a secured loan.|$|E

This may seem like an odd question, but this type of situation happens every day in financial markets in a practice known as <b>rehypothecation.</b> Although such practices may be hard for nontraders to understand, <b>rehypothecation</b> is widespread in financial markets.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} {{consequences}} of frictions in financial intermediation. I theoretically analyse two financial contracts commonly found in the modern shadow banking system-rehypothecation and securitisation. <b>Rehypothecation</b> is the direct repledging of the collateral received in a debt contract by the intermediate lender, while securitisation {{is the use of}} the debt contract itself as collateral. I show that <b>rehypothecation</b> enables more efficient reuse of the collateral by the intermediate lender. I emphasise the role of the limited pledgeability of the intermediary in differentiating between the two contracts. In what has significant implications for monetary policy, I also show that open market operations undertaken with the intention of increasing liquidity and investment will take away collateral from the <b>rehypothecation</b> chain and be counterproductive to investment down the chain. I also examine the possibility of distortions created by large global financial institutions on emerging financial markets. In the context of India, I find that prices of firms that receive foreign institutional investor flows are not differentially affected relative to the firms that don't. by Ameya Muley. Thesis: Ph.

30|$|Let {{us first}} make some {{comments}} from the hedger’s perspective regarding the crucial features of the margin account. The financial practice may require to hold the collateral amounts in segregated margin accounts, so that the hedger, when he is a collateral taker, cannot {{make use of the}} collateral amount for trading. Another collateral convention mostly encountered in practice is <b>rehypothecation</b> (around 90 % of cash collateral of OTC contracts are rehypothecated), which refers to the situation where the hedger may use the collateral pledged by his counterparties as collateral for his contracts with other counterparties. Obviously, if the hedger is a collateral provider, then a particular convention regarding segregation or <b>rehypothecation</b> is immaterial for the dynamics of the value process of his portfolio. We refer the reader to Bielecki and Rutkowski (2015) and Crépey et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of various conventions on collateral agreements. Here we will examine some basic aspects of collateralization (sometimes also called margining) in our context.|$|E

40|$|We use an {{extensive}} data set of bilateral {{credit default swap}} (CDS) positions to estimate the impact on collateral demand of new clearing and margin regula-tions.

System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared.

In order to mitigate counterparty risk, there have been regulatory initiatives to establish central counterparties (CCPs).

Moreover, we model the margin process as a functional of the credit ratings of the counterparty and the investor. We employ a Markovian approach for modeling of the rating transitions of the two parties to the contract. In this framework, we derive the representation for bilateral CVA.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Manmohan Singh covers {{a lot of}} ground, and lays {{out a number of}} very {{interesting}} issues {{about the nature of the}} shadow banking sector, and the extent to which the activities of banks and non-banks are interrelated. In particular, it points out that, in addition to deposits, a significant share of bank lending is ultimately funded by non-banks. This funding can be described as ‘indirect ’ deposits managed by ‘asset managers’. Banks and non-banks are also linked through the process of collateral intermediation, which is a major form of shadow banking activity. The paper highlights the importance of collateral for the financial system, and its money-like properties. The analogy between collateral and money is drawn out by comparing the haircut in a collateralised transaction to a reserve ratio, and the amount of <b>rehypothecation</b> of collateral to the money multiplier. The paper shows that the ‘velocity ’ of collateral, defined as the value of collateral transactions divided by the stock of collateral, has decreased by one-third since 2007. The paper goes on to suggest that one way of satisfying the increasing demand for high-quality collateral could be to increase collateral velocity rather than expand the issuance of collateral assets by either the private sector or the government.

40|$|This thesis explores {{topics in}} {{financial}} intermediation and macro-finance. In the first chapter, my co-authors and I analyse {{the structure of}} the UK repo market using a novel dataset. We estimate the extent of collateral <b>rehypothecation,</b> and address the question of which variables determine haircuts using transaction-level data. We find that collateral rating and transaction maturity have first order of importance in setting haircuts. Banks charge higher haircuts when they transact with non-bank institutions even after controlling for measures of counterparty risk. We examine {{the structure of the}} repo market network and we find out that banks with higher centrality measures ask for more haircuts on reverse repos and pay lower haircuts on repos. In the second chapter, I study the real effects of benchmarking in fund management industry in a general equilibrium model where stocks of productive sectors are traded in a competitive equity market. Investors delegate their portfolio decisions to managers whose performance is benchmarked against an index. Managers hedge themselves by tilting their portfolio toward the index which increases the demand and price of the stocks that feature prominently in the index. In equilibrium there is an inefficient shift towards extreme states in which big sectors dominate the economy. I show that in presence of benchmarking, index inclusion is preceded by a rise in firm’s investment rate relative to its capital stock. In the third chapter, I examine balance sheet recessions in a general equilibrium model where agents have heterogeneous beliefs about future technology growth. I show a channel which describes the risk concentration through belief dispersion rather than ad-hoc constraints on aggregate risk sharing. Endogenous stochastic consumption volatility arises from constant fundamental volatility. I study the role of static vis-à-vis dynamic disagreement and examine the effect of financing constraints on the equilibrium when there is belief dispersion among agents...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} consistent, arbitrage-free {{framework}} for valuing derivative trades with collateral, counterparty credit risk, and funding costs. Credit, debit, liquidity, and funding valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA, LVA, and FVA) are simply introduced as {{modifications to the}} payout cash-flows of the trade position. The framework is flexible enough to accommodate actual trading complexities such as asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement close-out, and <b>rehypothecation</b> of posted collateral – all aspects which are often neglected. The generalized valuation equation {{takes the form of}} a forward-backward SDE or semilinear PDE. Nevertheless, it may be recast as a set of iterative equations which can be efficiently solved by our proposed least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm. We implement numerically the case of an equity option and show how its valuation changes when including the above effects. In the paper we also discuss the financial impact of the proposed valuation framework and of nonlinearity more generally. This is fourfold: Firstly, the valuation equation is only based on observable market rates, leaving the value of a derivatives transaction invariant to any theoretical risk-free rate. Secondly, the presence of funding costs makes the valuation problem a highly recursive and nonlinear one. Thus, credit and funding risks are non-separable in general, and despite common practice in banks, CVA, DVA, and FVA cannot be treated as purely additive adjustments without running the risk of double counting. To quantify the valuation error that can be attributed to double counting, we introduce a ’nonlinearity valuation adjustment’ (NVA) and show that its magnitude can be significant under asymmetric funding rates and replacement close-out at default. Thirdly, as trading parties cannot observe each others’ liquidity policies nor their respective funding costs, the bilateral nature of a derivative price breaks down. The value of a trade to a counterparty will not be just the opposite of the value seen by the bank. Finally, valuation becomes aggregation-dependent and portfolio values cannot simply be added up. This has operational consequences for banks, calling for a holistic, consistent approach across trading desks and asset classes...|$|E
