5|$|On December 20, 2012, Booker {{announced}} that he would explore running for the U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or not he would run. Roughly one month after declaring his interest in <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1950, Clements {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees. Wetherby's popularity soared {{as a result of this}} session, and he seriously considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> seat vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2005, {{during an}} {{interview}} on C-SPAN's call-in show Washington Journal, Ford confirmed {{that he would be}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> He filed the papers necessary to officially begin his Senate campaign on May 25, 2005.|$|E

25|$|Former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, a {{moderate}} Republican from Connecticut, {{was a friend}} of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, George H. W. Bush (then <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> from Texas against Democrat Ralph Yarborough), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Only 11 {{percent of}} Tennesseans knew who Corker {{was when he}} began <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> race. All three have run statewide campaigns in the past, albeit {{unsuccessful}} ones: Bryant for the 2002 Republican Senate nomination, losing to Lamar Alexander; Corker for the U.S. Senate in 1994, losing to Frist in the Republican primary; and Hilleary for Tennessee Governor in 2002, losing to Democrat Phil Bredesen.|$|E
25|$|When McCarthy {{became a}} {{dominant}} voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed {{thousands of dollars}} to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the Senate race of 1952, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the GOP ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear.|$|E

A 1995 graduate of Yale Law School, he was a combat veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, {{and a graduate of}} the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is originally from Kansas and the father of eight children; he and his wife and family moved to Alaska in the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the 2003 gubernatorial runoff, Jindal decided to run for Louisiana's 1st congressional district. The incumbent, David Vitter, was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> seat being vacated by John Breaux. The Louisiana Republican Party {{endorsed}} him in the primary although Mike Rogers, also a Republican, was running for the same seat. The 1st District has been in Republican hands since a 1977 special election and is widely considered to be staunchly conservative. Jindal's campaign was able to raise over $1million very early in the campaign, making it harder for other candidates to effectively raise funds to oppose him. He won the 2004 election with 78 percent of the vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} was confirmed {{the following year}} when he was narrowly elected to the U.S. Senate on November 8, 1932, with 49% of the vote, {{in a year when}} {{more than half of the}} Republican incumbents <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> were defeated when Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Party won in a landslide. He served in the Senate until January 3, 1937. After completing Morrow's unfinished term, Barbour was unsuccessful in his 1936 reelection bid. For the next two years, he resumed his former pursuits, including service as a member of the New Jersey unemployment compensation commission in 1937. Barbour regained his Senate seat on November 8, 1938, when he was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of A. Harry Moore. Popularly elected to the office in 1940 after completing Moore's term, he served as U.S. Senator from New Jersey until his death in 1943.|$|E

500|$|The song {{entered the}} news again in 2000 {{when it was}} mistakenly used during Hillary Clinton's {{announcement}} {{that she would be}} campaigning for U.S. Senate. According to an NPR report on worst campaign songs, a staffer notes that the playing of [...] "Captain Jack" [...] was a mistake. It was played from the Billy Joel compilation CD Greatest Hits Volume 1, and the song intended to be played was [...] "New York State of Mind", which was track five on the CD. The Clinton staffer inadvertently played track two, which was [...] "Captain Jack". Her presumed opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, who ended up not <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> criticized the song's use because of its alleged glorification of drugs. Giuliani even read the lyrics to the song in a live press conference. Joel replied in a statement, [...] "There are a lot of important issues facing the voters in this Senate race. Is a politician's interpretation of a song I wrote nearly 30 years ago an issue to the voters of New York state? I do not think so." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 16, 1999, the First Lady's office {{announced}} that she was considering <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> position. [...] Once it was clear Clinton was going to run, Lowey stepped aside, although she would be disappointed at the lost opportunity. [...] On July 7, 1999, Clinton formally announced an exploratory committee for the Senate run; the setting was Moynihan's farm in Pindars Corners, in rural Delaware County. Bill Clinton was less than enthusiastic about her candidacy. The staging of the event was brokered by the Clintons' political consultant Mandy Grunwald. [...] Hillary Clinton embarked upon a [...] "listening tour" [...] of all parts of New York after her entrance into the race. [...] She planned to visit all 62 counties in New York, talking to New Yorkers in small-group settings according {{to the principles of}} retail politics. During the race, she spent considerable time campaigning in traditionally Republican upstate regions. Clinton faced charges of carpetbagging, since she had never resided in the State of New York nor directly participated in state politics prior to her Senate race.|$|E

In 1970 Carswell said Carswell's loss of the Court nomination was because of the [...] "dark evil winds of liberalism" [...] and the [...] "northern press and its knee-jerking followers in the Senate." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his {{election}} as attorney general, it was speculated that Cuccinelli {{was a potential}} candidate for governor in the 2013 election or for the United States Senate in 2014. Cuccinelli himself stated that he was considering <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Two days later, one of his aides said, [...] "We haven't ruled out anything. He's not actively considering a run for any particular office at the moment. Ken is operating {{under the assumption that}} he will run for reelection [...] He hasn't ruled out any option besides running for president, which he has no desire to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{delegation}} {{increased from}} 43 to 45 seats. [...] To create the two-seat net gain, five seats with no incumbent were added (the , , , , and [...] districts) and three seats were lost through {{the merger of}} pairs of incumbents (Martinez and Rousselot, Grisham and Dreier, and Fiedler and Goldwater) in an election contest. With redistricting controlled by Democrats {{in the state legislature}} and governorship, several Republicans faced substantially less favorable districts, with three <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> seat eventually won by San Diego mayor Pete Wilson, and the party balance shifted by a net of five seats to the Democrats.|$|E
2500|$|Expecting {{to benefit}} over the uproar in Florida over the {{rejection}} of Judge Carswell, political aides suggested that Carswell resign from the bench and run for Holland's Senate seat. Gurney has claimed that he was unaware that Cramer had considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1968 and had deferred to Gurney, {{with the expectation that}} Cramer would run for the other Senate seat in 1970. Governor Kirk and Gurney endorsed Carswell, and Lieutenant Governor Ray C. Osborne, a Kirk ally from St. Petersburg, abandoned his own challenge to Cramer.

[...] Commenting on Ford's political family, Corker said, [...] "I think it's evident there's been a Ford in this (9th District congressional district) seat for 32 years, {{and if you look at}} the number of Fords that are on the ballotespecially I think the most recent one, I know it concerns a lot of people right here in Memphis."

2500|$|Congressman Peter T. King {{made his}} likely {{candidacy}} clear in December 2008, partly {{to mention that}} he was not challenging former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as the latter was not in the running and partly to counter the wave of publicity for Caroline Kennedy. By January 2009, King was still deliberating over whether he would run, with the main factor being whether he could raise the estimated millions he would need. [...] National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair John Cornyn was said to support King, which could keep other Republican contenders out of play. [...] However, Cornyn has reportedly met with former Governor George Pataki to discuss his potential candidacy, which other Republicans were advocating. [...] In June 2009, due to an appointment to the House Intelligence Committee, King said he was much less likely to run. [...] As August 2009 closed, King announced officially that he would not run, saying: [...] "Senator Gillibrand generates neither strong support nor opposition. This makes it virtually impossible for me to raise the campaign funds I would need to overcome the built-in Democratic registration advantage and the countless millions of dollars which the Democrats will make available to Senator Gillibrand." [...] In September 2009, Giuliani reiterated that he had no interest at all in <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> seat, [...] though, much like Andrew Cuomo's anticipated desire to run for governor, it did not stop speculation that Giuliani might change his mind, and by October 2009, speculation continued that Giuliani would run for the Senate seat, particularly if Cuomo ran for governor. On November 19, 2009, the New York Daily News reported Giuliani would not run for Governor, and in fact would run for the Senate for fill out {{the last two years of}} the Clinton term, then use that as a springboard for another presidential run. [...] However, a Giuliani spokesperson quickly dismissed the notion that any such plan was in place, saying [...] "When Mayor Giuliani makes a decision about serving in public office, he will inform New Yorkers on his own."
