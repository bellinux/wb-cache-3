Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, bluegrass, <b>redtop</b> bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass.

5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and <b>redtop.</b> The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E

40|$|Mountain pine beetles are a pest {{indigenous}} to the pine {{forests of the}} western United States. Capable of exponential population growth, mountain pine beetles can destroy {{thousands of acres of}} trees {{in a short period of}} time. Much research has been carried out on the mathematical modeling of mountain pine beetle phenology. The research reported here is part of a larger project to demonstrate the application of, and evaluate, differential equation models for mountain pine beetle progression through pine forests. The study area is the Sawtooth National Recreation area in Idaho. To provide input parameter to the mathematical models, and to measure the changes in the pine forest in the study area, IKONOS satellite imagery was used to classify the vegetation of the study area. Five classifiers—linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor discriminant analysis, classification trees and random forests—were applied to raw and transformed multispectral and panchromatic satellite imagery, with and without an elevation variable. Quadratic discriminant analysis and random forests proved to be the best classifiers as measured by cross-validated error estimates, with overall classification rates of about 12 % without elevation, and about 5 % when elevation was included. <b>Redtops</b> were relatively easy to identify, with misclassification rates of about 5 %— 6 %, but green lodgepole pine and Douglas fir were relatively difficult to discriminate between and had much higher misclassification rates...|$|R

500|$|On March 31, 2015, Billboard premiered a remix of {{the song}} by Dutch DJ Don Diablo, who changed the ballad into an EDM track. Another set of remixes were {{released}} later as a Remix EP. Two of the remixes were released on Madonna's Tidal streaming account, including one by DJ <b>RedTop</b> as well as Armand Van Helden, Offer Nissim and Roger Sanchez. According to Idolator, [...] "RedTop completely deconstructs 'Ghosttown' and turns it into something you might hear in a post-apocalyptic piano bar. It's sad and depressing yet defiantly groovy." [...] Another remix, by Paul Andrews, gave emphasis on Madonna's vocals while adding piano and orchestra in the production. Andrews explained that the music video of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was how he had imagined it, [...] "two people in a dark place with destruction all around them, but they have each other". Hence he wanted the verse to represent {{the reality of the}} situation and the chorus would represent their view of the world because of their love. The non-dance remix was approved by Madonna and was another exclusive release to her Tidal account.|$|E

2500|$|For {{some time}} Mahal thought of {{pursuing}} farming over music. He {{had developed a}} passion for farming that nearly rivaled his love of music—coming {{to work on a}} farm first at age 16. It was a dairy farm in Palmer, Massachusetts, not far from Springfield. By age nineteen he had become farm foreman, getting up a bit after 4:00a.m. and running the place. [...] "I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn. I grew Tennessee <b>redtop</b> clover. Alfalfa." [...] Mahal believes in growing one's own food, saying, [...] "You have a whole generation of kids who think everything comes out of a box and a can, and they don't know you can grow most of your food." [...] Because of his personal support of the family farm, Mahal regularly performs at Farm Aid concerts.|$|E
6000|$|When we {{have with}} {{difficulty}} made our selection from the divine redundancy of the ideal world, and {{so far as we}} could have reduced ourselves to the penury of a sole possession, why do not we turn our eyes to the example of Nature in not only bringing forth a hundred or a thousand fold of the kind of seed planted, but in accompanying its growth with that of an endless variety of other plants, all coming to bear in a like profusion? Observe that wise husbandwoman (this is not the contradiction in terms it seems), how when her business is apparently a hay harvest, she mingles myriads of daisies and milkweed and wild carrot and <b>redtop</b> with the grass, and lets her fancy riot all round the meadow in a broidery of blackberries and asters and dogroses and goldenrod. She never works without playing; and she plays even while man is working--plays so graciously and winningly that it takes the heart with joy. Who has ever looked upon an old-world wheat-field, where poppies and vetches are frolicking among the ears, and begrudged Nature her pastime? No one, we will venture, but the owner of the field, who is perhaps also too much of a philosopher to grieve over it. In the ideal world it is much the same. There, too, art having chosen a kind brings it to bear with all the other kinds which have been lurking in the unconscious soil of the mind and only waiting tilth for any purpose before springing up in company with the selected seed. This is what makes the poets and novelists and dramatists so much more profitable reading than the moralists. From whom, indeed, has the vital wisdom of the race been garnered? Not from those hard, ethical masters who have sought to narrow culture to the business of growing precepts, but from the genial teachers who have inculcated amusement and breathed into the unwary mind some inspiration which escaped as unconsciously from themselves. Which philosopher or sage of them all has instructed mankind a hundredth part as much as Shakespeare, who supposed himself to be merely providing diversion for the patrons of the Globe Theatre? ...|$|E

5000|$|Redtop's {{career as}} a {{professional}} boxer might not be believable, were it not so well-documented. He made his professional debut in February 1946 and initially fought {{at least once a}} month, sometimes twice. By the end of 1946 he had already amassed a dismal record of 1 win and 6 losses with 2 draws. Nevertheless, he kept plugging away, winning a few fights here and there so that by March 1947 he had been selected as an opponent for Sammy Angott, whose record was 82-23-7. He lost that fight by TKO in the 3rd round. Having begun his career in Ohio in 1947, <b>Redtop</b> made a move to the boxing hotspot of New England, where the quality of his opponents improved - as did his own performances. It wasn't long before <b>Redtop</b> was fighting the best boxers of his day, and not only that, winning with some regularity. In fact before 1948 was over, <b>Redtop</b> had fought the legendary Willie Pep twice - losing both bouts. In 1949 <b>Redtop</b> fought 54-1-3 Eddie Compo and according to Ring Magazine refused to do any punching until the state fight commissioner confronted him in the ring, whereupon Davis peppered Compo at will for two rounds before getting knocked out in the 8th. [...] His purse for that fight was initially withheld, and its resolution is not known. <b>Redtop</b> continued to fight top-flight boxers for money and lower-flight pugs for wins, occasionally stringing together awful losing streaks and impressive winning streaks, and even occasionally pulling off a significant upset, as when he beat Elis Ask (record 31-5-2), Julie Kogon (record 81-37-17), George Dunn (record 33-7-3) and Paddy DeMarco (record 49-4-1) in a three-month period in 1950. Also, in 1952 <b>Redtop</b> put together a six-fight winning streak against a collection of opponents with a combined record of 133-47-5. And yet <b>Redtop</b> continued to pepper these impressive stretches with occasional, even frequent losses. Following another six-fight winning streak, this time against fighters with a combined record of 190-57-15, <b>Redtop</b> was given a shot at the legendary champion Sandy Saddler, whose record was an incredible 138-13-2. Saddler, it was written, [...] "won as he pleased and it pleased him to cuff and belabor Davis and put him to rout in a bout that through the early rounds looked fairly even." [...] Following the Sadler bout, the good times seemed to end, and <b>Redtop</b> finished out his career with a stretch in which he only managed to win 8 out of 33 contests.|$|E
