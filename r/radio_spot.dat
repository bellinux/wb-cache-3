[...] Whitney also created many of the remote control systems used by radio stations. [...] He was awarded for his work by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1970. [...] WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour—in excess of what the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitted.

2500|$|... the Republican Party ran {{radio and}} {{television}} ads characterized by some as racially tinged. A <b>radio</b> <b>spot,</b> referred to by critics as the [...] "jungle drums" [...] ad, had drums playing when Ford's name was mentioned and patriotic music when Corker's name was spoken. This ad was criticized as attacking Ford's race by evoking images of primitive, chanting African tribes. A television ad that received more attention featured satirical [...] "man‑on‑the‑street" [...] interviews purporting to support Ford, including one in which a blond white woman talks about meeting Ford at [...] "the Playboy party"; she returns {{at the end of}} the ad to wink and whisper in a seductive tone, [...] "Harold, call me."

2500|$|The NFL is {{very active}} on {{stopping}} {{what it says}} is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms [...] "NFL", [...] "Super Bowl", and [...] "Super Sunday". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as [...] "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions. [...] A <b>radio</b> <b>spot</b> for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying [...] "it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" [...] and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the [...] "Superb Owl". [...] In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for [...] "Superb Owl". [...] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase [...] "Super Bowl" [...] implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that [...] "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55inches. Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that [...] "any use is prohibited", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States. Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 [...] "to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games", and [...] "for other purposes".|$|E

2500|$|On an April 1 show in 2008, both Dennis and Callahan {{during a}} top ten April fools prank list made mention to a prank done by Opie and Anthony that {{caused them to}} be fired from WAAF, a Boston radio station. [...] The [...] "prank" [...] which they {{referred}} to was done because Opie & Anthony hated radio April fools pranks and felt they are only done by hack radio jocks. As a result, they made five false statements and admitted 4 of them were fake except for the fifth one in which they said the mayor had died after flipping his car on a bridge, the airborne car then went over the dividing jersey barrier and landed into the oncoming traffic lane where it {{was hit by a}} tractor trailer truck. They also said there was a hooker of African American descent in the passenger seat {{at the time of the}} accident. [...] During the Dennis and Callahan segment, Dennis asked [...] "Whatever happened to those guys?" [...] Callahan then said that they were working at McDonald's with a pedophile. [...] At the time Opie & Anthony had taken over Howard Stern's syndicated terrestrial <b>radio</b> <b>spot</b> (which was heard in basically every major city in the US), and was also broadcasting at the same time on Satellite radio. This insulted Opie & Anthony, which caused them to play the Dennis & Callahan clip on their air. [...] This ended up bringing national attention to the Ryen Russillo voicemail situation and also caused WEEI to take very few callers during all their shows because of the massive volume of Opie & Anthony fans calling in for weeks to let the station know where Opie & Anthony currently worked. Callers would also complain about the comments and disrespect [...] Dennis and Callahan show for a national show and would pester on air talent by swearing or pranking them causing them to dump out of many calls.|$|E
