5|$|Activated {{to oversee}} {{division}} elements prior to World War II, the battalion fought in Italy for a year. After the war {{it served as}} the command element for the 10th {{when it was a}} training unit. Due to reorganizations in the Army, the Special Troops Battalion was not <b>reactivated</b> with the 10th Mountain Division in 1985, and instead remained inactive while the division served in numerous contingencies throughout the 1990s. <b>Reactivated</b> during another reorganization in 2004, the Special Troops Battalion supported the 10th Mountain Division command elements when they deployed to both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. During this service, it has received several commendations for its multiple deployments. In October 2009, the Special Troops Battalion was redesignated to Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} there are {{reported}} observations {{on a certain}} new <b>reactivating</b> property of normal and immune blood sera of various animal species. The effect of the <b>reactivating</b> sera consists in restoration of the toxicity in vivo and in vitro of completely neutralized meningococcus and B. coli reacting factors. The property is apparently non-specific, heat-labile, lessens on storage, and has no relationship to complement. Heating of immune sera to a temperature destructive for the <b>reactivating</b> property but innocuous to the neutralizing antibodies, raises considerably their neutralizing potency. The possible immunological significance of the <b>reactivating</b> property is discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Inappropriate {{recollections}} {{and responses}} in stressful conditions are hallmarks of {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} and other anxiety and mood disorders, but how stress contributes to the disorders is unclear. Here we show that stress itself <b>reactivates</b> memories even if the memory is unrelated to the stressful experience. Forced-swim stress one day after learning enhanced memory recall. One-day post-learning amnestic treatments were ineffective unless administered soon after the swim, indicating that a stressful experience itself can <b>reactivate</b> unrelated consolidated memories. The swim also triggered inter-hemispheric transfer of a lateralized memory, confirming stress <b>reactivates</b> stable memories. These novel effects of stress on memory required the hippocampus although the memories themselves did not, indicating hippocampus-dependent modulation of extrahippocampal memories. These findings that a stressful experience itself can activate memory suggest the novel hypothesis that traumatic stress <b>reactivates</b> pre-trauma memories, linking them to memory fo...|$|R

5|$|When the Iowa-class battleships were {{commissioned}} in 1943 and 1944, they carried twenty quad 40mm AA gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also {{employed in the}} protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and accounted for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.

40|$|The {{ability of}} two newly {{developed}} oximes (K 305, K 307) to protect tabun-poisoned rats from tabun-induced inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase, acute neurotoxic {{signs and symptoms}} and brain damage was {{compared with that of}} the oxime K 203 and trimedoxime. The <b>reactivating</b> and neuroprotective effects of the oximes studied combined with atropine on rats poisoned with tabun at a sublethal dose were evaluated. The <b>reactivating</b> efficacy of a newly developed oxime K 305 is lower compared to the <b>reactivating</b> efficacy of the oxime K 203 and trimedoxime while the ability of the oxime K 307 to <b>reactivate</b> tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain roughly corresponds to the <b>reactivating</b> efficacy of the oxime K 203 and it is slightly lower compared to trimedoxime. In addition, only one newly developed oxime (K 307) combined with atropine was able to markedly decrease tabun-induced neurotoxicity although it did not eliminate all tabun-induced acute neurotoxic signs and symptoms. These results correspond to the histopathological evaluation of tabun-induced brain damage. Therefore, the newly developed oximes are not suitable for the replacement of commonly used oximes (especially trimedoxime) in the treatment of acute tabun poisonings...|$|R
