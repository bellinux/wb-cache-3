50|$|Nordyke Marmon {{exported}} machinery {{products to}} Canada, Mexico, Central and South America furnishing complete machinery equipment for flour mills, corn mills, cereal mills, starch and rice mills and elevators. They made <b>roller</b> mills, <b>bolting</b> machines, packers, blending machinery, rice, corn and starch mill machinery and numerous special machines.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle fires the [...]223 Remington or 5.56×45mm NATO {{cartridge}} and feeds from a 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable magazine (depending on the {{variant of}} the rifle). Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, {{it is not a}} <b>roller</b> lock <b>bolt</b> but rather a lug-type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18.|$|R
50|$|The HK33 is a {{selective}} fire weapon with Heckler & Koch's roller-delayed blowback system of operation. It employs a two-piece bolt {{consisting of a}} bolt head {{with a pair of}} <b>rollers</b> and <b>bolt</b> carrier. Upon firing, the two cylindrical <b>rollers</b> in the <b>bolt</b> head are cammed inward by inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and impart a rearward motion on the locking piece, which also propels the bolt carrier rearward. This built-in mechanical disadvantage delays the movement of the bolt head relative to the bolt carrier which is withdrawing at four times the velocity of the <b>bolt.</b> The <b>rollers</b> soon compress entirely into the bolt head, clearing the locking recesses of the barrel extension, and both parts now continue rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under very high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.|$|R
50|$|The rudder may {{be removed}} by {{loosening}} the <b>bolt,</b> <b>rollers</b> and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure. The rudder post {{passes through the}} hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing.|$|R
5000|$|The Tatra {{engine is}} an air-cooled, OHV, {{currently}} 12.7 liter 90° V8 120 x 140 mm diesel engine with direct fuel injection. It is turbocharged by one Holset WasteGate turbocharger, and {{equipped with an}} intercooler placed directly over the engine. The engine {{is equipped with a}} mechanically controlled in-line Bosch injection pump. Its <b>roller</b> crankshaft <b>bolted</b> together from individual segments belongs among unique technical solutions. The engine is available in emission specifications Euro 2 - Euro 5 with power output ranging from [...] and 1400 - 2100 Nm torque. Originally was the T 815 truck optionally powered by the same range V10 (15.8 liter) and V12 (19 liter) air-cooled Tatra engines without turbo and intercooler or by biturbo V12 until the Euro 1 emission limits.|$|R
50|$|The bolt rigidly {{engages the}} barrel extension—a {{cylindrical}} component welded to the receiver {{into which the}} barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the G3 rifle. The two-part bolt consists of a <b>bolt</b> head with <b>rollers</b> and a <b>bolt</b> carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, the T44 {{prototype}} service rifle was not principally {{designed by}} any single engineer at Springfield Armory, but rather was a conventional design developed {{on a shoestring}} budget {{as an alternative to}} the T47. With only minimal funds available, the earliest T44 prototypes simply used T20E2 receivers fitted with magazine filler blocks and re-barreled for 7.62×51mm NATO, with the long operating rod/piston of the M1 replaced by the T47's gas cut-off system. [...] Lloyd Corbett, an engineer in Harvey's rifle design group, added various refinements to the T44 design, including a straight operating rod and a <b>bolt</b> <b>roller</b> to reduce friction.|$|R
40|$|All of the ordered Tychoway rollers, {{to be used}} {{under the}} {{cryostat}} carriages on the center beam, have to be modified to accommodate a keyed way used to guide the cryostat along these same ways. A 0. 320 x 0. 406 inch notch is machined along one of the longer lower edges {{in order to create}} a 0. 640 x 0. 406 inch keyway when two of these notched <b>rollers</b> are <b>bolted</b> together (side by side) for installation. This keyway will fit over a. 635 x. 375 inch key, which is inserted into the ways. Due to the close fit, the rollers were sent to the Fermi Inspection Dept. to double check the machined notch dimensions and tolerances. Included is the drawing sent to the Tychoway manufacturer, who machined the notch, and the results of the measurements taken by the Inspection Dept. The tolerance on the 0. 320 inch dimension is {+-} 0. 002 inches. Only three of the initial ten rollers fall within the tolerance; No. 3, 9 and 10 (they were numbered by the Inspection Dept.). The other seven, plus one of the 'good' rollers, can be matched up to meet the required dimensions of a 0. 640 {+-} 0. 004 inch keyway. Since only four rollers will be used on the keyed way per cryostat, the worst matches can be installed on the non-keyed side of the cryostat. A table listing the best possible matches and their subsequent dimensions and tolerances is given...|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a <b>roller</b> locked <b>bolt</b> mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, close tolerance fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the <b>bolt,</b> <b>rollers</b> and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|R
2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} <b>bolt</b> <b>roller</b> and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|R
