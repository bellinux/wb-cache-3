As seen in the article by Amarillo Daily News on November 24, 1948, rather than calling out Lafayette's claim as a fallacy, the paper focused on the fact that no further arrangements could be made with Lafayette College once Texas Miners officials had already <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> to the other schools.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a brief school-based intervention on help-seeking behaviour among Australian adolescents. The aim of the intervention was to encourage adolescents to seek help, focusing on the use of the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website (www. reachout. com. au) as a help-seeking source. Male and female adolescents were compared. The evaluation involved 243 students from ten government and non-government schools across rural and regional Victoria. They received a presentation that contained information on <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> what to do if they or a friend was going through a tough time, and help-seeking options. Questionnaires assessing help-seeking knowledge, intentions, behaviour, and use of <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help were administered six months following the presentations. The majority of participants, with more females than males, knew where to go for help and who they could talk to. Almost half of the participants had been to the <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> website following the presentation, and approximately two-thirds reported that they would use <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> to seek help if they were going through a tough time. There were no significant gender differences in visiting <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!</b> or in intending to visit it. The results demonstrate that young people in Australia are likely to use the Internet, and especially <b>Reach</b> <b>Out!,</b> to seek help when they are going through tough times...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to his own developers, Schafer <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version.

Schafer noted they created the game with tank-style control as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.|$|E
