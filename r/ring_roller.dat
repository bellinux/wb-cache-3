The bearing between them was a large diameter <b>ring</b> <b>roller</b> bearing, mounted at the lowest part of the chassis. This gave rigidity and stability, even after long wear. A ring of rolled channel girder {{was attached to the}} engine group and rollers on the chassis carried the load upon this. On early Auto-Trucks this bearing is set very low, in line with the chassis members, and is covered by thin steel plates. The front panel of the engine cover is distinctive with large ventilation holes and a Lister signature cut through it. Strangely this panel is made of thick cast iron, providing substantial weight high on the engine and only adding to its top heaviness. To improve visibility of moving vehicles in noisy factories, this panel was often painted white, the rest of the vehicle being Lister's usual brunswick green.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a computational model for calculating {{the lifetime of}} rolling bearings in a 1. 5 MW wind turbine’s epicyclic gearbox. At first, a quasi-dynamic model is established to analyze the skidding of bearings and the skew of rollers. Then, the load distributions on raceways and inner rings of bearings are calculated using the quasi-dynamic model. Meanwhile, a multi-body finite element model established in RomaxWind software is utilized to simulate and analyze dynamics behaviors of the epicyclic gearbox including all bearings. The comparison of bearings’ lifetimes calculated with different methods shows that the quasi-dynamic model can obtain very close results as the multi-body finite element model obtains, but costs less time. Failures occurring on inner and outer rings, such as pitting, adhesion, are mainly resulted from the misalignment of inner <b>rings</b> and <b>roller</b> number on the skidding of bearings...|$|R

The concept was analyzed using closed-form and finite element techniques, to size structural members for a range of joint diameters and to determine necessary equivalent stiffnesses for the roller assemblies. Also, a mass study of the system was conducted to determine its practicality, and maximum loads in the joint were identified. To obtain the optimum balance between high stiffness and low structural mass {{in the design of the}} rotary joint, it is necessary to maximize the diameter of the annular ring within operational constraints (i. e., shuttle cargo bay size).

50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} were a breakthrough {{at the end}} of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times. They consisted of a cylindrical seat on the frame and part of the axle enclosed in a case or box that held a lubricant. These were called journal bearings and relied on the lubricant to form a fluid bearing. Without adequate lubrication, journal bearings would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction. Timken was able to significantly reduce the friction on his axle bearings by adding tapered elements which actually rolled while transferring the load evenly from axle to frame through the hardened steel inner and outer <b>rings</b> and the <b>rollers</b> - his tapered roller bearing.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating roller screw system. [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating roller screw system, rollers disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking <b>ring</b> gears and <b>roller</b> cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanism}} of surface rolling contact fatigue (SRCF) in rolling bearings is investigated {{by means of}} dedicated experiments and numerical simulations of the damage progression. Pre-indented inner <b>ring</b> raceways in <b>roller</b> and ball bearings were extensively endurance tested. It is observed that spalls originated from indentations in ball bearings develop initially at {{the trailing edge of}} a pre-indented raceway with a typical V-shaped spall.

40|$|The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on ultrasonic inspection of bearing components. Roller bearings sustain the heavy loads railcars can often encounter in the rail industry and consist of an inner and outer <b>ring</b> with <b>rollers</b> transferring the load between the two. Rollers in smaller bearings are typically spherical with {{the contours of the}} rings conforming closely to this spherical geometry. Tapered roller bearings were designed to increase this load capacity by increasing the contact area between the rollers and raceways by using rollers of cylindrical shape. This design allows for the support of heavier railcars but introduces a higher likelihood of encountering a defect below the contact surfaces due to increased contact area between <b>rollers</b> and <b>rings.</b> ^ In this work, metrics for ultrasonic quantification of inclusion content are described and applied to railcar bearings. An analysis program is then developed to quantify inclusion content in a consistent manner regardless of the part geometry such that meaningful comparisons between different steels can be made. Ultrasonic scanning methods and reference parts for equipment setup and calibration are also described. ^ In a similar manner, an alternative mode of defect detection is employed to detect inclusions in this critical region utilizing surface waves which propagate only near the surface of the part. The analysis code developed also characterizes these defects in terms of similar metrics for comparison between steels. Inspection routines and novel reference parts for verification of experimental setup and parameters are developed. ^ Predictions of the ultrasonic attenuation of waves in the presence of several types of defects are presented {{as a result of the}} analysis and theoretical development. The work presents predictions of detection limits in terms of both defect size and type, as well as the incorporation of steel characteristics such as the average grain size. ^ Bulk inspection of defects is modeled considering backscattered signals as a function of defect size and type, as well as the grain size of the steel used. Predictions of backscattered amplitude are given for defects with sizes and types that are of concern for fatigue considerations. Previous studies utilize an approach that models grain noise and defect backscatter independently. This work presents a unified approach to this problem that has not been performed previously. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} De Gekroonde Poelenburg is rather {{complicated}} involving several distinct windmills. The first windmill {{on the original}} location of the first De Poelenburg in Zaandam-Oost was mentioned in 1733. It was named after its owner Pieter Jochemsz. Poelenburg. This mill burned down in 1903 {{and was replaced by}} a windmill from Koog aan de Zaan called De Locomotief (The Locomotive) which was renamed to De Gekroonde Poelenburg after the move. De Locomotief was newly built in Koog aan de Zaan in 1867 to replace the 200-year-old De Groene Jager (The Green Hunter) that had to be dismantled {{for the construction of a}} railway line by the HSM. Hence the name of the new mill. De Gekroonde Poelenburg, formerly De Locomotief, was working until 1950 after which it fell into disrepair. It was acquired by Vereniging De Zaansche Molen and moved to the Zaanse Schans in 1963. It was re-erected at the site of pealing windmill De Grootvorst that had burned down in 1928. The restored mill turned out to be very hard to wind and attempts to use this mill commercially were abandoned in 1966. Since then it is operated by volunteers. The winding problem was solved years later. In hindsight a misunderstanding on the weight distribution of paltrok mills may have caused the problem.

Fase desberdinen frakzio bolumetrikoen eboluzioa, modelo ezberdinak erabiliz kalkulatu da bai austenizazioko berotze arrapalan eta baita austenizazio tenperaturako mantentzean. Lortutako emaitzek, bat egiten dute neurketa metalografikoekin. 100 Cr 6 altzairuaren transformazio bainitikoak azkar egiten du aurrera, 230 ºC-tako tratamendu isotermikoko lehenengo orduan. Hala ere, prozesua nabarmen moteltzen da puntu hortatik aurrera. Behaketa honen harira, bi pausutako tratamenduak diseinatu dira, non temperatura 20 ºC igo den azken 5 minutuetarako. Prozedura honekin lortutako bainita kantitateak 230 ºC-tan 6 orduz lortutakoen oso antzekoak dira. Aleazio altuagoko altzairuetan (adib. 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 eta 100 CrMo 7 - 3) 2 pausutako austenpering tratamenduak ez dira hain eraginkorrak. Transformatu gabeko hondar austenita kantitate esanguratsu bat gelditzen da laginetan tenplaketaren ondoren, eta honek, dimentsio kontrola eta gogortasuna mugatzen ditu. EBSD analisiek, altzairu hipereutektoide hauen mikroegitura, 1 mikra inguruko ferrita aleek osatzen dutela ikusi da; hauek paraleloki 5 mikrako pakete morfologikoak osatzen dituztelarik. Ondoz-ondoko aleen arteko desorientazioa 55 ºC-koa da eta txandakako aleen artekoa < 15 º. Aldaera hauen hautaketa, transformazio energiaren gutxitzearekin dago zihurrenik erlazionatuta. Martensita orratzen kasuarekiko guztiz bestelakoak dira, kasu honetan aleen arteko desorientazioa nagusiki 60 º izanik. Globulizazio ondorengo zementita partikulen tamaina kritikoa da 100 Cr 6 altzairuan transformazio bainitikoa azkartzeko, perlita hondarrak edo globulizatutako karburo oso finak dituzten {{material}}etan, ez bait da transformazio bainitikoa guztiz gauzatzen. Hau, austenizazioan zehar karburo hauen disolbagarritasun altua dela eta, austenitak duen karbono kantitatea handitzen delako gertatzen da. 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 altzairuan, bainitaren nukleazioa, motelago gertatzen da. Kasu honetan, austenizazioaren ondoren, zementita gutxien duten laginetan, bainita gehiago aurkitu da. Beraz, bainitaren hazkuntzan eragin handiagoa du hazten ari diren bainitaren eta zementita partikulen arteko elkarrekintzak, austenitaren egonkortzeak baino. Errodamendutarako osagaien diseinurako, eskala ezberdinetarako fidagarriak diren emaitzak behar dira. Uztailen eta elementu gurpildunen arteko kontaktuan, mikratako tamaina aldaketekin sortutako aldaketak nabarmenak dira errodamenduen jardunean. Gainera, ukipen errodadura nekearen bidez eragindako kalteak aztertuz, hauek tentsio kontzentrazio altuak dituzten inklusioen inguruan, oso material bolumen txikian gertatzen direla esan daiteke. Horregatik, tesi honen amaieran, mikrozutabeetan flexio esperimentuak burutu dira austenperizatutako laginetan topatutako talderik txkienak (adib. ferrita aleak) deformazio gradientepean entsegatuz eta hauen, propietate mekanikoak neurtuz. Horretarako, enpotratutako zutabe oso txikiak (1, 5 x 1, 5 x 5 mikra) mekanizatu dira fokalizatutako ioi emisio bidez (FIB) ehotuz. Metodo honen bidez neurtutako isurpen tentsioen balioak eskala makroskopikoko trakzio entseguetan lortutakoen bikoitzak dira. Hau, zutabearen enpotramenduan eragindako deformazio gradiente handiekin azaldu daiteke, zeinak estatistikoki, pakete morfologikoan dauden dislokazio iturri kantitatea murrizten duten. This thesis analyses {{the effects}} of several austempering treatments on {{the most commonly used}} bearing steels: 100 Cr 6, 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 and 100 CrMo 7 - 3. Having 100 Cr 6 steel as a reference, the other two grades have been selected for their higher hardenability, a property needed for components with wall thickness above 30 mm. Although quenching and tempering is the standard hardening procedure, austempering is preferred when machining costs increase due to distortion issues. Austenitizing has been investigated by means of high resolution dilatometry {{in order to understand the}} transformation kinetics in these steels. Continuous cooling experiments have also been carried out to have a precise determination of the Ms temperatures, especially for 100 CrMn 6 - 4 and 100 CrMo 7 - 3 grades. Different models have been used to calculate the evolution of phase volume fractions during the heating ramp and the dwelling step of the austenitizing cycle. The results obtained show reasonably good correlation with metallographic measurements. The bainitic transformation of 100 Cr 6 progresses at a high rate during the first hour of isothermal treatment at 230 ºC. However, the process slows down dramatically from this point forward. Based on this observation, two step austempering treatments have been designed in which the temperature is increased by 20 ºC for the last 5 minutes. Bainite contents obtained by this procedure are very similar to those obtained after 6 hours at 230 ºC. In the steels with higher alloying (i. e. 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 and 100 CrMo 7 - 3) 2 -step austempering treatments are less effective. A large amount of untransformed austenite is left in the samples after quenching which limits the attainable hardness and deteriorates the dimensional control. EBSD analyses show that the microstructure of these hypereutectoid steels consists of parallel plates with thickness below 1 micron organized in morphological packets with sizes around 5 microns. Misorientation between adjacent plates is close to 55 º whereas in alternate positions misorientations are very small (< 15 º). This variant selection is likely related to the reduction of the transformation strain energy. This is clearly different from martensitic plates in which the most frequent misorientation is 60 º. The size of cementite particles after globulization is critical for accelerating the bainitic transformation in 100 Cr 6 steel. Materials with rests of pearlite or very fine globulized carbides do not complete the bainitic transformation. It is reasonable to assume that the carbon content of austenite increases due to the higher solubility of these types of carbides during austenitisation. The nucleation rate of bainitic plates in 100 CrMnSi 6 - 4 steel is much lower. In this case, a higher volume fraction of bainite is obtained for the material with lower fraction of cementite after austenitisation. Therefore, in this case, the progression of the bainitic transformation is not only affected by the stability of the austenite but also to the interaction between growing bainite grains and cementite particles inside austenite. The design of bearing components requires reliable material data at different size scales. Significant changes in the bearing performance are obtained by micron size modifications in the contact profiles between <b>rings</b> and <b>rollers.</b> In addition, the damage induced by rolling contact fatigue is observed to concentrate in very small volumes of material near highly stresses inclusions. In the final part of this thesis, micro beam bending experiments have been carried out in order to investigate the mechanical properties of the smallest microstructural features found in the austempered samples (i. e. a bainitic ferrite plate) under strong strain gradients. For doing so, extremely fine cantilever beams (1. 5 x 1. 5 x 5 microns) have been produced by focused ion beam milling (FIB). Yield stresses measured by this method are approximately two times higher than those measured in macroscopic tensile test specimens. This is explained by the large strain gradient induced at the beam clamping, which statistically reduces the amount of dislocation sources with respect to those present in the morphological packet...|$|R
