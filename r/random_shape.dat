5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and probability theory, continuum percolation theory is {{a branch of}} mathematics that extends discrete percolation theory to continuous space (often Euclidean space [...] ). More specifically, the underlying points of discrete percolation form types of lattices whereas the underlying points of continuum percolation are often randomly positioned in some continuous space and form a type of point process. For each point, a <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> is frequently placed on it and the shapes overlap each with other to form clumps or components. As in discrete percolation, a common research focus of continuum percolation is studying the conditions of occurrence for infinite or giant components. Other shared concepts and analysis techniques exist in {{these two types of}} percolation theory as well as the study of random graphs and random geometric graphs.|$|E

It is evident that lightning strikes do indeed produce burn marks, and like any basically <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> (clouds, birthmarks, inkbots, etc.) it is human nature to see shapes in them. Although humans being struck by lightning is of course rare, it is nonetheless possible that over a wide period of time, certain cases of burn marks would exist which {{could be said to}} resemble objects nearby the point of the lightning strike. However, these cases are almost certainly the product of coincidence rather than evidence of any photographic property of lightning. No supposed case of keraunography has been investigated by modern science, and unless further evidence is presented, it remains a strange object of 19th-century British folklore.|$|E

Applications of such a distribution in the context of information transmission over a wireless fading channel are provided and novel average symbol error probability (SEP) expressions for single and multi-channel reception are derived involving the Laplace transform of the new distribution.

40|$|We present new {{observational}} data on small-angle {{light scattering}} properties of natural, <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles, as contrasted with spherical particles. The {{interest in this}} "shape effect" on scattering arises from {{the need for a}} suitable kernel matrix for use in the laser diffraction method (LD) of particle sizing. LD is now used broadly for measuring size distribution of suspended marine particles. LD involves the measurement of small-angle forward scattering at multiple angles. This data is inverted using the kernel matrix to produce size distribution. In the absence of a suitable matrix for <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles, past practice has been to use a model based on Mie theory, applicable strictly only to homogeneous spheres. The present work replaces Mie theory with empirical data. The work was motivated in part by anomalous field observations of size distribution and settling velocity distributions reported in literature. We show that a kernel matrix for <b>random</b> <b>shaped</b> particles results in improved interpretation of field multiangle scattering observations. In particular, a rising edge at the fine particle end of the size spectrum is shown to be associated with shape effects...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that verbal {{materials}} vary in meaningfulness or association value, and that these variations are related to learning and retention. Patterns and shapes may vary similarly; however, little systematic control over such variation has been exercised in studies of perceptual learning and retention. Indeed, little effort to standardize such materials has been expended (cf., e. g., the discussions by Hilgard [1951, p. 547] and Graham [1951, pp. 911 - 915]). A number of experiments have appeared in which <b>random</b> <b>shapes</b> have been used as stimuli in tasks involving perceptual learning and retention. <b>Random</b> <b>shapes</b> have also been employed in studies of mediated transfer and "predifferentiation.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mechanistic}} model capable of predicting end milling cutting forces in brittle porous media is described. A coefficient which {{is capable of}} reproducing the <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> and variation in cutting forces due to porosity is proposed. In addition, a method of experimental determination of cutting force coefficients is outlined. The proposed model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> and variation in cutting forces of brittle porous media coincide with the shape and variation of pore size and distribution in the media. The developed coefficient and model is compared to end milling tests conducted in CB 1100, a porous machinable alumina based ceramic manufactured by UMECO. High correlation between predicted and measured cutting forces is shown. Experiments show that the model is capable of accurate prediction of variation in individual cutting tooth force profile shape and overall magnitude over the entire range of machining conditions tested. The benefit of the model lies in its ability to greatly reduce the number of cutting tests required when investigating cutting forces in novel brittle porous materials...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMicroscopic {{analysis}} of paper printing shows regularly spaced dots whose <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> {{depends on the}} printing technology, {{the configuration of the}} printer as well as the paper properties. The modelling and identification of paper and ink interactions are required for qualifying the printing quality, for controlling the printing process and for application in authentication as well. This paper proposes an approach to identify the authentic printer source using micro-tags consisting of microscopic printed dots embedded in the documents. These <b>random</b> <b>shape</b> features are modelled and extracted as a signature for a particular printer. In the paper, we propose a probabilistic model consisting of vector parameters using a spatial interaction binary model with inhomogeneous Markov chain. These parameters determine the location and describe the diverse micro random structures of microscopic printed dots. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is thus developed to approximate the Minimum Mean Squared Error estimator. The performance is assessed through numerical simulations. The real printed dots from the common printing technologies (conventional offset, waterless offset, inkjet, laser) are used to assess the effectiveness of the model...|$|E
