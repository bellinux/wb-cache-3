5000|$|The {{energy from}} the {{incoming}} electromagnetic radiation is basically converted into heat. Thus {{it is the most}} important base for the thermal budget.

Therefore {{it is very important to}} know the chronological sequence and the orbital parameters because these parameters will all be considered and processed in our thermal analysis.All influences have to be combined with the temperature range of the electrical parts in the spacecraft. Precisely because we are using commercial off-the-shelf-products, it is indispensable to hold the satellite in an [...] "earth like" [...] environment. Therefore we are using some several insulation techniques like foils, coatings and so on to get the satellite in this marginal temperature range as well as to guarantee a good environment for micro controllers, sensors and the payload.|$|E
50|$|It is {{calculated}} that, for an Earth-sized object with a kilobar atmospheric pressure of hydrogen, {{in which a}} convective gas adiabat has formed, geothermal energy from residual core radioisotope decay will maintain a surface temperature above the melting point of water. Thus, it is proposed that interstellar planetary bodies with extensive liquid-water oceans may exist. It is further suggested that these planets are likely to remain geologically active for long periods, providing there is a geodynamo-created protective magnetosphere, with possible sea floor volcanism (hydrothermal vents) providing an energy source for life. Thus theoretically, humans might live on a planet without a sun, although food sources would be limited. The author admits these bodies {{would be difficult to}} detect due to the intrinsically weak thermal microwave radiation emissions emanating from the lower reaches of the atmosphere, although later research suggests that <b>reflected</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and far-IR thermal emissions may be detectable if such an object were to pass within 1000 AU of Earth. A study of simulated planet ejection scenarios has suggested that around 5% of Earth-sized planets with Moon-sized natural satellites would retain their satellites after ejection. A large satellite would be a source of significant geological tidal force heating.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the likely contribution of smoke particles from biomass burning to the global radiation balance. These particles act to <b>reflect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> directly; they also can act as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the reflectivity of clouds. Together these effects, although uncertain, may add up globally to a cooling effect as large as 2 watts per square meter, comparable to the estimated contribution to sulfate aerosols.

Iguanid lizards can change color on a much smaller time scale by varying melanin concentration. They become darker when burrowing and lighter when basking - both the desert iguana and the zebra-tailed lizard become so pale that they appear to shine due to the amount of light they reflect.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{accurate}} measurements of Earth's thermal infrared and <b>reflected</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> {{are required for}} detecting and predicting long-term climate change. We consider the concept of using the International Space Station to test instruments and techniques that would eventually be used on a dedicated mission such as the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory. In particular, a quantitative investigation is performed {{to determine whether it}} is possible to use measurements obtained with a highly accurate <b>reflected</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> spectrometer to calibrate similar, less accurate instruments in other low Earth orbits.

50|$|A {{volcanic}} {{winter is}} {{a reduction in}} global temperatures caused by volcanic ash and droplets of sulfuric acid and water obscuring the Sun and raising Earth's albedo (increasing the reflection of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation)</b> after a large particularly explosive volcanic eruption. Long-term cooling effects are primarily dependent upon injection of sulfur gasses into the stratosphere where they undergo a series of reactions to create sulfuric acid which can nucleate and form aerosols. Volcanic stratospheric aerosols cool the surface by <b>reflecting</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and warm the stratosphere by absorbing terrestrial radiation. The volcanic aerosols, resulting from the 1991 Pinatubo eruption and others, {{have been shown to}} contribute to anthropogenic ozone depletion. The variations in atmospheric warming and cooling results in changes in tropospheric and stratospheric circulation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> aerosols have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget. Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds <b>reflect</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, a phenomenon known as the Twomey effect. This effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size, which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the Albrecht effect. Indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Snow transmits, absorbs, and <b>reflects</b> <b>solar</b> <b>{{radiation}}</b> but {{is nearly}} a black {{body in the}} longwave spectrum. On clear days, longwave radiation is emitted to the cold sky, thus cooling the snow surface. Simultaneously, <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> attenuates as it is absorbed, adding thermal energy with depth. Radiation recrystallization {{occurs as a result}} of a temperature gradient caused by the interaction between outgoing longwave radiation and incoming shortwave (<b>solar)</b> <b>radiation.</b> Most shortwave radiation is absorbed in the top three to five centimeters. However, the absorption is also spectrally dependent and short solar wavelengths show deeper penetration. The re-sulting, subsurface heating and corresponding temperature gradient, is consistent with observed devel-opment of radiation recrystallized snow. Surface temperature and temperature gradients through snow pack can be spatially modeled with a computer model RadThermRT and an empirically altered Beer-Lambert-Bouguer for shortwave radiation attenuation...|$|R
