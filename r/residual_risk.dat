In part because agreement {{could not be reached}} on the best way for the EPA to determine whether any significant risks to human health will remain after the technology controls are in place, the amendments also created a Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management and gave the commission a broad mandate to review and make recommendations concerning risk assessment and risk management in federal regulatory programs. In its March 1997 final report to Congress and the administration, the commission recommended a tiered approach to assessing such <b>residual</b> <b>risks.</b> That approach included the idea that when decisions about managing <b>residual</b> <b>risks</b> are made, emissions should be evaluated in the context of other sources of air pollution.

2500|$|In the United States, 10 to 20 {{percent of}} people with breast cancer and people with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree {{relative}} {{with one of these}} diseases. [...] The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. [...] The best known of these, the BRCA mutations, confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent. [...] Some mutations associated with cancer, such as p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2, occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs. However, there is strong evidence of <b>residual</b> <b>risk</b> variation that goes well beyond hereditary BRCA gene mutations between carrier families. [...] This is caused by unobserved risk factors. [...] This implicates environmental and other causes as triggers for breast cancers. [...] The inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes can interfere with repair of DNA cross links and DNA double strand breaks (known functions of the encoded protein). [...] These carcinogens cause DNA damage such as DNA cross links and double strand breaks that often require repairs by pathways containing BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, mutations in BRCA genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers. [...] Levin et al. say that cancer may not be inevitable for all carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. About half of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndromes involve unknown genes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>residual</b> value <b>risk</b> {{modelling}} issues with a focus on automotive lease portfolios. <b>Residual</b> value <b>risk</b> is approached through a re-sampling technique that provides the probability density function of losses and VaR measures for credit portfolios. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is applied to a portfolio of 37, 523 operating leases issued between 1989 and 2001 by a major European financial institution. Findings – The results show that residual value losses are low and sometimes non-existent. Moreover, the major part of <b>residual</b> value <b>risk</b> is idiosyncratic and can thus be eliminated through adequate diversification. Additionally, this internal model seems to prove that capital requirements stemming from the Basel Committee's proposed new framework are somehow overestimated. Originality/value – This paper advocates determining a more accurate <b>risk</b> weight for <b>residual</b> value <b>risk</b> in order to better reflect this relatively low-risk part of leasing activities.

40|$|Abstract: In the leasing {{industry}} the lessor faces a risk, {{at the end}} of the contract, in not recovering sufficient {{capital value}} from resale of the asset. We propose a model to hedge <b>residual</b> value <b>risk</b> using the Gaussian copula methodology. After discussing <b>residual</b> value <b>risk</b> and credit risk modelization, a new derivative product is introduced and analyzed; the Collateralized Residual Values (CRV). The model is applied to an European auto lease portfolio of operating lease contracts pertaining to a major company. Our results indicate that the financial product is easy to customize, and to implement through the contract characteristics and the level of correlation. <b>Residual</b> value <b>risk,</b> credit risk, credit derivatives, factor modeling, copula...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The continuous desire to improve health and safety in UK construction has in recent years been challenged to adopt offsite strategies {{in order to address}} the poor health and safety record of construction. Despite the benefits of using offsite there has been little research on the actual benefits and disadvantages of the effect of offsite on occupational health and safety. This is important given that the UK government has promoted the use of offsite to improve health and safety performance. This thesis provides a strategy for the management of offsite risk and a risk management tool has been developed. The study investigated offsite manufacturers views on offsite activities and risks in comparison with insitu activities and risks. This was achieved through three phases: phase I comprised two expert group interviews, phase II involved ergonomic audits and phase III consisted of three semi-structured interviews with three offsite manufacturers. The thesis identified that there are significant health and safety benefits of offsite. The benefits relate to specific activities within the offsite categories and context studied. Examples include the elimination of work at height, reduction in noise, reduction in work in confined space, reduction in congested work with trade overlap and greater control over work in the factory. The research revealed that there are still potential health and safety risks with offsite. Examples include; transportation and delivery of units of large size and weight with associated high consequence craneage and handling risks (unit fall and hand injury), whole body vibration, cuts, MSDs, RSIs, fumes and slips trips and falls. There appears to be little in the literature to support the identification of offsite risk issues. The study identified strategies to eliminate and reduce offsite <b>residual</b> <b>risks.</b> The case study investigated solutions to further reduce <b>residual</b> <b>risks,</b> which were further explored in phase III the semi-structured interviews.
