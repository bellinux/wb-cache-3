25|$|In the United States the tax {{law allows}} trusts to be taxed as corporations, partnerships, {{or not at}} all {{depending}} on the circumstances, although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations. For example, the trust-preferred security is a hybrid (debt and equity) security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> on banks' balance sheets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets {{to be a part of}} (large) banks' <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E
25|$|Loans made {{to banks}} or {{securities}} firms subject to <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> requirements come under this category. Certain domestic PSEs or MDBs {{that do not}} meet the criteria for a 0% risk weight under the standardized approach also fall in this category.|$|E

25|$|Under the Basel II guidelines, {{banks are}} allowed {{to use their own}} {{estimated}} risk parameters for the purpose of calculating <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital.</b> This is known as the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to capital requirements for credit risk. Only banks meeting certain minimum conditions, disclosure requirements and approval from their national supervisor {{are allowed to}} use this approach in estimating capital for various exposures.|$|E
25|$|After the 2007-2009 {{financial}} crisis, regulators force {{banks to}} issue Contingent convertible bonds (CoCos).These are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses {{in accordance with}} their contractual terms when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level. Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost. Owing to their capacity to absorb losses, CoCos have the potential to satisfy <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> requirement.|$|E
25|$|Rating system {{refers to}} the entire {{mathematical}} and technological infrastructure a bank has {{put in place to}} quantify and assign the risk parameters. Banks are allowed to use multiple ratings systems for different exposures, but the methodology of assigning an exposure to a particular rating system must be logical and documented; banks are not allowed to use a particular rating system to minimize <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> requirements.|$|E
50|$|Above {{all these}} service types, ABCP {{programs}} {{are commonly used}} by banks to free up their <b>regulatory</b> <b>capitals</b> by moving the seemingly safe assets off their balance sheet. Traditionally, banks keep everything on their balance sheet and owners of the bank have to hold {{a certain amount of}} equity to meet the capital requirement. This means if a bank wants to invest in a large new project, i.e. increase its asset largely, it has to increase owners' equity proportionality. Moving such project off bank's balance sheet eliminates the need of increasing equity. Through setting up ABCP conduits, banks can fund assets all by short-term liabilities.|$|R

Furthermore, our evidence indicates that <b>capital</b> <b>regulatory</b> oversight and supervisory oversight are not significantly related to foreign bank ownership. ...|$|R
25|$|Banks must {{satisfy the}} 'use test', {{which means that}} the ratings must be used {{internally}} in the risk management practices of the bank. A rating system solely devised for calculating <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> is not acceptable. While banks are encouraged to improve their rating systems over time, they are required to demonstrate the use of risk parameters for risk management {{for at least three years}} prior to obtaining qualification.|$|E
25|$|Credit scoring {{models are}} allowed {{to play a role}} in the {{estimation}} of the risk parameters as long as sufficient human judgment not captured by the model is taken into account to assign the final rating to a borrower. The bank must also satisfy the supervisor that the data used to build these models are representative of its exposures, and there is no distortion in the calculation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital</b> due to the use of these models. Banks must also have in place a system governing the use of these models and whether they are fit for purpose for ongoing use; such a system must consider the stability of the model as well as its ability to predict default accurately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{nonparametric methods}} for estimating 99. 9 % operational value-at-risk (OpVaR) and its confidence interval (CI), and demonstrates their applications to US business losses. An attractive feature {{of these new}} methods {{is that there is}} no need to estimate either the entire heavy-tailed loss distribution or the tail region of the distribution. Furthermore, we provide algorithms that facilitate applied researchers and practitioners in risk management area to implement the sophisticated empirical likelihood ratio (ELR) based methodologies to construct the CI of the true underlying 99. 9 % OpVaR. In a simulation study, we find that the weighted ELR (WELR) CI estimator is more reliable than the ELR CI estimator. The empirical results show that the nonparametric OpVaR estimates are consistently larger than those of other comparable methods, which provide adequate <b>regulatory</b> <b>capitals,</b> particularly during crises. The findings have implications for regulators, and effective and efficient risk financing...|$|R
2500|$|At first, {{banks were}} the {{dominant}} {{players in the}} market, as CDS were primarily used to hedge risk in connection with its lending activities. [...] Banks also saw an opportunity to free up <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital.</b> By March 1998, the global market for CDS was estimated at about $300 billion, with JP Morgan alone accounting for about $50 billion of this.|$|E
2500|$|A bank buying {{protection}} {{can also}} use a CDS to free <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital.</b> [...] By offloading a particular credit risk, a bank {{is not required to}} hold as much capital in reserve against the risk of default (traditionally 8% of the total loan under Basel I). [...] This frees resources the bank can use to make other loans to the same key customer or to other borrowers.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} concern that the GSEs' {{liquidity}} was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure {{due to lack of}} liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk), which would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of deferred tax assets towards their <b>regulatory</b> <b>capital,</b> which were considered by some to be of [...] "low quality" [...] and not truly available capital. The deferred tax assets would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes. Both companies had experienced significant losses and were likely to face more over the next year or longer.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the effects of Basle accord on the three main issues: a) does the introduction of fixed minimum capital requirements lead banks to hold higher capital ratio? b) do the banks adjust their capital and risk level to achieve <b>regulatory</b> and market <b>capital</b> requirements? c) do the changes in the capital ratios or risk level create credit crunches which affect the economic growth? To address these issues, an econometric model, which apply the 3 SLS method is developed in order to identify the factors, which affects the capital ratio, risk and credit crunch. In addition, a simulation is done to examine the counterfactual of several variables. Descriptive analyses find that all commercial banks in Malaysia have already achieved the <b>regulatory</b> minimum <b>capital</b> requirement of 8 %. The findings also show that an increase in the capital ratio creates credit crunch...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the long run}} interaction among deposit insurance, bank deposit rates and capital adequacy requirements. Using analysis similar to the price discrimination model of Lott and Roberts (1991) we find that a competitive environment among banks would link the spread between insured and uninsured deposit rates {{to the size of}} the insurance premium. We also find that banks that choose to operate at the <b>regulatory</b> minimum <b>capital</b> level, would increase asset risk with increased capital requirements if (1) the implicit interest paid to insured and uninsured depositors is equally sensitive to changes in risk and capital adequacy and (2) the insurance premium is independent of the level of risk and capital adequacy. Under the present risk-based premium structure, asset risk has the potential to decline when the <b>regulatory</b> agency raises <b>capital</b> requirements. Finally, we examine the time series behavior of insured and uninsured interest rates to see if it is consistent with our theoretical model. We find that insured and uninsured rates, along with deposit insurance premiums, are cointegrated series as suggested by our model. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997. ...|$|R
40|$|Research {{regarding}} the capital structure of banks {{points to the}} <b>regulatory</b> minimum <b>capital</b> requirement established by the Basel agreements as its main determinant. For other kinds of enterprise, capital structure is pointed to by several theories as a tax planning alternative, since the use of debt allows tax savings. Given the debt characteristics of banks, which prevent the deduction {{of interest in the}} calculation of income taxes and thus prevent tax savings through debt, the use of capital structure for tax planning by financial institutions is less evident. In view of this, in addition to contributing to research on the determinants of the capital structure of banks, this study has the objective of examining the relationship between overall debt, taxation and the BIS ratio of financial institutions located in Brazil. The initial sample consisted of the 50 largest banks, identified by the criterion of net income in 2012; but due to lack of availability of information and adjustments made to assure the efficacy of the study, the final sample was made up of 34 financial institutions. The baseline for analysis was the mean values of data from 2010 to 2012 and data were analyzed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. No relationship was found between taxation and banks' overall indebtedness. However, influence of the <b>regulatory</b> minimum <b>capital</b> requirement on the capital structure of financial institutions was observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There was a {{systemic}} failure of financial regulation: Senior policymakers repeatedly enacted and implemented policies that destabilized {{the global financial}} system. They maintained these policies even as they learned {{of the consequences of}} their policies during the decade before the crisis. The crisis does not primarily reflect an absence of regulatory power, unclear lines of <b>regulatory</b> authority, <b>capital</b> account imbalances, or a lack of information by regulators. Rather, it represents the unwillingness of the policy apparatus to adapt to a dynamic, innovating financial system. I propose a new institution to improve the design, implementation, and modification of financial regulations...|$|R
