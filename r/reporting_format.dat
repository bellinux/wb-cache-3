Standardizing the <b>report</b> <b>format</b> is intended to make the evaluation information more accessible to program staff by providing one major framework for organizing the information. A consistent format for organizing the information is expected to facilitate reading and understanding of reports on diverse projects and components of the program, thus increasing the likelihood that results will be used. It is understood that not all evaluation reports can be forced into the same format (for example, qualitative evaluation designs might require a different <b>report</b> <b>format</b> for effective presentation of the results). In such cases, modified or alternative formats should be discussed with the external evaluation coordinating center and the director of evaluation...|$|R
