5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. <b>Radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{greenhouses}} are {{yet another}} matter, having an internal source of heating they leak heat out, {{which must be}} prevented. So it again makes sense {{to try to prevent}} <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> through the use of adequate glazing.|$|E

25|$|Aerosol {{indirect}} effect. Aerosols {{modify the}} properties of clouds through {{a subset of the}} aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> (first indirect effect), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect).|$|E
25|$|If {{the plasma}} is {{optically}} thin, the bremsstrahlung radiation leaves the plasma, carrying {{part of the}} internal plasma energy. This effect {{is known as the}} bremsstrahlung cooling. It is a type of <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling.</b> The energy carried away by bremsstrahlung is called bremsstrahlung losses and represents a type of radiative losses. One generally uses the term bremsstrahlung losses in the context when the plasma cooling is undesired, as e.g. in fusion plasmas.|$|E

25|$|Daytime {{exposure}} to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper {{layers of the}} snowpack if the sunlight {{is strong enough to}} melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling,</b> or both. Radiative heat loss occurs when the night air is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in the snow is re-radiated into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The 13Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule {{of thumb}} rather than {{something}} of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> rate.|$|E
25|$|When the {{accretion}} rate is sub-Eddington and the opacity very high, the standard thin accretion disk is formed. It is geometrically thin in the vertical direction (has a disk-like shape), and {{is made of}} a relatively cold gas, with a negligible radiation pressure. The gas goes down on very tight spirals, resembling almost circular, almost free (Keplerian) orbits. Thin disks are relatively luminous and they have thermal electromagnetic spectra, i.e. {{not much different from}} that of a sum of black bodies. <b>Radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> is very efficient in thin disks. The classic 1974 work by Shakura and Sunyaev on thin accretion disks {{is one of the most}} often quoted papers in modern astrophysics. Thin disks were independently worked out by Lynden-Bell, Pringle and Rees. Pringle contributed in the past thirty years many key results to accretion disk theory, and wrote the classic 1981 review that for many years was the main source of information about accretion disks, and is still very useful today.|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{demonstration model}} of a new-technology, high-performance, cryogenic <b>radiative</b> <b>cooler</b> has been successfully tested in a helium-cooled vacuum chamber. Thermal isolation of the radiator cold stage from the warm spacecraft and instrument is achieved by a novel arrangement of lightweight radiation shields which form large V-groove cavities, and {{by the use of}} low-conductance structural supports. The vacuum chamber experiments demonstrate the thermal isolation capability of the radiator design. Analytical model predictions are all within 1 K of the measured test temperatures. Utilization of this design enables reasonably sized radiative coolers (less than 0. 3 sq m) to achieve operating temperatures below 60 K at earth, Mars, and beyond for useful cooling loads below 75 mW. The design can be scaled to accommodate larger heat loads. The reduction in operating temperature of over 15 K relative to any <b>radiative</b> <b>cooler</b> flown in the past will allow the V-groove isolation radiator to meet the challenging instrument cooling requirements of many future space missions...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{radiator}} stages {{separated by}} V-groove shields protect main cooler from parasitic heat radiation and offer usable cooling themselves.

The detector operating temperature for the worst-case orbital environment is about 73 K...|$|R
500|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{falls in}} the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon. Consequently, the nights range from very cool in the summer to extremely cold in the winter; therefore, visitors should always remember to bring along at least a jacket, even during the summer. Records indicate that the highest temperature ever recorded in the forest was [...] in 1978, while the coldest was [...] in 1972.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees are {{typically}} found in temperate climates, {{and are often}} found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees, although a few lowland tropical species exist. A few species (B. polaris and B. alpinus) range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; B. polaris occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, along with another bumblebee B. hyperboreus, which parasitises its nest. This is the most northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect. One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of [...] "shivering" [...] and <b>radiative</b> <b>cooling</b> from the abdomen (called heterothermy).

[...] Here the surface properties {{may be an important}} design factor. Matte-black surfaces will radiate much more efficiently than shiny bare metal. [...] A shiny metal surface has low emissivity. The emissivity of a material is tremendously frequency dependent, and is related to absorptivity (of which shiny metal surfaces have very little). For most materials, the emissivity in the visible spectrum is similar to the emissivity in the infrared spectrum; however there are exceptions, notably certain metal oxides that are used as [...] "selective surfaces".|$|E

40|$|Recent {{demands for}} {{spaceborne}} sensor temperatures below 90 K are exceeding {{the capabilities of}} present passive <b>radiative</b> <b>cooler</b> designs. To improve cooling performance, a novel technique was developed to radiatively and conductively isolate the radiating plate from the spacecraft using low-emittance, highly specular angled radiation shields.

Based on the concept test results, performance predictions show that the Advanced Radiator can achieve lower temperatures, deliver more cooling power and be smaller and lighter than the best state-of-the-art coolers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the thermal design and thermal {{testing of the}} development model <b>radiative</b> <b>cooler</b> for the Composite Infra-Red Spectrometer (CIRS) due for launch on the Cassini spacecraft in 1997. The <b>radiative</b> <b>cooler</b> is used to cool the instrument's Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) to approximately 80 K. The FPA holds two arrays of HgCdTe detectors for the mid infra-red spectrometer of the instrument which covers the wavelength range 7 μm to 17 μm. The FPA is mounted from the optics on a titanium alloy tripod and is cooled conductively by the radiator via a flexible link and a cold finger. A range of thermal models of the system have been developed ranging from a simple, analytical model to a finite difference numerical model. A calorimeter was designed to perform heat leak measurements on samples of Multi- Layer Insulation (MLI) blankets {{to determine the number}} and type of shields required for the MLI blanket covering the back of the cooler radiator. A test facility incorporating a vacuum system, a space simulator target, and a simulator for the CIRS instrument was designed and constructed for testing the assembled cooler. Various configurations of the Development Model (DM) CIRS cooler were tested as components became available and the results obtained compared to the thermal model predictions. It was found that the cooler will attain a temperature of 80 K in operation, but with less excess cooling power than predicted by the thermal models...|$|R
