50|$|On 20 March 2016, the Custom {{officials}} at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from a mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag {{was said to}} belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu leaving this bag behind. Out of the 146 <b>tortoises,</b> 139 were <b>Radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered tortoise species of Madagascar.

50|$|No {{estimates}} of wild populations are available, but {{their numbers are}} declining, and many authorities see {{the potential for a}} rapid decline to extinction in the wild. In the North American studbook, 332 specimens are listed as participating in captive-breeding programs such as the Species Survival Plan. Captive breeding has shown great promise as in the captive breeding program for the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> at the New York Zoological Society's Wildlife Survival Center. In 2005, the Wildlife Survival Center was closed, and the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> captive-breeding program was continued with the inception of the Behler Chelonian Center.|$|E

5000|$|The {{carapace}} of the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is brilliantly {{marked with}} yellow lines radiating {{from the center}} of each dark plate of the shell, hence its name. This [...] "star" [...] pattern is more finely detailed and intricate than the normal pattern of other star-patterned tortoise species, such as G. elegans of India.The <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is also larger than G. elegans, and the scutes of the carapace are smooth, and not raised up into a bumpy, pyramidal shape as is commonly seen in the latter species. There is slight sexual dimorphism. Compared to females, male radiated tortoises usually have longer tails and the notches beneath their tails are more noticeable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chelonian intranuclear {{coccidiosis}} {{has been}} reported once, in two <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises,</b> three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18 S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered {{the cause of death}} in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises...|$|R
50|$|As the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> are herbivores, grazing {{constitutes}} 80-90% {{of their}} diets, while they also eat fruits and succulent plants. A favorite {{food in the}} wild is the Opuntia cactus. They are known to graze regularly in the same area, thus keeping the vegetation in that area closely trimmed. They seem to prefer new growth rather than mature growth because of the high-protein, low-fiber content.|$|R
25|$|The African Savannah {{replaced}} {{a variety}} of barred cages, and was the largest construction project undertaken at the zoo when it was created. The exhibit recreates the African savannah, and includes African painted dogs, African lions, cheetahs, Grant's zebras, hamadryas baboons, meerkats, <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Rothschild's giraffes, spotted hyaenas and southern white rhinoceroses. Visitors view the animals from a path that simulates a dry riverbed running through the savannah.|$|R
