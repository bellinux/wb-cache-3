In that <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118km/h (74mph) are known as typhoons.

In that <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum barometric pressure of , before striking eastern China.|$|E
5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> are controlled for.|$|E
5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and this is only for one <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E
