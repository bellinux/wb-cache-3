40|$|Tobacco {{products}} {{are composed of}} {{a great variety of}} constituents. Nicotine, 1 -methyl- 2 (3 -pyridyl) pyrrolidine, is a highly toxic major alkaloid found in tobacco plants and plays an important etiological {{role in the development of}} human carcinogenesis. Nicotine is also accused of the addictive potential of smoking, being classified by the Drug Abuse Advisory Committee as an addictive substance. Carbon dioxide has been extensively used for the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> nicotine from <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves</b> in the production of new cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. Although detailed knowledge of phase behaviour is most important for the design of any separation process, solubility of nicotine in sub/supercritical CO 2 seems to have been scarcely studied. Reported measurements are restricted to the temperatures of 313 and 343 K, and covering a range of pressures of 0. 9 – 8 MPa and 0. 9 – 16 MPa, respectively. In this work we present a phase behaviour study of the CO 2 -nicotine binary system at 313. 1 K, in a pressure range of 6 to 9 MPa. The phase equilibrium measurements were performed using an apparatus that employs a high-pressure sapphire cell and allows sampling of both vapour and liquid phases. From the experimental work, it could be concluded that, according to the Scott and Van Konynenburg classification of fluid phase equilibria, the system nicotine + CO 2 most likely shows type-V fluid phase behaviour. The characteristic of this type of phase behaviour is a three-phase (VLL) equilibrium, with a discontinuous critical curve. As expected, the mutual miscibility increases with increasing pressure and the mixture will be homogeneous above the upper critical pressures. These data may help in further studies on sub/supercritical CO 2 extraction of nicotine from nicotine-containing products...|$|R

40|$|Most of classification, quality {{evaluation}} or grading <b>of</b> the flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves</b> are manually operated, which {{relies on the}} judgmental experience of experts, and inevitably limited by personal, physical and environmental factors. The classification and the {{quality evaluation}} are therefore subjective and experientially based. In this paper, an automatic classification method <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves</b> based on the digital image processing and the fuzzy sets theory is presented. A grading system based on image processing techniques was developed for automatically inspecting and grading flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves.</b> This system uses machine vision for the extraction and analysis of color, size, shape and surface texture. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation provides {{a high level of}} confidence in decision making based on the fuzzy logic. The neural network is used to estimate and forecast the membership function of the features <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves</b> in the fuzzy sets. The experimental results of the two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) show that the accuracy rate of classification is about 94 % for the trained <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves,</b> and the accuracy rate <b>of</b> the non-trained <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaves</b> is about 72 %.
