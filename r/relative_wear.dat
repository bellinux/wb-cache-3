50|$|One of Bonifacio's {{best known}} works is {{the pack of}} tarocchi cards he painted for Bianca Visconti Sforza in the mid fifteenth century. Tarot cards {{began to appear in}} the mid fifteenth century, making Bembo one of the first artists to paint a deck of them. Bianca Sforza chose to have Bembo paint the cards because he was her {{favorite}} painter. In all, Bembo painted seventy-two cards of the full deck of seventy-eight. The modelling of the cherubs on the remaining six cards is different from Bembo's style and they are believed to have been painted by Antonio Cicognara to replace cards that had been lost from the original set. Of these seventy-eight, four have been lost over the course of history. The four that have been lost are the Devil, the Tower, the Knight of Coins, and the Three of Swords. The deck was composed of four main suits known as the Swords, Cups, Coins, and Staves. In addition the deck had a fifth mysterious suit of twenty-one trumps and a wild card known as the Fool. Bembo hand painted each individual card with skill, managing to incorporate the Visconti motto into many cards of the four main suits. On the fifth suit he managed to add Sforza devices. The deck is thought to have been painted in 1450, the year that Count Sforza adopted the three-ring device found on the Emperor and Empress cards. Each card was painted and illuminated on heavy cardboard and measures 175 by 87 millimeters. Given their beauty and elegance, the cards were very rarely played with, if at all, by the Sforza family based on the <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> and tear on the cards compared to other decks the family owned. Even today the beauty of the cards has an impact on people. Italo Calvino wrote a novel titled The castle of crossed destinies based on the deck of cards Bembo created. Today, the cards can be found in different places as the set has been broken up throughout the years. The Morgan Library and Museum acquired 35 of the cards in 1911 and they have remained there ever since. At the Morgan Library the cards are kept in transparent envelopes so they may be examined without handling them. They are also held in a fourteenth century French casket-box decorated in relief with chivalric scenes. Thirteen cards are owned by the Colleoni family who inherited them from the Sforza family. Finally, the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo owns the other 26 cards with the final four cards having been lost.|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of performance based standards for heavy vehicles, {{the industry is}} developing new generation vehicles incorporating higher tyre pressures, higher axle load limits and new axle group configurations such as quad axle groups. There {{is a need to}} study the impact of these vehicles on pavement performance now rather than waiting 10 - 20 years to quantify pavement damage. This paper describes a <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> assessment method which allows assessment of the relative impact of new proposed heavy vehicles on road pavements compared with existing heavy vehicles. The method includes the following three analyses (i) a 3 -dimensional vehicle model to estimate vertical and horizontal forces generated by a vehicle on pavement structure, (ii) a 3 -dimensional finite element pavement model to estimate the structural response and performance of a representative pavement under the imposed vehicle loadings, and (iii) a <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> concept to assess the <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> of various pavement components based on the outputs from the vehicle model and pavement model.

40|$|The {{machining}} parameter settings installed at CNC EDM machines are developed under optimum process conditions. Standard workpiece and electrode materials are used traditionally by machine manufacturers {{to establish the}} EDM parameter settings. However, {{this is not the}} usual situation of the tooling industry, where many different grades of workpiece and tool electrode materials are used. Consequently, the customers are required to develop their own process parameters, which normally demand many experimental tests. According to the aforementioned argument an experimental investigation on the EDM of AISI P 20 tool steel under finish machining has been carried out. The tests were performed with graphite and copper as tool electrodes. Important EDM electrical parameters that influence the process performance were investigated. The measured technological outputs were the material removal rate Vw, volumetric <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> J and workpiece surface finish Ra. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: the best results for material removal rate Vw were reached when EDM with negative graphite electrodes. Graphite and copper tools presented similar results of Vw for positive polarity.

40|$|Electric {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a thermoelectric {{process in which}} electrical energy is converted into thermal energy and this thermal energy {{is used for the}} machining purpose. It is the common practice in EDM to make tool negative and work piece positive (direct polarity), but researches shows that reverse of it is also possible in which tool is positive and work piece is negative (reverse polarity), but not much work has been carried out on the reverse polarity till now. This paper discusses the effect of tool polarity on the machining characteristics in electric {{discharge machining}} of silver steel. High metal removal rate, low <b>relative</b> electrode <b>wear</b> and good surface finish are conflicting goals, which can not be achieved simultaneously with a particular combination of control settings. To achieve the best machining results, the goal has to be taken separately in different phases of work with different emphasis. A 32 factorial design has been used for planning of experimental conditions. Copper is used as tool material and Silver steel of 28 grade is selected as work piece material with positive and negative polarities. The effectiveness of EDM process with silver steel is evaluated in terms of metal removal rate (MRR), percent <b>relative</b> electrode <b>wear</b> (%REW) and the surface roughness (S. R) ofthe work piece produced at different current and pulse duration levels. In this experimental work spark erosion oil (trade name IPOL) is taken as a dielectric and experiments have been conducted at 50 % duty factor. The study reveals that direct polarity is suitable for higher metal removal rate and lower <b>relative</b> electrode <b>wear</b> but reverse polarity gives better surface finish as compared to direct polarity. Direct polarity gives 4 - 11 times more MRR and 5 times less <b>relative</b> electrode <b>wear</b> as compared to reverse polarity, and reverse polarity gives 1. 3 - 2. 7 times better surface finish as compared to direct polarity. Second order regression model is also developed foroutput parameters...|$|R

40|$|Nanoscale, single-asperity wear of {{single-crystal}} silicon carbide (sc-SiC) and nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC) is investigated using single-crystal diamond nanoindenter tips and nanocrystalline diamond {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) tips under dry conditions, and the wear behavior is {{compared to that of}} {{single-crystal silicon}} with both thin and thick native oxide layers. We discovered a transition in the <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> resistance of the SiC samples compared to that of Si as a function of contact size. With larger nanoindenter tips (tip radius around 370 nm), the wear resistances of both sc-SiC and nc-SiC are higher than that of Si. This result is expected from the Archard's equation because SiC is harder than Si. However, with the smaller AFM tips (tip radius around 20 nm), the wear resistances of sc-SiC and nc-SiC are lower than that of Si, {{despite the fact that the}} contact pressures are comparable to those applied with the nanoindenter tips, and the plastic zones are well-developed in both sets of wear experiments. We attribute the decrease in the <b>relative</b> <b>wear</b> resistance of SiC compared to that of Si to a transition from a wear regime dominated by the materials' resistance to plastic deformation (i. e., hardness) to a regime dominated by the materials' resistance to interfacial shear. This conclusion is supported by our AFM studies of wearless friction, which reveal that the interfacial shear strength of SiC is higher than that of Si. The contributions of surface roughness and surface chemistry to differences in interfacial shear strength are also discussed...|$|E
