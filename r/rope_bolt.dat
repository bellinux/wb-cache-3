The [...] "Dolphin" [...] rolled swiftly along her path, and each moment dissipated the mist in which distance had enveloped the lesser objects on board the stranger. Guns, blocks, <b>ropes,</b> <b>bolts,</b> men, and even features, became plainly visible, in rapid succession, as the water that divided them was parted by the bows of the lawless ship. In a few short minutes, the stranger, having secured most of his lighter canvas, came sweeping up to the wind; and then, as his after-sails, squared for the purpose, took the breeze on their outer surface, the mass of his hull became stationary.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> were {{described}} as early as 1847, when Robert Kipping addressed [...] "bolt-rope" [...] attachment {{for a variety of}} sails, using sewing techniques appropriate to each, in his book, The Elements of Sailmaking. He addressed the tradeoff between stiffness and flexibility to provide reinforcement without distorting the intended shape of the sail. He emphasized the need for the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> not to affect the degree of slack on the leech (trailing edge) of a sail. He further emphasized that the rope must retain its original twist, as it is sewn in place, to avoid distorting the edge of the sail. He observed that, [...] "Many a well-cut sail is spoiled by the roping." ...|$|R
50|$|Its {{similarity}} with a spinnaker {{is that it}} is not {{attached to}} a stay along its luff, and typically has a slightly larger curvature than a genoa. Luff shape and tension is maintained by the halyard and a <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> which is woven into the sail itself, and it is this stiff tensioned rope which allows the sail to be furled on itself. In addition, many screachers are gybed by allowing the sail to fly free and pass in front of the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> and invert, much in the same way that an asymmetrical spinnaker is gybed. Tacking with a screacher may require furling and re-setting. The similarity with a genoa {{is that it is}} typically a white sail, and the clews always overlap the mast.|$|R
50|$|The buntlines {{are small}} lines {{fastened}} {{to the bottom of}} the sails, in the middle part of the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope,</b> to the cringle; and so are passed through a small block, seized to the yard. Their use is to trice up the bunt of the sail, to better furl it up.|$|R
60|$|He discovered, later, {{traces of}} an attempt to cross the gap in the broken bridge. A <b>rope</b> with a <b>bolt</b> {{attached}} had been flung across and had caught in a fenestration of a projecting fragment of railing. The end of the rope trailed in the seething water towards the fall.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the {{hurricane}} struck them, {{and for the next}} three days the tempest was terrible. Great waves swept over the ship, and every time that the captain attempted to show a rag of canvas, it was blown from the <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes.</b> The ship, however, was a stout one, and weathered the gale.|$|R
50|$|Saxon Switzerland is {{characterized}} by its sandstone rocks which draw many rock climbers. There are some 14,000 climbing routes on over 1,100 rock pinnacles. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the Saxon Rules for rock climbing were established. They are considered {{to be one of the}} origins of free climbing. <b>Ropes</b> and <b>bolts</b> may only be used for safety but never as a means of climbing. The use of chalk and common means of protection such as nuts and friends is also not permitted; instead knotted nylon slings are used. With a few exceptions, climbing is only practised and permitted at freestanding rock towers.|$|R
5000|$|Fore-and-aft sails {{often have}} <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> {{on the leading}} edge (luff) where they attach to the mast and the bottom edge (foot) where they attach to the boom, which provide the terms, [...] "luff bolt rope" [...] and [...] "foot bolt rope". They also occur on the edges of sails {{suspended}} from a spar, such as for gaff, square and lateen rigs.|$|R

Aveng Manufacturing Duraset specializes in the manufacturing of support (reinforcement) and suspension products mainly used within the mining industry, worldwide. Some of these products include: Rock Studs, Rock <b>Bolts,</b> <b>Rope</b> Eye <b>Bolts</b> and Pigtails each with their sub section of components. Safety is {{a major factor in the}} success of Aveng Manufacturing Duraset. This project will aim to smooth the general workflow of raw materials and products throughout the manufacturing process and also the general control and allocation of stock and inventory with, if time allows it, a simulation model for a recommendation of a new and improved manufacturing system would be included. This will be achieved by using the various relevant Industrial Engineering methods, tools and problem solving techniques gathered and learned in the BEng Industrial Degree thus far. This report will show the author’s recommendation to the current problems at Duraset Manufacturing. System improvements, whether it is the decrease of idle times, increase in productivity and output of finished products, by eliminating bottlenecks and implementing new technology, simple, basic designs and equipment, even the control of finished products, good housekeeping and accurate stock data in whichever way possible, that should provide Aveng Manufacturing Duraset with one of many solutions.

40|$|Within a {{first floor}} {{room of a}} factory housed in the Gangadhar Ji Ki Haveli in the Naya bazaar of Ajmer, India, a loom is {{restrained}} by a <b>rope</b> <b>bolted</b> through the centre of a fictive scene painted on the wall to keep the machine in position. The painting {{has been identified as}} depicting the “celebration of the ninth or tenth day of Dasahra in Jaipur” and shows a “puja to the royal vehicles of war [...] elephants, horses, camels, carts, palanquins, etc”. The paintings are in a Jaipuri tradition, either early 19 th or possibly late 18 th century. The puncture appears to be sensitively positioned, through a blank middle ground of white. We were told at the factory that their products; “all kinds of Gota Fancy Jari and Metallic Goods” are mainly sold to the many thousands of pilgrims visiting the Dargah at Ajmer annually. Should the relationship between the painted scene and the mercantile activity supported by ongoing ritual traditions be regarded as a poignant overlayering or a serious conservation risk? A ruinous neighbouring site shows the economic threats at hand. Arguably the makeshift canopy over the inner courtyard, erected to facilitate the storage of materials has saved this building from obsolescence. The presence of the machines may even be seen in a positive light; ensuring that the frescoes are not overly impacted by high levels of humidity from modern domestic activity. The pigments are protected from natural light by permanent shades. In addition, its connection with the weaving, the ritual traditions of dress and occasion that surround the Dargah, make a literal thread from past to present, albeit transformed into “Rayon, Nylon and Metallic Yarn”. Nevertheless outside, the indifference appears more concerning, the elephants flanking the entrance are already half rendered in cement. On the face of it, it might be assumed that conservation management must begin and activity be suspended. However, it may also be read as a demonstration of specific path of continuity, an economic business model upheld by the ritual significance and almost unique cosmopolitan spiritual activity of the city itself...|$|R
50|$|The {{brothers}} {{found that}} paper {{made from a}} scrap pile of manila <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> cut from old sails was very strong and suitable for industrial applications; they were granted a patent by the U.S. Patent Office for the manufacture of paper from manila fiber. In 1852 Lyman Hollingsworth purchased an existing paper mill {{on the site of}} the present West Groton Mill of Hollingsworth & Vose Company. Until 1881 it was used to manufacture paper from jute and manila for tag paper, pattern paper, abrasive backing, and wrapping paper. These products were sold both domestically and abroad.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Maestri {{returned}} to Cerro Torre and climbed a new route on the south-east {{side of the}} mountain. Over two seasons he used a petrol-driven compressor, weighing approximately 135 kg (300 pounds), and thousands of metres of fixed <b>ropes</b> to drill <b>bolts</b> into the rock, some 400 in all. The resulting route {{became known as the}} Compressor Route. Its namesake can still be found hanging on the face of Cerro Torre 100m below the summit. On this second endeavour, Maestri stopped short of the summit's [...] "ice mushroom", which almost always covers the highest point.|$|R
5000|$|In mountaineering, a fixed rope or {{fixed line}} is the {{practice}} of fixing in place <b>bolted</b> <b>ropes</b> to assist climbers and walkers in exposed mountain locations. They are used widely on American and European climbing routes, where they may be called via ferrata routes, but are not used in [...] "Alpine style" [...] mountaineering. Many guided expeditions {{to any of the}} eight-thousanders normally set up fixed rope on steep or icy sections of the route. For example, on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest, fixed rope was used to reduce the bottleneck of climbers that typically results from climbing this technical section just below the summit.|$|R
60|$|The captain, {{the first}} mate, and two seamen {{were at the}} wheel. Reuben saw the captain wave his hand, but his words {{were lost in the}} fury of the wind. The second mate, Bill Hardy, and two or three other sailors knew what was required, and hauled upon the lee brace of the fore-top-sail yard. The Paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but {{gradually}} her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale. Scarcely had she done so, when the fore-top sail blew out of the <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes,</b> with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest.|$|R
50|$|In lead climbing, a climber climbs a {{route from}} the ground up. For {{protection}} against a fall, the lead climber trails a rope which is managed by a belayer who remains {{on the ground or}} at an established anchor. As the leader climbs, they either place traditional protection such as cams and stoppers, or clip their <b>rope</b> through pre-placed <b>bolted</b> hangers or fixed anchors. The belayer feeds rope to the lead climber through a belay device, keeping a minimum amount of slack in the system, and keeping themself ready to catch the leader in case of a fall. The leader climbs until the top is reached, and they can then belay the following climber from above.|$|R
60|$|Mulcachy {{ordered an}} {{assistant}} to enter the arena with him. Since he could not compel the tiger directly {{to sit in the}} chair, he must employ other means. The <b>rope</b> about Ben <b>Bolt's</b> neck was passed up through the bars and rove through the block-and-tackle. At signal from Mulcachy, the ten men hauled away. Snarling, struggling, choking, in a fresh madness of terror at this new outrage, Ben Bolt was slowly hoisted by his neck up from the floor, until, quite clear of it, whirling, squirming, battling, suspended by his neck like a man being hanged, his wind was shut off and he began to suffocate. He coiled and twisted, the splendid muscles of his body enabling him almost to tie knots in it.|$|R
5000|$|Quickdraws (often {{referred}} to as [...] "draws") are used by climbers to connect <b>ropes</b> to <b>bolt</b> anchors, or to other traditional protection, allowing the rope {{to move through the}} anchoring system with minimal friction. A quickdraw consists of two non-locking carabiners connected together by a short, pre-sewn loop of webbing. Alternatively, and quite regularly, the pre-sewn webbing is replaced by a sling of the above-mentioned dyneema/nylon webbing. This is usually of a 60 cm loop and can be tripled over between the carabiners to form a 20 cm loop. Then when more length is needed the sling can be turned back into a 60 cm loop offering more versatility than a pre-sewn loop. Carabiners used for clipping into the protection generally have a straight gate, decreasing the possibility of the carabiner accidentally unclipping from the protection. The carabiner into which the rope is clipped often has a bent gate, so that clipping the rope into this carabiner can be done quickly and easily. Quickdraws are also frequently used in indoor lead climbing. The quickdraw may be pre-attached to the wall. When a climber ascends the wall, (s)he must clip the rope through the quickdraw in order to maintain safety. The safest, easiest and most effective place to clip into a quickdraw is when it is at waist height.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a comfort," [...] he remarked, [...] "to sail under liberal owners. Now, {{my people}} insist on having their ships as well found as possible, and if I condemn spars, sails, ropes, or stays, they are {{replaced}} without a question. And {{it is the}} cheapest policy in the long run. There is nothing so costly as stinginess on board a ship. The giving way of a stay may mean {{the loss of the}} mast and all its gear, and that may mean the loss of a ship. The blowing away of a sail at a critical moment may mean certain disaster; and yet there are many owners who grudge a fathom of new <b>rope</b> or a <b>bolt</b> of canvas, and who will risk the safety of their vessels for the petty economy of a few pounds." ...|$|R
50|$|Sails feature {{reinforcements}} {{of fabric}} layers where lines attach at grommets or cringles. A <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> may be sewn onto {{the edges of}} a sail to reinforce it, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller-furling jib. They may have stiffening features, called battens, that help shape the sail, when full length, or just the roach, when present. They may {{have a variety of}} means of reefing them (reducing sail area), including rows of short lines affixed to the sail to wrap up unused sail, as on square and gaff rigs, or simply grommets through which a line or a hook may pass, as on Bermuda mainsails. Fore-and-aft sails may have tell-tales—pieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails—to help visualize airflow over their surfaces.|$|R
60|$|Bill hurried forward. The {{other hand}} had hauled in the traveller, {{to which the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> of the jib was still attached, and hauling on this had got the block down and in {{readiness}} for fastening on the new jib. The sheets were hooked on, and then while one hand ran the sail out with the out haul to the bowsprit end, the other hoisted with the halliards. By this time the boat {{was close to the}} broken water. As the sail filled her head payed off towards it. The wind lay her right over, and before she could gather way there was a tremendous crash. The Susan had struck on the sands. The next wave lifted her, but as it passed on she came down with a crash that seemed to shake her in pieces. Joe Chambers relaxed his grasp of the now useless tiller.|$|R
6000|$|... "Methinks," [...] said Cnut, [...] "that we {{are about}} to have a storm. A few minutes ago scarce a cloud was to be seen; now that bank over there has risen half-way up the sky. The sailors are {{accustomed}} to these treacherous seas, and the warnings which we have not noticed have no doubt been clear enough to them." [...] With great rapidity the sails of the fleet came down, and in five minutes its whole aspect was changed; but quickly as the sailors had done their work, the storm was even more rapid in its progress. Some of the ships whose crews were slower or less skilful than the others, were caught by the gale before they could get their sails snug, and the great sheets of white canvas were blown from the <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> as if made of paper, and a blackness which could almost be felt, covered the sea, the only light being that given by the frothing waters. There was no longer any thought of order. Each ship had to shift for herself; and each captain to do his best to save those under his charge, without thought of what might befall the others.|$|R
60|$|Everybody was {{in motion}} on this hint, {{and the first}} thing we did was to board fore-tack. The clews of that sail came down as if so many giants had hold of the tack and sheet. We set it, double-reefed, which made it but a rag of a sail, and yet the ship felt it directly. We next tried the fore-topsail, close-reefed, and this stood. It was well we did, for I feel certain the ship was now in the ground-swell. That black hill seemed ready to fall on our heads. We tried the mizen-topsail, but we found it would not do, and we furled it again, not without great difficulty. Things still looked serious, the land drawing nearer and nearer; and we tried to get the mainsail, double-reefed, on the ship. Everybody mustered at the tack and sheet, and we dragged down that bit of cloth {{as if it had been}} muslin. The good ship now quivered like a horse that is over-ridden, but in those liners {{everything}} is strong, and everything stood. I never saw spray thrown from a ship's bows, as it was thrown from the Erie's that night. We had a breathless quarter of an hour after the mainsail was set, everybody looking to see what would go first. Every <b>rope</b> and <b>bolt</b> in the craft was tried to the utmost, but all stood! At the most critical moment, we caught a glimpse of a light in a house that was known to stand near the Start; and the mate came among us, pointed it out, and said, if we weathered that, we should go clear. After hearing this, my eyes were never off that light, and glad was I to see it slowly drawing more astern, and more under our lee. At last we got it on our quarter, and knew that we had gone clear! The gloomy-looking land disappeared to leeward, in a deep, broad bay, giving us plenty of sea-room.|$|R
