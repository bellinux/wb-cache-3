The meat recipes were mostly based <b>on</b> <b>beef</b> and <b>veal,</b> where cooked <b>beef</b> {{was used for}} everyday meals. In the case of pork, suckling pig played a great role. [...] "The use of offal and the entire slaughtered animal - especially the calf - {{from head to toe}} was a special characteristic of the recipes collected in the Bavarian cookbooks. Udders, tripe, calf head, calf hoofs, etc. have changed from 'poor man's dishes' ... to the prestigious 'Schmankerl' of the new Bavarian regional cuisine. ... The prominence of head cheese, prepared both sweet and sour, seems to also be a speciality of Bavarian cuisine." ...|$|R

Actually, the <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> supporting aid-system based on various types of direct farmers’ premia will be turned to a single farm payment. Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> sector decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to national ceiling reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated <b>on</b> the <b>beef</b> and <b>veal</b> sector of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied. A reduction in young cattle price may further compensate the negative impact of decoupling...|$|R

A set of derived reduced form functions are employed in a study of some dynamic behavioural relationships in the cattle and sheep sector.

40|$|An {{application}} of Zellner's [13] two-stage procedure {{is illustrated in}} the estimation of the para-meters {{of a system of}} linear, contemporaneously related demand functions for <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> pork, lamb, and chicken meat in Canada, based on annual data for the period 1950 to 1970. Two studies published in the last ten yearshave estimated demand functions formeat in Canada. Yeh [12] estimated de-mand functions for beef and pork, using annual data for the period 1929 to 1958. More recently, Kulshreshtha and Wilson [3] estimated the demand function for beef only as a part of an econometric model of the Canadian beef sec-tor, using annual data for the period 1949 - 1969. 1 In the present study, the demand functions for <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> pork, lamb, and chicken meat are simultaneously estimated on the basis of an-nual data for the period 1954 to 1970. The per capita consumption of <b>beef,</b> <b>veal,</b> pork, do-mestic lamb, and chicken meat are the de-pendent variables; deflated retail prices (or prices indexes) and per capita deflated personal disposable income are the principal explanatory variables. Zellner's method of estimating "seem-ingly unrelated regression equations " [13] is employed because of the contemporaneous cor-relation among the dependent variables. To examine the extent and degree of substitution among different kinds of meat, a statistical test (the simultaneous equations analogue of the familiar F-test) is used to reduce the demand equations by removing insignificant price and income variables. The implied price and in-come elasticities are calculated. A comparison of actual and predicted values shows that {{a large proportion of the}} variation in the demand of meat in Canada is explained by the model...|$|R
