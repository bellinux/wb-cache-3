According to the selected development method, adapted to the software available CASE (Computed Aided System Engineering) »POSE« & RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) »INGRES«, the Information System (IS) has been designed and implemented. The IS design process is described in detail. The system was subdivided into three subsystems: POM (Project Organization Module), EOM (Expedition Organization Module), and SPMM (Sampling and Parameter Measurements Module). The necessary entities and their relationships were defined using the E-R (Entity-Relationship) diagram concept. The integral E-R diagram {{was transformed into a}} set of 3 NF (Third Normal Form) relation schemes. The SQL (Structured Query Language) command file was generated and started in the INGRES, producing a relational database scheme. The integrity constraints were built into the database by defining 87 SQL procedures and 146 rules for 61 relation schemes. Therefore, the database integrity control could be performed while the data were inserted. The developed application is based on hierarchically organized frames (Menu, Browse and Report), allowing the information flow (»top- down«) between them. The application enables data presentation in space and time under user-defined conditions. The verification of the system was performed using real data from three research projects...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{processes}} and outcomes of four public-private mix (PPM) projects on DOTS implementation for tuberculosis (TB) control in New Delhi, India; Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pune, India. METHODS: Cross-project analysis of secondary data from separate project evaluations was used. Differences among PPM project sites in impact on TB control (change in case detection, treatment outcomes and equity in access) {{were correlated with}} differences in chosen intervention strategies and structural conditions. FINDINGS: The analysis suggests that an effective intervention package should include the following provider-side components: (1) orienting private providers (PPs) and {{the staff of the}} national TB programme (NTP); (2) improving the <b>referral</b> and <b>information</b> <b>system</b> through simple practical tools; (3) the NTP adequately supervising and monitoring PPs; and (4) the NTP providing free anti-TB drugs to patients treated in the private sector. CONCLUSION: Getting such an intervention package to work requires that the NTP be strongly committed to supporting, supervising and evaluating PPM projects. Further, using a local nongovernmental organization or a medical association as an intermediary may facilitate collaboration. Investing time and effort to ensure that sufficient dialogue takes place among all stakeholders is important to help build trust and achieve a high level of agreement...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to present a qualitative ‘situation analysis’ of the healthcare system in Tunisia, as it applies to management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. A primary concern was the institutional capacity to manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Methods Research took place during 2010 (analysis of official documents, semi-structured interviews with key informants, and case studies in four clinics). Walt and Gilson’s framework (1994) for policy analysis was used: content, actors, context, and process. Results Problems of integration and coordination have compounded funding pressures. Despite its importance in Tunisian healthcare, primary health is ill-equipped to manage NCDs. With limited funds, and no <b>referral</b> or health <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> staff morale in the public sector was low. Private healthcare has been the main development filling the void. Conclusion This study highlights major gaps in the implementation of a comprehensive approach to NCDs, which is an urgent task across the region. In strategic planning, research on the health system is vital; but the capacity within Ministries of Health to use research has first to be built, with a commitment to grounding policy change in evidence. </p...|$|R

40|$|China {{is facing}} the {{unprecedented}} challenge of rapidly increasing rural-to-urban migration. Migrants are in a vulnerable state when they attempt to access to primary care services. This {{study was designed to}} explore rural-to-urban migrants' experiences in primary care, comparing their quality of primary care experiences under different types of medical institutions in Guangzhou, China. The study employed a cross-sectional survey of 736 rural-to-urban migrants in Guangzhou, China in 2014. A validated Chinese version of Primary Care Assessment Tool [...] Adult Short Version (PCAT-AS), representing 10 primary care domains was used to collect information on migrants' quality of primary care experiences. These domains include first contact (utilization), first contact (accessibility), ongoing care, coordination (<b>referrals),</b> coordination (<b>information</b> <b>systems),</b> comprehensiveness (services available), comprehensiveness (services provided), family-centeredness, community orientation and culturally competent. These measures were used to assess the quality of primary care performance as reported from patients' perspective. Analysis of covariance was conducted for comparison on PCAT scores among migrants accessing primary care in tertiary hospitals, municipal hospitals, community health centers/community health stations, and township health centers/rural health stations. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore factors associated with PCAT total scores. After adjustments were made, migrants accessing primary care in tertiary hospitals (25. 49) reported the highest PCAT total scores, followed by municipal hospitals (25. 02), community health centers/community health stations (24. 24), and township health centers/rural health stations (24. 18). Tertiary hospital users reported significantly better performance in first contact (utilization), first contact (accessibility), coordination (<b>information</b> <b>system),</b> comprehensiveness (service available), and cultural competence. Community health center/community health station users reported significantly better experience in the community orientation domain. Township health center/rural health station users expressed significantly better experience in the ongoing care domain. There were no statistically significant differences across settings in the ongoing care, comprehensiveness (services provided), and family-centeredness domains. Multiple linear regression models showed that factors positively associated with higher PCAT total scores also included insurance covering parts of healthcare payment (P< 0. 001). This study highlights the need for improvement in primary care provided by primary care institutions for rural-to-urban migrants. Relevant policies related to medical insurance should be implemented for providing affordable healthcare services for migrants accessing primary care...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION India is {{undergoing}} a rapid epidemiologic transition with chronic diseases now constituting {{a leading cause of}} death and suffering. Delivering an appropriate response to this rising burden implies health systems strengthening. We analysed the structure and functioning of the Local Health System (LHS) in the poor urban neighbourhood of KG Halli (Bangalore) in order to identify its principal weaknesses in providing quality care to PWCD. METHODS We applied the health-system analysis framework developed by Van Olmen et al. to the situation of KG Halli using data generated over a period of 2 years through (i) a household census (n = 9299, response rate = 98. 5 %) using a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, illness profile, health seeking behaviour, and healthcare expenditure; (ii) mapping and interviewing healthcare providers (n = 24); and (iii) observational fieldnotes. Document analysis and STATA were used to analyse data. RESULTS The KG Halli LHS faces poor operational and administrative integration across public and private healthcare providers. Most resources including trained personnel, laboratory and pharmacy support lie in a poorly regulated private sector that cares-on a fee-for-service basis – for more than 80 % of PWCD. Lack of gate-keeping at the primary care level leads to hospitals managing almost 60 % of PWCD. These inefficiencies contribute to have one out of four families experiencing catastrophic expenditure (> 10 % of household income) in ambulatory care alone. All the preceding factors, plus poor <b>referral</b> and <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> negatively affect continuity and effectiveness of care, with a high hospitalisation rate of 191. 4 / 1000 per year in PWCD, pointing to delays in receiving adequate care at the primary care level. The geographical delimitation of the population of responsibility of the public facilities in the KG Halli area is inappropriate; among the private providers, the notion of a ‘population of responsibility’ is simply not taken into consideration. Contextual factors like rapid urbanisation and internal migration pose additional challenges. CONCLUSION The KG Halli LHS not only responds poorly to needs of PWCD but also causes them considerable impoverishment. Rising chronic disease burden provides an opportunity to reexamine organisation and performance of health systems. A structured analysis allows identification of the main obstacles to overcome...|$|R

Information and communication technology has a great potential to improve health care in the process of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, medication prescription, <b>referral,</b> <b>information</b> retrieval and communication, documentation and transactions, {{but at the same time}} they influence social systems of which they become a part. Health Information programs are the product of careful planning, prudent management, dedicated healthcare professionals and support staff, and a commitment to appropriate funding. Nevertheless, effective implementation of health information program requires that people not only believe that change is necessary but understand how change will come about and what the consequences will be.
