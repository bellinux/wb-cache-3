40|$|This {{article is}} rooted in the {{observation}} that the 21 st century has witnessed a resurgent interest in and a new visibility of <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs across a range of arts, humanities and social science disciplines, some of which have always focused on <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, others are returning to it, while some have no previous tradition of doing so. The article reports on an analysis of these new spaces of interest in <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs, undertaken through semi-structured interviews with eighteen landmark figures in the study of <b>religion</b> internationally, <b>and</b> an innovative process of group reflection in four countries. Points of connection, disconnection and innovation are explored, and the concept of liminality is deployed to explore how understandings of <b>religion,</b> belief <b>and</b> the secular are in a process of being re-imagined within academic disciplines. By considering new thresholds and debates as they are emerging, the article concludes that there are opportunities to research and conceive of the role of <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs as an interdisciplinary exercise, which are yet to be addressed and which reflect the need to re-imagine how <b>religions</b> <b>and</b> beliefs are broadly conceived and how different disciplines engage with each other...|$|R
