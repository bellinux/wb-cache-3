5000|$|Located in the Aeronautical <b>Radionavigation</b> Services band, a {{frequency}} band {{that is available}} worldwide.|$|E
50|$|CDMA {{networks}} such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS {{tend to use}} handset-based radiolocation technologies, {{which are}} technically more similar to <b>radionavigation.</b> GPS {{is one of those}} technologies.|$|E
50|$|Controllers can assign routing {{relative}} to location fixes derived from latitude and longitude, or from <b>radionavigation</b> beacons such as VORs. See also Airway; VORs, Airways and the Enroute Structure.|$|E
5000|$|Radio {{navigation}} or <b>radionavigation</b> is {{the application}} of radio frequencies to determine a position of an object on the Earth. [...] Like radiolocation, it {{is a type of}} radiodetermination.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Radionavigation</b> service (short: RNS) is - {{according}} to Article 1.42 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as «A radiodetermination {{service for the}} purpose of radionavigation.» ...|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, some ships communicated by underwater bells, the system being competitive with the primitive Maritime <b>radionavigation</b> service of the time. The later Fessenden oscillator allowed communication with submarines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radionavigation</b> aids {{located on}} the ground, such as VORs, are also checked and updated to keep them aligned with {{magnetic}} north to allow pilots to use their magnetic compasses for accurate and reliable in-plane navigation.|$|E

50|$|A {{civilian}} {{safety of}} life signal (broadcast in a frequency band {{protected by the}} ITU for aeronautical <b>radionavigation</b> service), first broadcast for demonstration purposes on satellite USA-203 (a Block IIR-M series satellite), and available on all GPS IIF satellites (and beyond). The intent of the L5 band {{is to provide a}} means of <b>radionavigation</b> secure and robust enough for life critical applications, such as aircraft precision approach guidance. The L5 band provides additional robustness in the form of interference mitigation, the band being internationally protected, redundancy with existing bands, geostationary satellite augmentation, and ground based augmentation. The added robustness of this band also benefits terrestrial applications.|$|E
50|$|According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) {{a marker}} beacon {{is defined as}} A {{transmitter}} in the aeronautical <b>radionavigation</b> service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In this municipality, the German {{army was}} allowed to install during the Second World War three <b>radionavigation</b> antennas, 112 metres high {{with the aim of}} facilitating the {{positioning}} and follow-up of submarines (U-Boots) and aeroplanes in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2014, Beidou {{became part}} of the World-Wide <b>Radionavigation</b> System (WWRNS) at the 94th meeting of The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee, which {{approved}} the [...] "Navigation Safety Circular" [...] of the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).|$|E
5000|$|Radionavigation-satellite service (short: RNSS) is - {{according}} to Article 1.43 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) - defined as [...] "A radiodetermination-satellite service {{used for the}} purpose of <b>radionavigation.</b> This service may also include feeder links necessary for its operation".|$|E
50|$|Other ITU {{allocations}} {{have been}} made within the Ku band to the fixed service (microwave towers), radio astronomy service, space research service, mobile service, mobile satellite service, radiolocation service (radar), amateur radio service, and <b>radionavigation.</b> However, {{not all of these}} services are actually operating in this band and others are only minor users.|$|E
50|$|The {{envelope}} {{of the individual}} pulses {{could be used to}} establish a receiver's internal timing within the 10-second pattern. However, it was the phase of the received signals within each pulse that was used to determine the transit time from transmitter to receiver. Using hyperbolic geometry and <b>radionavigation</b> principles, a position fix with an accuracy on the order of 5 - 10 km was realizable over the entire globe at any time of the day. Omega employed hyperbolic <b>radionavigation</b> techniques and the chain operated in the VLF portion of the spectrum between 10 and 14 kHz. Near the end of its service life of 26 years, Omega evolved into a system used primarily by the civil community. By receiving signals from three stations, an Omega receiver could locate a position to within 4 nmi km using the principle of phase comparison of signals.|$|E
50|$|An {{en-route}} (also {{known as}} en route or enroute) chart provides detailed information useful for instrument flight, including information on <b>radionavigation</b> aids (navaids) such as VORs and NDBs, navigational fixes (waypoints and intersections), standard airways, airport locations, minimum altitudes, and so on. Information not directly relevant to instrument navigation, such as visual landmarks and terrain features, is not included.|$|E
50|$|Link 16 is a TDMA-based secure, jam-resistant, {{high-speed}} {{digital data}} link which operates {{in the radio}} frequency band 960-1,215 MHz, allocated {{in line with the}} ITU Radio Regulations to the aeronautical <b>radionavigation</b> service and to the <b>radionavigation</b> satellite service. This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of-sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and adhoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). It uses the transmission characteristics and protocols, conventions, and fixed-length or variable length message formats defined by MIL-STD 6016, STANAG 5516 (formerly the JTIDS technical interface design plan). Information is typically passed at one of three data rates: 31.6, 57.6, or 115.2 kilobits per second, although the radios and waveform FHSS itself can support throughput values well over 1 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The United States Federal <b>Radionavigation</b> Plan and the IALA Recommendation on the Performance and Monitoring of DGNSS Services in the Band 283.5-325 kHz {{cite the}} United States Department of Transportation's 1993 {{estimated}} error growth of 0.67 m per 100 km from the broadcast site but measurements of accuracy across the Atlantic, in Portugal, suggest a degradation of just 0.22 m per 100 km.|$|E
50|$|One major {{mission of}} the service, {{maintaining}} Ocean Stations, {{came to an end}} as improvements in oceanic aviation (turbojet airliners and improved <b>radionavigation)</b> obviated the need. However, the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976 brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.|$|E
50|$|The Inside GNSS {{editorial}} content has been heavily weighted towards {{issues of the}} four major GNSS operators: the United States (GPS), Russia (GLONASS), China (BeiDou) and the European Union (Galileo). Regional and augmentation systems such as those developed by the United States (WAAS, SBAS), Japan (QZSS) and Europe (EGNOS) as well as eLoran, the terrestrial <b>radionavigation</b> system, are also covered.|$|E
50|$|For example, in the United States, signal leakage from cable {{television}} systems is {{regulated by the}} FCC, since cable signals use the same frequencies as aeronautical and <b>radionavigation</b> bands. CATV operators may also choose to monitor their networks for leakage to prevent ingress. Outside signals entering the cable can cause unwanted noise and picture ghosting. Excessive noise can overwhelm the signal, making it useless.|$|E
50|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS), {{originally}} Navstar GPS, is a space-based <b>radionavigation</b> system {{owned by}} the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force. It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere {{on or near the}} Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of 121.5 MHz beacons, the {{frequency}} is known in aviation as the [...] "VHF Guard" [...] emergency frequency, and all U.S. civilian pilots (private and commercial) are required, by FAA policy, to monitor this frequency when {{it is possible to}} do so. The frequency can be used by Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) <b>radionavigation</b> equipment, which is being phased out in favor of VOR and GPS but is still found on many aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s and 60's, {{the use of}} astrodomes in {{aircraft}} was gradually phased out as <b>radionavigation</b> and ground plotting radars took over. Astrodomes did, however, enjoy a second career on ocean racing yachts (especially in singlehanded racing).Eric Tabarly, record-breaking winner of the 1964 OSTAR single-handed transatlantic race, and former French Aéronavale (Fleet air arm) pilot, had fitted his revolutionary lightweight ketch-rigged racer Pen Duick II with an astrodome scavenged from a Shorts Sunderland decommissioned aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Radiolocating is {{the process}} of finding the {{location}} of something through the use of radio waves. It generally refers to passive uses, particularly radar - as well as detecting buried cables, water mains, and other public utilities. It is similar to <b>radionavigation,</b> but radiolocation usually refers to passively finding a distant object rather than actively one's own position. Both are types of radiodetermination. Radiolocation is also used in real-time locating systems (RTLS) for tracking valuable assets.|$|E
