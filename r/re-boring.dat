50|$|The L7 105 mm {{tank gun}} was {{developed}} from the 20 pounder. In 1954, the original version of the 105 mm was made by <b>re-boring</b> the tube of a 20 pounder barrel.|$|E
50|$|From {{a monthly}} output of three engines in December 1942, the Breakfast Creek plant {{increased}} to {{a peak of}} 116 engines per month in April 1943. Subsidiary contractors such as the Toowoomba Foundry {{were involved in the}} <b>re-boring</b> of engine block components.|$|E
5000|$|The {{objective}} {{behind the}} design of the [...]458 Lott was to provide a greater case capacity over the [...]458 Winchester Magnum so as to provide better performance and less compression of the powder charge. The [...]458 Lott achieved both these objectives by its lengthened cartridge. Furthermore, as the Lott cartridge is in essence a lengthened [...]458 Winchester Magnum, converting a [...]458 Winchester Magnum to [...]458 Lott involves in many cases a simple <b>re-boring</b> of the chamber and if required, a lengthening of the magazine.|$|E
5000|$|The s [...] and [...] {{originally}} mounted 13 guns {{as built}} in 1915 and 1914. These ships were rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 {{by removing the}} Q triple turret amidships and replacing guns in triple A turret, twin B and X turrets, and triple Y turret. Conte di Cavour carried Vickers Mk G guns while Giulio Cesare carried Pattern T guns built by Elswick Ordnance Company. Odero Terni Orlando (OTO) <b>re-bored</b> the Vickers guns while the Elswick guns were <b>re-bored</b> by Gio. Ansaldo & C.. Maximum gun elevation was increased to 27°.|$|R
5000|$|In 1855, the Mississippi rifle {{was changed}} to [...]58 caliber, {{so that it could}} use the [...]58 caliber Minie Ball that had {{recently}} become standard. Many older Mississippi rifles were <b>re-bored</b> to [...]58 caliber. The rifle was also modified to accept a sword type bayonet.|$|R
50|$|Wilf Green {{subsequently}} {{created the}} ETZ300 (as {{distinct from the}} later, factory produced ETZ301), which was essentially a standard ETZ250 with a <b>re-bored</b> (and slightly restyled) engine, cockpit fairing and revised decals. Shortly after releasing this bike, however, Wilf Green lost the MZ import franchise meaning an end to importer-modified special editions in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Once glazing or carbon {{build up}} has occurred, {{it can only}} be cured by {{stripping}} down the engine and <b>re-boring</b> the cylinder bores, machining new honing marks and stripping, cleaning and de-coking combustion chambers, fuel injector nozzles and valves. If the problem is detected in its early stages, running an engine at maximum load to raise the internal pressures and temperatures allows the piston rings to scrape glaze off the bores and allows carbon build-up to be burnt off. However, if glazing has been allowed to progress to the stage where the piston rings have seized into their grooves, this will not have any effect.|$|E
5000|$|Work on 25kV OHLE {{electrification}} of {{the line}} began in May 2015 and has included numerous bridgeworks plus the major undertaking of the <b>re-boring</b> of Farnworth Tunnel. [...] Its high profile resulted in a visit from Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, shortly after work started, and from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin in August 2015 during the reboring of the Farnworth tunnel. Breakthrough was achieved in late, rather than early October, due to loose sand delaying the work in August; the first trains running through the new twin track bore on Monday December 14, 2015. Electrification is now due for completion, before the Preston-Blackpool North line is electrified, by December 2017.|$|E
50|$|A single {{month of}} 1942 {{production}} used a 306 cu. in. (5.0 L) {{version of the}} engine. This was resurrected after the war in 1946 (with 7.2:1 compression and 2-barrel {twin choke} carburetor, rated at 130 hp {97 kW}) {{for a short time}} before reverting to 292 cu. in. for the rest of 1946 through 1948. The reason for the reversion to the smaller size was that the cylinder walls on the bored-out engine were found to be too thin. Many disappeared altogether in the block casting process at the factory causing many blocks to be scrapped before installation. Cylinder wear in the field was extreme, and <b>re-boring</b> during engine overhaul was impossible.|$|E
5000|$|To {{conserve}} {{lead on the}} frontier, smaller calibers {{were often}} preferred, ranging often from about [...]32 to [...]45 cal. As a rifle became worn from use, with accumulated corrosion from firing black powder causing the bore to enlarge, {{it was not uncommon}} to see many rifles <b>re-bored</b> and re-rifled to larger calibers, to keep the rifle shooting accurately. Many copies of historical Kentucky Rifles are seen with a bore of around [...]50 caliber.|$|R
50|$|A {{renovation}} of the tunnel {{was carried out in}} 1919-1920, after a freight train tore out {{a large portion of the}} tunnel in November 1917. After the old wooden timbers and concrete footings were removed and dumped into nearby ravines, the tunnel was <b>re-bored</b> and reinforced with concrete, which was poured into holes dug in the roof of the tunnel by an oil derrick. During the renovation, a worker died when a section of the tunnel collapsed, crushing him.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 October 2013: J549 {{undertakes}} {{its first}} test runs {{after completion of}} a 9-year overhaul. During the overhaul the loco received new tyres on the pony truck and coupled wheels, a new smokebox barrel, cylinders <b>re-bored,</b> motion gear re-metaled and the tender bogie wheels re-profiled. The test run included a light engine trial around Maldon yard, followed by a line test to Muckleford and return with Y133. The following week it undertook load tests to Muckleford and Castlemaine.|$|R
50|$|The two cannons {{that were}} first {{placed at the}} site were RML 9 inch 12 ton guns. Rifled Muzzle Loaders (RMLs) are {{artillery}} pieces loaded from the muzzle, but with a rifled bore liner, invented in the mid-19th century. In contrast to smooth bore cannon which preceded it, the rifling of the gun barrel allowed much greater accuracy and penetration as the spin induced to the shell gave it directional stability. Initially smooth-bore cannon were converted into rifles by <b>re-boring</b> and lining; but later new guns were manufactured from scratch as RMLs. The RML 9 inch 12 ton gun could discharge shells weighing 249 pounds (113 kg) as far as South Head (Watsons Bay); approximately 3,000 yards (2,770 metres).|$|E
5000|$|Since {{there are}} several rifle actions {{manufactured}} {{that are capable of}} handling the full length magnum cartridges such as the [...]375 H&H Magnum, {{it is not surprising that}} the [...]458 Lott has been chambered in several rifles. The [...]458 Lott cartridge’s maximum overall length is only [...]3 in longer than the standard length magnum cartridge like the 7mm Remington Magnum and the [...]300 Winchester Magnum. For this reason several rifles which were formerly chambered for cartridge like the [...]375 H&H Magnum and the [...]458 Winchester Magnum were easily converted to the [...]458 Lott early on when [...]458 Lott rifles were only available as a custom offering. These conversions required no more than a <b>re-boring</b> or a re-barreling and perhaps a magazine extension if required.|$|E
5000|$|At a high-level, the {{multimachine}} {{is built}} using vehicle engine blocks combined in a LEGO-like fashion. It utilizes the cylinder bores and engine deck to provide accurate surfaces. Since cylinder bores are bored exactly parallel {{to each other}} and at exact right angles to the cylinder head surface, multimachine accuracy begins at the factory where the engine block was built. In the most common version of the multimachine, one that has a roller bearing spindle, this precision is maintained during construction with simple cylinder <b>re-boring</b> of the #3 cylinder {{to the size of the}} roller bearing outside diameter (OD) and <b>re-boring</b> the #1 cylinder to fit the overarm OD. These cylinder-boring operations can be done in almost any engine shop and at low cost. An engine machine shop provides the most inexpensive and accurate machine work commonly done anywhere and guarantees that the spindle and overarm will be perfectly aligned and at an exact right angle to the face (head surface) of the main engine block that serves as the base of the machine. Use a piece of pipe made to fit the inner diameter of the bearings as the spindle. A three-bearing spindle is used because the [...] "main" [...] spindle bearings just [...] "float" [...] in the cylinder bore so that the third bearing is needed to [...] "locate" [...] the spindle, act as a thrust bearing, and support the heavy pulley. The multimachine uses a unique way of clamping the engine blocks together that is easily built, easily adjusted, and very accurate. The multimachine makes use of a concrete and steel construction technique that was heavily used in industry during the First World War and resurrected for this project.|$|E
50|$|Further {{extensive}} work {{started in}} April 1937. The six-single mount 8 inch guns were replace by three dual mount and <b>re-bored</b> 8 inch guns installed in improved mountings (allowing 55° elevation) with two turrets forward, and one aft, fire control changed, light anti aircraft weapons augmented and eight new 24 inch Type 93 torpedo tubes were installed. Facilities were upgraded for two E7K2 floatplanes. New oil-fired boilers were installed {{and there was}} a general overhaul of machinery. In the light of the added top weight, an attempt was made to maintain stability by increasing the ship's beam - not entirely successfully.|$|R
50|$|In late 1961 Bull visited Murphy and Trudeau at Aberdeen and {{was able}} to {{interest}} them in the idea using guns to loft missile components for re-entry research, a task that was otherwise very expensive and time-consuming aboard rockets. They arranged funding for the work under Project HARP (for High Altitude Research Program, {{not to be confused with}} HAARP). The US Navy supplied a surplus 16-inch battleship gun, and a contract from the Office of Naval Research paid for the gun to be <b>re-bored</b> into a 16.4-inch smooth bore. The entire contract, excluding shipping, was only $2,000.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 an {{employee}} demonstrated the K R Wilson Combination Machine. Within three hours he relined the crankshaft bearings, bored them to accurate size and <b>re-bored</b> four cylinders {{to a standard}} Ford size. The work would previously have taken 18 to 20 hours. A special assembly bench by Manley Motor Support assisted with quick and accurate re-assembly. The machinery was claimed to bring factory exactness to the local garage and ensure a full 12,000 miles of running without further attention. Other machinery for the same purpose included the Wright Multi-valve Grinder which grinds 4 valves at once, the Ames Cylinder Gauge, the Wilson Crankcase Aligning Jig and Weaver Axle Stand.|$|R
40|$|There {{the study}} object is the {{blasting}} of benches of open casts. The {{purpose is to}} develop the effective and safe blasting process of bench of open casts by the method of vertical hole charges. The model of bench caving and of rock flying to pieces has been presented. The methods of computation and of optimization of main variables of blasting and of flying of rock to pieces have been developed. The possibility of computation and of optimization of tamping, of charge, of hole networks, of <b>re-boring</b> and of blasting regimes; the possibility of computation of dangerous zones according to the rock flying to pieces and of misfire decrease have been substantiated. The blasting process of bench {{on the basis of}} optimum variables of hole blasting is used at the open casts in Yakutia and in South Ural.

50|$|Nikasil {{is short}} for Nickel Silicon Carbide. Silicon carbide is a very hard ceramic (much harder than steel) that can be {{dissolved}} in nickel. The nickel solution can then be electroplated onto the aluminium cylinder bore. The piston rings will then rub off the exposed nickel, leaving a very hard layer of silicon carbide to protect the aluminium piston from {{direct contact with the}} aluminium cylinder. With this setup, the engine tolerances can be much tighter for better performance. The cylinder must be re-plated after it is <b>re-bored,</b> but Nikasil is extremely durable, so the cylinder {{does not need to be}} reworked as often as an iron or chrome cylinder.|$|R
500|$|While on {{the return}} voyage to Gotenhafen on 15 October, Prinz Eugen {{inadvertently}} rammed the light cruiser [...] amidships north of Hela. The cause of the collision was heavy fog. The light cruiser was nearly cut in half, and the two ships remained wedged together for fourteen hours. Prinz Eugen was taken to Gotenhafen, where repairs were effected with a month. Sea trials commenced on 14 November. On 20–21 November, the ship supported German troops on the Sworbe Peninsula by firing around 500 rounds of main battery ammunition. Four torpedo boats—T13, T16, T19, and T21—joined the operation. Prinz Eugen then returned to Gotenhafen to resupply and have her worn-out gun barrels <b>re-bored.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only Mark II {{guns were}} {{installed}} in type E twin turrets. Maximum elevation was 70° {{in the five}} turrets installed aboard Atago, Takao, and Chōkai in 1932. Early recognition of the impracticality of using these guns for anti-aircraft fire caused reduction of maximum elevation to 55° in all subsequent installations. Maya received five 55° turrets as original equipment in 1932. Three new turrets with Mark I guns from Myōkō class cruisers <b>re-bored</b> to Mark II replaced the original type A mounts aboard Furutaka class cruisers in 1936 and 1937. Tone class cruisers were completed with four type E turrets in 1937 and 1938. Five new turrets replaced the original triple 6-inch turrets aboard Mogami class cruisers between 1939 and 1941.|$|R
50|$|Brooke {{designed}} {{a series of}} smoothbores that were produced in small numbers by the Selma and Tredegar foundries. Selma <b>re-bored</b> five flawed 6.4-inch blanks as 8-inch double-banded guns, one of which survives in Selma, Alabama. Brooke's 1863 report to Secretary Mallory shows a plate of an unbanded 8-inch smoothbore, but nothing further is known of it. Similar attempts to bore out flawed 7-inch gun blocks to 9 in smoothbores were unsuccessful. Seven 10 in double-banded guns were cast by Selma and four by Tredegar in 1864. Two survive, {{one of which is}} a trophy from CSS Columbia in the Washington Navy Yard. Selma cast twelve 11-inch double-banded smoothbores in 1864, although only eight were shipped. One survives in Columbus, Georgia. In 1863 and 1864 two 11-inch triple-banded guns were cast by Tredegar, but none are known to survive.|$|R
50|$|The all-metal, {{duralumin}} metal-covered monoplane {{aircraft was}} conventional in layout, with braced, high gull wing and fixed undercarriage with a rear skid. The two-spar wing of trapezoid shape, thinner by the fuselage, {{was covered with}} a rimmed Wibault type duralumin sheet (upper surfaces were smooth) and supported by two struts on either side. The fuselage was framed in a front section and semi-monocoque in mid- and tail sections, oval in cross-section. In keeping with the period, the pilot's cockpit was open with a windshield. The armament was two 7.92 mm machine guns mounted on the fuselage sides (initially 7.7 mm Vickers E, then <b>re-bored</b> to 7.92 mm). The aircraft was powered by the Bristol Jupiter VII F radial engine (normal power: 480 hp (360 kW), maximum: 520 hp (390 kW) and fitted with a Townend ring and two-blade propeller. A main 290 l fuel tank in the fuselage, behind the engine, could be dropped in case of fire emergency. The second fuel tank was 7 l.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to a request in November 1942, the P.108A Artigliere [...] "gunship" [...] was developed for anti-shipping duties to supplement torpedo bombers. It was armed with a modified high velocity Cannone da 90/53 gun mounted in a redesigned nose. This was considered the most effective artillery piece in service, and in several versions {{was used as an}} anti-aircraft and anti-tank gun by the Army and the Navy. To be more effective in its new role, the size of the gun was increased from 90 mm (3.5 in) to 102 mm (4 in), a non-standard Italian artillery calibre, and fired shells weighing 13 kg (29 lb) as opposed to the standard gun's 10 kg (22 lb), with a muzzle velocity of over 600 m/s (1,970 ft/s).The gun together with its recoil system weighed 1,500 kg (3,300 lb). Due to it being a <b>re-bored</b> smaller gun, its weight was relatively low for its calibre.|$|R
5|$|Caltech {{is home to}} the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming Cannon. The {{origins and}} exact age of the Fleming Cannon are not known with certainty. It is {{believed}} to have been cast during the Franco-Prussian War era, but completed in 1878 after the war was over. It was then given by the French to the United States where it was <b>re-bored</b> to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition. The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, fragility, and irreplaceable nature.|$|R
500|$|Not until 17 January 1940 did Richard Casey obtain Cabinet's {{approval}} to spend £400,000 {{to construct a}} plant to manufacture 25pounder field guns and 2pounder anti-tank guns. Until the 25 pounder could become available in quantity, units in Australia and the Far East were equipped with the old 18pounder. Some units in the Middle East operated the 18/25 pounder, an 18pounder that had been <b>re-bored</b> to take 25pounder ammunition, until they received British 25pounders. The old 4.5inch howitzer also saw service, with the 2/10th Field Regiment employing them {{in support of the}} 9th Division during the Siege of Tobruk. A collection of captured Italian guns, known as the [...] "Bush Artillery", were also employed. These were rendered obsolete when the 25pounder became available in quantity. Eventually, 1,527 were manufactured in Australia. A special light weight version known as the Short 25pounder was developed for jungle warfare. The requirement for a portable field piece in mountainous jungle led {{to the use of the}} 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer in the New Guinea campaign. The American 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 was also employed. Experience in the Western Desert campaign soon showed that the 2pounder could not deal with German tanks, and it was superseded by the 6pounder, which began coming off the assembly lines in Australia in July 1942. In turn it was replaced in 1944 by the 17pounder, which was manufactured at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory. The anti-aircraft artillery were equipped with the Swedish-designed Bofors 40 mm gun, which was manufactured in Australia, and the British 3.7inch Anti-Aircraft gun. Medium artillery included the American 155 mm Long Tom and the British 5.5inch gun.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{forthcoming}} electrification scheme, the original tunnel has been enlarged to allow sufficient clearance for the overhead wires and for both lines to be routed through it once again. During this period, the 1880 bore was initially retained to permit a limited diesel service over the route to continue during the upgrade work, and after was then abandoned as clearances within are too restricted to allow safe operation with overhead wires. This has also required realignment of the lines approaching it and consequent alterations to the platforms that they serve. Work began in May 2015, when the 1838 bore was closed, filled in with cement and <b>re-bored</b> to a larger diameter using the largest tunnel boring machine ever built in Britain. During tunnelling, the workers ran into loose/soft sand, which caused the project to be delayed from October to December and also led to the temporary closure of some lanes on the A666 road above for safety reasons. The TBM finally bored through on 25 October 2015, 21 days after the scheduled completion date. The newly widened tunnel reopened on 14 December 2015, after a scheduled engineering possession on the preceding weekend to connect and test the track & signalling equipment. The first train through was the 05:30 on 15 December from Horwich Parkway station, and the first passenger to use it was former councillor Andrew Morley. At the end of January 2016, the tunnel was closed as the temporary tracks were taken out and replaced with the permanent tracks that are essential for the 100 mph speed limit. The tunnel will be closed later on when putting up the electric wires and pylons for the electric trains in December 2017.|$|R
