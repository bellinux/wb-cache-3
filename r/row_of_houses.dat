5|$|Basingstoke was {{fortunate}} during the Second World War to suffer very little bomb damage. A stick of German bombs did {{fall in the}} Church Square area on 16 August 1940. The same day bombs destroyed part of a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> in Burgess Road. Six {{people were killed in}} the raid. After the war, the town had a population of 25,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} one of the first in London to be lit by gas after Frederick Albert Winsor set up {{experimental}} lighting on 4 June 1807 to celebrate King George III's birthday. Permanent lighting was installed in 1820. The eastern end of Pall Mall was widened between 1814 and 1818; a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on its north side was demolished to make way for the Royal Opera Arcade.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1962, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> and the Prime Minister's chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, College Green, was laid out beside the tower, {{on top of an}} underground parking lot. The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and filled with water between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality led to its being drained and lined with gravel.|$|E

5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{was always}} noted for his {{dedication}} to football and, in his playing days, would do his own training {{during the summer}} months. The Liverpool website records that, {{during the summer of}} 1933 when he returned to Glenbuck after completing his first season as a professional, he decided to develop his throw-in skills. He was an early exponent of the long throw-in and, according to the site, he practiced by throwing balls over a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> and the small boys of the village helped by fetching them back for him.|$|E
5|$|Some {{location}} shooting {{took place}} in New York City. The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior for NYPD headquarters, and an apartment house at 15 West 81st Street, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, {{was used as the}} exterior for the home of Gwen Stacy and her family. A <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on Fuller Place in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Windsor Terrace stood in for the Forest Hills, Queens neighborhood of Ben and May Parker.

5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it spread to the east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|On the {{hillside}} of the Colhugh Valley {{there are a}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> situated at Hillhead in Llantwit Major. The houses {{were built in the}} early years of the 19th century for the poor of the parish. With the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a workhouse was opened in Bridgend. The houses became surplus to requirements and were then sold as private residences. Llantwit Major came under the Bridgend and Cowbridge Poor Law Union. Each unit was originally divided into two separate upper and lower accommodation, the upstairs entrance was from the west and the entrance to the lower accommodation came from the east.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which bears an {{electronic}} scoreboard on its roof and can seat {{a maximum of}} 1,800 fans. Originally a home section, the Oak Road End {{was turned into a}} stand for away fans only {{at the start of the}} 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road's home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to go through an entrance built into the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> and up stairs to the stand.|$|E

50|$|At Tell el-Dab'a were {{excavated}} {{remains of}} a settlement, dating to the early Middle Kingdom (about 2000 BC). The ancient name of the town is not known. An area of about 100 to 100 meters were uncovered, therefore, only parts of the settlements are known. The settlements consisted of at least ten <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> divided by straight streets. There {{is evidence that the}} town was surrounded by a wall. Remains were found in the North. Here there was also a bigger building. The East side of the settlements had an open space. The <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on the east side (west of the open space) consisted of blocks with 12 houses. The single houses were small, just about 5 by 5 meters large and all built on the same plan. The <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on the west side consisted of blocks of at least 20 houses, but perhaps even more. The settlement was inhabited only for about 20 years.|$|R
60|$|As {{they passed}} the <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> they saw through the open doors that men were {{sweeping}} and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in groups, gossiping and laughing.|$|R
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

50|$|Lylestone is a hamlet in North Ayrshire, Parish of Kilwinning, Scotland. The {{habitation}} {{is situated}} between Kilwinning and Auchentiber on the B778. It was originally {{built as a}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> for quarry workers.|$|R
25|$|The square is {{rectangular}} in shape, with {{measurements of}} 142 metres by 129 metres and with two streets radiating {{out of every}} corner. In the middle there was a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> with its southern wall made by the Town Hall. However, when in 1825 the tower of the Town Hall burned, all adjacent houses were demolished and a new hall, with a 65-metre tower, was built in 1835 by architects J. Markl and F. Trescher.|$|E
25|$|Wiltshire Police's {{headquarters}} {{used to be}} on Bath Road in Devizes, {{formerly the}} Wiltshire Militia Stores; it was acquired in 1879 by Wiltshire Police as their headquarters. Nearby was a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> where senior officers lived. The building has since been demolished. Wiltshire Police remained at this site for 85 years until the early 1960s when the organization required a larger headquarters and the new building was commissioned on the London Road site, which was officially opened in 1964. An extension was added in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The Town Hall, {{designed}} to provide a central feature to a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> is typical of the work of the Bastard brothers, from which they were to make their fortune. They became entrepreneurs and local politicians. Other works by the Bastards in the town include the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, built between 1733 and 1739; the market place around the town hall, designed in the classical style but not uniform; the Greyhound Inn (1734–35; now a bank), which was their own property; a terrace of almshouses; and many large private houses with classical facades, notably Spetisbury and Coupar House.|$|E

25|$|The descendents of Pedro Linares, {{many of whom}} live in Mexico City {{near the}} Sonora Market, carry on the {{tradition}} of making alebrijes and other figures from cardboard and papier-mâché.

Various branches of the family occupy a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> on the same street.

On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park.

25|$|Peterhouse has {{its main}} site {{situated}} on Trumpington Street, {{to the south}} of Cambridge's town centre. The main portion of the college is just {{to the north of the}} Fitzwilliam Museum, and its grounds run behind the museum. The buildings date from a wide variety of times, and have been much altered over the years. The college is reputed to have been at least partially destroyed by fire in 1420. The entrance of the college has shifted through its lifetime as well, with the change being principally the result of the demolition of the <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> that originally lined Trumpington Street on the east side of the college. In 1574, a map shows the entrance being on the south side of a single main court. The modern entrance is to the east, straight onto Trumpington Street.|$|E
