50|$|Self-belay {{is the use}} of {{belaying}} equipment by {{a single}} person while rock climbing or mountaineering. Typically, belaying involves a two person team: a climber ascends, while a belayer takes in their <b>rope</b> <b>slack,</b> ready to catch and arrest their fall; when self-belaying, the climber plays both roles.|$|E

5000|$|Whippers {{can be very}} {{dramatic}} falls, often for quite a distance.

60|$|Without {{debating the}} question, Malcolm put {{his foot on}} Ronald's hand, {{and in a moment}} was seated in the opening of the window. Grasping the rope he let himself quietly out, and lowered himself to the ground, {{reaching}} it so noiselessly that Ronald, who was listening, did nor hear a sound. After waiting a minute, however, he sprang up on to the sill, and feeling that the <b>rope</b> was <b>slack,</b> was soon by Malcolm's side below. Then both removed their shoes and hung them round their necks, and walking noiselessly across the court they took up their post under the window indicated in the note. In less than a minute the end of a rope was dropped upon their heads.|$|R
5000|$|Accidents at Cirque du Soleil {{shows are}} rare. However, Guyard-Guillot's fall {{was the second}} {{accident}} to halt a performance {{in less than a}} week.

5000|$|Top rope {{climbing}} (or top roping) is a {{style in}} climbing {{in which the}} climber is securely attached to a rope which then passes up, through an anchor system {{at the top of}} the climb, and down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. The belayer takes in <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber were to lose their hold, they would not fall more than a short distance.|$|R
25|$|It was {{the second}} time {{in less than a week}} that a Cirque show on the Strip was halted for an {{accident}} involving one of its artists; a performer in one of the final preview performances of Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay suffered a mild concussion after slipping through the <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> in the show’s “Stranger in Moscow” scene, missing the protective pad below the act and landing hard upon the stage. The performer was expected to return to the show.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} major crevasses were crossed {{and the first}} rope pair had {{successfully}} negotiated the third crevasse when the accident occurred.

40|$|Methods and {{algorithms}} {{of control}} of the tension of lifting and towing ropes of bucket-chain excavators are proposed in the article. They {{are based on the}} non-linear dependence of the current path length and intensity of excavation efforts. Three automatic control modes, including scooping, correction signals and automatic overload protection, are implemented. Two independent control loops in charge of tension of lifting and towing ropes are developed. The proposed automated control system may be integrated both into new bucket-chain excavators and into those excavators that are already in operation. The new system does not require any substantial alterations in electric drive control systems in charge of lifting and towing, if integrated into excavators in operation. The author has performed the non-linearity analysis; he has also designed, developed and implemented the models that are capable of taking an adequate account of the system peculiarities identified {{in the course of the}} project implementation. The system parameters are adjustable to specific conditions of the excavator operation, including the hardness of the rock extracted by the excavator, etc. The automatic overload control system attached to the electric drives in control of lifting and towing ensures maximal responsiveness of the system based on the commutation-related limitations imposed by power-driven elements, maximal over-control values and variability of the transition process. Prevention of any <b>rope</b> <b>slacks</b> in the course of scooping of any hard rock is assured by the loop of regulation of minimal tension of lifting cables. The service life of lifting and towing ropes goes up by eight to ten weeks, if the system proposed by the author is implemented. Разработаны методы и алгоритмы регулирования натяжением подъемных и тяговых канатов экскаватора-драглайна, основанные на нелинейных зависимостях от текущей длины пути копания и величины усилий в этих канатах.

This dissertation examined the processes generated by eighth-grade students to interpret and represent the functions embedded in dynamic physical models and the instructional decisions that facilitated the processes. Using the teaching experiment method, students were paired to interactively explore a <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> board. The <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> board consisted of a string that had been attached to a corkboard and that could be pulled taut to generate two segments of varying length. Students also explored the spool elevating system where an object was attached to a spool by string. The object could be raised or lowered by turning a handle attached to the spool. In each case, students identified variables, selected symbols to represent variables, and generated tables, equations, and graphs of observed functions. Students' equations were often treated as records of the action or relationship of the functions embedded in the dynamic physical models. Some students were reluctant to algebraically manipulate their equations because the record of the action or relationship was lost. Students' graphs, created using an Etch-a-Sketch, were generated via direct translation of the action of a dynamic physical model to the knobs of the Etch-a-Sketch. Several students developed a rate to accomplish the translation. In verbally presented real-world scenarios which differed in context from that of dynamic physical models but which had underlying structures similar to those of functions embedded in dynamic physical models, it was found that students focused on the underlying structure. The learning environment created by interactive use of the dynamic physical models supported development of instruction through which students' thinking could be challenged and through which students could connect their knowledge of functions generated in one representation to another. Use of the dynamic physical models enabled students to interpret functions as repeated actions with several students constructing generalized interpretation of the process. Instruction incorporating the use of dynamic physical models is indicated and recommended...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{responses}} of parallel hoisting system with time-varying length and rigid guidance under drive deviation are investigated considering tension and torsion {{characteristics of the}} ropes. The variable-domain three-node elements of rope are employed and the corresponding differential algebraic equations (DAEs) are derived using Lagrange’s equations of the first kind. The slack situation of the rope is considered, and the dynamic equations which are systems of DAEs are transformed to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The dynamic {{responses of}} tension, torsion, and acceleration are analyzed considering radius’ error of the drums, which indicates that the drive deviation between ropes can cause large influence on the tension difference and even cause one of the <b>ropes</b> to <b>slack.</b> However, the torsion of the corresponding rope is active. And unreasonable discordance between ropes should be controlled for the design and manufacture of drum on super deep parallel hoisting system...|$|R

50|$|Slacklining is {{a popular}} form of slackwire walking which {{utilizes}} nylon webbing stretched tight between two anchor points. Slacklining is distinct from tightrope walking in that the line is not held rigidly taut; it is instead dynamic, stretching and bouncing like a long and narrow trampoline. The tension of the slackline can be varied {{to allow for a}} variety of balance skills to be performed. The tighter a slackline the closer the technique and performance is to tightwire; the more slack in the slackline, the more similar it is to <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> walking and performance.|$|R

25|$|Slacklining {{refers to}} the act of walking or {{balancing}} along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. Slacklining is similar to <b>slack</b> <b>rope</b> walking and tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes {{in the type of}} material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires {{in order to create a}} dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.|$|R
50|$|The lead climber {{typically}} {{connects the}} rope {{to the protection}} with carabiners or quickdraws. If the lead climber falls, they will fall twice {{the length of the}} rope from the last protection point, plus rope stretch (typically 5% to 8% of the <b>rope</b> out), plus <b>slack.</b> If any of the gear breaks or pulls out of the rock or if the belayer fails to lock off the belay device immediately, the fall will be significantly longer. Thus if a climber is 2 meters above the last protection they will fall 2 meters to the protection, 2 meters below the protection, plus rope stretch (typ., 0.10-0.16 m) and slack, for a total fall of over 4 meters.|$|R
5000|$|At any point, {{the length}} of a fall will be at least twice that of the {{distance}} to the most recently placed protection.

If a lead climber, starting from the ground, approaches twice the height of the last piece of protection, there is danger of a ground fall (more commonly referred to as [...] "decking") in which the falling climber hits the ground before the rope goes tight.|$|R
