A border-irrigated field was used as the control group. The total soil porosity, pore size distribution, pore shape distribution, soil cracks and soil compaction were measured. The <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> brought significant changes to the total soil porosity, capillary porosity, air-filled porosity and pore shape of topsoil layers in comparison with the border irrigation. The total porosity and air-filled porosity of the topsoil in the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> were higher than those in the border irrigation. The changes in the air-filled and elongated pores were the main reasons for the changes in total porosity. The porosities of round and irregular pores in topsoil under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> were lower than those under border <b>irrigation.</b> <b>Sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> produced smaller soil cracks than border <b>irrigation</b> did, so <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> may restrain the development of macropore flow in comparison with border irrigation.

Half of the planted area was irrigated using furrow flood irrigation and half was irrigated using a low-pressure overhead linear sprinkler system. Ground water was sampled {{during the growing season}} under both irrigation systems and analyzed for nitrate-N concentration. Nitrate-N concentration of irrigation water and run-off water was also measured. The type of irrigation did not affect stand, sucrose concentration, or root yield. Sodium (Na), potassium (K) and amino-N concentrations were significantly greater under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> than under flood irrigation. Because of higher impurities, sugarbeet produced under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> had greater sucrose loss to molasses (SLM) and lower extraction than sugarbeet produced under flood irrigation. Greater nitrate-N concen-tration was detected in ground water under flood <b>irrigation</b> than under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and nitrate-N was detected in run-off water from flood irrigation. These data indicate that more leaching and run-off of available N occurs in a flood irrigation system than in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system and that sprinkler irrigated sugarbeet probably needs less applied N than flood-irrigated sugarbeet because of reduced N losses to leaching and run-off.

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} (ECV) is a direct, {{accurate and}} reliable micrometeorological mass transfer method for measuring evaporation and evapotranspiration (ET).
