5|$|Chesbro {{was elected}} to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, though he had <b>received</b> <b>little</b> {{consideration}} from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election a mistake, and believe that Chesbro was elected {{solely on the basis of}} his 1904 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1848 the Hungarian Lazzlo Magyar {{ascended the}} Congo to the Yellala falls, before {{spending}} five years exploring {{the region to}} the south. Due to his lack of {{contact with the outside}} world, the valuable information that he gathered <b>received</b> <b>little</b> circulation.|$|E

Throughout his childhood Lajoie <b>received</b> <b>little</b> formal education.|$|E
5|$|Marty Jannetty was {{originally}} supposed to face Rick Martel, but Ludvig Borga replaced Martel {{well before the}} match. The match <b>received</b> <b>little</b> buildup, although Borga appeared in several vignettes {{leading up to the}} match. He criticized the United States for such reasons as its pollution. Jannetty vowed to defend America's pride in his match against Borga.|$|E
5|$|McAleer's rift with Johnson, {{along with}} his sudden retirement, damaged his {{professional}} reputation, and he <b>received</b> <b>little</b> recognition for his contributions to baseball.

5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has <b>received</b> <b>little</b> attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England in 1897, Chamberlain became a successful businessman {{in his home}} city of Birmingham. He was interested in social affairs, and successfully stood for Birmingham City Council in 1911. He became Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1915. His second term was interrupted in December 1916 when Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked him to become Director of National Service. Chamberlain <b>received</b> <b>little</b> support from Lloyd George in the post, and his eight-month tenure sparked a hatred between the two which lasted Chamberlain's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it <b>received</b> <b>little</b> attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In the years following the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again.|$|E

5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and <b>received</b> <b>little</b> impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
5|$|Although ill-equipped {{and having}} <b>received</b> <b>little</b> training, Dalforce {{was sent to}} the northwestern front where they fought against Japanese landing parties during the battles of Sarimbun Beach and Kranji. Despite their efforts, Singapore fell to the Japanese {{a few days after the}} invasion, and the Japanese army moved in to occupy the Chin Kang Huay Kuan. After the Japanese {{surrender}} on September 1945, Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it <b>received</b> <b>little</b> attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
