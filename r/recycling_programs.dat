5|$|The {{population}} generally supports progressive causes such as {{the extensive}} city <b>recycling</b> <b>programs</b> and the decriminalization of cannabis both for medical and recreational use at the municipal level (though the scope of latter of the two cannabis ordinances has since been restricted). The city {{is also one of}} only four in the state to offer medical benefits to same-sex partners of city employees. The new health plan also extends health benefits to unmarried heterosexual domestic partners of city employees. On October 10, 2006, the City Council approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars. The ordinance was passed with protest, and several amendments to the ordinance reflect this. Over half of citizens possess at least a bachelor's degree, while over a quarter hold a graduate degree, making it the thirteenth most highly educated municipality in the United States.|$|E

In 1999, the Legislature and all interested parties again worked together to update and improve California’s <b>recycling</b> <b>program</b> resulting in the passage of Senate Bill 332, and the companion bill, Assembly Bill 1244 (AB 1244). These efforts resulted in an expansion of beverage containers included in the <b>recycling</b> <b>program.</b> AB 1244 also included a requirement to evaluate the <b>recycling</b> <b>program’s</b> effectiveness and the impact to recycling rates for the containers added to the <b>recycling</b> <b>program.</b> The attached closed study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley provides an excellent review of this innovative <b>recycling</b> <b>program.</b> I am pleased to report the <b>recycling</b> <b>program</b> continues to be a resoundin...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} meet recyclers' needs while {{providing}} manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry. Because municipal <b>recycling</b> <b>programs</b> traditionally have targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the resin coding system offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.|$|E

25|$|Although many {{government}} programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many <b>recycling</b> <b>programs</b> done by industry is the cost–effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like retail stores, warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending {{on the nature of}} the waste materials that are present.|$|E
25|$|Objections to {{replacement}} of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate {{the effects of}} these concerns, various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and <b>recycling</b> <b>programs</b> are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and dimmable types are available.|$|E

Due to the Chinese water crisis, as well as for future exports, China is building up its desalination technological abilities and plans to create an indigenous industry.

All stores in Oklahoma will be partnered with Oklahoma Gas & Electric to exclusively use wind power for all Target stores {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions. Stores nationwide use only LED and fluorescent lights and low-flow restrooms that reduce waste water by 30%. Some Target stores are installing roof gardens or green roofs, which absorb storm water and cut down on surface runoff, mitigate temperature fluctuations and provide habitats for birds. There are currently four green-roof Target stores in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} {{batteries}} employ toxic {{materials such as}} lead, mercury, and cadmium as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of mercury-containing batteries, enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones. The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide <b>recycling</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Bloomberg Businessweek placed George Pataki {{among the}} 20 {{individuals}} it commended for their personal efforts to combat global warming, citing his Greenhouse Gas Task Force {{and efforts to}} increase New York's usage of renewable energies. In 1996, Pataki oversaw the creation and passage of the Clean Water/Clean Air Environmental Bond Act. The act put forth $1.75 billion for over 2,200 environmentally minded projects throughout the state. Projects were focused on improving drinking water quality, closing landfills, investing in <b>recycling</b> <b>programs,</b> cleaning up New York's polluted waterways, funding cleanup of Brownfields and clean-air projects. During his tenure, Pataki added over 1 million acres to {{the entirety of the}} protected open spaces of New York. He also worked to protect the drinking water of millions of New Yorkers through the Catskill Watershed Agreement. Through the agreement, the numerous small communities that surround the 19 reservoirs that provide drinking water for New York City received $1 billion in aid to assuage environmental issues and promote local development in return for accepting higher standards of environmental regulations to better protect the reservoirs. On Pataki's final day in office, The New York Times ran an editorial evaluating his twelve years as governor and praised his work on the environment.|$|E
