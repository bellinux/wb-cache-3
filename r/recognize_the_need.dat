25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the Thousand Islands region {{increasingly}} became the focus of outdoor recreation, tourism, and private development. The New York side of the St. Lawrence River in particular became host to a number of lavish private estates built by wealthy newcomers to the region, to the exclusion of recreational visitors; in addition, river anglers grew frustrated with the impacts of illegal fishing and the lack of enforcement of game laws.

Companies that <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{successes of}} the German armored units in Poland and France underscored America's need for an {{effective}} armored force. The tank battles of North Africa and Russia in early 1942 caused the US Army to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to drastically {{increase the number of}} its armored units. The 8th Armored Division was activated on 1 April 1942, at Fort Knox, Kentucky, to serve as a training command. The division served as the first official military guardian of the gold vault at Fort Knox. From 1942 to 1944 it functioned as a training command stationed at Camp Polk, Louisiana. During this period the 8th supplied trained personnel to the 9th through 14th Armored Divisions. In September 1943 the division completed reorganization from the old style triangular division to the new 'light' armored division, as per War Department Letter AG-322, in preparation for activation as a combat unit. The light format armored division was made up of three combat commands referred to as Combat Command A (CCA), Combat Command B (CCB) and a smaller unit called Combat Command Reserve (CCR). Units could be assigned to one of the combat commands at need, creating a very flexible formation.|$|E

[...] In July 1905 28 men met at the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, opposite Buffalo. Differing explanations exist for why the group met in southern Ontario and not Buffalo. A commonly given reason, which has not been substantiated by primary sources, is that they had originally planned to meet in Buffalo, but were refused accommodation. [...] Du Bois' writings of the time, however, show that his original plan was to find a quiet, out of the way location for the event, and that the Erie Beach Hotel satisfied his requirements. [...] Researcher Cynthia Van Ness has further located contemporary evidence of Buffalo hotels complying with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895. [...] Bookerites had been alerted to the planned conference, but one who traveled to Buffalo to investigate the conference found no activity there.|$|E
2500|$|Community {{attitude}} towards homeless shelters varies widely, but {{one study found}} that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often adverse to the concept of homeless shelters in general.

At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, jurisdictions such as Santa Barbara, California, feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode. Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers.

2500|$|The Roman Senate was a {{political}} institution starting in the ancient Roman Kingdom. The Latin term, [...] "senātus," [...] is derived from senex, which means [...] "old man". Therefore, senate literally means [...] "board of old men." [...] The prehistoric Indo-Europeans that settled Italy in the centuries before the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC were structured into tribal communities. These communities would often include an aristocratic board of tribal elders. The early Roman family was called a gens, or [...] "clan". Each clan was an aggregation of families under a common living male patriarch, called a pater (Latin for [...] "father"), who was the undisputed master of his clan. When the early Roman gentes were aggregating to form a community, the patres from the leading clans were selected for the confederated board of elders (which later became the Roman Senate). Over time, the patres came to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a single leader. Therefore, they elected a Roman king (rex), and vested in him their sovereign power. When the king died, that sovereign power would naturally revert to the patres. The senate of the Roman Kingdom held three principal responsibilities: it functioned as the ultimate repository for the executive power, served as counsel to the king, and functioned as a legislative body {{in concert with the}} people of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to work together and learn from each other.

6000|$|... 126. The first tale shows very curiously the {{mercenary}} {{and independent}} character of warfare, {{as it now}} was carried on by the great chiefs, whether Guelph or Ghibelline. The Florentines wanted to send a troop of five hundred horse to assist Orvieto, a Guelph town, isolated on its rock, and at present harrassed upon it. They gave command of this troop to the Knight Guido Guerra de' Conti Guidi, {{and he and his}} riders set out for Orvieto by the Umbrian road, through Arezzo, which was at peace with Florence, though a Ghibelline town. The Guelph party within the town asked help from the passing Florentine battalion; and Guido Guerra, without any authority for such action, used the troop of which he was in command in their favour, and drove out the Ghibellines. Sismondi does not notice what is quite one of the main points in the matter, that this troop of horse must have been mainly composed of Count Guido's own retainers, and not of Florentine citizens, who would not have cared to leave their business on such a far-off quest as this help to Orvieto. However, Arezzo is thus brought over to the Florentine interest; and any other Italian state would have been sure, while it disclaimed the Count's independent action, to keep the advantage of it. Not so Florence. She is entirely resolved, in these years of victory, to do justice to all men so far she understands it; and in this case it will give her some trouble to do it, and worse,--cost her some of her fine new florins. For her counter-mandate is quite powerless with Guido Guerra. He has taken Arezzo mainly with his own men, and means to stay there, thinking that the Florentines, if even they do not abet him, will take no practical steps against him. But he does not know this newly risen clan of military merchants, who quite clearly understand what honesty means, and will put themselves {{out of their way to}} keep their faith. Florence calls out her trades instantly, and with gules, a dragon vert, and or, a bull sable, they march, themselves, angrily up the Val d'Arno, replace the adverse Ghibellines in Arezzo, and send Master Guido de' Conti Guido about his business. But the prettiest and most curious part of the whole story is their equity even to him, after he had given them all this trouble. They entirely <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> he is under of getting meat, somehow, for the mouths of these five hundred riders of his; also they hold him still their friend, though an unmanageable one; and admit with praise what of more or less patriotic and Guelphic principle may be at the root of his disobedience. So when he claims twelve thousand lire,--roughly, some two thousand pounds of money at present value,--from the Guelphs of Arezzo for his service, and the Guelphs, having got no good of it, owing to this Florentine interference, object to paying him, the Florentines themselves lend them the money,--and are never paid a farthing of it back.|$|E
