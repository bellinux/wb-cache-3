5000|$|Former rugby player, now actor, Ian <b>Roberts</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I chose Saltwater as {{the first}} film in which I play a gay {{character}} because its content is something that’s very personal to me. It spoke {{to me in a}} way no other script has." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He impresses me very favourably too," [...] Sir <b>Robert</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and perhaps I {{may find}} a post for him here if we go out, though we need not think of that at present. Well, let us go in to him again. I {{have no doubt that}} the poor fellow is on thorns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{well for}} him that this armour was good," [...] Sir <b>Robert</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Had it not been, it would have gone hard with him.
