5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E

5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The EAIS <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The church {{itself is}} a large brick {{building}} constructed {{in the shape of}} a Greek cross; it was designed by Andrew DeCurtins of Lima and built under the supervision of John Burkhart of Kenton. A Romanesque Revival structure erected in 1903, it is centered on a large bronze dome. Worshippers may enter the building through its eastern end; the facade is pierced by three large doorways and a massive rose window. Capping the facade are two square towers; each one includes an octagonal belfry and is topped with a smaller bronze dome. Inside, the church is heavily decorated; many of the walls feature paintings, and the altar is distinctly Romanesque in its style. The entire building <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone foundation with a basement.|$|E

5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E

5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle lectern date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The Great Seal: The Great Seal of Fordham University was {{designed}} to acknowledge {{the presence of the}} Society of Jesus on campus, hence the order's coat of arms in the seal's center. The coat of arms bears the Greek letters of the lapidary form of Jesus Christ (IHS), with the Cross resting on the center of the H and the three nails of the Crucifixion beneath the epigraph. These figures, dressed in gold, lay in a field framed in maroon, the color of the university, with silver fleur-de-lis at the edge. The fleur-de-lis symbolize the French Jesuits who arrived at Fordham in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown, enclosing the university's pedagogical disciplines: arts, science, philosophy, medicine, and law. Below the shield is a blue scroll with the university's motto, Sapientia et Doctrina. The scroll <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina) and is surrounded by the fiery tongues of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of wisdom (sapientia). In a circular maroon field embroidered with beads is Fordham's official title, Universitas Fordhamensis; at the field's lower edge is the date of the university's founding, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal is a heraldic belt, which is employed as a stylistic decoration. The University of Oxford, the only other tertiary institution in the world that uses a belt in its seal, however, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.|$|E
