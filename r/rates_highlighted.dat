40|$|International audienceUptake and {{assimilation}} kinetics of nitrate and ammonium were investigated along with inhibition of nitrate uptake by ammonium in the harmful dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum Halim at different nitrogen (N) -limited growth rates. Alexandrium minutum {{had a strong}} affinity for nitrate and ammonium (Ks 50. 26 0. 03 and 0. 31 0. 04 lmol. L 1, respectively) whatever the degree of N deficiency of the cells. Ammonium was always the preferred form of nitrogen taken up (rNO 3 =rNH 4 50. 42 - 0. 50). In the presence of both forms, nitrate uptake was inhibited by ammonium, and inhibition was particularly marked in N-sufficient cells (Imax~ 0. 9 and Ki 50. 31 - 0. 56 lmol. L 1). In the case of N assimilation, ammonium was also the preferred form in N-deficient cells (rassim NO 3 =rassim NH 4 50. 54 - 0. 72), whereas in N-sufficient cells, both N sources were equally preferred (rassim NO 3 =rassim NH 4 50. 90 - 1. 00). The comparison of uptake {{and assimilation}} <b>rates</b> <b>highlighted</b> the ability of A. minutum to significantly store in 1 h nitrate and ammonium in amounts sufficient to supply twice the daily N requirements of the slowest-growing N-deficient cells.

Tracking of mortality is particularly essential among US military members because of unique occupational exposures (e. g., worldwide deployments as well as combat experiences). Our study objectives were to describe the early mortality experience of Panel 1 of the Millennium Cohort, consisting of participants in a 21 -year prospective study of US military service members, and to assess data sources used to ascertain mortality. Methods A population-based random sample (n = 256, 400) of all US military service members on service rosters as of October 1, 2000, was selected for study recruitment. Among this original sample, 214, 388 had valid mailing addresses, {{were not in the}} pilot study, and comprised the group referred to in this study as the invited sample. Panel 1 participants were enrolled from 2001 to 2003, represented all armed service branches, and included active-duty, Reserve, and National Guard members. Crude death rates, as well as age- and sex-adjusted overall and age-adjusted, category-specific death rates were calculated and compared for participants (n = 77, 047) and non-participants (n = 137, 341) based on data from the Social Security Administration Death Master File, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) files, and the Department of Defense Medical Mortality Registry, 2001 - 2006. Numbers of deaths identified by these three data sources, as well as the National Death Index, were compared for 2001 - 2004. Results There were 341 deaths among the participants for a crude death rate of 80. 7 per 100, 000 person-years (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 72. 2, 89. 3) compared to 820 deaths and a crude death rate of 113. 2 per 100, 000 person-years (95 % CI: 105. 4, 120. 9) for non-participants. Age-adjusted, category-specific death <b>rates</b> <b>highlighted</b> consistently higher rates among study non-participants. Although there were advantages and disadvantages for each data source, the VA mortality files identified the largest number of deaths (97 %). Conclusions The difference in crude and adjusted death rates between Panel 1 participants and non-participants may reflect healthier segments of the military having the opportunity and choosing to participate.

40|$|Background: Audit and {{feedback}} is an established strategy for improving maternal, neonatal and child health. The Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIP), implemented in South African public {{hospitals in the}} late 1990 s, measures perinatal mortality rates and identifies avoidable factors associated with each death. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the processes involved in the implementation and sustainability of this programme. Methods: Clinicians’ experiences of the implementation and maintenance of PPIP were explored qualitatively in two workshop sessions. An analytical framework comprising six stages of change, divided into three phases, was used: pre-implementation (create awareness, commit to implementation); implementation (prepare to implement, implement) and institutionalisation (integrate into routine practice, sustain new practices). Results: Four essential factors emerged as important for the successful implementation and sustainability of an audit system throughout the different stages of change: 1) drivers (agents of change) and team work, 2) clinical outreach visits and supervisory activities, 3) institutional perinatal review {{and feedback}} meetings, and 4) communication and networking between health system levels, health care facilities and different role-players. During the pre-implementation phase high perinatal mortality <b>rates</b> <b>highlighted</b> the problem and indicated the need to implement an audit programme (stage 1). Commitment to implementing the programme was achieved by obtaining buy-in from management, administration and health care practitioners (stage 2). Preparations in the implementation phase included the procurement and installation of software and training in its use (stage 3). Implementation began with the collection of data, followed by feedback at perinatal review meetings (stage 4). The institutionalisation phase was reached when the results of the audit were integrated into routine practice (stage 5) and when data collection had been sustained for a longer period (stage 6). Conclusion: Insights into the factors necessary for the successful implementation and maintenance of an audit programme and the process of change involved may also be transferable to similar low- and middle-income public health settings where the reduction of the neonatal mortality rate is a key objective in reaching Millennium Development Goal 4. A tool for reflecting on the implementation and maintenance of an audit programme is also proposed. [URL]...|$|E

Focusing the attention on steel structures, a method for a realistic multi-hazard approach is presented. The problem has been investigated at the material level first {{and then at the}} structural level. The material level was studied performing a detailed experimental investigation {{in a wide range of}} strain rates and temperatures. A typical structural steel, namely S 355, has been studied. A Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar equipped with a water-cooled induction heating system was used for the mechanical characterisation at high strain rates (300 1 /s, 500 1 /s and 850 1 /s) and in a wide range of temperatures (20 C, 200 C, 400 C, 550 C, 700 C and 900 C). A Hydro-Pneumatic machine and a universal electromechanical testing machine were used for intermediate (5 1 /s and 25 1 /s) and quasi-static (0. 001 1 /s) strain rate tests at room temperature, respectively. Results showed that the S 355 structural steel is strain rate sensitive, keeping its strain hardening capacity with increasing strain rates. The temperature effect was studied by means of the reduction factors for the main mechanical properties. Results at high strain <b>rates</b> <b>highlighted</b> also the blue brittleness phenomenon between 400 C and 550 C. The link between the material and the structural level is a material constitutive law able to take into account the strain rate sensitivity and the thermal softening. The widely used constitutive law proposed by Johnson and Cook was calibrated using the experimental results. A critical review of this material model highlighted a perceptible variation of the thermal softening parameter at different temperatures. Following a fitting approach, a modification of the dimensionless temperature (T*) has been proposed. The structural level was numerically investigated adopting the calibrated material model. Explicit non-linear dynamic analyses of a steel column under fire conditions and followed by an explosion were performed. The commercial code LS-DYNA was used. A method for a realistic multi-hazard approach has been proposed by studying the residual load bearing capacity. The results can be also of great interest to establish the initial conditions that could potentially lead to the onset of progressive collapse in steel framed structures under a combined effect of fire and blast. As expected, the results indicated that the load bearing capacity is influenced by the stand-off distance, the charge size as well as the column boundary conditions. The time of fire loading at which an explosion is triggered is a critical parameter as well...|$|E

30|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{recession}} exacerbated the economic disparities across European countries, with more pronounced increases in unemployment rates—especially among youths—and in the NEET {{rates in the}} Mediterranean countries, which were more severely hit (Salvà-Mut et al. 2017). For many countries, these disparities also increased within them at a regional level. Italy shows very different levels of economic development between the Centre-North and the South and Isles areas. These disparities also concern the indicators related to the youth professional condition and their human capital. In 2015, early school leavers in the Isles amounted to three times those of the North-East regions (more than 24 % against percentages less than 9 %, respectively). The share of young people aged 30 – 34 who attained at least a 3 -ISCED level of education was higher than 80 % in the North-East and in many regions of the Centre, while in Campania, Puglia and Isles, it was approximately 60 %. The low percentages of higher education directly influence {{the number of people}} at high risk of unemployment. The unemployment rates for youth 15 – 24  years of age in the South and Isles range between 50 and 60 %, more than double of those living in the North-East and in Emilia Romagna, where they do not reach 30 % (Eurostat online database and ISTAT datawarehouse). Southern Italy shows the highest percentages of NEETs but also a major incidence of the phenomenon in older age groups, suggesting that in this area, the transition from the educational system to work is a very long period (Table  1). While in the South, 1 out of 2 young people are NEETs, in the Centre-North, only 1 out of 4 belongs to this cluster. However, the comparison between the share of NEETs in 2015 and in 2005 shows that the increase was greater for men (8.61 %) than for women (2.96 %) while according to the territorial districts, while for men the highest increases concerned the residents in the Southern of Italy, further increasing the territorial gap, for women the highest increases affected those residing in the North-Centre of Italy, while in the South this share remained almost stationary. Bruno et al. (2014), which analysed the impact of the crisis on the NEET <b>rates,</b> <b>highlighted</b> the persistence of NEET rates and found that the increase of NEETs during the crisis was close to the youth unemployment rate while the sensitivity of NEET rate to GDP decreased. Among immigrants, the share of NEETs also differs widely across the Italian macro-regions. In the North, the gap in the share of NEETs between immigrants and native-born is very high and has increased after the economic crisis. Conversely, in the South, the gap between immigrants and the local population is very small and in the Isles further decreased after the economic crisis.|$|E

A large network {{devoted to the}} detection and monitoring of crustal deformations in the Northern Victoria Land (Victoria Land Network for DEFormation control – VLNDEF), was monumented during the 1999 – 2000 and 2000 – 2001 field campaigns, as part of Italian National Program for Antarctic Research and surveyed periodically during the Southern summer seasons. In this paper, GPS observations of VLNDEF collected over a more than 15 -year span, together with various selected POLENET sites and more than 70 IGS stations, were processed with Bernese Software, using a classical double difference approach. A solution was obtained combining NEQs by means of ADDNEQ 2 /FODITS tools embedded in Bernese Software. All the Antarctic sites were kept free and a subset of 50 IGS stations were used to frame VLNDEF into ITRF 2008. New evidence provided by analysis of GPS time series for the VLNDEF network is presented; also displacements along the vertical component are compared with the recently published GIA models. The absolute velocities indicate an overall displacement of the northern Victoria Land region along the south-east direction (Ve = 10. 6 mm/yr, Vn = − 11. 5 mm/yr) and an average uplift rate of Vu = 0. 5 mm/yr. Two GIA models have been analyzed: ICE- 6 G_C-VM 5 a proposed by Argus et al. (2014), Peltier et al. (2015) and W 12 A_v 1 by Whitehouse et al. (2012 a,b). Up rates, predicted over the VLNDEF sites by the mentioned GIA models, have been extracted and compared with those observed. A preliminary comparison with GPS-derived vertical rates shows that the Victoria Land ICE- 6 G_C-VM 5 and W 12 A_v 1 GIA models predict overestimated uplift rates of 0. 7 and 0. 9 mm/yr weighted mean residuals respectively. The mean horizontal relative motions within the Victoria Land (VL) area are in most cases negligible, while only a few points exhibit horizontal velocities greater than the confidence level. Such a residual horizontal velocity field could represent some of the tectonic characteristics affecting VL, characterized by block faulting, tilting along NE striking and SE dipping extensional faults. Uplift <b>rates,</b> <b>highlighted</b> in the present paper depict a well defined spatial pattern in the investigated areas. Northward, all sites show a general positive trend up to 2. 3 mm/yr. In the central and southern areas small negative trends (up to − 1. 3 mm/yr) were detected in the vertical displacements. Only the site VL 06, located atop the Mt. Melbourne volcano, does not concord with such a general reading, as it {{is representative of the}} volcanic complex’s evolution. Observed and predicted uplift rates increase westward (inland) where the ice-load increases. The same behavior is predicted southward by the GIA models; whereas GPS values decrease toward the south pole, due to the movements of a few sites reflecting the neotectonic phenomena acting in the Victoria Land region...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyIntroduction Since the mid- 1980 s the Mexican {{economy has}} {{undergone}} a process of deep economic reform designed to shift away from the more inward-oriented development model that Mexico had followed until then. The main purpose of these reforms was to privilege market mechanisms in economic activities, which meant reducing the state's direct and indirect involvement in the economy. Some of these economic reforms have been completed, some are still in process, and still others - those that encountered opposition - have not yet, or have only just, been implemented. Economic liberalization had varying effects {{on the behavior of}} economic actors and therefore on the evolution of various economic sectors and the Mexican economy as a whole. Liberalizing reforms were intended to have a strong impact on the investment process. Under the previous development model - import-substitution industrialization (ISI); the state played a fundamental role in directing investment; the reforms sought to shift that role by placing greater emphasis on domestic and foreign private investment, {{while at the same time}} orienting investment more toward exports and tradable activities and less toward non-tradable sectors. The expectation was that, as the reform process took its course and obstacles to free market operations were reduced, investment decisions would increasingly be based on market signals, thus increasing both efficiency in the use of the factors of production and the potential for economic growth. Mexico's liberalization process began in 1982, when collapsing petroleum prices and rising international interest <b>rates</b> <b>highlighted</b> the economy's vulnerability and the waning effectiveness of an importan import-substitution model characterized by high levels of protectionism and strong state participation. Those developments prompted the Mexican government to try to modulate the impact of international economic shocks, and they also paved the way for vigorous attempts to modify the country's development pattern. Liberalizing reforms sought to convert the private sector into the axis of economic growth, ideally making it able to operate competitively (without subsidies); in world markets. The main elements of this reform process included opening the domestic market to foreign trade, attracting foreign investment, deregulating the economy, privatizing public enterprises, signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA);, and liberalizing financial markets. (1); The reforms'goals have been bolstered by a governmental commitment to continue stringent monetary and fiscal policies while eliminating preferential lending. These efforts, particularly by the late 1980 s, transformed a nearly closed economy into one that is highly open to foreign participation in trade and investment. State involvement in the economy was curtailed sharply, as shown by the downsizing of the public sector and the substitution of market forces for state intervention in determining key variables such as interest rates, nominal exchange rates, and prices of basic inputs. In addition to their broad sweep and the speed with which they were implemented, the reforms displayed two other interesting features. The first is that they were largely accepted by key economic and political players. That is, the shift toward trade liberalization, the elimination of subsidies, and an expanded role for market forces in allocating funds did not encounter strong opposition from those who had benefited from the prior system of protection and subsidies, or from the workers and labor unions who were affected by productive restructuring and new conditions in the labor market. Even the currency crisis that erupted in December 1994 did not provoke a rejection of the new development model. In fact, in dealing with the crisis, the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo (1994 - 2000); reaffirmed its commitment to the reform process and to orthodox management of fiscal and monetary policy. Moreover Vicente Fox (2000 - 2006); - Mexico's first ever elected Presidential candidate not nominated by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI); - has stated his intention to extend the reform process. The second feature concerns the reforms' impact on economic growth. From 1983 to 1988, the Mexican economy was stagnant; from 1989 to 1994, per capita gross domestic product (GDP); grew by only 0. 8 percent a year on average; and in 1995, more than ten years after the reform process was launched, per capita GDP dropped 9 percent in real terms, its largest decline in sixty years. The consensus among observers is that Mexico received an international financial aid package and achieved a speedy, though moderate, economic recovery in 1996 - 2000 largely thanks to the NAFTA, the productive apparatus's focus on foreign markets, and appropriate fiscal policy-all central results of the economic reform process. Despite the recovery, however, Mexico's economy has yet to show the high and sustained growth rates required to generate sufficient jobs to curb national unemployment and underemployment. Moreover, in 2001 Mexico's GDP once again stalled, falling 0. 1 %. The key role that capital formation plays in creating and expanding productive capacities, incorporating technology, and raising productivity makes it a fundamental factor in macroeconomic development. Yet despite its importance, there is little information available on the sectoral performance of capital formation in the Mexican economy. (2); In fact, empirical studies of investment in specific sectors have lagged behind the theoretical advances of recent years. Against this background, this chapter analyzes the effect that Mexico's liberalizing reforms have had on fixed capital formation at the aggregate level and in the industrial sector. (3); The period under study begins with the aftermath of the 1982 economic crisis and continues to 2000 and - when data was available - to 2001. The following four sections review, respectively, the behavior of aggregate investment and its relationship to the growth process; (4); trends and performance of foreign direct investment (FDI);, including the activities of in-bond processing plants (maquiladoras);; the behavior and determining factors of investment in manufacturing; and the impact of investment patterns on the manufacturing industry's structure and export performance. (1); Mexico's reforms are well documented; for an overview, see Aspe 1993; Lustig 1998; Ros 1991. (2); The available data on capital formation tend to be highly aggregated.

The estimator is semiparametric, {{in the sense that}} it does not require a full specification of the conditional distribution of the data, and it is very simple to compute, being a least squares estimator with a closed form expression. We establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under mild regularity conditions. A simulation study provides evidence of the excellent finite-sample properties of the estimator and an application to some exchange <b>rates</b> <b>highlights</b> the semiparametric aspect of the new estimator. conditional value at risk; CVaR; Tail VaR; coherent risk measures; tail risk; market risk; conditional distribution; semiparametric estimation; conditional expected shortfall models. ...|$|R

More than ten years of educational reform in Delaware has {{led to the creation of}} a performance based accountability system composed of rigorous standards, a statewide assessment, and consequences for performance. This ongoing study, conducted at the request of the Delaware State Board of Education, is intended to monitor Delaware’s student accountability plan and provide longitudinal information about its effects on students. It addresses four key areas of potential impact: 1) student achievement, 2) behavioral effects, 3) retention rates, and, 4) completion <b>rates.</b> <b>Highlights</b> are organized according to these categories.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyse}} {{the impact of}} {{exchange}} rate changes on the trade balance, and to construct the effective exchange rate index using the simulated trade balance effects of the exchange rate changes as the weights. The study is divided into four sections. Section I reviews various indices of effective exchange <b>rates,</b> <b>highlighting</b> their uses and limitations. Section II presents a multilateral trade model appropriate to primary commodity exporting countries. The model is employed to analyse the effects of both the nominal and real exchange rate changes during 1971 - 1985 on the trade balance of Sri Lanka. The results are discussed in Section III. Section IV concludes the study highlighting the major observations, limitations and further research to be undertaken. ...|$|R

MSMEs are credited with generating {{high rates of}} employment growth and account for a major share of industrial production and exports. Credit risk assessment in this segment requires a specific approach, because the factors affecting the creditworthiness are somewhat different compared to the large corporate entities. Hence, to further support the growth for this sector and help the investors to determine the relative creditworthiness of entities belonging to this segment, a need for separate rating product was felt. Credit ratings assess the financial viability of the MSMEs and its capability to honor business obligations. <b>Rating</b> <b>highlights</b> the overall health of the enterprise and benchmarks its performance within the industry for an effective peer review...|$|R

The staff at Boston.com praised Fergie's vocals on the song, while commenting, [...] "a nice change since she's often reduced to just singing hooks." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song a {{three and a half}} star <b>rating,</b> <b>highlighting</b> the song's Latin-tinged beats, sentiment, and family-oriented lyrics as pros. Lamb also commented that the song maybe too pop-oriented for their hip-hop followers and found the lyrics to be less challenging. A reviewer for Contactmusic.com praised the song as a clever hip-hop song that diverges away from the dangerous lyrics present in most rap music and presents a family-friendly message.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe explore {{experimentally}} {{the motion}} of deformable objects – bubbles and capsules – through narrow localised constrictions, with widths between 16 and 32 % of {{the diameter of the}} object. Under constant volume-flux flow, both bubbles and capsules extend to a maximum length as their front passes through the constriction. Rapid contraction occurs as their rear accelerates towards the constriction, followed by relaxation upon exiting the constriction. We find that the large deformations imposed by narrowing constrictions and increasing flow <b>rates</b> <b>highlight</b> distinguishing features between bubbles and capsules, which reflect their distinct mechanics. These include tip-streaming of the rear of the bubble, buckling of the capsule upon contraction and wrinkling of the capsule membrane through excessive compressive strains. Finally, we present evidence of distinct modes of rupture for bubbles and capsule as the flow rate is further increased...|$|R
