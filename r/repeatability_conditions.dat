40|$|It {{is common}} in {{evolutionary}} ecology to interpret body-condition indices as indicators of individual quality, but this hypothesized relationship has been questioned and remains poorly validated. Here, we test {{one of the fundamental}} predictions of this condition-quality hypothesis, that relative-condition indices are repeatable within individuals, that is, that the index score of an individual relative to others is consistent over time. We sampled crimson finches (Neochmia phaeton) for seven commonly used condition indices and tested whether individual condition relative to conspecifics in the same context (e. g., breeding stage) was repeatable. We calculated the relative indices’ repeatability across several temporal scales, from short (within breeding season) to long (more than 2 yr) time periods, as well as without consideration of timescale. Most relative-condition indices were repeatable when sampled without consideration of timescale, all were repeatable within a short time period, and none were repeatable over the longest time period. This provides only partial support for the condition-quality hypothesis, because although relative-condition indices were generally repeatable, this was primarily attributed to short-term, instead of long-term, <b>repeatability.</b> <b>Condition</b> indices may be meaningful indicators of short-term survival or fitness potential, but our findings are inconsistent with the idea that condition indices are indicators of inherent individual quality...|$|R

On the other hand the study of a complete railway bogie allows one to simulate the behaviour of a real vehicle {{and can be used}} in the design phase of new vehicles. For instance, it is possible to evaluate the effect of changes brought to the suspension system on the running dynamics of the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Individuals of {{many species}} differ {{consistently}} in their behavioral reactions toward different stimuli, such as predators, rivals, and potential mates. These typical reactions, described as ‘behavioral syndromes’ or ‘personalities,’ {{appear to be}} heritable and therefore subject to selection. We studied behavioral syndromes in 36 male fowl living in 12 social groups and found that individuals behaved consistently over time. Furthermore, responses to different contexts (anti-predator, foraging, and territorial) were inter-correlated, suggesting that males exhibited comparable behavioral traits in these functionally distinct situations. We subsequently isolated the same roosters and conducted tests in a ‘virtual environment,’ using high-resolution digital video sequences to simulate the anti-predator, foraging, and territorial contexts that they had experienced outdoors. Under these controlled <b>conditions,</b> <b>repeatability</b> persisted but individual responses to the three classes of stimuli failed to predict one another. These were instead context-specific. In particular, production of each type of vocal signal was independent, implying that calls in the repertoire are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Our results show that extrinsic factors, such as social position, can {{be responsible for the}} appearance of traits that could readily be mistaken for the product of endogenous characters...|$|R
