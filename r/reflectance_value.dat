40|$|This paper {{focused on}} the {{assessment}} of the relation between constructional properties and percentage <b>reflectance</b> <b>values</b> of fabrics woven from polyester yarns through fabric layer numbers. Reflectance measurements were conducted on pretreated but undyed fabric samples at five different fabric layers. Twelve polyester fabrics having different constructional parameters were used and fabrics differed from each other by their weft yarn densities, weave patterns, and weft yarn filament fineness. Warp yarn properties (type, count, and density) were the same at all the fabrics. Percentage <b>reflectance</b> <b>values</b> of the fabrics changed according to yarn density, weave pattern, and filament fineness in accordance with fabric layer numbers during reflectance measurement. Percentage <b>reflectance</b> <b>values</b> gradually increased as fabric layer numbers increased. The highest <b>reflectance</b> <b>values</b> were obtained at 16 layers of fabric. The effects of single constructional parameters on <b>reflectance</b> <b>values</b> disappeared as fabric layer numbers increased.

Light-trap phenomenon was discussed according to reflectance characteristics of woven fabrics...|$|R

5000|$|Uplighting is less common, {{often used}} to bounce {{indirect}} light off the ceiling and back down. It is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels. Uplighting (indirect) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces. It gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation. However indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> of the surface.

50|$|White Portland cement {{is used in}} {{combination}} with white aggregates to produce white concrete for prestige construction projects and decorative work. White concrete usually {{takes the form of}} pre-cast cladding panels, since it is not economical to use white cement for structural purposes. White Portland cement is also used {{in combination}} with inorganic pigments to produce brightly colored concretes and mortars. Ordinary cement, when used with pigments, produces colors that may be attractive, but are somewhat dull. With white cement, bright reds, yellows and greens can be readily produced. Blue concrete can also be made, at some expense. The pigments may be added at the concrete mixer. Alternatively, to guarantee repeatable color, some manufacturers supply ready-blended colored cements, using white cement as a base. The whiteness of WOPC is measured as the powdered material having a <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> ("L value") in excess of 85%.

Repeat measurements taken over a 20 month period on a quartz sand standard show that the repeatability of the system is very high, with a standard deviation ranging between 0. 001 and 0. 006 reflectance units depending on wavelength. This high level of repeatability is achieved even after replacing optical components, re-aligning mirrors and placement of sample port reducers.

5000|$|Kirchhoff's law {{of thermal}} {{radiation}} states that absorption equals emissivity opaque for every specific wavelength/frequency (materials often have quite different emissivities at different wavelengths). Therefore, if asphalt has an emissivity value of 0.90 {{at a specific}} wavelength (say wavelength of 10 micrometer, or room temperature thermal radiation), its thermal absorptance value would also be 0.90. This means that it absorbs and emits 90 percent of radiant thermal energy. As it is an opaque material, the remaining 10 percent must be reflected. Conversely, a low-e material such as aluminum foil has a thermal emissivity/absorptance value of 0.03 and as an opaque material the thermal <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> must be 1.0 - 0.03 =0.97, meaning it reflects 97 percent of radiant thermal energy. Low-emissivity building materials include window glass manufactured with metal-oxide coatings as well as housewrap materials, reflective thermal insulations {{and other forms of}} radiant thermal barriers. The thermal emissivity of various surfaces is listed in the following table.|$|E
50|$|As an example, suppose {{one wants}} to print an area at 50% reflectance, {{assuming}} no ink is 100% reflective and saturated black ink is 0% (which of course they aren't). The 50% could be approximated using digital halftoning by applying a dot of ink at every other dot target area, and staggering the lines in a brick-like fashion. In a perfect world, this would cover exactly half of the page with ink and make the page appear to have 50% reflectivity. However, because the ink will bleed into its neighboring target locations, greater than 50% of the page will be dark. To compensate for this darkening, a TRC is applied and the digital image's <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> is reduced to something less than 50% dot coverage. When digital halftoning is performed, we will {{no longer have the}} uniform on-off-on-off pattern, but we will have another pattern that will target less than 50% of the area with ink. If the correct TRC was chosen, the area will have an average 50% reflectance after the ink has bled.|$|E

5000|$|When making {{transmission}} measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively {{compares the}} fraction of light that passes through a reference solution and a test solution, then electronically compares the intensities of the two signals and computes the percentage of transmission of the sample compared to the reference standard. For reflectance measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares {{the fraction of}} light that reflects from the reference and test samples. Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator, which diffracts the light into a [...] "rainbow" [...] of wavelengths through a rotating prism and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum through a mechanical slit on the output side of the monochromator. These bandwidths are transmitted through the test sample. Then the photon flux density (watts per metre squared usually) of the transmitted or reflected light is measured with a photodiode, charge coupled device or other light sensor. The transmittance or <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission or reflectance values from the reference sample.

50|$|The {{study of}} {{vitrinite}} reflectance (or VR) {{is a key}} method for identifying the maximum temperature history of sediments in sedimentary basins. The reflectance of vitrinite was first studied by coal explorationists attempting to diagnose the thermal maturity, or rank, of coal beds. More recently, its utility {{as a tool for}} the study of sedimentary organic matter metamorphism from kerogens to hydrocarbons has been increasingly exploited. The key attraction of vitrinite reflectance in this context is its sensitivity to temperature ranges that largely correspond to those of hydrocarbon generation (i.e. 60 to 120°C). This means that, with a suitable calibration, vitrinite reflectance can be used as an indicator of maturity in hydrocarbon source rocks. Generally, the onset of oil generation is correlated with a reflectance of 0.5-0.6% and the termination of oil generation with reflectance of 0.85-1.1%. The onset of gas generation ('gas window') is typically associated with values of 1.0-1.3% and terminates around 3.0%. However these generation windows vary between source rocks with different kerogen types (vitrinite is typically abundant in 'Type III' kerogen-rich source rocks), so a conversion to 'Transformation Ratio' (TR) can be applied to create a kerogen-specific maturity parameter. The vitrinite <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> represents the highest temperature that the vitrinite maceral (and source rock) has experienced, and is routinely used in 1D burial modelling to identify geological unconformities in sedimentary sections.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an optical model that simulates the light {{trapping}} and scattering {{effects of a}} paraboloid texture surface first time. This model was experimentally verified by measuring the reflectance values of the periodically textured silicon (Si) surface with {{the shape of a}} paraboloid under different conditions. A paraboloid texture surface was obtained by electrochemical etching Si in the solution of hydrofluoric acid, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and deionized (DI) water. The paraboloid texture surface has the advantage of giving a lower <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> than the hemispherical, random pyramidal, and regular pyramidal texture surfaces. In the case of parabola, the light can be concentrated {{in the direction of the}} Si surface compared to the hemispherical, random pyramidal, and regular pyramidal textured surfaces. Furthermore, in a paraboloid textured surface, there can be a maximum value of 4 or even more by anisotropic etching duration compared to the hemispherical or pyramidal textured surfaces which have a maximum h/D (depth and diameter of the texture) value of 0.5. The reflectance values were found to be strongly dependent on the h/D ratio of the texture surface. The measured reflectance values were well matched with the simulated ones. The minimum <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> of ~ 4  % was obtained at a wavelength of 600  nm for an h/D ratio of 3.75. The simulation results showed that the <b>reflectance</b> <b>value</b> for the h/D ratio can be reduced to ~ 0.5  % by reducing the separations among the textures.
