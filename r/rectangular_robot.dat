40|$|International audienceAn {{augmented}} reality based robotic system isproposed {{for treatment of}} large liver tumor using multipleoverlapping ablations technique. Radiofrequency ablation is anon-resection interventional procedure that minimizesinvasiveness and reduces trauma. A single ablation is howeverlimited by the ablation volume coverage. In treatment of tumorwith diameter that could be 150 mm or more, a single needleinsertion will not create sufficient ablation coverage to destroy theentire tumor. As such, multiple insertions are required. Theprecision and consistency associated with robot assisted surgerycoupled with direct {{augmented reality}} projection system canbetter facilitate such treatment. The projection system is equippedwith manipulator mechanism and robotic needle insertion arm formultiple insertions and needle deployment. The prototypeaugmented reality surgical system was evaluated on its abilities inablating large tumor. Virtual models of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>robot</b> forprojector manipulation and robotic needle insertion device werealso {{used to assess the}} effectiveness of the proposed AR design...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to obstacle avoidance and local path planning for polygonal robots. It decomposes the task into a model stage and a planning stage. The model stage accounts for robot shape and dynamics using a reduced dynamic window. The planning stage produces collision-free local paths with a velocity profile. We present an analytical solution to the distance to collision problem for polygonal robots, avoiding thus the use of look-up tables. The approach has been tested in simulation and on two non-holonomic <b>rectangular</b> <b>robots</b> where a cycle time of 10 Hz was reached under full CPU load. During a longterm experiment over 5 km travel distance, the method demonstrated its practicability. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the reactive collision-free motion generation for indoor /outdoor robots which have geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constraints. Most {{of the current}} mobile robots are designed exhibiting some of these constraints: (1) typically they are circular, square or <b>rectangular</b> <b>robots</b> and (2) they are differential-driven robots, car-like robots, tri-cycle robots, etc. On the other hand, many navigation methods do {{not take into account}} the specific shape or robot's kinematics and dynamics. In this case, these methods relax some constraints or they rely on approximations. It is clear that this is a gap in research that needs to be closed, by devising mechanisms to generalize navigation methods to be applied over a wide range of mobile platforms. This paper focuses on the generalization of a reactive method - Nearness Diagram Navigation - to work over a fleet of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constrained indoor/outdoor mobile robots. This framework has been extensively tested using four indoor and one outdoor robots equipped with different sensors. To validate the method, we report experiments in unknown, nonpredictable, unstructured, cluttered, dense and complex environments...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} a specic problem of distributed robotics [...] namely, {{the problem of}} using a team of identical robots to autonomously and cooperatively generate a map of their shared workspace {{without the use of}} a central controller. The problem is posed as one of sensor-based coverage, in which a complete exploration of the environment is produced without any initial information. The system that inspired this work, the minifactory, is an automated assembly system that requires the ability for complete self-calibration, a task that can be posed as sensor-based coverage. The problem addressed here is therefore specied for a class of robots similar to the minifactory's couriers [...] <b>rectangular</b> <b>robots</b> with intrinsic contact sensing operating in a shared rectilinear environment. To approach this problem, rst a novel sensor-based coverage algorithm for a single robot, CC R, is presented. CC R uses a reactive construction and no time-based history to perform coverage, enabling the straightforward addition of cooperation. A proof is then presented which shows that a robot under the direction of CC R will reach every point in any nite rectilinear environment with no initial knowledge. A cooperative algorithm DC R is then presented which runs independently on each robot in a team with a shared workspace...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the following scenario. A point robot is placed at some start location in a 2 dimensional scene containing oriented <b>rectangular</b> obstacles. The <b>robot</b> must repeatedly travel {{back and forth between}} and a second location in the scene. The robot knows the coordinates but initially knows nothing about the positions or sizes of the obstacles. It can only determine the obstacles' locations by bumping into them. We would like an intelligent strategy for the robot so that its trips between both are relatively fast initially, and improve as more trips are taken and more information is gathered...|$|R
40|$|Incremental {{hammering}} forming automated using a CCD (Charged-Coupled Device) {{camera and}} a database is developed as flexible forming of sheet metals. In this process, the sheets are bent into desired shapes by repeating local deformation due to the hammering. The forming process is divided into roughing and finishing operations. In the roughing operation, the sheet is hammered in accordance with a sequence stored in a database. On the other hand, the roughly formed shape is corrected by hammering at points of large differences of shape in the finishing operation. The three-dimensional shape of the sheet during the forming is calculated from the distortion of grid pattern measured by the CCD camera system {{by means of the}} Fourier transform grid method. Aluminum square sheets are formed by an incremental forming machine with a set of a hemispherical punch and rubber die. The sheet is moved by a <b>rectangular</b> coordinate <b>robot</b> to change the position for the blow with the punch. The sheets are successfully formed into a sphere, frustum of cone, paraboloid and hyperboloid...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{strategy}} SEP for finite state machines tasked with cleaning a cellular {{environment in which}} a contamination spreads. Initially, the contaminated area is of height h and width w. It may be bounded by four monotonic chains, and contain <b>rectangular</b> holes. The <b>robot</b> does not know the initial contamination, sensing only the eight cells in its neighborhood. It moves from cell to cell, d {{times faster than the}} contamination spreads, and is able to clean its current cell. A speed of d<√(2) (h+w) is in general not sufficient to contain the contamination. Our strategy SEP succeeds if d ≥ 3 (h+w) holds. It ensures that the contaminated cells stay connected. Greedy strategies violating this principle need speed at least d ≥ 4 (h+w); all bounds are up to small additive constants...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{man-made}} environments, rectangular shapes {{can be seen}} almost everywhere. It is thus {{convenient to}} use <b>rectangular</b> shapes for <b>robot</b> location, which {{is equivalent to the}} problem of close-range space resection encountered in photogrammetric engineering. A new method for robot location using mutually parallel or perpendicular line pairs in observed rectangular shape images is proposed. From a monocular image of any object with at least a rectangular shape, image processing and numerical analysis techniques are applied to extract the projection characteristics of each corner point in the rectangular shape. The position and orientation parameters of a camera mounted on the robot can then be computed for <b>robot</b> location. Multiple <b>rectangular</b> shapes can be utilized to promote the accuracy of the parameters. Partial rectangular shapes also can be utilized. A major merit of the method is that the solution can be uniquely and analytically determined without iterative computation. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach. Error analysis useful for determining location precision is also included.
