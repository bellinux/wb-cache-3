500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic. He added [...] " [...] come in and they just jump <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Did you see last week's episode?' They totally talk all about it, just that it's funny, that it's hilarious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cohen's writing process, {{as he told}} an {{interviewer}} in 1998, was [...] "like a bear stumbling into a beehive or a honey cache: I'm stumbling <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> and getting stuck, and it's delicious and it's horrible and I'm in it and it's not very graceful and it's very awkward and it's very painful and yet there's something inevitable about it." ...|$|E

Even {{if you happen to}} bump <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> {{how will you}} know it is the thing you didn't know?" [...] Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the {{canonical}} statement of the paradox: [...] " [...] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, {{there is no need to}} search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for." ...|$|E

[...] Harrison noted that as Heston knew it was her [...] "first big picture", he {{took it upon himself}} to coach her. Harrison was admittedly still [...] "camera-shy", so Heston [...] "taught me to favour the camera. Don't look <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Look off to the side, don't look too far, you know, not to turn my head this way. And he would say turn it just here. Don't go all the way back. And he held my hand for a lot of things." [...] Their off-screen relationship, Harrison said, tended to reflect their on-screen relationship. Heston ...|$|E
2500|$|Many stories {{exist to}} explain {{the origins of the}} footprints. The theatre's {{official}} account in its books and souvenir programs credit Norma Talmadge as having inspired the tradition when she accidentally stepped into the wet concrete. However, in a short interview during the September 13, 1937, Lux Radio Theatre broadcast of a radio adaptation of A Star Is Born, Grauman related another version of how he got the idea to put hand and foot prints in the concrete. He said it was [...] "pure accident. I walked <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> While we were building the theatre, I accidentally happened to step in some soft concrete. And there it was. So, I went to Mary Pickford immediately. Mary put her foot into it." [...] Still another account by the construction foreman, Jean Klossner, recounts that Klossner autographed his work next to the right-hand poster kiosk and that Grauman and he developed the idea then and there. His autograph and handprint, dated 1927, remain today. The theatre's third founding partner, Douglas Fairbanks, was the second celebrity, after Talmadge, to be immortalized in the concrete.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of comity enshrined in Art. IV, Sec. 2, {{is one of}} the most fundamental principles in the Constitution, White claimed. It was, he asserted, the very basis for the Union. The right encompassed not only travel between the separate states but also movement within a state, but while the Constitution fused these two <b>rights</b> <b>into</b> one, <b>it</b> reserved exclusively to the states the power to enforce these rights, except when a state violated the rule of comity.|$|R
2500|$|Originalists often argue that, where a {{constitution}} is silent, judges should not read <b>rights</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> (i.e. a textualist interpretation). However, the Ninth Amendment, seen through an originalist lens, {{can be seen}} as providing the judiciary with means of protecting [...] which the founders had not thought, for whatever reasons, to explicitly list, such as rights involving abortion, gender and sexual orientation equality, and capital punishment. This presents a particular challenge to the theory of Original Intent, which seems to thus suggest just the opposite of what the text of the Constitution and original intent of the founders arguably affirm, creating an inconsistency in the practice of at least one branch of Originalism. The subsequent Tenth Amendment, detailing non-enumerated rights as the sole property of the states and the people, is often cited as the clarification for this inconsistency and the reason why the federal courts have no say in affirming or denying said rights per the Ninth Amendment.|$|R

2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. [...] "I'd say {{the main difference between}} this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That {{is one of the reasons}} I am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new. I won't let you down this record, I promise you." ...|$|E

60|$|When Peter Rabbit dodged, {{something}} surprising happened. Johnny Chuck, who {{had opened}} his eyes to see if all was over, jumped up and shouted for joy, and did a funny little dance {{in the doorway of}} the old house on the hill.

50|$|In June 2008, a {{memorial}} to Dr. Humphrey was unveiled {{in his hometown of}} Hampton, New Brunswick. The memorial, located just a few hundred yards from his childhood home, consists of a UN-style wooden bench with a young and old Humphrey seated.

He saw six sweeps at work, and in the stern, clearly outlined against the overhanging wall of white, a man who stood erect, gigantic, swaying with his weight on the steering-sweep. This he saw, and an eighth man who crouched in the bow and gazed shoreward. But what startled Sheldon was the sight of a woman in the stern-sheets, between the stroke-oar and the steersman. A woman she was, for a braid of her hair was flying, and she was just in the act of recapturing it and stowing it away beneath a hat that for all the world was like his own [...] "Baden-Powell." ...|$|E

Now, being over the Old Briar-patch, he could look <b>right</b> down <b>into</b> <b>it</b> and see all through it. Just as he reached it, he remembered having heard Sammy Jay say something about gossipy little Jenny Wren's having said that there was great news there.

50|$|On May 15, 2015, a {{coalition}} of more than 60 Asian-American organizations filed federal complaints with the United States Department of Education and Department of Justice against Harvard University. The coalition asked for a civil <b>rights</b> investigation <b>into</b> what <b>it</b> described as Harvard's discriminatory admission practices against Asian-American applicants. The complaints were dismissed in July 2015 because a lawsuit making similar allegations was filed by Students for Fair Admissions in November 2014.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} the work was resumed, and was carried on all day with only short breaks for meals, and so on the {{following}} two days. At {{the end of that}} time as much had been put on board the cutter as she could carry. Ten men were then left to guard the stores, and the rest, going on board, sailed out to the schooner and towed her in. They did not, as was at first intended, stop a mile outside the inlet, but came <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> and anchored opposite the path, as the labour of continually loading the cutter and then transferring her cargo to the hulk would have been very great. The next morning a party of twelve men went on board her, and found, as Will had expected, that she was entirely deserted.|$|E
60|$|It thrilled {{through him}} when he first felt the keel answer to {{his hand on the}} spokes and slide over the long hollows as the {{foresail}} scythed back and forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of Disko saying that it would break a snake's back to follow his wake. But, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They were sailing on the wind with the staysail--an old one, luckily--set, and Harvey jammed her <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> to show Dan how completely he had mastered the art. The foresail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and ripped through the stay-sail, which, was of course, prevented from going over by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey spent his leisure hours {{for the next few days}} under Tom Platt's lee, learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he said, he had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.|$|E

I hold that a man will never become a first-class seaman unless he likes work for its own sake. There are three sorts of hands. There is the fellow who shirks his work whenever he has a chance; there is the man who does his work, but who does it because he has to do it, and always looks glad when a job is over; and there is the lad who jumps to his work, chucks himself <b>right</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> and puts his last ounce of strength on a rope. That is the fellow who will make a good officer, and who, if needs be, can set an example to the men when they have to go aloft to reef a sail in a stiff gale. So, as I understand, Mr. Prendergast, he is going to leave the sea for a bit. It seems a pity too." ...|$|E
