5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards <b>rationalisation.</b> Similarly, <b>rationalisation</b> could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw <b>rationalisation</b> as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. <b>Rationalisation</b> relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|By <b>rationalisation,</b> Weber {{understood}} first, {{the individual}} cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally, {{in the more}} general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (disenchantment).|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{comprehensive}} <b>rationalisations</b> {{have been}} implemented in public dentistry in Sweden. How <b>rationalisations</b> affect working conditions, health and production from a long-term perspective has been poorly investigated. This study aims to analyse changes and associations in dentists' working conditions, health and productivity during a 5 -year period. In 2003 and 2008, 65 dentists responded to questionnaires measuring work conditions and health. Treatment times for patients and productivity were tracked in electronic registers. Paired t-tests showed {{that the number of}} treated adult patients per dentist increased, and perceived physical working conditions improved while perceived work control and leadership deteriorated. Structural equation modelling showed that physical factors were important for health and productivity. When assessing risks in the work environment, {{there is a need to}} understand the interaction of effects on working conditions and health due to <b>rationalisations</b> so as to increase the sustainability of production systems. Practioner Summary: Dentistry in Sweden has undergone considerable change. Questionnaire surveys with dentists, undertaken in 2003 and 2008, found that the present <b>rationalisations</b> resulted in improved perceived physical working conditions. Aspects of the psychosocial working environment had deteriorated, however. This is a concern as health and workability are important for workplace efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Many {{scholars}} have described <b>rationalisation</b> {{and the question}} of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work. This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily, religion) and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1930 Palmer's {{launched}} its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but {{by this time}} the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and <b>rationalisation</b> in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this <b>rationalisation</b> was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.|$|E

5|$|The heavy <b>rationalisation</b> {{process in}} British Railways in the 1960s, often {{referred}} to as the Beeching Axe, resulted in a re-assessment of those lines, at a time when efficient bus services were abstracting passengers from often infrequent and inconvenient train services.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 all {{production}} at Churchill-Redman in Halifax moved to Blaydon with the consequent loss of 350 jobs. This formed {{a part of}} TI's many <b>rationalisation</b> measures taken in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the closure was explained as being due to the desire for greater productivity and {{a recognition of the}} low sales generated at the site. A Churchill factory at Bedford which had been operating since 1967 was closed at this time.|$|E
5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and <b>rationalisation</b> of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>rationalisation</b> {{programme}} was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering {{soldiers from}} the Socialist Party, Communist Party, {{and members of the}} All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations for a would-be proletarian revolution in Madiun, East Java, which occurred on 18September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling his wife that he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and <b>rationalisation</b> of intrastate freight {{operations}} {{have seen this}} change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{after the}} death of Armaments Minister Fritz Todt, Hitler {{appointed}} Albert Speer as his replacement. Speer improved production via streamlined organisation, the use of single-purpose machines operated by unskilled workers, <b>rationalisation</b> of production methods and better co-ordination between the many different firms that made tens of thousands of components. Factories were relocated away from rail yards, which were bombing targets. By 1944, the war was consuming 75 percent of Germany's gross domestic product, compared to 60 percent in the Soviet Union and 55 percent in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} served in general by around {{half a dozen}} trains each way between North Walsham, Mundesley and Cromer Beach. However, with no direct service to Norwich - the nearest city - the halt was little-used, and closed in 1953 {{as part of a}} package of early <b>rationalisation</b> {{measures}} undertaken by British Railways after nationalisation, which also involved the closure of the line from Roughton Road Junction to Mundesley. The coastal line, although highly picturesque, carried little traffic and its closure made sound economic sense to British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{also made}} {{a variety of other}} {{contributions}} in economic history, as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of modernity and <b>rationalisation</b> significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.|$|E
5|$|In this programme, by {{presidential decree}} Sudirman {{was no longer}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the military starting on 2January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma {{was intended to be}} commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, Mohammad Hatta, worked to implement the <b>rationalisation</b> programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as a rallying point and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{fundamental}} {{reforms to}} South African education, large performance gaps still prevail between former black schools and former white schools. Nineteen years into a democracy and education in post-apartheid South Africa still retains a strong racial dimension between poorer communities and more affluent communities. Differential access {{to power and}} privilege in post-apartheid South Africa is the logical consequence of a racialised society, and the latter constitutes {{the context in which}} pre-service students have to make sense of their racialised subjectivities that ultimately affect their decisions and active agency to bringing about a less polarised society. In this paper, Bonilla-Silva's structural theory of racism is used as a theoretical lens to unpack the <b>rationalisations</b> used by four white pre-service teachers to make sense of race and their own racial identities. By claiming that they were not part of apartheid, the participants use various <b>rationalisations</b> to provide them with information to maintain a belief in white innocence in racism and to disengage them from structural racism...|$|R

5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a joint-venture agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from <b>rationalisation</b> and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the <b>rationalisation</b> known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{extensions}} of the Piccadilly line to Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters followed in 1933. On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield and Pick instigated a <b>rationalisation</b> of services. The barely used and loss-making Brill and Verney Junction branches beyond Aylesbury were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of government-backed loans to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Ashfield and Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the New Works Programme for 1935–1940, including {{the transfer of the}} Metropolitan line's Stanmore services to the Bakerloo line in 1939, the Northern line's Northern Heights project and extension of the Central line to Ongar and Denham.|$|E
