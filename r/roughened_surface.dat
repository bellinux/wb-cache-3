5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a <b>roughened</b> <b>surface</b> where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E

To {{understand}} the free <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> phenomena of polycrystalline metals, the <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> behaviors of {{three kinds of}} metal sheets were investigated under uniaxial tension.

In the in-situ observation of <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> for AZ 31 magnesium alloy, {{it seemed that the}} surface of each grain roughened independently and the roughness increases with increasing plastic strain. In contrast to A 5052 -O and SPFC, the anisotropy of free <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> was observed for AZ 31 magnesium alloy. Compared with planar anisotropy r ∆, the microscopic anisotropy of <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> is not related to r ∆. In AZ 31 magnesium alloy, the anisotropy of <b>surface</b> <b>roughening</b> arises and, instead of the r-value, another parameter is needed to evaluate the anisotropy of free <b>surface</b> <b>roughening...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} morphotropic phase {{transformation}} in vanadium dioxide (VO 2) nanobeams annealed in a high-pressure hydrogen gas, {{which leads to}} the stabilization of metallic phases. Structural analyses show that the annealed VO 2 nanobeams are hexagonal-close-packed structures with <b>roughened</b> <b>surfaces</b> at room temperature, unlike as-grown VO 2 nanobeams with the monoclinic structure and with clean surfaces. Quantitative chemical examination reveals that the hydrogen significantly reduces oxygen in the nanobeams with characteristic nonlinear reduction kinetics which depend on the annealing time. Surprisingly, the work function and the electrical resistance of the reduced nanobeams follow a similar trend to the compositional variation due mainly to the oxygen-deficiency-related defects formed at the <b>roughened</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The electronic transport characteristics indicate that the reduced nanobeams are metallic over a large range of temperatures (room temperature to 383 K).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Cardiovascular device-centered {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} {{hospital}} morbidity, mortality, and expense. Caused by opportunistic bacteria, this phenomenon is thought to arise because of a defect in neutrophil bacterial killing. We have shown that neutrophils that adhere to polystyrene remain viable, whereas neutrophils that adhere to the vascular biomaterials expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron undergo a rapid nonapoptotic death. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that surface topography is a determinant of the nonapoptotic death response of neutrophils to biomaterials. Methods: We took advantage of the ease with which a polystyrene surface can be manipulated to examine the effect of surface topography on neutrophil viability. Neutrophils were exposed to smooth or <b>roughened</b> polystyrene <b>surfaces</b> both in vivo and in vitro. Changes in cell membrane permeability and production of reactive oxygen species by individual cells were monitored with fluorescent dyes. Results: Host cells and isolated human neutrophils died rapidly after adhesion to roughened polystyrene. Neutrophils adherent to <b>roughened</b> <b>surfaces</b> produced more reactive oxygen intermediates than those adherent to smooth surfaces and were first to die. The cell death response precipitated by expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, Dacron, or the <b>roughened</b> <b>surfaces</b> was significantly reduced with treatment of the neutrophils with catalase, diphenylene iodonium, or the src kinase inhibitor PP 2 before adhesion. Conclusions: Neutrophil adhesion to roughened materials triggers rapid production of reactive oxygen species and precipitates a nonapoptotic cell death. Understanding the material properties that trigger these responses is essential to development of the next generation of implantable biomaterials. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 1082 - 90. ...|$|R
50|$|Surface {{condition}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the required deposit thickness and good field performance. For example, machined substrates alloyed with sulfur and/or lead are particularly vulnerable to a high degree of porosity, since these alloying constituents are catalytic poisons to the deposition process. Substrates with high roughness values require thicker deposits to provide adequate corrosion protection. This is primarily due to the formation of nodules on the <b>roughened</b> <b>surface</b> during the initial stages of deposition, resulting in microporosity of the ENP film.|$|E
