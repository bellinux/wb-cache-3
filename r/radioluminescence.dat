25|$|Radium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolRa and atomic number88. It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, {{also known as}} the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas (specifically the isotope radon-222). When radium decays, ionizing radiation is a product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause <b>radioluminescence.</b>|$|E

50|$|Tritium lumination {{is the use}} of gaseous tritium, a {{radioactive}} isotope of hydrogen, to create visible light. Tritium emits electrons through beta decay and, when they interact with a phosphor material, fluorescent light is created, a process called <b>radioluminescence.</b> As tritium illumination requires no electrical energy, it found wide use in applications such as emergency exit signs and illumination of wristwatches.

50|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} is not detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as Geiger counters {{must be used}} to indicate its presence and measure it. However, high intensities can cause emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in Cherenkov radiation and <b>radioluminescence.</b> Ionizing {{radiation is}} used {{in a wide variety}} of fields such as medicine, nuclear power, research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure aren't followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living tissue, and can result in mutation, radiation sickness, cancer, and death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radioluminescence</b> {{occurs when}} an {{incoming}} particle of ionizing radiation collides with an atom or molecule, exciting an orbital electron {{to a higher}} energy level. The particle usually comes from the radioactive decay of an atom of a radioisotope, an isotope of an element which is radioactive. The electron then returns to its ground energy level by emitting the extra energy as a photon of light. A chemical that releases light of a particular color when struck by ionizing radiation is called a phosphor. Radioluminescent light sources usually consist of a radioactive substance mixed with, or in proximity to, a phosphor.|$|E

5000|$|Yuri A. Barbanel (also Yuri A. Barbanel’, Yury Abramovich Barbanel) (8 April 1935 - 2 August 2016) was a {{distinguished}} Russian chemist born in 1935 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). [...] He obtained a Master of Science in chemistry from A. A. Zhdanov Leningrad State University, now Saint Petersburg State University, in 1958 and his Ph.D. in 1964 and his D.Sc. in 1991. Barbanel was a scientist in the fundamental radiochemistry {{branch of the}} V.G. Khlopin Radium Institute in St. Petersburg {{until his retirement in}} 2011. His research interests included optical spectra induced by <b>radioluminescence</b> and coordination chemistry of the actinides, and absorption spectra of the actinides in molten salts.|$|E
50|$|Since {{radioactivity}} {{was discovered}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, the main application of <b>radioluminescence</b> has been in radioluminescent paint, used on watch and compass dials, gunsights, aircraft flight instrument faces, and other instruments, to allow them to be seen in the dark. Radioluminescent paint consists of a mixture of a chemical containing a radioisotope with a radioluminescent chemical (phosphor). The continuous radioactive decay of the isotope's atoms releases radiation particles which strike the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to give off light. The constant bombardment by radioactive particles causes the chemical breakdown of many types of phosphor, so radioluminescent paints lose some of their luminosity over their working life.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of <b>radioluminescence</b> was in {{luminous}} paint containing radium, a natural radioisotope. Beginning in 1908, luminous paint containing a mixture of radium and copper-doped zinc sulfide was used to paint watch faces and instrument dials, giving a greenish glow. Phosphors containing copper-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) yield blue-green light; copper and manganese-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mn), yielding yellow-orange light, are also used. Radium-based luminescent paint is no longer used due to the radiation hazard posed to those manufacturing the dials. These phosphors are not suitable for use in layers thicker than 25 mg/cm2, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.|$|E
50|$|Radon is a colorless, odorless, and {{tasteless}} gas {{and therefore}} not detectable by human senses alone. At standard temperature and pressure, radon forms a monatomic gas with a density of 9.73 kg/m3, about 8 times {{the density of the}} Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217 kg/m3. Radon is one of the densest gases at room temperature and is the densest of the noble gases. Although colorless at standard temperature and pressure, when cooled below its freezing point of 202 K, radon emits a brilliant <b>radioluminescence</b> that turns from yellow to orange-red as the temperature lowers. Upon condensation, radon glows because of the intense radiation it produces. Radon is sparingly soluble in water, but more soluble than lighter noble gases. Radon is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water.|$|E

5000|$|In 1910, Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray {{isolated}} radon, determined its density, {{and determined}} {{that it was the}} heaviest known gas. They wrote that [...] "L'expression de l'émanation du radium est fort incommode", (the expression 'radium emanation' is very awkward) and suggested the new name niton (Nt) (from the Latin [...] "nitens" [...] meaning [...] "shining") to emphasize the <b>radioluminescence</b> property, and in 1912 it was accepted by the International Commission for Atomic Weights. In 1923, the International Committee for Chemical Elements and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chose among the names radon (Rn), thoron (Tn), and actinon (An). Later, when isotopes were numbered instead of named, the element took the name of the most stable isotope, radon, while Tn was renamed 220Rn and An was renamed 219Rn, which caused some confusion in the literature regarding the element's discovery as while Dorn had discovered radon the isotope, he had not been the first to discover radon the element. As late as the 1960s, the element was also referred to simply as emanation. The first synthesized compound of radon, radon fluoride, was obtained in 1962. Even today, the word radon may refer to either the element or its isotope 222Rn, with thoron remaining in use as a short name for 220Rn to stem this ambiguity.|$|E

However, current methods are limited to measuring average radiotracer uptake in large cell populations and, as a result, lack the ability to quantify cell-to-cell variations.

40|$|Remote {{detection}} of alpha emitters {{is achieved by}} measuring the secondary <b>radioluminescence</b> light (air fluorescence) that is induced by alpha particles when absorbed in air. A telescope was used to collect the <b>radioluminescence</b> photons to a photomultiplier tube, which is operated in the photon counting mode. Careful matching of photocathode response and filter passband allows the sensing of a faint <b>radioluminescence</b> emission in a brightly illuminated environment, which is essential for operative use. A minimum detectable alpha activity of 4 kBq was reached at 1 m distance in 10 s time, when ultraviolet-free lighting is present, and 800 kBq under bright fluorescent lighting.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{radiation}} dosimeter for large radiation doses is described, {{which is based on}} silica fibre material. Conventional <b>radioluminescence</b> or thermoluminescence of silica produces emission in the blue region of the spectrum.
