5|$|Luís Alves' grandfather, José Joaquim, was a Portuguese {{military}} {{officer who had}} emigrated in 1767 to Brazil. He settled {{in the city of}} <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro, capital of both the <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro captaincy and of Brazil. He had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in an environment in which advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections. Having fought against the Spaniards on Brazil's southern frontiers, he secured a place for himself in <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro's upper class when he married a member of a local and influential family.|$|E

5|$|A grand state funeral—not {{seen since}} the death of PedroII's sister Paula in 1833—was held for the Prince Imperial at 7p.m. three days after his death.

When the convent was {{demolished}} in 1911 his remains were moved to the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro, where other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza (including his younger brother Pedro, his uncle João and his aunt Paula) are also located.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} clear that there was to be no {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the <b>Río</b> <b>de</b> la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and <b>Río</b> <b>de</b> la Plata.

5|$|At the <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above <b>Rio</b> <b>de</b> Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E

5|$|Both the British and Spanish {{settlements}} coexisted in {{the archipelago}} until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily {{withdraw from the}} islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's Viceroyalty of the <b>Río</b> <b>de</b> la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the British invasions of the <b>Río</b> <b>de</b> la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily.|$|E
