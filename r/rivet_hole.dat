The weather was very cold that day, with snow blanketing the fields and very low freezing temperatures, another factor that hastened the tyre failure. The Railway Inspectorate recommended that the railway companies adopt Mansell wheels, a type of wooden composite wheel, as the design had a better safety record than the alternatives. There had been a long history of failed wheels involved in serious accidents, especially in the previous decade. The problem of broken wheels was not resolved until cast steel monobloc wheels were introduced.|$|E

Limpet shells have also been found near the bones. Archaeologists found iron objects, adding further credibility {{to the idea that}} this fort is from the Iron Age. These objects include a chisel or borer, several spearheads and javelin heads, and an iron cone with charred wood inside and a <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> through the cone. Dymond assumes that this cone was once a plowshare. Stone artefacts, mainly slingstones and scrapers, have been discovered at the site. Just less than 36 flint chips have been found, of which some may be arrowheads. One good-quality arrowhead has been found. In addition to these, Dymond recorded finding a lead lump {{about the size of a}} walnut that he decided was probably a sling bullet. Glastonbury type bead-rim pottery was also found at this site. A socketed bronze axe from the late Bronze Age, which was found at Worlebury Hill in 1883, is in the Ashmolean Museum.|$|E

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{which followed}} {{was led by}} William Yolland and established the root causes very quickly. The tyre was on an old carriage, and was of an obsolete design. The fracture started at a <b>rivet</b> <b>hole,</b> possibly by metal fatigue, {{although it was not}} recognised as such by the inquiry. The weather was very cold that day, with snow blanketing the fields and very low freezing temperatures, another factor which hastened the tyre failure. The disaster led to a re-appraisal of braking methods and systems, and eventual adoption of continuous automatic brakes being fitted to trains, based either on the Westinghouse air brake or a vacuum brake. The Railway Inspectorate recommended Mansell wheels, a type of wooden composite wheel, be adopted by the railway companies since the design had a better safety record than the alternatives. There had been a long history of failed wheels involved in serious accidents, especially in the previous decade. They were also critical of the communication method between the locomotive {{and the rest of the}} train using an external cord and gong, suggesting that a telegraphic method be adopted instead.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of riveted structures requires a local–global approach in modelling.

40|$|In this article, {{ultrasonic}} {{guided wave}} propagation and {{interaction with the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> cracks has been formulated using closed-form analytical solution while the local damage interaction, scattering, and mode conversion have been obtained from finite element analysis. The <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> cracks (damage) in the plate structure {{gives rise to the}} non-axisymmetric scattering of Lamb wave, as well as shear horizontal (SH) wave, although the incident Lamb wave source (primary source) is axisymmetric. The damage in the plate acts as a non-axisymmetric secondary source of Lamb wave and SH wave. The scattering of Lamb and SH waves are captured using wave damage interaction coefficient (WDIC). The scatter cubes of complex-valued WDIC are formed that can describe the 3 D interaction (frequency, incident direction, and azimuth direction) of Lamb waves with the damage. The scatter cubes are fed into the exact analytical framework to produce the time domain signal. This analysis enables us to obtain the optimum design parameters for better detection of the cracks in a multiple-rivet-hole problem. The optimum parameters provide the guideline of the design of the sensor installation to obtain the most noticeable signals that represent the presence of cracks in the <b>rivet</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|E

The super element accurately models the crack and <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> of the skin while the regular finite element method provides the versatility {{to take into account the}} variety of doubler designs.

40|$|TAP/NDE (Thermo-Acousto-Photonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation) {{has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it is possible to confidently explore many different application areas. One area of interest is the inspection of defects around rivet holes and under rivet heads. This problem is of concern not only from a safety point of view in aging aircraft, but also has major economic implications. For example, a heavy “C” check for a Boeing 707 requires the physical removal, inspection and replacement of many thousands of structural fasteners. Of the various types of rivets the round head <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> was chosen for this preliminary analysis (Fig. 1). Since it is not known how Lamb waves interact with an in situ rivet, we have chosen to restrict this analysis to the simplest possible case where there is no rivet in the hole. This corresponds to the current practice of removing the rivet and then using eddy current probes to inspect the hole. Our goal is to develop an inspection technique that does not require the physical removal of the rivet. The buried in-plane defect study was undertaken to provide real time, on-line detection of flaws during the processing of the material to prevent these flaws from causing in-service, premature <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> degradation. This inspection would prevent flawed materials from entering service...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of static properties of combined rivet and adhesive bonded joints {{have been proven}} by several authors [1, 2]. On the other side, dynamic properties of joints (for example fatigue and corrosion) significantly affect final function of structures during their service life. In this thesis, the combine joints created by blind rivets and hyper elastic sealant are solved. Complex description of dynamic properties of this particular combined joining technology has not been publicised, yet. Description of sealant layer influence on stress concentration in <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> regions {{is one of the}} main goal of this work. The next stage of the thesis is focused on the influence of above mentioned sealant layer on fatigue properties of combined blind rivet and solid countersunk rivet joints. Stress strain analysis of rivet and combined joints done by FE analysis and by experimental optical measurement of strain field proved that hyper elastic sealant layer has a positive effect on decreasing of stress peaks in <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> regions. This findings are in direct compliance with fatigue measurement of combined joint (AAPL). The influence of applied sealant in this combined joints improved fatigue properties by twenty percentage increasing of stress to failure in comparison with rivet joints...|$|E

40|$|Aging {{aircraft}} {{may develop}} multiple-site damage (MSD) that {{can reduce the}} structural integrity of fuselage structures. The existence of small cracks emanating from adjacent <b>rivet</b> <b>holes</b> in a fuselage lap-splice joint is of major concern. Small collinear cracks greatly reduce the residual strength of a panel with a lead crack. Recent studies predicting the residual strength of flat and curvilinear panels with riveted lap-splice joints gave encouraging results but some difficulties arose in modeling small cracks at rivet-loaded holes. Thus, {{there was a need}} to conduct detailed fracture analyses of the crack-linkup phenomenon in lap-splice joints with rivet-loaded fasteners.

In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model has been developed in order to simulate the riveting process on composite plates. The finite element model is based on continuum elements and accounts for some important mechanisms involved in a whole riveting process. The stresses around the <b>rivet</b> <b>hole</b> and the deformed shapes of the rivet are presented together with the effects of the interference fit and the geometry of the washer when the rivet joints are subjected to the compressive load.
