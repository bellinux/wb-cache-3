40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} margin preparation design and resin-composite type on microleakage with or without re-application of surface-penetrating sealant. METHODS: Class-I resin-composite restorations were completed for 128 extracted human molars. Half of the margins were beveled, the other half, butt-joint. Half of each group was restored with Filtek-Supreme (FS), the other half with Esthet-X (EX) using their respective adhesive systems. Margins were etched and sealed with a surface-penetrating sealant, Fortify. The samples were stored in water 24 h, and thermocycled (5, 000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C). Then, samples were abraded using a toothbrush machine (6, 000 strokes). Half of the restorations from each sealant group (n= 16) were <b>resealed,</b> {{and the other half}} had no further treatment. Thermocycling and tooth brushing were repeated. The samples were sealed with nail polish, immersed in methylene-blue for 8 h, sectioned, and magnified digital photographs were taken. Three examiners assessed dye penetration. A 2 × 2 × 2 multi-layered Chi-Square analysis, using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was conducted for statistical analysis. RESULTS: No difference was observed between sealed and <b>resealed</b> FS and EX restorations with butt-joint margins. In beveled margins, <b>resealing</b> caused significantly less microleakage (P 3 ̆c. 01). No differences were found between restorations either sealed or <b>resealed</b> with bevel margins. In butt-joint margins, at the leakage level deeper than 2 / 3 of the preparation depth, <b>resealed</b> FS showed less microleakage than EX <b>resealed</b> restorations (P 3 ̆c. 01). CONCLUSION: <b>Resealing</b> reduced microleakage in bevel margins, however, in butt-joint margins <b>resealing</b> did not affect the leakage. A significant statistical relationship exists between and within <b>resealing,</b> margin preparation design, type of composite, and microleakage...|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that the requirement for Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis in cell-membrane repair is to provide an adequate lowering of membrane tension to permit membrane <b>resealing.</b> We used laser tweezers to form membrane tethers and measured the force of those tethers to estimate the membrane tension of Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts after membrane disruption and during <b>resealing.</b> These measurements show that, for fibroblasts wounded in normal Ca 2 + Ringer's solution, the membrane tension decreased dramatically after the wounding and <b>resealing</b> coincided with a decrease of ∼ 60 % of control tether force values. However, the tension did not decrease if cells were wounded in a low Ca 2 + Ringer's solution that inhibited both membrane <b>resealing</b> and exocytosis. When cells were wounded twice in normal Ca 2 + Ringer's solution, decreases in tension at the second wound were 2. 3 times faster than at the first wound, correlating well with twofold faster <b>resealing</b> rates for repeated wounds. The facilitated <b>resealing</b> to a second wound requires a new vesicle pool, which is generated via a protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent and brefeldin A (BFA) -sensitive process. Tension decrease at the second wound was slowed or inhibited by PKC inhibitor or BFA.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we report}} {{the results of}} a {{systematic}} attempt to relate the intrinsic plasma membrane fluidity of three different cell lines to their electroporation behaviour, which consists of reversible and irreversible electroporation. Apart from electroporation behaviour of given cell lines the time course required for membrane <b>resealing</b> was determined in order to distinguish the effect of <b>resealing</b> time from the cell’s ability to survive given electric pulse parameters. Reversible, irreversible electroporation and membrane <b>resealing</b> were then related to cell membrane fluidity as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and computer characterization of membrane domains. We found that cell membrane fluidity does not have significant effect on reversible electroporation although there is a tendency for the voltage required for reversible electroporation to increase with increased membrane fluidity. Cell membrane fluidity, however, may affect irreversible electroporation. Nevertheless, this effect, if present, is masked with different time courses of membrane <b>resealing</b> found for the different cell lines studied. The time course of cell membrane <b>resealing</b> itself could be related to the cell’s ability to survive...|$|R

In this paper we standardize a method to construction a <b>resealed</b> ghost cell–alkaline phosphatase system to mimic matrix vesicles and examine the kinetic behavior of the incorporated enzyme. Polidocanol-solubilized alkaline phosphatase, free of detergent, was incorporated into <b>resealed</b> ghost cells. This process was time-dependent and practically 50 % of the enzyme was incorporated into the vesicles in 40 h of incubation, at 25 °C. Alkaline phosphatase–ghost cell systems were relatively homogeneous with diameters of about 300 nm and were more stable when stored at − 20 °C. Alkaline phosphatase was completely released from the <b>resealed</b> ghost cell-system using only phospholipase C. These experiments confirm that the interaction between alkaline phosphatase and the lipid bilayer of <b>resealed</b> ghost cell is exclusively via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the enzyme. An important point shown is that an enzyme bound to <b>resealed</b> ghost cell does not lose the ability to hydrolyze ATP, pyrophosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), but the presence of a ghost membrane, as a support of the enzyme, affects its kinetic properties. Moreover, calcium ions stimulate and phosphate ions inhibit the PNPPase activity of alkaline phosphatase present in <b>resealed</b> ghost cells...|$|R

The functions of nonmuscle myosin IIA and IIB in this exocytotic process of membrane repair were studied by the antisense technique. Knockdown of myosin IIB suppressed wound-induced exocytosis and the membrane <b>resealing</b> process. Knockdown of myosin IIA did not suppress exocytosis at an initial wound and had no inhibitory effect on the <b>resealing</b> at initial wounds but did inhibit the facilitated rate of <b>resealing</b> normally found at repeated wounds made at the same site. COS- 7 cells, which lack myosin IIA, did not show the facilitated response of membrane <b>resealing</b> to a repeated wound. S 91 melanoma cells, a mutant cell line lacking myosin Va, showed normal membrane <b>resealing</b> and normal facilitated responses. We concluded that myosin IIB was required for exocytosis and therefore cell membrane repair itself and that myosin IIA was required in facilitation of cell membrane repair at repeated wounds. Myosin IIB was primarily at the subplasmalemma cortex and myosin IIA was concentrated at the trans-Golgi network consistent with their distinct roles in vesicle trafficking in cell membrane repair...|$|R

40|$|Using {{confocal}} microscopy, we visualized exocytosis during membrane <b>resealing</b> in {{sea urchin}} eggs and embryos. Upon wounding by a laser beam, both eggs and embryos showed a rapid burst of localized Ca(2 +) - regulated exocytosis. The rate of exocytosis was correlated quantitatively with successfully <b>resealing.</b> In embryos, whose activated surfaces must first dock vesicles before fusion, exocytosis and membrane <b>resealing</b> were inhibited by neurotoxins that selectively cleave the SNARE complex proteins, synaptobrevin, SNAP- 25, and syntaxin. In eggs, whose cortical vesicles are already docked, vesicles could be reversibly undocked with externally applied stachyose. If cortical vesicles were undocked both exocytosis and plasma membrane <b>resealing</b> were completely inhibited. When cortical vesicles were transiently undocked, exposure to tetanus toxin and botulinum neurotoxin type C 1 rendered them no longer competent for <b>resealing,</b> although botulinum neurotoxin type A was still ineffective. Cortical vesicles transiently undocked {{in the presence}} of tetanus toxin were subsequently fusion incompetent although to a large extent they retained their ability to redock when stachyose was diluted. We conclude that addition of internal membranes by exocytosis is required and that a SNARE-like complex plays differential roles in vesicle docking and fusion for the repair of disrupted plasma membrane...|$|R
