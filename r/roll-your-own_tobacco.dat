40|$|Quantifying {{the market}} size for {{cannabis}} is important given vigorous policy debates {{about how to}} intervene in this market. We develop {{a new approach to}} measuring the size of the cannabis market using forensic economics. The key insight is that cannabis consumption often requires the use of complementary legal inputs: <b>roll-your-own</b> <b>tobacco</b> and rolling papers. The forensic approach specifies how legal and illegal inputs are combined in the production of hand-rolled cigarettes and cannabis joints. These input relationships, along with market adding-up conditions, can then be used to infer the size of the cannabis market. We prove proof-of-concept that this approach can be readily calibrated using: (i) point-of-sales data on the legal inputs of <b>roll-your-own</b> <b>tobacco</b> and rolling papers; (ii) input parameter estimates drawn from a wide-ranging interdisciplinary evidence base. We then implement the approach using data from 2008 - 9. For those years, the forensic estimates for the UK cannabis market are near double those derived from standard demand-side approaches. We make precise what drives the measurement gap between methods by establishing: (i) the parameter adjustments needed in demand-side approaches to match the forensic measure; (ii) the changes in methodology to the forensic approach needed to match the demand-side estimate.

40|$|Introduction. Nicotine {{electronic}} cigarettes (NECs) {{are becoming increasingly}} popular as a potentially safer alternative to tobacco but little is known regarding their subjective effects, including possible gender differences. Method. Participants were New Zealand smokers with no intention to quit (N= 357) and whom had never used an NEC. During an interview in November-December 2012, participants sampled an NEC and rated it and their own-brand tobacco for satisfaction on a 10 -point visual analogue scale. Participants were contacted again in February-March 2013 after a 10 % increase in the tobacco excise tax on 1 January 2013. Results. Overall participants rated NECs 83. 3 % as satisfying as own-brand tobacco. Females rated NECs more highly than males. Of those who agreed to be re-interviewed (n= 227), 37. 8 % said they had cut back or made a change in their smoking habit and 7 % had quit in February-March 2013. NEC satisfaction ratings predicted changes in smoking habit and reductions in nicotine dependence after controlling for covariates including demographic variables, factory-made vs. <b>roll-your-own</b> <b>tobacco</b> preference, and addiction scores. Conclusion. Smokers' first impressions of NECs were very favourable, and were correlated with readiness to change after a tobacco tax increase.

40|$|Background: Since the {{implementation}} of the 2002 Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act, point-of-sale (PoS) tobacco displays are one of few remaining means of communication between the tobacco industry and customers in the UK. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of tobacco displays in a UK city, and particularly to assess the tobacco prices and promotional offers, types and pack sizes on display. Methods: Digital pictures of PoS displays were taken in 117 small retail shops in Nottingham in mid 2010. Data were analysed using Windows Photo Gallery software and SPSS version 16. Results: Just over half (52 %) of cigarette packs on display were packs of 20, and 43 % packs of 10. Cigarette prices differed substantially between brands, ranging from £ 4. 19 to £ 6. 85 for 20 -packs, and from £ 2. 12 to £ 3. 59 for 10 -packs. Forty four percent of cigarette packs and 40 % of RYO (<b>Roll-Your-Own)</b> <b>tobacco</b> pouches, almost exclusively lower priced brands, were displayed with a pricemark, implying a promotional price offer.

Cigarettes were prepared using commercial tubes, and were smoked under smoking conditions based on the ISO 3308. The gaseous and condensed fractions of the smoke from RYO brands and 3 R 4 F have been analyzed and compared. RYO tobaccos, as opposed to 3 R 4 F, present lower amounts of condensed products in the traps than in the filters. In general, RYO tobaccos also provide lower yields {{of most of the}} compounds detected in the gas fraction. The yield of CO is between 15. 4 and 20. 4 mg/cigarette. In most of the cases studied, RYO tobaccos deliver higher amounts of nicotine than the 3 R 4 F tobacco. On average, the yield of the different chemical families of compounds appearing in the particulate matter retained in the cigarette filters tends to be around three times higher than those obtained from 3 R 4 F, whereas similar values have been obtained in the particulate matter retained in the traps located after the filters. It can be concluded that RYO tobaccos are not less hazardous than the reference tobacco, which may be contrary to popular belief...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground Although <b>roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco</b> often elicits {{negative}} {{connotations of}} a lower class product, uptake and use by young adult smokers has grown because RYO is more cost-effective than tailor-made (TM) cigarettes. We explored the practices and beliefs young adults develop {{to distance themselves from}} unattractive stereotypes of RYO smokers. Methods We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with New Zealand young adult RYO users aged between 18 and 30  years, and used thematic analysis to interpret the transcripts. Results We identified three themes: establishing the superiority of RYO tobacco; creating and enacting usage rituals, and ritual disruption. Participants regarded RYO tobacco as more natural and better-tasting; they used it to control their tobacco use and facilitate interactions with others. Many described rolling rituals where they used specific artefacts and microbehaviours to construct cigarettes they saw as personal and artisanal. Several, though not all, disliked unattractively coloured papers as these disrupted the value their rituals created. Conclusions Young adults imbue RYO tobacco with positive attributes, many of which centre on rolling rituals or draw on widely held misperceptions of RYO tobacco as less harmful. Excise tax increases could counter perceptions of RYO as more cost-effective while mandating that dissuasively coloured paper could disrupt reduced-harm connotations. However, evidence that erroneous harm beliefs are widespread and entrenched may justify restricting or eliminating the key artefact—the product itself...|$|R
40|$|Combustible and {{smokeless}} tobacco use causes adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and multiple {{types of cancer}} (1, 2). Standard approaches for measuring tobacco use include self-reported surveys of use and consumption estimates based on tobacco excise tax data (3, 4). To provide the most recently available tobacco consumption estimates in the United States, CDC used federal excise tax data to estimate total and per capita consumption during 2000 - 2015 for combustible tobacco (cigarettes, <b>roll-your-own</b> <b>tobacco,</b> pipe tobacco, small cigars, and large cigars) and {{smokeless tobacco}} (chewing tobacco and dry snuff). During this period, total combustible tobacco consumption decreased 33. 5 %, or 43. 7 % per capita. Although total cigarette consumption decreased 38. 7 %, cigarettes remained {{the most commonly used}} combustible tobacco product. Total noncigarette combustible tobacco (i. e., cigars, roll-your-own, and pipe tobacco) consumption increased 117. 1 %, or 83. 8 % per capita during 2000 - 2015. Total consumption of smokeless tobacco increased 23. 1 %, or 4. 2 % per capita. Notably, total cigarette consumption was 267. 0 billion cigarettes in 2015 compared with 262. 7 billion in 2014. These findings indicate that although cigarette smoking declined overall during 2000 - 2015, and each year from 2000 to 2014, the number of cigarettes consumed in 2015 was higher than in 2014, and the first time annual cigarette consumption was higher than the previous year since 1973.

Researchers from New Zealand have modelled the implications of regular increases in tobacco taxation in the tobacco endgame. 2 The researchers contend that regulator increases in tobacco taxation can play an important role in tobacco control in New Zealand. However, a wider range of strategies will be needed to meet the smoke free goal of less than 5 % prevalence by 2025.

40|$|Background Price-based {{mechanisms}} {{are an important}} tobacco cessation policy tool in New Zealand (NZ) and so measurement of smokers’ reaction to price changes is crucial in determining efficacy of this approach. Although approximately two-thirds of NZ tobacco demand is for manufactured cigarettes (MC) and one-third is for <b>Roll-Your-Own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco,</b> previous price elasticity estimates have ignored differences between RYO tobacco and MC consumers. Methods We employ a seemingly unrelated regression econometric approach applied to quarterly data over the period 1991 – 2011 to estimate price elasticities of demand separately for MC and RYO tobacco. Results Estimate of price elasticity of demand for MC is − 1. 033, and − 0. 441 for RYO tobacco. RYO tobacco is an inferior good; a 1 % increase in average weekly income {{is associated with a}} 0. 8 % reduction in demand. RYO tobacco is a substitute for MC; a 1 % increase in the price of MC is associated with a 0. 867 % increase in demand for RYO tobacco. Conclusions There is significantly different price responsiveness across the two tobacco product types. MC smokers react far more strongly to price increases compared with RYO tobacco smokers. These findings suggest that pricing mechanisms may be more effective for reducing MC demand than for RYO tobacco. However, substitution between products means that this pricing effect is muted by the uptake of RYO tobacco use.

Manufacturers and retailers were given a 12 -month transition period.   Methods: An observational study was conducted using monthly Electronic Point of Sale data from 500 small retailers in England, Scotland, and Wales, between May 2016 and May 2017. The 20 top selling tobacco products (15 FMC, 5 RYO) were monitored to observe when standardised packs were first introduced, the proportion of retailers selling each fully branded and standardised product, and the average number of monitored fully branded and standardised products sold by each retailer. The number of unique tobacco-related product codes sold by each retailer was also recorded each month.   Results: Eighteen of the fully branded products continued to be sold throughout the transition period and no standardised variants were sold in the first five months. It was not until month eleven that the average number of standardised products sold by retailers exceeded the fully branded products. The average number of unique tobacco-related product codes sold by each retailer decreased by a third over the transition period.   Conclusions: Tobacco companies used the transition period to delay the removal of fully branded products and gradually introduce standardised variants.

40|$|Introduction Raising tobacco {{prices is}} the most {{effective}} population-level intervention for reducing smoking, but this is undermined by the availability of cheap tobacco. This study monitors trends in cheap tobacco use among adult smokers in the UK between 2002 - 2014 via changes in product type, purchase source, and prices paid. Methods Weighted data from 10 waves of the International Tobacco Control policy evaluation study were used. This is a longitudinal cohort study of adult smokers with replenishment; 6169 participants provided 15812 responses. Analyses contrasted 1) product type: <b>roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco,</b> factory made packs (FM-P), and cartons (FM-C); 2) purchase source: UK store-based sources (e. g. supermarkets, convenience stores) with non-UK/ non-store sources representing tax avoidance/ evasion (e. g. outside the UK, duty free, informal sellers); and 3) prices paid (inflation-adjusted to 2014 values). Generalised Estimating Equations tested linear changes over time. Results 1) RYO use increased significantly over time as FM decreased. 2) UK store-based sources constituted approximately 80 % of purchases over time, with no significant increases in tax avoidance/ evasion. 3) Median RYO prices were less than half that of FM, with FM-C cheaper than FM-P. Non-UK/ non-store sources were cheapest. Price increases of all three product types from UK store-based sources from 2002 - 2014 were statistically significant, but not substantial. Wide (and increasing for FM-P) price ranges meant each product type could be purchased in 2014 at prices below their 2002 medians from UK store-based sources.

40|$|Excise {{duties on}} <b>roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco,</b> which are {{generally}} based on RYO cigarettes containing 1 g of tobacco, {{are lower than}} duties on factory-made (FM) cigarettes. This provides a price incentive for smokers to switch to RYO, the use of which is increasing across Europe. To effectively approximate duties on {{the two types of}} products, accurate data on the weight of RYO cigarettes are required. We provide updated information on RYO use and RYO cigarette weight across Europe. From a representative face-to-face survey conducted in 2010 in 18 European countries (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden), we considered data from 5158 current smokers aged 15 years or above, with available information on daily consumption of FM and RYO cigarettes separately. In Europe, 10. 4 % of current smokers (12. 9 % of men and 7. 5 % of women) were 'predominant' RYO users (i. e. > 50 % of cigarettes smoked). This proportion was highest in England (27. 3 %), France (16. 5 %) and Finland (13. 6 %). The median weight of one RYO cigarette is 0. 75 g (based on 192 smokers consuming exclusively RYO cigarettes). The proportion of RYO smokers is substantial in several European countries. Our finding on the weight of RYO cigarettes is consistent with the scientific literature and industry documents showing that the weight of RYO cigarettes is substantially lower than that of FM ones. Basing excise duties on RYO on an average cigarette weight of 0. 75 g rather than 1 g would help increase the excise levels to those on FM cigarettes...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To examine if {{exclusive}} <b>Roll-Your-Own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco</b> use {{relative to}} factory-made (FM) cigarette use {{has been rising}} over time, {{to determine the extent}} to which economic motives and perceptions that RYO cigarettes are less harmful act as primary motivations for use, and to examine the association of income and education with the level of RYO tobacco use among smokers in four European countries. Methods Data were obtained from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Europe Surveys, and a cohort sample of 7070 smokers from the Netherlands, Germany, France and UK were interviewed between June 2006 and December 2012. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) were used to assess trends in RYO use, and whether RYO consumption varied by socioeconomic variables. Results Exclusive RYO use over the study period has increased significantly in the UK from 26. 4 % in 2007 to 32. 7 % in 2010 (p< 0. 001); France from 12. 2 % in 2006 to 19. 1 % in 2012 (p< 0. 001); and Germany from 12. 7 % in 2007 to 18. 6 % in 2011 (p= 0. 031), with increased borderline significantly in the Netherlands (31. 7 % to 34. 3 %, p= 0. 052), from 2008 to 2010. Over three-quarters of users in each of the study countries indicated that lower price was a reason why they smoked RYO. Just over a fourth of smokers in the UK, less than a fifth in France, and around a tenth in Germany and the Netherlands believed that RYO is healthier. Compared with exclusive FM users, exclusive RYO users were more likely to have lower incomes and lower education.

40|$|Enhanced {{tobacco control}} {{policies}} and programmes {{are an important}} component of any strategic approach to improving population health and tackling health inequalities. The consultation on standardised packaging of tobacco products in the UK is particularly timely in view of the recent publication of the Ten Year Tobacco Strategy for Northern Ireland (DHSSPS, 2012). In this strategy the Department expressed its support for the introduction of further measures to reduce the influence of tobacco advertising and promotion upon children e. g. the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes and hand rolling tobacco.  IPH key points •    The extent of tobacco-related harm across the island of Ireland and across the UK is unacceptable. Increasingly comprehensive and effective tobacco-control interventions are required. •    IPH recommends the adoption of option 2 : require standardised packaging of tobacco products. •    IPH acknowledges that as plain packaging has not yet been introduced in any country, it is not possible at this time to accurately forecast the extent and nature of this intervention on population level health outcomes in the UK context. •    The proposed approach appears comprehensive in addressing the direct and indirect ways in which elements of tobacco packaging can promote brand appeal and can portray impressions in respect of tobacco-related harm. Consideration should be given to include specific provisions relating to <b>roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco</b> packaging. Any approach needs to be regularly reviewed to take into account attempts to bypass restrictions and evaluate responses in respect of consumer choices. •    IPH considers that the introduction of plain packaging has the potential to support the achievement of the goals set out in the Ten Year Tobacco Control Strategy for Northern Ireland (DHSSPS, 2012). •    Among children in Northern Ireland who reported trying their first cigarette, around one quarter were aged 11 or under and three quarters were 14 or under when they did so (DHSSPS, 2012).   The very young age of these children is concerning on many levels including their susceptibility to sophisticated branding and marketing techniques linked to tobacco packaging...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how socio-economic status (SES) modifies how smokers adjust {{to changes in}} the price of tobacco products through utilization of multiple price minimizing techniques. Data come from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Four Country Survey, nationally representative samples of adult smokers and includes respondents from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Cross-sectional analyses were completed among 8, 243 respondents (7, 038 current smokers) from the survey wave conducted between October 2006 and February 2007. Analyses examined predictors of purchasing from low/untaxed sources, using discount cigarettes or <b>roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco,</b> purchasing cigarettes in cartons, and engaging in high levels of price and tax avoidance at last purchase. All analyses tested for interactions with SES and were weighted to account for changing and under-represented demographics. Relatively high levels of price and tax avoidance behaviors were present; 8 % reported buying from low or untaxed source; 36 % used discount or generic brands, 13. 5 % used RYO tobacco, 29 % reported purchasing cartons, and 63 % reported using {{at least one of these}} high price avoidance behaviors. Respondents categorized as having low SES were approximately 26 % less likely to report using low or untaxed sources and 43 % less likely to purchase tobacco by the carton. However, respondents with low SES were 85 % more likely to report using discount brands/RYO compared to participants with higher SES. Overall, lower SES smokers were 25 % more likely to engage in at least one or more tax avoidance behaviors compared to their higher SES counterparts. Price and tax avoidance behaviors are relatively common among smokers of all SES strata, but strategies differed with higher SES groups more likely to report traveling to a low-tax location to avoid paying higher prices, purchase duty free tobacco, and purchase by cartons instead of packs all of which were less commonly reported by low SES smokers. Because of the strategies lower SES respondents are more likely to use, reducing price differentials between discount and premium brands may have a greater impact on them, potentially increasing the likelihood of quitting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many smokers {{believe that}} "light" {{cigarettes}} are less harmful than regular cigarettes, {{which is at}} variance with the scientific evidence. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) aims {{to address this problem}} in Article 11 which deals with misleading labelling of tobacco products. In this study we aimed to determine smokers' use and beliefs concerning "light" and "mild" cigarettes ("lights"), including in relation to ethnicity, deprivation and other socio-demographic characteristics. Methods The New Zealand (NZ) arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC Project) uses as its sampling frame the NZ Health Survey. This is a national sample with boosted sampling of Maori, Pacific peoples and Asians. From this sample we surveyed adult smokers (n = 1376) about use and beliefs relating to "light" cigarettes. We assessed the associations with smoking "lights" after adjusting for socio-demographic variables, and smoking-related behaviours and beliefs. Results Many smokers of "lights" believed that smoking "lights" made it easier to quit smoking (25 %), that "lights" are less harmful (42 %), and that smokers of "lights" take in less tar (43 %). Overall most "lights" smokers (60 %) had {{at least one of these}} three beliefs, a proportion significantly higher than for smokers of "regular" cigarettes at 45 % (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1. 96, 95 % CI = 1. 29 – 2. 96). While "lights" smokers had significantly lower tobacco consumption and were more aware of smoking harms, they were no more likely to be intending to quit or have made a previous quit attempt. By ethnicity, both Maori and Pacific people were less likely to smoke "lights" than Europeans (aOR = 0. 53, 95 % CI = 0. 35 – 0. 80 and aOR = 0. 14, 95 % CI = 0. 05 – 0. 40 respectively). In contrast there was no significant difference by level of deprivation. <b>Roll-your-own</b> (RYO) <b>tobacco</b> smokers were less likely to smoke "light" forms of RYO tobacco while both older and women smokers were more likely to smoke "lights". Conclusion Most "lights" smokers have one or more misperceptions about the product they use, and were no more likely to intend to quit or to have made a quit attempt. In response to such misperceptions, governments could act further to eliminate all misleading tobacco marketing. Ideally, they could not only adopt FCTC requirements, but go further by requiring plain packaging for all tobacco products. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the prevalence of}} use of six alternative tobacco products [ATPs] among Canadian students in grades 9 and 10, identified between-school variability in the current use of each ATP, and identified the school- and student-level characteristics {{associated with the use}} of each ATP. Methods: This cross-sectional study used nationally representative student data collected from 14, 916 students in grades 9 and 10 from 134 secondary schools as part of the 2010 - 11 Youth Smoking Survey and data from the 2010 - 11 Enhanced Points of Interest data file. Multilevel regression analyses examined the association between school- and student-level characteristics and the use of each ATP. Results: Among Canadian students in grades 9 and 10, 15. 4 % reported currently using a tobacco product. Cigarillos or little cigars were the most prevalent product (6. 3 %) and bidis were the least prevalence product (0. 6 %). School-level differences accounted for between 14. 1 % and 31. 2 % of the variability in use. Grades 9 and 10 students who attended schools with a high rate of senior students that smoked manufactured cigarettes were significantly more likely to currently use cigarillos or little cigars (AOR 1. 79, 95 %CI 1. 21 to 2. 65) and roll-your-own cigarettes (AOR 1. 88, 95 %CI 1. 15 to 3. 07). Grades 9 and 10 students who reported having ever used flavoured tobacco products were significantly more likely to currently use cigarillos or little cigars, cigars, <b>roll-your-own</b> cigarettes, smokeless <b>tobacco,</b> and a hookah (AOR range 1. 87 to 18. 40). Finally, grades 9 and 10 students who reported currently using alcohol (AOR range 1. 99 to 3. 06) or marijuana (AOR range 2. 09 to 3. 47) were significantly more likely to currently use cigarillos or little cigars, cigars, and a hookah. Conclusions: Many students reported currently using one or more ATPs, and these data illustrate that there is a population of students who are not represented in current smoking prevalence estimates. The school environment continues to play an important role in tobacco control as the rate of tobacco use among senior students affects the use of ATPs by younger students. Future tobacco control strategies need to be inclusive of all tobacco products...|$|R
