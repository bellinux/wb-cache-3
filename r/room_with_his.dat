5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E

5|$|The {{most violent}} and {{controversial}} pre-Code gangster film was undoubtedly Scarface (1932). Directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, {{the film is}} based on the life of Al Capone. When the film begins, Camonte works for Johnny Lovo but is unhappy being a subordinate, and is attracted to Lovo's girlfriend Poppy. He has a deep love for his promiscuous sister, who he expects to remain chaste, which has often been deemed incestuous. Lovo warns Camonte to leave the North Side alone as it is controlled by a rival mob. Camonte ignores this warning and begins a series of executions and extortions that result in a war with the North side gang. Camonte then takes the gang over from Lovo, at which point Lovo tries to kill him but fails. Camonte murders Lovo and Poppy becomes his girl. When Camonte finds his missing sister in a hotel <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> closest friend, the coin flipping gangster Guino Rinaldo (played by George Raft), he goes into a rage and kills Rinaldo. After he finds out that they had become married and wanted to surprise Camonte he becomes despondent. The film ends with first Camonte sister then Camonte being gunned down by police at his home.|$|E

25|$|Pearson {{graduated}} from Hamilton Collegiate Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1913 {{at the age}} of 16. Later that same year, he entered Victoria College at the University of Toronto, where he lived in residence in Gate House and shared a <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother Duke. He was later elected to the Pi Gamma Mu social sciences honour society's chapter at the University of Toronto for his outstanding scholastic performance in history and psychology. After Victoria College, Pearson won a scholarship to study at St John's College, Oxford, from 1921 to 1923.|$|E

50|$|In October 1929, as {{the country}} {{plummeted}} into the Great Depression, Bill founded Hill-Rom and began an unconventional marketing plan. He persuaded hospitals to furnish their private <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wooden furniture for six months free of charge. If they weren’t satisfied, they could simply return the furniture. After the trial periods, none of the furniture was returned and some hospitals placed orders for more.|$|R

25|$|Ulliott {{was born}} in 1954, the son of Stanley Ulliott, a World War II paratrooper turned truck driver and his wife Joyce (née Jefferson). He {{grew up in a}} small council house in a working class area, where he shared a <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sister Janet (who later died of cancer). Ulliott was unmotivated {{throughout}} his education and left school at the age of 15, without any O-levels, to take his first job making trophies for G K Beaulah. After visiting the bookies with his father and winning his first bet at 50:1, he picked winners at horse racing with his colleagues during hot lunch breaks. He was eventually fired from the job for taking an afternoon off to go to the races.|$|E

According to Sacramento Police Sergeant Justin Risley, both parties suffered scratches on their arms, but Troy did not press charges, and both Clark and Troy left in a vehicle together. Clark later apologized for the incident, explaining that his dancers, management team and record label representatives were also involved in the food fight, but that after they had left to get cleaned up, he and his manager, who stayed {{to clean up the}} room, were the ones present when the police arrived.|$|E
25|$|In December 1995, Florida Panthers captain Scott Mellanby {{scored a}} rat trick, the term coined by {{teammate}} John Vanbiesbrouck. Prior to the game, Mellanby killed a rat in the Panthers' locker <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hockey stick, {{and proceeded to}} score a pair of goals later that night. When Mellanby scored a hat trick in a later game, some Florida fans threw plastic rats on the ice, a tradition that continued for all Panthers' goals throughout the 1996 playoffs. Due to the resulting game delays caused by the necessary clean-up of the plastic rats, the league eventually banned the activity and modified Rule 63 to impose a minor penalty against the home team for a violation. The more traditional practice of fans throwing hats on the ice following genuine hat tricks remains exempt from this penalty.|$|E

25|$|The third series {{featured}} Nathan's {{proposal and}} marriage to Melanie Poppy (Laura Aikman), who both departed the series, and Josh {{is forced to}} share his <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> annoying younger cousin, Nero (Akai Osei). When the school burns down due to an issue with candles, Elmsbury is merged with another school, Fowlmere, renaming the school Elmsmere as of the fourth episode of the third series. Molly and Ryan do {{not appear in the}} rest of the series and attend a new school off screen. Due to the merger, several new characters joined the series in episode three - these were PE teacher Mr Nunn (Dan Wright), Miss Parkwood (Sophia Di Martino) and pupils in Nero's year; Eli Grant (Daniel Kerr), Owen Garland (Lewis Brindley), Fleur Murphy (Chloe Davison) and Eleesha Rahad (Grace McIntosh). Sally Ann Matthews also joined the cast as head teacher Aine O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> then girlfriend, two men shoved the two {{back into the room}} and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. He made that final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E

50|$|The castle was {{originally}} {{built as a}} fortification. In 1649 Philip-Albert Taye, 1st Marquess of Wemmel had his property redesigned in Baroque style. Inside he decorated the <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> heraldic crest. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was the main residence of the Marquess of Wemmel until Marie Josepha Taye, 6th Marquess of Assche and 3rd Marquess of Wemmel, married Jean-Antoine van der Noot. In 1838 the castle was sold to the mayor, Willem-Bernard Count of Limburg-Stirum. The house of Limburg-Stirum gave the estate to the local community.|$|R

500|$|One {{novel that}} did not appear in Startling was Isaac Asimov's Pebble in the Sky, which Merwin had {{commissioned}} from Asimov in the early summer of 1947. [...] After {{the unusual step of}} allowing the editor to twice read the work-in-progress and receiving nothing but approval, Asimov delivered a completed draft in September. This time, Merwin asked for revisions: Leo Margulies, Merwin's boss, had decided that Startling needed to focus more on action and adventure in the style of Amazing, and less on cerebral stories in the style of Astounding. [...] Asimov, [...] "for the first and only time of [...] life...openly lost [...] temper with an editor", stalked out of the <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> manuscript and never submitted anything to Merwin again, though he later expressed a softening of feeling and admitted Merwin had been within his rights.|$|E
500|$|The El Capitan Theatre, at Nixon's insistence, {{was entirely}} deserted. Press members were {{confined}} to a nearby room, where they could watch on television; stenographers were {{standing by at the}} Ambassador to ensure an accurate transcript of Nixon's remarks for the press, who would be facing deadlines in the East. Chotiner and Rogers would watch from behind a screen in the theatre; Pat Nixon, wearing a dress knitted by supporters, would sit on stage a few feet from her husband. The chosen set was a [...] "GI bedroom den" [...] with a desk, two chairs, and bookshelves. The senator usually preferred to work from a memorized text, but would work from notes for this speech to make the talk sound more spontaneous. Nixon spent some time practicing movements for the cameramen and finally went into the dressing <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife for a few minutes of solitude. He told her that he did not think he could go through with it, but she reassured him.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell Keeler has {{commented that}} Lynch's {{dropping}} out of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston [...] "worked to his detriment then, but may now be one of his greatest assets". Keeler recounts that Lynch left the school after allowing one of his tutors to use his dormitory room; the tutor, who {{was in the process of}} divorcing his wife, spent several nights in Lynch's <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mistress, while Lynch obligingly slept on the floor. Rather than confronting the tutor about this situation, Lynch felt it would be easier to leave school instead. Keeler and film critic Greg Olson posit that this desire to avoid confrontation has shaped the characters he has written, who often seek an [...] "escape route" [...] in the face of adversity rather than face it directly. Olson has further added that several of Lynch's later works—Dune and Twin Peaks—would have [...] "been less compromised" [...] had Lynch been of a more adversarial personality; as they were, both projects featured interference from film and television studios respectively.|$|E
500|$|Yorkshire {{appointed}} Major Arthur Lupton as captain, {{hoping that}} {{his experience in}} the army {{would allow him to}} exercise greater control than his predecessors had managed. Aged 46, he was old for a cricketer. He had played once for Yorkshire in 1908, but was no longer an effective batsman. He was very popular with the players, and managed to improve discipline but had little influence on team tactics. He left such matters to Rhodes and Robinson, to the point where several apocryphal stories emerged about his lack of control. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, [...] "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [...]" [...] After three years in charge, Lupton resigned the captaincy at the end of 1927. In their search for a successor, Yorkshire hoped to appoint a player with a better cricketing reputation who would serve for a longer term.|$|E
500|$|The Ice King {{decides that}} he wants to enlist Marceline's help in writing a song to woo princesses, taking pages {{randomly}} torn from an old scrapbook with him for later inspiration. He flies to her cave, and after a minor scuffle that involves Finn and Jake, Marceline finally relents and helps him write a song. At first, the Ice King simply sings a song he wrote about Princess Bubblegum, before breaking down, crying about his loneliness and damaging Marceline's living <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ice magic. Marceline tells him to stop acting crazy, and he pushes her, before timidly retreating to the top of her refrigerator. Marceline begins to lament, via the song [...] "Nuts," [...] and notes that, despite his instability, she is glad to see him. The Ice King is surprised to find out that she [...] "likes" [...] him and asks for a hug. However, when he misinterprets her feelings and tries to kiss her, Marceline angrily confronts him and asks if he remembers his past by calling him by his actual name: Simon.|$|E
