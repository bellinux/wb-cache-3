40|$|The M 184 V {{mutation}} in the HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase gene is primarily associated with rapid, high-level lamivudine (3 TC) resistance. It {{has also been}} observed to arise under selective pressure by abacavir, to which it confers low-level resistance. Although the development of viral drug resistance remains a major concern in antiretroviral therapy, {{it is known that}} some immunological and clinical benefit can still be derived from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens despite resistance-associated virological failure. This residual benefit on a failing regimen is commonly attributed to the preservation of fitness-reducing protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations under continued drug pressure. However, fitness-reducing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations may also contribute to the effect. M 184 V is both common in the treated population and fitness-reducing. A number of studies, both of dual nucleoside therapy and HAART, have noted a <b>residual</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> for 3 TC despite the assumed or observed presence of M 184 V and high-level phenotypic resistance. The speed and consistency with which this mutation is selected by 3 TC under suboptimal viral suppression therefore makes M 184 V a particularly interesting model for further clinical studies on the association of drug resistance with ongoing treatment benefit. While fitness considerations are likely to be a major contributor to the clinical observations noted, {{there are a number of}} other potential mechanisms that may contribute to a continuing response to 3 TC in the presence of M 184 V. These include the delay and reversal of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance, hypersensitization to other NRTIs, reduced reverse transcriptase (RT) processivity and a possible reduction in RT pyrophosphorolysis. The full impact of M 184 V on therapeutic prospects will require further elucidation; ideally, the risk/benefit of preserving this substitution would be investigated in randomized trials. However, existing data suggest that the presence of this mutation may preserve some benefit in spite of the loss of 3 TC susceptibility which, with further study, may prove valuabl...|$|E

Studies have shown that individuals with prior fractures have {{an increased risk of}} experiencing subsequent fractures. Therefore secondary fracture prevention appears useful to reduce further fractures in high risk individuals, e. g., in individuals with a prior hip fracture. A clinical trial (HORIZON-RFT) showed that a yearly dose of 5 mg intravenous zoledronic acid (IZA) had a fracture-reducing effect in individuals with a prior hip fracture. As to our knowledge no evidence about the cost-effectiveness of IZA is available, the objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 5 mg IZA in women with a previous hip fracture in comparison to no intervention. For this reason a previously published discrete event simulation model which simulates the natural occurrences of different fractures was enhanced.

HYPOTHESIS: Transthoracic echocardiography allows detection of left atrial (LA) mechanical dysfunction in horses after conversion of AF to NSR. ANIMALS: Five Standardbreds with AF and 6 healthy Standardbreds of similar age, weight, and athletic condition were included in this study. METHODS: Four horses were treated pharmacologically (quinidine), and 1 horse was treated by means of transvenous electrical cardioversion. Echocardiographic examinations were performed in normal horses (once) and in AF horses (24 hours and 72 hours after conversion to NSR) by means of 2 -dimensional echocardiography (2 DE), transmitral flow Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) techniques. Echocardiographic indices of LA mechanical function were compared between normal horses and AF horses. RESULTS: Two-dimensional echocardiography and TDI indices of LA mechanical function revealed significant decreases in LA contractile function and LA reservoir function 24 hours after cardioversion. This decrease was no longer statistically significant 72 hours after cardioversion, but changes in echocardiographic variables between 24 and 72 hours varied among horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: LA contractile dysfunction can be evaluated in horses by use of 2 DE, transmitral Doppler flow velocity profiles, and analyses of LA wall motion by TDI.

Soils were analyzed for mineral N and FN. ^ High N supply moderated N management effects on maize growth, yield and N fertilizer use efficiency.

Delayed planting reduced FN recovery at both N rates. ^ Application of 180 kg N ha(2 ̆ 7 - 1) at the 4 -leaf stage decreased crop growth and final yield in 1980. Application of N at the 16 -leaf stage increased rates of grain growth and N accumulation, resulting in greatest grain yield and FN recovery, especially with early planting.

40|$|Sulfur (S) is an {{essential}} plant nutrient. Decreased S deposition in combination with a switch to high-analysis N/P-fertilizers has increased the need for S fertilization. Thus, soil research directed at understanding soil sulfur properties and processes has intensified. However, the methodology at hand has been insufficient for determining relationships between soil properties, S cycling and S availability to crops. In this thesis, recently developed methods were used to study the effect on soil S by two management systems, livestock production and arable crop production, at five different locations within a Swedish long-term fertility field experimental series. In an open incubation study, and a pot trial, where isotopic labeling (35 S) was used to trace S transformations, S cycling rates {{were higher in the}} livestock system, especially in one soil (Orup). The S delivering capacity of all soils was too low to avoid S deficiency in ryegrass without mineral S application. Observed differences in S cycling patterns could not be satisfactorily explained by soil properties; however, multivariate analyses indicated net S mineralization was negatively related to C/N-ratios and SO 42 - content. The extent of organic S stabilization through organomineral association and physical protection within microaggregates was investigated by an extraction/dispersion method. The relative distribution between the pools varied between soils, with the residual (non-extractable) pool always being largest; however, only the physically protected fraction was negatively related to plant S uptake. All soil organic S pools were involved in S transformations, although the residual pool was less active than the other pools. Chemical speciation of S in soils and soil fractions was determined by S K-edge X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy. A new method for fitting spectra provided reliable quantification of S species by using internally calibrated spectra of dilute (30 mM) model compounds. The response of S speciation to management system differed between soils, but highly oxidized S dominated in the organomineral fractions, and intermediate forms of oxidized S in the residual fraction. In conclusion, soil organic S speciation can be accurately quantified by S K-edge XANES spectroscopy. The speciation differs between organomineral associated S and <b>residual</b> S. <b>Treatment</b> <b>effects</b> are dependent on soil type, but S cycling is stimulated by long-term farmyard manure application, as seen in the livestock system...|$|R

All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> can be generated from a baseline marginal <b>treatment</b> <b>effect.</b> All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the marginal <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> in partially identified models, when the marginal <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> is known only over a limited support. We show how to use the marginal treatment in econometric cost benefit analysis, in defining limits of policy experiments, in constructing the average marginal <b>treatment</b> <b>effect,</b> and in forecasting the effects of programs in new environments. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{nature of}} the {{identification}} of the firm effects can be more intuitively understood in terms of average <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> and local average <b>treatment</b> <b>effects.</b> The AKM decomposition identifies the average <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> of changing between two employers based on the contrast between the employer effects for those two employers, holding constant observables and individual heteogeneity. AKM uses the actual employment as the weights for this contrast, rather than just the movers, as would be the case for a local average <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> estimated by instrumental variables 6. Further analysis of the identification in terms of average <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> can be found in Card et al. (2012).|$|R

Using a latent variable model {{that allows for}} heterogeneous <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> among observationally identical persons, we estimate commonly defined mean <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> {{and the distribution of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>effects.</b> We find no significant mean <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> of PSE programme participation as compared to participation in other programmes for PSE programme participants. However, we find substantial heterogeneity in the <b>treatment</b> <b>effects,</b> and those most likely to participate in PSE programmes are those who benefit the least from such programmes.

40|$|Randomized {{controlled}} trials provide unbiased {{estimates of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> through reducing the attribution of observed differences in outcome {{to the play}} of chance or the treatment of interest. Issues {{in the design of}} randomized trials may lead to a dilution or magnification of <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> when compared with clinical practice. The intention-to-treat principle will lead to dilution in the <b>treatment</b> <b>effect,</b> while the selective recruitment of adherent and motivated subjects may lead to enhanced <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> estimates. Observational data, on the other hand, may reflect clinical practice but cannot provide unbiased estimates of <b>treatment</b> <b>effect.</b> Health policy may be informed by the combination of randomized and observational data in decision-analytic models. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} welfare effects of R&D subsidies. We develop {{a model of}} {{continuous}} optimal treatment with outcome heterogeneity where the treatment outcome depends on applicant investment. The model takes into account heterogeneous application costs and identifies the <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> on the public agency running the programme. Under the assumption of a welfare-maximizing agency, we identify general equilibrium <b>treatment</b> <b>effects.</b> Applyiing our model to R&D project-level data we find substantial <b>treatment</b> <b>effect</b> heterogeneity. Agency-specific <b>treatment</b> <b>effects</b> are smaller than private <b>treatment</b> <b>effects.</b> We find {{that the rate of}} return on subsidies for the agency is 30 – 50 %. applications; effort; investment; R&D; selection; subsidies; treatment programme; treatment effects; welfare...|$|R
