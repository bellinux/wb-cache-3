5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, black-necked stilt, caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E

5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
25|$|Birds: bald eagle, {{northern}} caracara, snail kite, osprey, {{white and}} brown pelicans, sea gulls, whooping and sandhill cranes, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> Florida scrub jay (state endemic), and others. One subspecies of wild turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, namely subspecies osceola, is {{found only in}} the state of Florida. The state is a wintering location for many species of eastern North American birds.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E

500|$|Copano Bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp, which attracts {{a large number of}} redfish. Abundant {{collections}} of black drum, flounder and trout, can also be found in the bay. Oysters grow in large numbers to form elongated reefs [...] "oriented perpendicular to tidal flow" [...] in the estuary. The reefs provide habitat for fish and sustenance {{for a wide variety of}} birds including the black-bellied whistling-duck, black-necked stilt, brown pelican, gull-billed tern, reddish egret, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> seaside sparrow, white-faced ibis and the whooping crane. The dominant species of gastropod in the bay is Eulimastoma harbisonae.|$|E
500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Year-round {{residents}} include least grebe, brown pelican, neotropic cormorant, white-faced ibis, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> black-bellied whistling-duck, mottled duck, white-tailed hawk, crested caracara, pauraque, golden-fronted woodpecker, great kiskadee, green jay, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, seaside sparrow, and bronzed cowbird. [...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E
5000|$|This species feeds {{in shallow}} fresh or coastal waters by {{swinging}} its bill {{from side to}} side as it steadily walks through the water, often in groups. The spoon-shaped bill allows it to sift easily through mud. It feeds on crustaceans, aquatic insects, frogs, newts and very small fish ignored by larger waders. In the United States, a popular place to observe <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbills</b> is [...] "Ding" [...] Darling National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. <b>Roseate</b> <b>spoonbills</b> must compete for food with snowy egrets, great egrets, tricolored herons and American white pelicans.|$|R

He then lists the cases of the white flamingo, the skunk and the white rump of the prongbuck, quoting Roosevelt ("The raven's coloration is of course concealing if it is put into a coal scuttle"), notes [...] "How unreasonable are extreme views like that adopted by Thayer", and admits that criticisms of [...] "certain of Thayer's conclusions" [...] are justified, before returning to the attack on those critics, robustly defending the [...] "theory of protective and aggressive resemblance".|$|E
500|$|Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, {{completed}} {{by his son}} Gerald H. Thayer, argued correctly for {{the widespread use of}} crypsis among animals, and in particular described and explained countershading for the first time. However, the Thayers spoilt their case by arguing that camouflage was the sole purpose of animal coloration, which led them to claim that even the brilliant pink plumage of the flamingo or the <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill</b> was cryptic—against the momentarily pink sky at dawn or dusk. As a result, the book was mocked by critics including Theodore Roosevelt as having [...] "pushed [...] to such a fantastic extreme and to include such wild absurdities as to call for the application of common sense thereto." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle.

60|$|Two {{miles from}} my home there stood an old mud-built house, {{thatched}} with rushes, and shaded by a few ancient half-dead trees. Here lived a very old woman with her two unmarried daughters, both withered and grey as their mother; indeed, in appearance, they were three amiable sister witches, all very very old. The high ground on which the house stood sloped down to an extensive reed- and rush-grown marsh, the source of an important stream; it was a paradise of wild fowl, swan, <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> herons white and herons grey, ducks {{of half a dozen}} species, snipe and painted snipe, and stilt, plover and godwit; the glossy ibis, and the great crested blue ibis with a powerful voice. All these interested, I might say fascinated, me less than the tame geese that spent most of their time in or on the borders of the marsh in the company of the wild birds. The three old women were so fond of their geese that they would not part with one for love or money; the most they would ever do would be to present an egg, in the laying season, to some visitor as a special mark of esteem.|$|E
60|$|It {{was smaller}} than the other lagoons I have {{described}} and much shallower, so that the big birds, such as the stork, wood-ibis, crested screamer, and the great blue ibis, called vanduria, and the <b>roseate</b> <b>spoonbill,</b> could wade almost all over it without wetting their feathers. It {{was one of those}} lakes which appear to be drying up, and was pretty well covered with a growth of camalote plant, mixed with reed, sedge, and bulrush patches. It was the only water in our part of the country where the large water-snail was found, and the snails had brought the bird that feeds on them--the large social marsh hawk, a slate-coloured bird resembling a buzzard in its size and manner of flight. But being exclusively a feeder on snails, it lives in peace and harmony with the other bird inhabitants of the marsh. There was always a colony of forty or fifty of these big hawks to be seen at this spot. A still more interesting bird was the jacana, as it is spelt in books, but pronounced ya-sa-NA by the Indians of Paraguay, a quaint rail-like bird supposed {{to be related to the}} plover family: black and maroon-red in colour, the wing-quills a shining greenish yellow, it has enormously long toes, spurs on its wings, and yellow wattles on its face. Here I first saw this strange beautiful fowl, and here to my delight I found its nest in three consecutive summers, with three or four clay-coloured eggs spotted with chestnut-red.|$|E
