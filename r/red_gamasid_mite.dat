40|$|The ectoparasitic <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> {{found on}} small mammals are {{important}} arthropods {{in the field}} of medical entomology. This paper studied the distribution and ecological niches of ectoparasitic <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> on small mammal hosts in Yunnan Province of southwest China. Levins' niche breadth and Colwell-Futuyma's method were used to quantitatively evaluate host-specificity and similarity of host selection, and hierarchical analysis was used to illustrate niche overlap among <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> species. Species diversity of both small mammals and <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> was lower in indoor habitats than that in outdoor habitats. Most <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> species were found on the body surface of the host species and niche breadths varied from species to species. A species with low niche breadth indicates high host specificity and most <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> showed a relatively low niche overlap. The results suggest that a coevolutionary relationship may exist between some species of <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> and their small mammal hosts...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates assemblages of mesostigmatid mites on Spitsbergen, in the Arctic {{archipelago}} of Svalbard, Norway. Soil {{samples were}} collected from three areas with differing vegetational communities in Adventdalen. The greatest <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> density and species diversity was observed at the location with the richest vegetation cover, Dryas octopetala heath, where 10 species were collected {{and there was a}} mean total <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> density of 1000 individuals per m 2. The vegetation-poor saline meadow site revealed five species and had a mean total <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> density of 130 individuals per m 2. The floristically more diverse Luzula tundra site yielded four species and had a density of 270 individuals per m 2. The most frequently found species were Zercon forsslundi, Arctoseius haarlovi and A. weberi. Results indicate that even in High-Arctic regions, where species diversity is less than at lower latitudes, there is specialization amongst the <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> community depending on local environmental conditions. Apart from isolated checklists, only sporadic information concerning the ecology of High-Arctic <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> is available.

40|$|International audienceOribatid mites {{represent}} {{a diverse group}} of soil micro-arthropods. They have evolved a broad range of defensive chemical and morphological traits (e. g. sclerotization, ptychoidy, biomineralization). Chemical defense, rather than sclerotization, can provide protection against large predators (staphylinid beetles) and many oribatid mite species are also well protected against <b>gamasid</b> soil <b>mites</b> using morphological traits ("enemy-free-space hypothesis"). However, since predatory mites and staphylinid beetles have different types of attacking and feeding, the adaptive values of chemical and morphological traits might differ accordingly. We used the oribatid model species Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki and the common <b>gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> Stratiolaelaps miles Berlese in a predator-prey experiment. We tested for effects of chemical defense (treatments with and without oil gland secretions) and sclerotization (treatments with unsclerotized tritonymphs and sclerotized adults) in an orthogonal design. In contrast to attacks by large predators, chemical defense was mostly ineffective against <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites.</b> Sclerotization, however, had a positive effect. Hence, in a natural environment with diverse types of predators, the "enemy-free space" seems only realizable by combinations of chemical and morphological protective traits...|$|R

40|$|Andropolymorphism, {{defined as}} {{discontinuous}} morphological variability in males, {{can lead to}} taxonomic confusion when different male morphs are determined and described as separate species. This study addresses this issue in two occasionally sympatric mite species Aclerogamasus similis (Willmann, 1953) and A. holzmannae (Micherdziński, 1969) collected in Poland. The females of these two taxa are morphologically indistinguishable but males are quite different, and could be either separate species or one species with two male morphs. We address this question by performing molecular assays, testing variation in a fragment of the mtDNA COI gene and the D 2 region of 28 S rDNA. Molecular analysis of populations revealed very low variation in the studied gene fragments. All sequences of the D 2 region of 28 S rDNA (size 375 bp) were identical. Only two COI haplotypes were found, differing by two out of 644 nucleotide positions (0. 3 % K 2 P distance). The variant haplotype was found in one A. similis male, and probably represents intraspecific variability. The results strongly suggest that all studied females and males belong to only one species with dimorphic males. This finding confirms some earlier opinions on synonymy of both species. Therefore, Aclerogamasus holzmannae (Micherdziński, 1969) {{should be regarded as}} a junior synonym of Aclerogamasus similis (Willmann, 1953). As andropolymorphism has been rarely observed in <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites,</b> we briefly discuss its possible origins and consequences.

40|$|Abstract Increased {{tree species}} {{diversity}} in the tropics is associated with even greater herbivore diversity, but few tests of tree eVects on litter arthropod diversity exist. We studied whether tree species inXuence patchiness in diversity and abundance of three common soil arthropod taxa (ants, <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites,</b> and oribatid mites) in a Panama forest. The tree specialization hypothesis proposes that treedriven habitat heterogeneity maintains litter arthropod diversity. We tested whether tree species diVered in resource {{quality and quantity of}} their leaf litter and whether more heterogeneous litter supports more arthropod species. Alternatively, the abundance–extinction hypothesis states that arthropod diversity increases with arthropod abundance, which in turn tracks resource quantity (e. g., litter depth). We found little support for the hypothesis that tropical trees are templates for litter arthropod diversity. Ten tree species diVered in litter depth, chemistry, and structural variability. However, the extent of specialization of invertebrates on particular tree taxa was low and the more heterogeneous litter between trees failed to support higher arthropod diversity. Furthermore, arthropod diversity did not track abundance or litter depth. The lack of association between tree species and litter arthropods suggests that factors other than tree species diversity may better explain the high arthropod diversity in tropical forests...|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} the evidence indicating {{a role for}} parasitic mites in the transmission and maintenance of Hantaan virus in nature. The available data, much of it from recent studies in China, indicate that both trom-biculid and <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> are naturally infected with Hantaan virus and that infected mites can transmit the virus by bite to laboratory mice and transovarially (vertically) through eggs to their offspring. Collectively, these findings challenge the current paradigm of hantavirus transmission, namely, that rodents serve as the reservoir of human pathogenic hantaviruses in nature and that humans are infected with these viruses by inhalation of aerosols of infectious rodent excreta. Further {{research is needed to}} confirm the mite-hantavirus association and to determine if parasitic mites are in fact the major source and principal vectors of human pathogenic hanta-viruses, such as Hantaan.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} role of {{the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) in immune recognition {{has led to a}} general consensus that the characteristically high levels of functional polymorphism at MHC genes is maintained by balancing selection operating through host–parasite coevolution. However, the actual mechanism by which selection operates is unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed: overdominance (or heterozygote superiority) and negative frequency-dependent selection. Evidence for these hypotheses was evaluated by examining MHC–parasite relationships in an island population of water voles (Arvicola terrestris). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine whether individual variation at an MHC class II DRB locus explained variation in the individual burdens of five different parasites. MHC genotype explained a significant amount of variation in the burden of <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites,</b> fleas (Megabothris walkeri) and nymphs of sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus). Additionally, MHC heterozygotes were simultaneously co-infected by fewer parasite types than homozygotes. In each case where an MHC-dependent effect on parasite burden was resolved, the heterozygote genotype was associated with fewer parasites, and the heterozygote outperformed each homozygote in two of three cases, suggesting an overall superiority against parasitism for MHC heterozygote genotypes. This is the first demonstration of MHC heterozygote superiority against multiple parasites in a natural population, a mechanism that could help maintain high levels of functional MHC genetic diversity in natural populations...|$|R
40|$|A major {{question}} in soil ecology is whether soil food webs are regulated by resources or by predators, i. e. bottom-up (donor) or top-down controlled. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} meso- and macrofaunal soil predators can regulate fungivore populations and, thereby cause a top-down cascade effect on fungal biomass and decomposition/mineralisation processes in boreal forest soils. The study was performed as a microcosm experiment with two contrasting soils (humus layers), one poor and one rich in N, and with different combinations of fungivore and predator soil fauna added to "defaunated" soil. In comparison with control microcosms lacking mesofauna (but with nematodes and protozoans), {{the presence of a}} diverse Collembola and Oribatida fungivore community significantly reduced the FDA-active fungal biomass or tended to reduce the ergosterol fraction of the fungal biomass in the N-poor humus, but no clear effect could be detected in the N-rich humus. Fungivores as well as fungivores plus predators (a predator community consisting of gamasids, spiders and beetles or a subset thereof) reduced C mineralisation and increased net N mineralisation in both soils. The presence of predators (particularly <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites)</b> reduced collembolan numbers and alleviated the negative effect of fungivores on fungal biomass in the N-poor soil. In the N-rich soil, the presence of predators increased fungal biomass (ergosterol) in relation to the "defaunated" soil. Therefore, a top-down trophic cascade could be detected in the N-poor humus but not in the N-rich humus. Our results suggest that the degree of top-down control in soil fauna communities depends on resource quality and soil fertility...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{species of}} ectoparasites that {{live on a}} {{specific}} host in a geographical region form an ectoparasite community. Species abundance distributions describe {{the number of individuals}} observed for each different species that is encountered within a community. Based on properties of the species abundance distribution, the expected total number of species present in the community can be estimated. Methods: Preston’s lognormal distribution model was used to fit the expected species abundance distribution curve. Using the expected species abundance distribution curve, we estimated the total number of expected parasite species present and the amount of species that were likely missed by our sampling in the field. Results: In total, 8040 ectoparasites (fleas, sucking lice, <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> and chigger mites) were collected from 431 Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) from a localized area in southwest China. These ectoparasites were identified to be 47 species from 26 genera in 10 families. The majority of ectoparasite species were chigger mites (family Trombicu­lidae) while the majority of individuals were sucking lice in the family Polyplacidae. The expected species abun­dance distribution curve demonstrated the classic pattern that the majority of ectoparasite species were rare and that there were a few common species. The total expected number of ectoparasite species on R. norvegicus was estimated to be 85 species, and 38 species were likely missed by our sampling in the field. Conclusions: Norway rats harbor a large suite of ectoparasites. Future field investigations should sample large num­bers of host individuals to assess ectoparasite populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1950 Our {{knowledge}} of Acarina is limited. Life histories {{have not been}} studied because {{it is difficult to}} rear these mites in the laboratory. Of the two-hundred or more identified mite larvae known in 1946, only twelve are known as nymphs or adults. However, this lack of knowledge in taxonomy does not appear to hinder the work on the biological relationships of mites associated with insects. 	Mites attacking members of the order, Orthoptera, were described by Lawrence (1940), Howard (1918), Hamilton (1914), Wehrle and Welch (1925), and Radford (1946). The mites attacked mainly the grasshoppers and locueta. These mites belonged to four families: Trombidiidae, Erythraeidae, Tarsonemidae, and Tyroglyphidae. 	Walsh (1868), Shimer (1868), Lignieres (1893), Riley (1873), and Ewing (1912) gave accounts of mites attacking the scale insect eggs and adults. These mites, which play an important part in the natural control of scale insects, include: Hemisarcoptes malus (Shimer), Monieziella entomophaga Laboulbene, Tydeus cocoophagus Ewing, Bdells cardinalis Banks, Cyta brevipalpa Ewing, Anystis agilis Banks, Eupalus sp., Tetranychus telariue Linne, and Oribata sp [...] 	 Of the mites which are parasitic on members of the order Hymenoptera, the most important one is Acarapis woodi (Rennie) which is the causative agent of the well-known Isle of Wight disease of honey bees. The mites infest the tracheal system of the bees and cause death due to the possible secretion of a toxic substance by the mite. White (1921), who reported on this acarine disease, experimented with healthy bees in an attempt to secure information on the mechanical effects of obstruction of the honey bee's tracheal system. The transmission of this disease was reported on by Burnside, Sturtevant, and Halst (1949). 	 Other mites associated with hymenopterans were commensals. The <b>Gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> of the genus, Antennophorus, were described by Wheeler (1910) and Michael (1891, 1894). A certain biological specificity in the relationships with ants wes shown by these mites. One species of <b>Gamasid</b> <b>mite</b> usually was found with only one or two species of ants. 	LeVeque (1930, 1931) worked extensively on the mites belonging to the genus, Dinogamasus, Kramer. She described several new species of this genus and listed the different groups in whioh the species of Dinogamasus were placed. The groups listed were the perkinsi group, the alfkeni group, the ootoconus group, and the braunsi group. Descriptions of oommon features {{of the members of the}} groups and keys for distinguishing between the various species were also included. 	Marshall (1938), Shapiro, Saliternik, and Belferman (1944) reported the finding of larvae of bydrachnid mites as external parasites on adult mosquitoes. Other records of these water-mite larval parasites were made by Wolcott (1905) and Soar and Williamson (1925). The larvae of Hydrachna (Mulller) Latreille live parasitically on aquatic insects, larvae of Limnoohares Latreille live parasitically on water-bugs, larvae of Eylais Latreille are parasites on insects which leave the water and became aerial, and larvae of the family Hydryphantidae leave the water and live parasitically on aerial fnsects. 	Mites found on Buprestid beetles and Cerambycid beetles attack in particular in the ventral joints and sutures of the host insect. Lawrence (1940 a) described a mite, Pysmephorus crassipes, which was found on the beetles. Anothe mite parasite of beetles, Uropoda vegetans de Geer, reported on by Riley (1877), developed an adaptive organ for attachment. The organ was an extensile organ which issued from the anal vent just beneath the extremity of the body and stuck to the beetle by means of a flattened disc. 	The mite parasite, Pediculoides ventricosus Newport, which attacks the grain moth, Sitotroga oereallela Oliv. is beneficial to man. It acts as a natural control for the destruction of the grain moth. 	More recently in 1948 mites of the genus Leptus were found parasitic on species of Corythucha. 	This discussion given on mite-insect relationship is not by any means complete, but it does point to the fact that investigations have been carried out and that there are great opportunities tor any researcher who may be interested in this field of study...|$|R

We used ash concentrations spanning 0 - 75 g kg- 1 soil. As ash increases pH we compared bioash effects with effects of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2, the main liming component of ash. Only high ash concentrations above 15 g kg- 1 agricultural soil or 17 t ha- 1 had significant effects on the collembolans. The wood ash neither affected H. aculeifer nor E. crypticus. The estimated osmolalities of Ca(OH) 2 and the wood ash were similar at the LC 50 concentration level. We conclude that short-term chronic effects of wood ash differ among different soil types, and osmotic stress is the likely cause of effects while high pH and heavy metals is of minor importance...|$|R

40|$|Since 2003, a {{long-term}} field {{monitoring of the}} development of Organic Farming has been performed at the bio-farm “Rutzendorf“ in the Marchfeld region east of Vienna. The overall project focus includes three topics: (1) effects of organic farming on soil and plant characteristics depending on three organic fertilization systems (variant 1 : green manure: mulching lucerne; variant 2 : green manure plus communal compost; variant 3 : farmyard manure: harvesting and removal of lucerne crop and cereal straw) (2) effects of hedges on micro climate, water capacity of the soils and crop performances, (3) analyses and cultivation of existing biotopes and establishment of new biotope structures, effects of biotopes and organic farming on the biodiversity of the farm. In the current phase of the project (MUBIL II, 2006 to March 2009), first effects of the conversion have been confirmed and new developments have occurred. (1) Soil monitoring in the period 2003 – 2008 has shown that the concentrations of plant available, CAL-extractable P and K pools remained in the range of “sufficient availability”. An investigation on five additional sites has shown that also for sites with long term organic farming (12 – 18 years) a sufficient or even high availability of P and K can be expected. This assumption is supported by the fact that in all studied soils a very large pool of organically bound phosphorous (which becomes plant available due to microbial degradation) has been detected. Measurements of the soil water balance showed that biologically farmed fields had higher soil water contents than conventional fields, especially in dry years. A significant impact of the kind of fertilization was not observed. Lucerne in the crop rotation had a positive influence on soil physical parameters like bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, aggregate stability and the N mineralization potential. The densities and diversities of the soil fauna (oribatid and <b>gamasid</b> <b>mites</b> and springtails) were very low {{at the onset of the}} study in 2003. Except for the conventional site, the abundance and species richness of Collembola and Gamasida considerably increased in all organic land use types after an initial lag phase. Generally, the conversion to organic farming had a positive effect on Collembola and Gamasida; however, there was no discernible difference between three manure treatments. It is not yet clear if the resulting large numbers will sustain in the following years. Compared to the conventional managed field the number of weed species on the permanent plots is clearly higher but no continuous increase over the investigated years was detected. Under lucerne and under field pea the highest species numbers were found. Due to a decrease in numbers during the following years of the crop rotation, no problems for the practice are assumed. The different fertilizers have neither shown an effect on the emergence of weeds nor on the number of seeds. The yield of winter wheat following lucerne was significantly lower in variant 3 because of the removal of lucerne biomass in this system in contrast to the systems with lucerne mulching. No significantly positive effect of a fertilisation with communal compost and farmyard manure on crop yield has been detected. However, interesting results can be found by analysis of all fertilised trials of the last years. Overall, the fertilisation with farmyard manure (system 3) reached tendentiously the highest crop yields. The communal compost fertilisation did not show so constant results because of the lower nitrogen effect of the compost in contrast to the farmyard manure. The yield development of the three organic fertilization systems was confirmed by the results of nutrient and humus balances calculated with the agro software REPRO. The nutritional value of wheat from organic farms has been examined. Based on these results, it is recommended to conduct regular feed analysis, implying crude protein analysis at least, if home-grown grains are fed to livestock on organic farms. Variant 1 achieved the highest average gross margin during the six years period. The assumed costs for the organic manure in variant 2 and 3 could not be covered by higher revenues. The main influence on the level of the gross margin was, among the climatic conditions, the fluctuating prices of the cash crops during the sample period. (2) Field studies have shown a total sphere of influence of hedgerows in relation to their orientation, permeability and height of about the 15 to 20 fold of the height. Furthermore, available water resulting from precipitation, reduced evapotranspiration due to wind breaks or dislocation of snow has a high impact on (soil) water balance and hence on agriculture at this relatively dry location in Rutzendorf. The impact of the hedgerow lead to reduced water losses and higher soil water contents within a distance of 3 times the barrier height. These positive effects were higher in years with low precipitation amounts. Furthermore a positive effect of a hedge on crop yield in the adjacent field was shown. Yield increases ranged from 9. 5 to 23. 7 percent depending on the cultivated crop, the temperature and the amount of rain in the period of growth. (3) Hedges and tree rows on the farm proved to be species-poor and the structure is more and more degenerating. Therefore cultivation measures have been identified to improve the multi-functionality of landscape elements as well as biodiversity. These measures have been mapped in a preservation concept for the biotope structures. Along hedges and between fields 6 m broad “eco-stripes” were established. An increase in species diversity was achieved by sowing authochthonal wild flowers in one part of the stripes. In the other part of the stripes, which was left to natural succession, low diversity was recorded. A total of 139 species of wild bees was recorded in the project area Rutzendorf. The results show high diversity and rare species in five year old “eco-stripes” in the east. The species richness of two year old “eco-stripes” was also high, but only euryeicous species were found. Carabids and hoover flies were accumulated in and alongside the eco-stripes due to their rich blossom supply. By single-plant countings of pea aphids and their antagonists in three different distances of a flowering strip, lower aphid densities were recorded close to the eco-stripe. These could not be attributed to higher beneficial efficacy there. The spatial distribution of arthropod group numbers emphasizes the significance of hedges and eco-stripes for arthropod biodiversity. In 2006 - 2008, the territories of breeding birds in the research area Rutzendorf were censused using the mapping method.
