40|$|Depth {{data from}} archival tags on {{northern}} rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) were examined {{to assess whether}} fish used tidal currents to aid horizontal migration. Two northern rock sole, out of 115 released with archival tags in the eastern Bering Sea, were recovered 314 and 667 days after release. Both fish made periodic excursions away from the bottom during mostly night-time hours, but also during particular phases of the tide cycle. One fish that was captured and released {{in an area of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>currents</b> made vertical excursions that were correlated with tidal current direction. To test the hypothesis that the fish made vertical excursions to use tidal currents to aid migration, a hypothetical migratory path was calculated using a tide model to predict the current direction and speed during periods when the fish was off the bottom. This migration included limited movements from July through December, followed by a 200 -km southern migration from January through February, then a return northward in March and April. The successful application of tidal current information to predict a horizontal migratory path not only provides evidence of selective tidal stream transport but indicates that vertical excursions were conducted primarily to assist horizontal migration...|$|R

Three of the stations were along a two-mile line perpendicular to the expected mean flow. The fourth station was six miles upstream of the other three. Of the eight current measuring meters which operated successfully, three were at depths of approximately 15 m, two at 65 m and one each at 106 m and 218 m. [...] The currents were found to be rotary in a clockwise direction. A comparison with theory showed that the near-surface currents were of an inertial nature; the measured periods of the near-surface currents being almost equal to the theoretical inertial period of 15. 5 hrs. A curve was constructed showing the form of the correlation between the <b>rotary</b> <b>currents</b> at different depths at one of the stations. A vertical spiral effect similar to the Ekman spiral but rotating in time was interpreted from the shape of the curve. [...] A study of measured iceberg tracks showed that the loops sometimes made by icebergs could quite possibly be caused by inertial current effects.

A prototype single cell rotary water electrolyser was constructed, {{and a number}} of design challenges with regard to the practical application were addressed. The rotary electrolyser was tested over a range of current density, centrifugal acceleration, electrolyte concentration, temperature, and electrode geometry. The test results showed that at normal cell operating conditions (7. 7 M KOH solution, 348 K) much of the cell voltage benefits were achieved at an acceleration of about 16 g (g= 9. 81 ms- 2), equivalent to a rotational speed of 500 rpm (revolution per minute) for the rotary cell. The rotary electrolyser cell voltage was about 0. 25 - 0. 5 V, less than the equivalent static cell under similar operating conditions, depending on the current density.

40|$|A {{rotary encoder}} reads {{rotational}} motion (angular position and speed) and converts the motion into electrical signals. It involves two components: a designed coded-disc to represents rotational {{information and a}} sensor to convert the coded information into electrical signals. A conventional rotary encoder uses three major elements, a pattern code disc, a light source and a photo-detector. Factors affecting rotary encoder are mechanical component alignments, resolution enhancement, size reduction, additional processing electronics and the working environment. Depending {{on the design of}} the coded-disc and the signal interpolation, a rotary encoder can function as an absolute or incremental encoder. An absolute encoder can determine the angular position without the need to have a reference position. On the other hand, an incremental encoder requires a reference position {{in order to determine the}} angular position. In operations, when an incremental encoder is started, the system has to move to the home position in order to set a reference point. An absolute encoder does not require home operations because it knows exactly the current angular position. As such, an incremental encoder requires an additional power supply when the system is turn-off so that it can “memorize” the current position. An absolute encoder is more expensive and the angular position range is limited by the disc size. Many researchers proposed and implemented different alternatives to absolute encoder. One technique is using an image <b>rotary</b> encoder. <b>Current</b> trends in digital image processing techniques have been applied widely into various applications. Some of the applications emerge as a sensing device with the assist of digital image processing techniques. Therefore, the research objective is to develop an image rotary encoder based on image texture before converting it into speed and motion data. The image texture is captured from a specially-designed texture of rotating disc using a digital image sensor. The proposed image rotary encoder is based on pixel changes by motion of rotating disc. The captured images are then converted into motion data by an image processing algorithm. The output signal is a binary position code which is similar to the conventional absolute rotary encoder. Performance of the image rotary encoder is validated by comparing the speed and position with the conventional rotary encoder. Experimental results indicate that the speed and position measured by the developed image rotary encoder are directly proportional to those measured using the conventional rotary encoder. Experiments also confirmed that the developed image rotary encoder can be utilized as a feedback device to a DC motor PID position control. Therefore, the developed image rotary encoder successfully functions as an absolute rotary encoder...|$|R
40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>rotary</b> blade {{choppers}} for sugarcane harvesting {{have the}} disadvantage of becoming clogged with leaves/cane around the rotating blades causing them to hit the ground and rocks that result in rapid blade wear and tear. Dull blades require repeated cane cutting attempts causing damage to the cane and increasing the cutting force and energy requirements. Thus, the search for alternative, non-contact, cutting options such as waterjet (WJ) cutting has been undertaken. The results indicated that WJ cutting has potential but weaknesses have also been reported. Hence, this study explored the use of abrasive fine sand (AWJ) to overcome the weaknesses of the pure WJ cutting application. Using the Hoogstrate model and a MATLAB program, AWJ cutting simulation was performed using an orifice and nozzle diameter combination of 0. 25 and 0. 76  mm at 360  MPa water pressure, respectively, which produced a water flow rate of 1. 6  L/min and a power input of 15  kW. Other parameters used in the test included: 80  mesh fine river sand abrasive materials, a specific cutting energy of 8. 7  ×  10 − 3  J/mm 3 and a fitted cutting efficiency of 0. 35. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to cut sugarcane stalks completely at a much farther standoff distance by reducing the traverse speed. The study also showed that cutting sugarcane of 30 and 120  mm diameters would require a traverse speed of 4. 4  km/h and 1. 1  km/h, respectively.

40|$|Clock Distribution Network (CDN) is an {{important}} component of any synchronous logic circuit. The function of CDN is to deliver the clock signal to the clock sinks. Clock skew is defined as the difference in the arrival time of the clock signal at the clock sinks. Higher uncertainty in skew (due to PVT variations) degrades circuit performance by decreasing the maximum possible delay between any two sequential elements. Aggressive frequency scaling has also led to high power consumption especially in CDN. This dissertation addresses variation and power issues in the design of current and potential future CDN. The research detailed in this work presents algorithmic techniques for the following problems: (1) Variation tolerance in useful skew design, (2) Link insertion for buffered clock nets, (3) Methodology and algorithms for rotary clocking and (4) Clock mesh optimization for skew-power trade off. For clock trees this dissertation presents techniques to integrate the different aspects of clock tree synthesis (skew scheduling, abstract topology and layout embedding) into one framework- tolerance to variations. This research addresses the issues involved in inserting cross-links in a buffered clock tree and proposes design criteria to avoid the risk of short-circuit <b>current.</b> <b>Rotary</b> clocking is a promising new clocking scheme that consists of unterminated rings formed by differential transmission lines. Rotary clocking achieves reduction in power dissipation clock skew. This dissertation addresses the issues in adopting current CAD methodology to rotary clocks. Alternative methodology and corresponding algorithmic techniques are detailed. Clock mesh is a popular form of CDN used in high performance systems. The problem of simultaneous sizing and placement of mesh buffers in a clock mesh is addressed. The algorithms presented remove the edges from the clock mesh to trade off skew tolerance for low power. For clock trees as well as link insertion, our experiments indicate significant reduction in clock skew due to variations. For clock mesh, experimental results indicate 18. 5 % reduction in power with 1. 3 % delay penalty on a average.

40|$|Citation: Graham, Lewis M. Elder, Leonard Roscoe. The use of {{the rotary}} {{converter}} in substations. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: In street or interurban railway service, when {{the distance from the}} central station becomes greater than five or six miles, the copper losses over the trolley become excessive, and it is necessary to reduce these losses to a minimum. This is done by generating alternating current at from 2000 to 7000 volts, or if a higher voltage is desired a step up transformer is used. This high potential is transmitted to a substation situated at some convenient place on the line. Here the line voltage is stepped down by a transformer to something below 1100 and converted into direct current. This conversion may be made by one of three ways. (1). The alternating current may be fed into a synchronous or induction motor which is belted or direct connected to a direct current generator. (2). A motor-generator may be used. This is a machine with two separate armature windings on the same core, one being connected to slip rings through which alternating current is fed and operates the machine as a synchronous motor, driving the other winding as a direct current generator connected to a commutator. (3). The alternating current may be fed into a <b>rotary</b> converter, direct <b>current</b> being taken off at the other end. It is about this machine that I wish to write. The rotary converter as far as purpose is concerned is simply the commutator of a direct current rotating at some distance from the generator. But with it as with any commutator it must rotate at the same cyclic speed as the generator. To accomplish this the principle of the synchronous motor is used, for the synchronous motor will run at synchronous speed if it runs at all. So the rotary converter is essentially a synchronous motor in the respect that it has a magnetic field in which rotates an armature winding connected slip rings by leads which are taped on at regular intervals, there being as many rings as there are phases in the circuit...|$|R

Characterization and analysis {{were performed to}} evaluate material reactions and energy usage. Processing parameters for laboratory scale and larger scale calcining experiments were developed for MAT limestone calcination. Early stage equipment design concepts were developed, {{with a focus on}} microwave post heating treatment. The retrofitting of existing rotary calcine equipment in the lime industry was assessed and found to be feasible. Ceralink sought to address some of the major barriers to the uptake of MAT identified as the need for (1) team approach with end users, technology partners, and equipment manufacturers, (2) modeling that incorporates kiln materials and variations to the design of industrial microwave equipment. This project has furthered the commercialization effort of MAT by working closely with an industrial lime manufacturer to educate them regarding MAT, identifying equipment manufacturer to supply microwave equipment, and developing a sophisticated MAT modeling with WPI, the university partner. MAT was shown to enhance calcining through lower energy consumption and faster reaction rates compared to conventional processing. Laboratory testing concluded that a 23 % reduction in energy was possible for calcining small batches (5 kg). Scale-up testing indicated that the energy savings increased as a function of load size and 36 % energy savings was demonstrated (22 kg). A sophisticated model was developed which combines simultaneous microwave and conventional heating. Continued development of this modeling software could be used for larger scale calcining simulations, which would be a beneficial low-cost tool for exploring equipment design prior to actual building. Based on these findings, estimates for production scale MAT calcining benefits were calculated, assuming uptake of MAT in the US lime industry. This estimate showed that 7. 3 TBTU/year could be saved, with reduction of 270 MMlbs of CO 2 emissions, and $ 29 MM/year in economic savings. Taking into account estimates for MAT implementation in the US cement industry, an additional 39 TBTU/year, 3 Blbs of CO 2 and $ 155 MM/year could be saved. One of the main remaining barriers to commercialization of MAT for the lime and cement industries is the sheer size of production. Through this project, it was realized that a production size MAT rotary calciner was not feasible, and a different approach was adapted. The concept of a microwave post heat section located in the upper portion of the cooler was devised and appears to be a more realistic approach for MAT implementation. Commercialization of this technology will require (1) continued pilot scale calcining demonstrations, (2) involvement of lime kiln companies, and (3) involvement of an industrial microwave equipment provider. An initial design concept for a MAT post-heat treatment section was conceived as a retrofit into the cooler sections of existing lime rotary calciners with a 1. 4 year payback. Retrofitting will help spur implementation of this technology, as the capital investment will be minimal for enhancing the efficiency of <b>current</b> <b>rotary</b> lime kilns. Retrofits would likely be attractive to lime manufacturers, as the purchase of a new lime kiln is on the order of a $ 30 million dollar investment, where as a MAT retrofit is estimated on the order of $ 1 million. The path for commercialization lies in partnering with existing lime kiln companies, who will be able to implement {{the microwave}} post heat sections in existing and new build kilns.

Since drying is a key factor affecting the quality of the ultimate product of tea, the simulation results of the mathematical model explain the drying performance and how the physical model or the prototype could be scaled. The tea sector has always been a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy. Sri Lanka as the third biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share of 9 % in the international sphere, and one of the world's leading exporters with a share of around 19 % of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187, 309 hectares. Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to make loose tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated timber plank as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the cylinder the dryer {{is said to be the}} type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one.

Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance.

As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the dryer type for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co <b>current</b> <b>rotary</b> type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance. The accuracy of simulation results of the mathematical model is highly depend upon the accuracy of the experiments carried out at various situations for finding out the dryer constant and the characteristic constants using physical models...|$|R
