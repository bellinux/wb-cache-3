50|$|This {{attempted}} solution fails {{because it}} allows the system to reach a deadlock state, in which no progress is possible.

50|$|After {{acquiring}} Sun in January 2010, Oracle Corporation continued developing OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, {{which it}} renamed Oracle Open Office, though with {{a reduction in}} assigned developers.

In April 2011, Oracle stopped development of OpenOffice.org and fired the remaining StarDivision development team. Its reasons for doing so were not disclosed; some speculate that it was due to the loss of mindshare with much of the community moving to LibreOffice while others suggest it was a commercial decision.|$|R

40|$|Rapid and processive leading-strand DNA {{synthesis}} in the bacteriophage T 4 system requires functional coupling {{between the}} helicase and the holoenzyme, {{consisting of the}} polymerase and trimeric clamp loaded by the clamp loader. We investigated the mechanism of this coupling on a DNA hairpin sub-strate manipulated by a magnetic trap. In {{stark contrast to the}} isolated enzymes, the coupled system synthesized DNA at the maximum rate without exhibiting fork regression or pauses. DNA synthesis and unwinding activities were coupled at low forces, but became uncoupled displaying separate activities at high forces or low dNTP con-centration. We propose a collaborative model in which the helicase <b>releases</b> the <b>fork</b> regression pressure on the holoenzyme allowing it to adopt a processive polymerization conformation and the holoenzyme destabilizes the first few base pairs of the fork thereby increasing the efficiency of helicase unwinding. The model implies that both enzymes are localized at the fork, but does not require a specific interaction between them. The model quantitatively reproduces homologous and heterologous coupling results under various experimental conditions...|$|R
