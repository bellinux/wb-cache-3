5|$|The {{foundation}} of accountable Pony Express history {{rests in the}} few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence.

For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E
