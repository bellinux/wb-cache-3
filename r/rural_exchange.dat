50|$|The IPKall {{business}} model {{appears to be}} based on its ability to charge termination rates for calls reaching its subscribers, estimated at about $.01/min, as the service is free for end users. The wholesale price for major interexchange carriers to terminate calls to independent telcos in rural Washington (state) and similar locations (such as northern Minnesota and Iowa) is often several cents a minute higher than typical US48 rates; this money is effectively a subsidy to the destination local <b>rural</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} appreciated that concentrated settlement {{is an effective}} means to reduce land for residence and improve the effectiveness, which contributes to the mission of sustainable development. In China, the policy of <b>rural</b> residence land <b>exchange</b> {{is used as a}} measure to advocate concentrated rural settlement and promote new countryside construction. However, it is found that, under the development driven condition (DDC), the government usually pushes forward or forcibly implement this policy while the farmers are reluctant to accept this. By contrast, Dujiangyan, in the disaster induced condition (DIC), adopted this policy to raise funds for post-disaster reconstruction, which is accepted by the rural victims and gained great success. Therefore, the contrasted phenomenon inspires us to explore why the practices between the two conditions are different. Game theory was employed to explain the difference and three critical reasons were identified. The findings provide valuable reference for the practice of <b>rural</b> residence land <b>exchange</b> under DDC. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
50|$|A {{security}} weakness on the <b>rural</b> Strowger <b>exchanges</b> (UAX 13s and smaller) {{had been}} the electrical power supply. If the mains feed went down, the exchanges relied on back-up batteries, but these could only keep the exchange going {{for a few hours}} and after that, service was lost across the whole exchange to typically several hundred customers. The TXE2s were much better equipped. They had a separate power room, itself often bigger than the entire UAX 13, in which, as well as back-up batteries, there was a stand-by diesel generator. This started automatically {{in the event of a}} power cut and could keep the exchange going for days. Isolations due to power cuts therefore became a thing of the past, but at considerable initial capital cost.|$|R

During carrying out this policy, many new problems are produced such as low standard of chosing exchange teachers; no right of free choice for exchange teachers and exchange schools, exchange teachers’ job assignments uncorrespondence with their professions, too long time of exchange and single exchange form, unreasonable evaluation subject or no unified evaluation standards and so on.

Rising house prices over recent years are a particular problem as there is limited land available in the valley for building affordable housing.
