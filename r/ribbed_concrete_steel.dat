40|$|Abstract：FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube may fully use the {{character}} of FRP-confined concrete and <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube. Based on the analysis of existing experimental data, the formula of ultimate bearing capacity of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube is proposed. The mechanical behavior of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube is mainly related to the equivalent confinement effect coefficient before the rupture of FRP. Based on the static equilibrium condition, the equivalent conversion section is adopted; taking efξ as main parameter, the simplified stress-strain model of FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube is established. The predictions of the model agree well with test data...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} both, theoretical and experimental work and aims to assessment the yield point of <b>concrete</b> <b>steels,</b> based on the known alloy chemical composition. The experimental portion of the work was performed at the Split steelmaking factory, which produces <b>concrete</b> <b>steels</b> from the waste iron. The theoretical portion of this study involves mathematical modelling carried out using the software package MATLAB.

The results show that ductility, crack resistance of rubber concrete slab, shear capacity of shear connector for rubber <b>concrete</b> <b>steel</b> composite beam are improved significantly compared with ordinary <b>steel</b> <b>concrete</b> composite beams. Along with the increase of rubber content, the energy consumption of composite beams gradually increases, while the ultimate bearing capacity decreases with small amplitude.

40|$|Abstract. There are {{changes in}} {{material}} properties of concrete when compared axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube with axially loaded short columns with common reinforced concrete and these changes will inevitably {{lead to the}} change of axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube in performance. It is impossible to fully use the existing research results of axially loaded short columns with common reinforced concrete; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} do experimental research on the working performance of axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube. This paper studied the hydration heat, self-stress and failure load according to the test conditions of the 15 axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube specimen; determined the optimum mix amount of axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube and proposed the increase rate of ultimate failure load of axially loaded short columns with micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube compared with axially loaded short columns with common reinforced concrete.

It is offered to make <b>concrete</b> filled <b>steel</b> tube columns with a preliminary compressed concrete core to improve their design.
