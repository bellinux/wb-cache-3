40|$|A {{low speed}} {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley V/STOL tunnel to determine the power-on static-turning and powered-lift aerodynamic performance of a four engine upper surface blown transport configuration. Initial tests with a D-shaped exhaust nozzle showed relatively poor flow-turning capability, and the D-nozzles were replaced by rectangular nozzles with a width-height ratio of 6. 0. The high lift system consisted of a leading edge slat and two different trailing-edge-flap configurations. A double slotted flap with the gaps sealed was investigated and a simple <b>radius</b> <b>flap</b> was also tested. A maximum lift coefficient of approximately 9. 3 was obtained for the model with the rectangular exhaust nozzles with both the double slotted flap deflected 50 deg and the <b>radius</b> <b>flap</b> deflected 90 deg...|$|E

The low wing Phase I model utilized 0. 126 c <b>radius</b> Jacobs/Hurkamp <b>flaps</b> and 0. 337 c <b>radius</b> Coanda <b>flaps.</b> The high wing Phase II model was utilized for continued studies on the Jacobs/Hurkamp flap.

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to study the velocity and persistence characteristics of the trailing vortices generated by a jumbo jet transport. The investigation showed that the tangential velocities were initially higher for vortices generated with the flaps up and that they persisted for longer distances behind the aircraft than those generated with the flaps down. The core <b>radii</b> with <b>flaps</b> down appeared to be generally larger than those with flaps up. The vertical locations of the vortices behind the generating aircraft varied from several hundred meters below the generating aircraft flight path at long ranges up to, and occasionally above, the flight path at short and moderate ranges...|$|R
40|$|A {{representative}} {{supersonic transport}} design was {{tested in the}} National Transonic Facility (NTF) in its original configuration with small-radius leading-edge flaps and also with modified large-radius inboard leading-edge flaps. Aerodynamic data were obtained over a range of Reynolds numbers at a Mach number of 0. 3 and angles of attack up to 16 deg. Increasing the radius of the inboard leading-edge flap delayed nose-up pitching moment to a higher lift coefficient. Deflecting the large-radius leading-edge flap produced an overall decrease in lift coefficient and delayed nose-up pitching moment to even higher angles of attack {{as compared with the}} undeflected large- <b>radius</b> leading-edge <b>flap.</b> At angles of attack corresponding to the maximum untrimmed lift-to-drag ratio, lift and drag coefficients decreased while lift-to-drag ratio increased with increasing Reynolds number. At an angle of attack of 13. 5 deg., the pitching-moment coefficient was nearly constant with increasing Reynolds number for both the small-radius leading-edge flap and the deflected large-radius leading-edge flap. However, the pitching moment coefficient increased with increasing Reynolds number for the undeflected large-radius leading-edge flap above a chord Reynolds number of about 35 x 10 (exp 6) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the pursuit}} of more {{advanced}} and environmentally-friendly technologies of today’s society, the airline industry has been pushed further to investigate solutions that will reduce airport noise and congestion, cut down on emissions, and improve the overall performance of aircraft. These items directly influence airport size (runway length), flight patterns in the community surrounding the airport, cruise speed, and many other aircraft design considerations which are setting the requirements for next generation aircraft. Leading the research in this movement is NASA, which has set specific goals {{for the next generation}} regional airliners and has categorized the designs that meet the criteria as Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Land (CESTOL) aircraft. With circulation control (CC) technology addressing most of the next generation requirements listed above, it has recently been gaining more interest, thus the basis of this research. CC is an active flow control method that uses a thin sheet of high momentum jet flow ejected over a curved trailing edge surface and in turn utilizes Coanda effect to increase the airfoil’s circulation, augmenting lift, drag, and pitching moment. The technology has been around for more than 75 years, but is now gaining more momentum for further development due to its significant payoffs in both performance and system complexity. The goal of this research was to explore the design of the CC flap shape and how it influences the local flow field of the system, in attempt to improve the performance of existing CC flap configurations and provide insight into the aerodynamic characteristics of the geometric parameters that make up the CC flap. Multiple dual radius flaps and alternative flap geometry, prescribed radius, flaps were developed by varying specific flap parameters from a baseline dual <b>radius</b> <b>flap</b> configuration that had been previously developed and researched. The aerodynamics of the various flap geometries were analyzed at three different flight conditions using two-dimensional CFD. The flight conditions examined include two low airspeed cases with blown flaps at 60 ° and 90 ° of deflection, and a transonic cruise case with no blowing and 0 ° of flap deflection. Results showed that the shorter flaps of both flap configurations augmented greater lift for the low airspeed cases, with the dual radius flaps producing more lift than the corresponding length prescribed radius. The large lift generation of these flaps was accompanied by significant drag and negative pitching moments. The incremental lift per drag and moment produced was best achieved by the longer flap lengths, with the prescribed radius flaps out-performing each corresponding dual radius. Longer flap configurations also upheld the better cruise performance with the least amount of low airspeed flow, drag, and required angle of attack for a given cruise lift coefficient. The prescribed radius flaps also presented a favorable trait of keeping a more continuous skin friction distribution over the flap when the flaps were deflected, where all dual radius configurations experienced a distinct fluctuation at the location where the surface curvature changes between its two radii. The prescribed radius flaps displayed a similar behavior when the flaps were not deflected, during the cruise conditions analyzed. Performance trends for the different flap configurations, at all three flight conditions, are presented {{at the end of each}} respective section to provide guidance into the design of CC geometry. The results of the presented research show promise in modifying geometric surface parameters to yield improved aerodynamics and performance...|$|E
40|$|Helicopter rotor {{primary control}} is {{conventionally}} carried out using a swashplate with pitch links. Eliminating the swashplate promises {{to reduce the}} helicopter's parasitic power in high speed forward flight, as well as {{may lead to a}} hydraulic-less vehicle. A Mach-scale swashplateless rotor is designed with integrated piezobender-actuated trailing edge flaps and systematically tested on the benchtop, in the vacuum chamber and on the hoverstand. The blade is nominally based on the UH- 60 rotor with a hover tip Mach number of 0. 64. The blade diameter is 66 inches requiring 2400 RPM for Mach scale simulation. The rotor hub is modified to reduce the blade fundamental torsional frequency to less than 2. 0 /rev by replacing the rigid pitch links with linear springs, which results in an increase of the blade pitching response to the trailing edge flaps. Piezoelectric multilayer benders provide the necessary bandwidth, stroke and stiffness to drive the flaps for primary control while fitting inside the blade profile and withstanding the high centrifugal forces. This work focuses on several key issues. A piezobender designed from a soft piezoelectric material, PZT- 5 K 4, is constructed. The new material is used to construct multi-layer benders with increased stroke for the same stiffness relative to hard materials such as PZT- 5 H 2. Each layer has a thickness of 10 mils. The soft material with gold electrodes requires a different bonding method than hard material with nickel electrodes. With this new bonding method, the measured stiffness matches precisely the predicted stiffness for a 12 layer bender with 1. 26 inch length and 1. 0 inch width with a stiffness of 1. 04 lb/mil. The final in-blade bender has a length of 1. 38 inches and 1. 0 inch width with a stiffness of 0. 325 lb/mil and stroke of 20. 2 mils for an energy output of 66. 3 lb-mil. The behavior of piezobenders under very high electric fields is investigated. High field means + 18. 9 kV/cm (limited by arcing in air) and - 3. 54 kV/cm (limited by depoling). An undocumented phenomenon is found called bender relaxation where the benders lose over half of their initial DC stroke over time. While the bender stiffness is shown not to change with electric field, the DC stroke is significantly less than AC stroke. A two-bladed Mach-scale rotor is constructed with each blade containing 2 flaps each actuated by a single piezobender. Each flap is 26. 5 % chord and 14 % span for a total of 28 % span centered at 75 % of the blade <b>radius.</b> <b>Flap</b> motion of greater than 10 degrees half peak-peak is obtained for all 4 flaps at 900 RPM on the hoverstand. So, the flaps show promise for the Mach-scale rotor speed of 2400 RPM. A PID loop is implemented for closed loop control of flap amplitude and mean position. On the hoverstand at 900 RPM, the swashplateless concept is demonstrated. The linear springs used to lower the torsional frequency are shown to have minimum friction during rotation. 1 /rev blade pitching of ± 1 degree is achieved at a torsional frequency of 1. 5 /rev for each blade. At resonance, the blade pitching for each blade is greater than ± 4 degrees. Primary control is demonstrated by measuring hub forces and moments. At resonance state, the flaps in conjunction with the blade pitching provide ± 15 lbs of normal force at a mean lift of 15 lbs yielding ± 100 % lift authority. Significant hub forces and moments are produced as well. For a production swashplateless helicopter, it may be prudent to eliminate the pitch links by reducing the blade structural stiffness. A novel wire sensor system network is proposed in order to measure blade elastic flap bending, lead-lag bending and torsion. The theory for measuring blade twist is rigorously derived. A blade is constructed with the wire sensor network and validated on the benchtop for blade elastic bending and twist. This work is a step forward in achieving a swashplateless rotor system. Not only would this reduce drag in high speed forward flight, but it would lead to a hydraulic-less rotorcraft. This would be a major step in vertical flight aviation...|$|E
40|$|A static {{acoustic}} and propulsion {{test of a}} {{small radius}} Jacobs-Hurkamp and a large <b>radius</b> Flex <b>Flap</b> combined with four upper surface blowing (USB) nozzles was performed. Nozzle force and flow data, flap trailing edge total pressure survey data, and acoustic data were obtained. Jacobs-Hurkamp flap surface pressure data, flow visualization photographs, and spoiler acoustic data from the limited mid-year tests are reported. A pressure ratio range of 1. 2 to 1. 5 was investigated for the USB nozzles and for the auxiliary blowing slots. The acoustic data were scaled to a four-engine STOL airplane of roughly 110, 000 kilograms or 50, 000 pounds gross weight, corresponding to a model scale of approximately 0. 2 for the nozzles without deflector. The model nozzle scale is actually reduced to about. 17 with deflector although all results in this report assume 0. 2 scale factor. Trailing edge pressure surveys indicated that poor flow attachment was obtained even at large flow impingement angles unless a nozzle deflector plate was used. Good attachment was obtained with the aspect ratio four nozzle with deflector, confirming the small scale wind tunnel tests...|$|R
40|$|Jet exhaust flow-turning {{characteristics}} were determined for systematic variations in upper-surface blowing exhaust nozzles and trailing-edge flap configuration variables from experimental wind-off (static) flow studies. For conditions with parallel flow exhausting from the nozzle, jet height (as indicated by nozzle exit height) and <b>flap</b> <b>radius</b> {{were found to}} be the most important parameters relating to flow turning. Nonparallel flow from the nozzle, as obtained from an internal roof angle and/or side spread angle, had a large favorable effect on flow turning. Comparisons made between static turning results and wind tunnel aerodynamic studies of identical configurations indicated that static flow-turning results can be indicative of wind-on powered lift performance for both good and poor nozzle-flap combinations but, for marginal designs, can lead to overly optimistic assessment of powered lift potential...|$|R
