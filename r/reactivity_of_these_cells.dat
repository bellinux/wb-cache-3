Thus, the present study explored the hypothesis that chronic hypoxemia also influences {{the size and shape of}} cerebrovascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, with parallel changes in the <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>cells</b> to endothelium-dependent vasodilator stimuli. To test this hypothesis, measurements of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell size and density were made in silver-stained common carotid and middle cerebral arteries from term fetal and non-pregnant adult sheep maintained at an altitude of 3, 820 m for 110 days. Chronic hypoxia induced an age-dependent remodeling that lead to smooth muscle cells that were larger in fetal arteries, but smaller in adult arteries. Chronic hypoxia also increased endothelial cell density in fetal arteries, but reduced it in adult arteries. These combined effects resulted in an increased (adult carotid), decreased (adult middle cerebral), or unchanged (fetal arteries) per-cell serosal volume of distribution for endothelial factors.

40|$|Summary Peripheral B-lymphocytes of 13 {{patients}} with uveal melanoma and of 5 healthy individuals were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> transformed <b>cells</b> with autologous or allogeneic melanoma cells and lymphocytes {{was measured by}} the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The response detected by the techniques available is likely to reflect antibody multispecificity leading to mis-identification of irrelevant antigens.

40|$|Recently, Vδ 2 - γδ T {{cells have}} been shown to be {{reactive}} against both cytomegalovirus (CMV) -infected cells and tumor cells. This dual reactivity can be important for clinical application after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, since CMV-infection causes morbidity and mortality in these patients. The dual reactive Vδ 2 - γδ T cells could be interesting as a treatment for these patients, since <b>these</b> <b>cells</b> are known to kill tumor cells, while at the same time control CMV infection and reactivation. The dual <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> Vδ 2 - γδ T is most likely caused by antigens expressed on both tumor and CMV-infected cells.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Accumulation of extracellular adenosine has been {{closely associated with}} human asthmatic responses. However, the relevance of adenosine signalling in equine airways has not previously been investigated. Objectives: To determine the expression of adenosine receptors (AR) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and assess the <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>cells</b> to AR ligands ex vivo, employing IL- 6 as readout of adenosinergic inflammatory signalling. Methods: Eight horses {{with varying degrees of}} lower airway inflammation and 10 healthy controls were analysed. Expression of AR-subtypes in each BAL sample was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and compared to that in 13 other tissues. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells were stimulated either with the adenosine analogue NECA, CGS- 21680 (A(2 A) AR selective agonist) or with a combination of NECA and SCH- 58261 (A(2 A) AR antagonist) and IL- 6 expression assessed. Results: Bronchoalveolar lavage cells predominantly expressed A(2 B) AR, with lower A(2 A) AR levels and marginal A(3) AR expression; A(1) AR was not detected. This pattern was similar to that of PBMCs but different from the other tissues tested. No significant differences in AR expression in BAL cells from both groups were detected, although a trend for decreased A(2 B) AR in airway-compromised horses was observed. Treatment of BAL cells with the nonselective agonist NECA upregulated IL- 6 expression in cells from airway-compromised horses, but levels remained unchanged in control animals. Furthermore, blockage of A(2 A) AR with SCH- 58261 enhanced IL- 6 mRNA induction by NECA in both groups, with higher levels in airway-compromised horses; the amplitude of this response correlated with neutrophil count. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the presence of an adenosine/IL- 6 inflammatory axis in the bronchoalveolar milieu of airway-compromised horses. While A(2 B) AR is the predominant proinflammatory AR subtype expressed, A(2 A) AR appears to modulate inflammatory signalling (IL- 6 expression) by adenosine. Potential relevance: This study supports selective AR targeting as a potential therapeutic approach for the modulation of inflammation in the equine lower respiratory tract...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{mediated}} immune responses (CMIR), {{mediated by}} T-lymphocytes, {{have been shown}} {{to play a role in}} tumour immunity and allograft rejection. Studies of specific cytotoxic responses indicate that the cells involved in the CMIR are capable of recognizing various cell surface markers. Although many investigations have been conducted the exact nature of the target antigens are not known.;Sensitization of human T cells in Marbrook tissue culture vessels and microtitre trays resulted in the production of effector cells capable of lysing certain target cells. The characterization of the <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>cells</b> was carried out in two systems, the first in which the target cell had been chemically modified with trinitrobenzene-sulphonic acid, and the second in which the target cells were not modified.;The effector cell capable of lysing chemically modified targets did not exhibit MHC restricted cytotoxicity. The cell was a large granular lymphocyte that resided in the non-T cell fraction of cells separated through sheep erythrocyte rosette formation. The cytotoxicity could also be developed, without specific sensitizing antigen, in the presence of factors derived during the generation of an allogeneic response. On the basis of the above observations it was concluded that the predominant effector cell within this system was a human NK-like cell.;Cytotoxic lymphocytes capable of lysing unmodified cells were directed at either major histocompatibility complex (MHC) coded targets or at stable, non-MHC coded targets. Three types of reactivity were delineated; (1) MHC explainable, (2) explainable on the basis of specific antigens on the cell surface that are not MHC antigens, and (3) reactivity that was not specific for a particular cell surface antigen.;Analysis of the distribution of reactivity within the two systems suggest that the primary CMIR is directed against modified self components of the target cell and that it is mediated by an NK-like cell. This form of reactivity is observed between MHC identical transplant pairs, certain randomly selected individuals from the normal population, and in response to hapten and tumour antigen altered self. Greater antigenic differences activate more specific T cells that mediate a selective, MHC specific response that is the major form of reactivity observed in anti-allogeneic responses or during allograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Sr-substituted hydroxyapatites (HA), of general formula Ca(10 −x) Srx(PO 4) 6 (OH) 2, where x= 2 and 4, were {{synthesized}} by solid state methods and characterized extensively. The <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> materials in <b>cell</b> culture medium was evaluated, {{and the behavior}} towards MG- 63 osteoblast cells (in terms of cytotoxicity and proliferation assays) was studied. Future in vivo studies will give further insights into {{the behavior of the}} materials. A paper by Lagergren et al. (1975), concerning Sr-substituted HA prepared by a solid state method, reports that the presence of Sr in the apatite composition strongly influences the apatite diffraction patterns. Zeglinsky et al. (2012) investigated Sr-substituted HA by ab initio methods and Rietveld analyses and reported changes in the HA unit cell volume and shape due to the Sr addition. To further clarify the role played by the addition of Sr on the physico-chemical properties <b>of</b> <b>these</b> materials we prepared Sr-substituted HA compositions by a solid state method, using different reagents, thermal treatments and a multi-technique approach. Our results indicated that the introduction of Sr at the levels considered here does influence the structure of HA. There is also evidence of a decrease in the crystallinity degree of thematerials upon Sr addition. The introduction of increasing amounts of Sr into the HA composition causes a decrease in the specific surface area and an enrichment of Sr-apatite phase at the surface of the samples. Bioactivity tests show that the presence of Sr causes changes in particle size and/ormorphology during soaking inMEMsolution; on the contrary the morphology of pure HA does not change after 14 days of reaction. The presence of Sr, as Sr-substituted HA and SrCl 2, in cultures of human MG- 63 osteoblasts did not produce any cytotoxic effect. In fact, Sr-substituted HA increased the proliferation of osteoblast cells and enhanced cell differentiation: Sr in HA has a positive effect on MG- 63 cells. In contrast, Sr ions alone, at the concentrations released by Sr-HA (1. 21 – 3. 24 ppm), influenced neither cell proliferation nor differentiation. Thus the positive effects of Sr in Sr-HA materials are probably due to the co-action of other ions such as Ca and P...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the A receptors was studied among 'agglutinated' and 'free' populations of A variant RBC (A 3, AX, Aend) known to be either partially or weakly agglutinated by human anti-A reagents. Following separation of the red cell populations and disaggregation of the clumps by mild treatment with soluble blood group substances, it was shown after appropriate controls, that among A 3 ARBC, the 'agglutinated' RBC have {{at least five times}} as 'free' RBC, these latter however being strongly A positive. The differences between the A antigenic content of the AX RBC were less pronounced. The most striking result was obtained with the Aend RBC, where two populations are clearly demonstrated; the first, including 5 - 10 per cent of the RBC, strongly agglutinates with anti-A and contains erythrocytes of high antigenic content (140, 000 A receptors per cell). The second, including the majority of RBC could not be differentiated from the control O RBC. A wide heterogeneity of antibody binding capacity of the various populations of A 3, AX and Aend red cells, was also demonstrated following ultrastructural examination by immunoelectron microscopy with peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Such study reveals furthermore an heterogeneity of labelling from one cell to another in the same population of red blood cells. Comparison of 'week A' RBC and O RBC enzymatically converted into A RBC, demonstrates a similar pattern <b>of</b> <b>reactivity</b> between <b>these</b> <b>cells,</b> and supports the general relationship between antigen site density and red cell agglutination. It is concluded that the typical pattern of agglutinability of A 3 and AX RBC arises both from their heterogeneous antigenic content and from the occurrence of an antigenic threshold below which red cells become non-agglutinable. The typical mixed-field agglutination pattern of Aend RBC merely reflects the occurrence of a probably true dual population of RBC. Finally, the mechanisms of inheritance of such well-known Mendelian characters, enabling the production of highly heterogeneous blood cell populations in the same individual, remains to be elucidated...|$|R
