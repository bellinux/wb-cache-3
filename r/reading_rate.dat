40|$|AbstractWord {{recognition}} thresholds {{and rapid}} serial visual presentation (RSVP) <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> for both unrelated words and meaningful sentences were examined across the visual field. Both word recognition thresholds and RSVP <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> for unrelated words can be equated across the visual field {{by an increase}} in size scale. RSVP <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> for meaningful sentences cannot be equated across the visual field, with the fovea demonstrating a qualitative superiority over the periphery, irrespective of scale. The results suggest that the early visual machinery which underlies word recognition is the same across the visual field apart from a change in scale, whilst the periphery is qualitatively inferior to the fovea at interpreting sentences with meaning.

40|$|Network {{switches}} and routers need to serve packet writes and <b>reads</b> at <b>rates</b> that challenge {{the most advanced}} memory technologies. As a result, scaling the switching rates is commonly done by parallelizing the packet I/Os using multiple memory units. For improved <b>read</b> <b>rates,</b> packets can be coded with an [n,k] MDS code, thus giving more flexibility at read time to achieve higher utilization of the memory units. In the paper, we study the usage of [n,k] MDS codes in a switching environment. In particular, we study the algorithmic problem of maximizing the instantaneous <b>read</b> <b>rate</b> given a set of packet requests and the current layout of the coded packets in memory. The most interesting results from practical standpoint show how the complexity of reaching optimal <b>read</b> <b>rate</b> depends strongly on the writing policy of the coded packets.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} coloured light filter overlays on <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> for people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Method: Using a prospective clinical trial design, we examined the null hypothesis that coloured light filter overlays do not improve <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> in AMD when compared to a clear filter. Reading rates for 12 subjects with non-exudative AMD, associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation (mean age 81 years, SD 5. 07 years) were determined using the Rate of Reading Test® (printed, nonsense, lower case sans serif, stationary text) with 10 different, coloured light filter overlays (Intuitive Overlays®; figures in brackets are percentage transmission values); rose (78 %), pink (78 %), purple (67 %), aqua (81 %), blue (74 %), lime-green (86 %), mint-green (85 %), yellow (93 %), orange (83 %) and grey (71 %). A clear overlay (Roscolene # 00) (360 cdm- 2) with 100 % transmittance was used as a control. Results: ANOVA indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> with the coloured light filter overlays compared to the clear filter. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis indicated that the rose, purple and blue filters had a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> compared to the other coloured and clear light filters. Conclusion: Coloured light filter overlays are unlikely to provide a clinically significant improvement in <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> for people with non-exudative AMD associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the center}} of a readers, visual field is blocked from view, <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> decline and eye {{movement}} patterns change. This is true whether the central visual field is blocked artificially (i. e. a mask) or through disease (e. g. a retinal scotoma due to macular degeneration). In past studies, when mask size was defined {{in terms of the number}} of letters masked from view, <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> declined sharply as number of letters masked increased. Patients with larger central scotomas (in degrees of visual angle) also read slower. We sought to determine whether number of letters masked or size of the mask in degrees is the predominant factor affecting <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> and eye movement behavior. By matching number of letters masked across several mask sizes (and compensating for reduced acuity in the periphery), we found that number of letters masked is the more important factor until mask size is quite large (≥− 7. 5 °) and number of letters masked from view is more than seven...|$|R

50|$|When {{a single}} column of 24 pixels is scanned across {{a line of}} text, all of the {{information}} is acquired. However, with the sense of touch, people are capable of perceiving two dimensional images. Bliss wondered if the <b>reading</b> <b>rate</b> would be higher if more than one column of 24 pixels were used, and if so, how many columns would be appropriate? Experiments with the computer simulation determined that <b>reading</b> <b>rate</b> increased dramatically up to 6 columns, which was a window width of about one letter space and this was about the maximum number of columns that could be placed on one finger. Jon Taenzer, one of Bliss’ Stanford graduate students, ran visual reading experiments on the same computer simulation and determined that for visual reading, reading rates continued to increase up to a window width of up to about 6 letter spaces. This led to a number of experiments toward trying to increase the tactile <b>reading</b> <b>rate</b> by increasing the number of columns in the tactile screen so more than one letter would be in view at a time. Instead of moving the text across only the index fingertip, tests were run with a screen wide enough for both the index finger and the middle finger to be used so two letters could be simultaneously tactually sensed. In another experiment the moving belt of text was run {{down the length of the}} fingers, rather than across them. The only approach that showed any promise of increasing the <b>reading</b> <b>rate</b> was when both index fingers were used, rather than the index finger and the adjacent middle finger. However, the use of both index fingers was incompatible with the design concept of using one hand to control the camera while the other hand sensed the tactile screen. The Optacon design was therefore based on an array of 24-by-6 pixels in both the camera retina and bimorph array.|$|E

The question arose whether silent <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> would correlate with oral <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> across languages. Although silent and oral reading fluency has been studied with respect to reading comprehension and how it develops in children, little literature focuses on comparing them in different languages. We present here data for 8 languages (Cantonese, Finnish, French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Serbian, and Thai).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the theoretical upper limit (best possible) reading performance attainable with a state-of-the-art 60 -channel retinal implant and to find the optimum viewing conditions for the task. Four normal volunteers performed full-page text reading tasks with a low resolution, 60 -pixel viewing window that was stabilized in the central visual field. Two parameters were systematically varied: (1) spatial resolution (image magnification) and (2) the orientation of the rectangular viewing window. Performance was measured in terms of reading accuracy (% of correctly read words) and <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> (words/min). Maximum <b>reading</b> performances were reached at spatial resolutions between 3. 6 and 6 pixels/char. Performance declined outside this range for all subjects. In optimum viewing conditions (4. 5 pixels/char), subjects achieved almost perfect reading accuracy and mean <b>reading</b> <b>rates</b> of 26 words/min for the vertical viewing window and of 34 words/min for the horizontal viewing window.
