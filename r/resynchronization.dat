25|$|Cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy (CRT) is {{used for}} people with heart failure in whom {{the left and right}} ventricles do not {{contract}} simultaneously (ventricular dyssynchrony), which occurs in approximately 25–50% of heart failure patients. To achieve CRT, a biventricular pacemaker (BVP) is used, which can pace both the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle. By pacing both sides of the left ventricle, the pacemaker can resynchronize the ventricular contractions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{condition}} is diagnosed {{based on the}} history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [...] or angiotensin receptor blockers along with beta blockers are recommended. For those with severe disease, aldosterone antagonists, or hydralazine with a nitrate may be used. Diuretics are useful for preventing fluid retention. Sometimes, depending on the cause, an implanted device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended.

50|$|An {{implanted}} cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> {{device is}} a medical device used in cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy (CRT). It resynchronizes the contractions of the heart’s ventricles by sending tiny electrical impulses to the heart muscle, which can help the heart pump blood throughout the body more efficiently. CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) also incorporate the additional function of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, to quickly terminate an abnormally fast, life-threatening heart rhythm. CRT and CRT-D have become increasingly important therapeutic options for patients with moderate and severe heart failure.|$|E

5000|$|Cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy (CRT) is an {{effective}} therapy in patients with heart failure and dyssynchrony identified as a prolonged QRS duration.

50|$|Supported by National Institutes of Health funding, Spotnitz pioneered {{quantitative}} echo studies during cardiac surgery. This {{research has}} documented substantial improvements in cardiac output among heart surgery patients undergoing biventricular pacing (also known as cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy), which involves installation of pacemakers to fix delays in heart ventricle contractions {{and keeps the}} left/right ventricles pumping together (CUMC 2007).|$|E
50|$|Although {{studies on}} CCM therapy {{have focused on}} {{patients}} with a normal QRS duration (i.e. ≤ 120 ms), {{it is possible to}} use CCM in patients who meet the treatment indication but who do not have a normal QRS duration.

50|$|Synchronization {{starts with}} a hard {{synchronization}} on the first recessive to dominant transition {{after a period of}} bus idle (the start bit). <b>Resynchronization</b> occurs on every recessive to dominant transition during the frame. The CAN controller expects the transition to occur at a multiple of the nominal bit time. If the transition does not occur at the exact time the controller expects it, the controller adjusts the nominal bit time accordingly.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Skylink {{produced}} a universal transmitter called Model 39 {{that was designed}} to work for both rolling code and non-rolling code GDOs. The Model 39 bypasses the Chamberlain's rolling code system by imitating Security+'s <b>resynchronization</b> feature. The Model 39 transmitter sends three fixed codes in rapid succession; this either causes the door to open due to the first code or it causes the door to resynchronize and open due to the latter two codes.|$|E
50|$|In another study, ischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} in the murine infarction {{model was}} targeted by iPS cell transplantation. It synchronized failing ventricles, offering a regenerative strategy to achieve <b>resynchronization</b> and protection from decompensation {{by dint of}} improved left ventricular conduction and contractility, reduced scarring and reversal of structural remodelling.One protocol generated populations of up to 98% cardiomyocytes from hPSCs simply by modulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway at defined time points in during differentiation, using readily accessible small molecule compounds.|$|E
50|$|Practically, the {{duration}} of one burst is {{in the range of}} several hundred milliseconds whereas the power-save time may amount to several seconds. A lead time for powering up the front end, for <b>resynchronization,</b> etc. has to be taken into account; this time period is assumed to be less than 250 ms according to the DVB-H technical standard. Depending on the ratio of on-time / power-save time, the resulting power saving may be more than 90%.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{a related}} key attack was {{published}} in September 2006 by Ozgul Kucuk in the paper [...] "Slide <b>Resynchronization</b> Attack on the Initialization of Grain 1.0". The paper claims: [...] "we find related keys and initial values of the stream cipher Grain 1.0. For any (K,IV) pair there exist related (K’,IV’) pair with probability 1/22 that generates 1-bit shifted keystream. Although this does not result in an efficient key recovery attack yet, it indicates a weakness in the initialization which could be [...] with a little effort." ...|$|E
5000|$|Synchronous {{communication}} {{requires that}} the clocks in the transmitting and receiving devices are synchronized [...] - [...] running {{at the same rate}} [...] - [...] so the receiver can sample the signal at the same time intervals used by the transmitter. No start or stop bits are required. For this reason [...] "synchronous communication permits more information to be passed over a circuit per unit time" [...] than asynchronous serial communication. Over time the transmitting and receiving clocks will tend to drift apart, requiring <b>resynchronization.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{transition}} {{that occurs}} {{before or after}} it is expected causes the controller to calculate the time difference and lengthen phase segment 1 or shorten phase segment 2 by this time. This effectively adjusts {{the timing of the}} receiver to the transmitter to synchronize them. This <b>resynchronization</b> process is done continuously at every recessive to dominant transition to ensure the transmitter and receiver stay in sync. Continuously resynchronizing reduces errors induced by noise, and allows a receiving node that was synchronized to a node which lost arbitration to resynchronize to the node which won arbitration.|$|E
50|$|The workshop's {{structure}} is essentially based on {{different kinds of}} scientific sessions, including symposia, debates, lectures, live cases presentations, satellite events, interative and e-learning sessions, oral and poster communications and an allied professionals program, too.All these sessions deal with the most important topics concerning the cardiology and arrhythmology fields - such as atrial fibrillation, palpitations, anti-thrombotic therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy, remote monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias/devices, sudden death, new technologies and techniques in catheter ablation, sport and arrhythmias, cardiac arrhythmias surgery and also arrhythmias clinical trial updates.|$|E
5000|$|In Left bundle branch block (LBBB), the {{asynchronous}} {{activation of}} the left ventricle gives asynchronous contraction as well.

Disappointingly, large scale studies {{have not been able to}} establish additional echo criteria for selection of Heart failure patients with LBBB who may respond to Cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy, although smaller studies are promising ...|$|E
