Secret nationalist societies began to form in the 1910s.

Germany's defeat of the French army and occupation of France in 1940, the imposition of a Vichy regime on Madagascar and the subsequent occupation of the island by the British in 1942 further tarnished the colonial government's image. Popular anger was especially aroused by its policies of forced labor in lieu of taxes, involuntary conscription into the army to fight in World War II, and the <b>required</b> <b>contribution</b> of large quantities of rice per head annually.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} above, employers that {{choose to}} sponsor a self-funded health benefits plan truly {{do so at}} their own risk. To be self-funded, the employer necessarily retains one hundred percent {{of the risk of}} the payment of the health benefits claims of plan participants. The practical effect of that is that many small groups simply cannot afford to self-fund; a common theory is that groups with too few employees are unable to collect a contribution sufficient to allow the employer to pay health benefits claims without bankrupting itself. While the practical solution to this is simply to charge a higher and higher contribution as necessary, both the Affordable Care Act and the general business considerations prevent raising the employee’s <b>required</b> <b>contribution</b> amount above a certain level.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2010, the Pew Center on the States {{identified}} {{four states}} that demonstrate {{different approaches to}} designing and managing retirement systems: Florida, Nebraska, Iowa and Georgia. [...] Florida's method for calculating annual contribution rates incorporates a portion of any unfunded liability into upcoming actuarially <b>required</b> <b>contributions</b> so that the bill is paid off over time. The state has legally mandated that pension surpluses of less than 5 percent of total liabilities will be reserved to pay for unexpected losses in the system -- {{and even if the}} surplus is greater than 5 percent of total liabilities, only a fraction can be used to reduce participating employer contributions. This process allows for a rebate in <b>required</b> employer <b>contributions</b> to the FRS when the fund is more than 100% funded, and mandates employers contributions in excess of normal <b>required</b> <b>contributions</b> to make up any unfunded liability when the fund is less than 100% funded.|$|R

50|$|Each {{county and}} {{district}} that participates in TCDRS maintains its own customized plan of benefits. This gives employers the flexibility and local control to select {{and pay for}} benefits based on their needs and budget. Employers review their plans annually and {{have the option to}} raise or lower benefits to control costs.Employees save for their own retirement over the length of their careers. TCDRS benefits are based on an employee’s total savings balance, which includes interest and employer matching contributions. This structure prevents benefit manipulation—or “benefit spiking”—sometimes found in plans using final average salary benefit formulas.Benefits are funded by each county or district and its employees. Each employer must pay 100% of its <b>required</b> <b>contribution</b> each year. This ensures the necessary money is saved and avoids pushing retirement costs onto future generations of workers.|$|E

50|$|Pension {{computations}} {{are often}} performed by actuaries using assumptions regarding {{current and future}} demographics, life expectancy, investment returns, levels of contributions or taxation, and payouts to beneficiaries, among other variables. One area of contention relates to the assumed annual rate of investment return. If a higher investment return is assumed, relatively lower contributions are demanded of those paying into the system. Critics have argued that investment return assumptions are artificially inflated, to reduce the <b>required</b> <b>contribution</b> amounts by individuals and governments paying into the pension system. For example, bond yields (the return on guaranteed investments) in the US and elsewhere are low (and the U.S.and other stock markets did not consistently beat inflation between 2000 and 2010). But many pensions have annual investment return assumptions in the 7-8% p.a. range, which are closer to the pre-2000 average return. If these rates were lowered by 1-2 percentage points, the required pension contributions taken from salaries or via taxation would increase dramatically. By one estimate, each 1% reduction means 10% more in contributions. For example, if a pension program reduced its investment return rate assumption from 8% pa to 7% pa, a person contributing $100 per month to their pension {{would be required to}} contribute $110. Attempting to sustain better-than-market returns can also cause portfolio managers to take on more risk.|$|E
50|$|The Michigan Office of Retirement Services (ORS) administers {{retirement}} {{programs for}} Michigan's state employees, public school employees, judges, state police, and National Guard. ORS also provides various retiree healthcare benefits, including traditional insurance plans, Personal Healthcare Funds, and Health Reimbursement Accounts. ORS serves over 515,000 customers (approximately 250,000 active and 265,000 retired), representing {{one out of}} every fourteen Michigan adults. ORS customers live in approximately {{one out of every}} nine Michigan households. The state employee system and the public school employee system administered by ORS make up 80 percent of all active plan membership in Michigan.ORS is responsible for the 16th largest public pension system in the United States and the 48th largest pension system in the world, managing combined net assets of nearly $60.9 billion. In fiscal year 2014, ORS paid out over $6.9 billion in pension and health benefits. According to the Pensionomics 2012 report from the National Institute on Retirement Security, pensions paid to Michigan retirees generated $9.2 billion in total spending in the state of Michigan. A recent Pew study ranks ORS in the top ten state pension systems for paying the highest percentage of their annual <b>required</b> <b>contribution</b> for pension plans, which demonstrates a commitment to fiscal responsibility. ORS is a division of Michigan's Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB).|$|E
30|$|The other {{challenge}} {{is related to}} the absence of experts.
