50|$|Numbers are entered using slides (one slide per digit) on {{the side}} of the device. The <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and result counter appear on the top. A single turn of the crank adds the input number to the result counter, at any position, and {{increments}} the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> accordingly. Pulling the crank upwards slightly before turning performs a subtraction instead of an addition. Multiplication, division, and other functions require a series of crank and carriage-shifting operations.|$|R

50|$|The {{cabin is}} made from steel and glass fibre and its top is detachable. All windows are made from safety glass and the side windows {{as well as the}} {{windscreen}} are openable. There are seats for driver and two passengers; the driver's seat is adjustable. The gauge panel is comprehensive, including a <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (<b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> and valve head temperature indicator). Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, Hobbs meter, ELT or turn indicators.|$|R
50|$|The Curta {{was also}} favored by both {{commercial}} and general-aviation pilots, {{before the advent}} of electronic calculators, because of both its precision and the user's ability to confirm the accuracy of his or her manipulations via the <b>revolution</b> <b>counter.</b> Because calculations such as weight and balance are critical for safe flight, precise results free of pilot error are essential.|$|R

The T3rupt and Dsrupt interrupts were produced when their <b>counters,</b> <b>driven</b> by a 100Hz hardware clock, overflowed after executing many Pinc subsequences.

The compression ratio was increased to 6.8 : 1, a downdraught carburettor fitted {{and an extra}} large exhaust pipe with special Pullswell silencer.

50|$|To {{ensure the}} Bug hit its target, a {{mechanical}} system was devised that would track the aircraft's distance flown. Before takeoff, technicians determined {{the distance to}} be traveled relative to the air, taking into account wind speed and direction along the flight path. This was {{used to calculate the}} total number of engine revolutions needed for the Bug to reach its destination. When a total <b>revolution</b> <b>counter</b> reached this value a cam dropped down which shut off the engine and retracted the bolts attaching the wings, which fell off. The Bug began a ballistic trajectory into the target; the impact detonated the payload of 180 lb of explosives.|$|R
