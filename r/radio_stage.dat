2500|$|When the Wind Blows, {{a graphic}} novel by Raymond Briggs, was {{published}} in 1982. [...] The novel is a bitter satire on the Publicized Civil Defense advice given by the British government(Protect and Survive) about how to survive a nuclear war, where a working-class couple that {{do not believe that}} nuclear war is possible die of radiation sickness after a nuclear explosion. It reflects Briggs’ participation in the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Briggs is best known as a writer and illustrator of children’s literature, but this novel was written for an older audience and is his bleakest work (though the story is not without humour). The novel’s message greatly affected young adult readers. Briggs rewrote the novel for <b>radio,</b> <b>stage,</b> and an animated film that was released in 1986.|$|E
