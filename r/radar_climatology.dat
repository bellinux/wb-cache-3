Continental mosaics of radar data have now been generated {{for more than twenty}} years. These offer information on precipitation climatology that is simply not available or archived elsewhere: How often does it rain at any particular location? At what time? And with what intensity distribution? What are the geographical and temporal patterns of precipitation occurrence, formation, and decay? What is the climatology of severe weather? Answers to these questions have value on their own and also invariably trigger more questions about the processes causing these patterns as well as suggest some answers. They also have considerable pedagogical value to illustrate in the classroom the impacts on precipitation of different processes such as sea-land breezes, topography, and seasons. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year <b>radar</b> <b>climatology</b> {{of summer}} season (May-Sept.) {{thunderstorm}} and intense thunderstorm daysfor New Jersey was developed using manually digitized radar (MDR) data from four local radar sites. Echo intensity levels equal to 3 or more {{were determined to}} be associated with sll/face reports of thunder in the majority of cases (75 percent). Intense thunderstorm days were arbitrarily defined to occur when echo intensity levels reached 5 or 6. A network of 63 grid boxes located in and around New Jersey was used to tabulate thunderstorm and intense thunderstorm days frequencies over a 5 -season period (1978 - 1982). Frequencies and averages of thunderstorm days were plotted by grid box and isoplethed by month and season. Thunderstorm and intense thunder-storm day frequencies by month were generally highest over interior sections of southeastern Pennsylvania and south-western New Jersey. When thunderstorm and intense thun-derstorm days were averaged over 4 seasons the maximum frequencies were found over southwestern and northern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania. Comparisons to con-ventional c 1 imatologies indicated that despite some similar-ities, the radar-based climatology provided much finer res-olution and indicated frequencies over urban areas to be higher than conventional values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{provides}} the first climatological synthesis of how urbanization augments warm-season convection among {{a range of}} cities in the southeastern U. S. By comparing the location of convection in these cities and adjacent control regions via high-resolution, radar reflectivity and lightning data, we illustrate that demographic and land-use changes feed back to local atmospheric processes that promote thunderstorm formation and persistence. Composite radar data for a 10 -year, June– August period are stratified according to specific “medium ” and “high ” reflectivity thresholds. As surrogates for potentially strong (medium reflectivity) and severe (high reflectivity) thunderstorms, these <b>radar</b> <b>climatologies</b> {{can be used to}} determine if cities are inducing more intense events. Results demonstrate positive urban amplification of thunderstorm frequency and intensity for major cities. Mid-sized cities investigated had more subtle urban effects, suggesting that the urban influences on thunderstorm development and strength are muted by land cover and climatological controls. By examining cities of various sizes, as well as rural counterparts, the investigation determined that the degree of urban thunderstorm augmentation corresponds to the geometry of the urban footprint. The research provides a methodological template for continued monitoring of anthropogenically forced and/or modified thunderstorms...|$|R

40|$|A {{climatology}} of convection initiation (CI) and convective enhancements (CE) {{has been}} developed using radar reflectivity data in southwestern Germany and eastern France over the period of MayÃ¢Â�Â�August of 2000 Ã¢Â�Â� 2006 and 2008. The study region included the Vosges Mountains of France, the Rhine Valley which straddles France and Germany, the Black ForestMountains and the SwabianMountains of Germany. Convection occurred frequently {{during the summer months}} throughout the study region. The CI density (number of initiations per square km) illustrates preferential formation in the mountain regions while the CE events spanned both mountains and valleys nearly equally. There is a strongmid-day peak of the CI events suggesting that diurnal heating is critical for CI in the region. The very strong thunderstorms (> 46 dBZ) first occurred in the mountains and Ã¢Â�Â¼ 2 h later in the Rhine Valley. During the summer of 2007, the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS) field campaign was conducted with the objective of obtaining improved understanding of convective processes and short-term quantitative precipitation forecasting in low-mountain regions. Comparisons were made between the <b>radar</b> <b>climatology</b> results and the COPS summer. The COPS summer exhibited preferential CI density in the mountainous regions but not as pronounced as the climatology. The COPS summer had a similar diurnal peak of CI events as climatology but the ratio of daytime to nighttime CI (1. 7), or amplitude of the diurnal cycle, was less than that of climatology (3. 0). While both the 8 -year climatology and COPS summer were dominated by daytime, locally-forced CI occurrences, the broad distribution of daytime CI events and increase in nighttime events observed during COPS indicate a more active synoptic pattern in 2007...|$|E

A Springtime (March 15 -June 15) climatology of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) has been established on the basis of satellite imagery and radar reflectivities over the Northwest Gulf of Mexico and adjacent coastal areas during 1985 - 1994. The systems are tracked using hourly to half-hourly GOES- 7 enhanced infrared satellite imagery. After tracking the storm's upper level cloud shield, radar reflectivities were used to classify the organization of convection within the MCS. The nine primary classes of convective structure were enhanced stratiform rain, embedded unorganized storms, unorganized storms, organized cells, solid line, symmetric line, asymmetric line, multiple convective bands, and embedded line. An examination was performed {{of the relationship between the}} synoptic-scale environment with the structure and evolution of these storms. Particular attention was given to synoptic-scale factors that affect convective organization. Climatological attributes such as diurnal characteristics and average durations were extracted from a documentation of more than 3 @O meso-systems. Also, severe weather produced by the MCSs was examined. In addition, wind shear and thermodynamic parameters were analyzed during the initial phases of storm development. Since a climatological study has never been recorded for this region, the analysis will be informative for determining what type of interactions there are between synoptic scale forcing and mesoscale weather features in this area. Comparison with similar climatologies conducted in the Central Plains of the US was made to determine if MCS activity in a semi-tropical location was similar to that in more northern latitudes. Moreover, this <b>radar</b> <b>climatology</b> may be used as a resource in the planning of field experiments or operations concerning mesoscale weather throughout the southern portion of the US...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{corrections}} of radar {{data are}} a crucial prerequisite for radar derived climatology. This kind of climatology demands {{a high level}} of data quality. Little deviations or minor systematic underestimations or overestimations in single radar images become a major cause of error in statistical analysis. First results of radar derived climatology have emerged over the last years, as data sets of appropriate extent are becoming available. Usually, these statistics are based on time series lasting up to ten years as storage of radar data was not achieved before. We present a new statistical post-correction scheme, which is based on seven years of radar data of the Munich weather radar (2000 – 2006) that is operated by DWD (German Weather Service). The typical correction algorithms for single radar images, such as clutter corrections, are used. Then an additional statistical post-correction {{based on the results of}} a climatological analysis from radar images follows. The aim of this statistical correction is to correct systematic errors caused by clutter effects or measuring effects but to conserve small-scale natural variations in space. The statistical correction is based on a thorough analysis of the different causes of possible errors for the Munich weather radar. This robust analysis revealed the following basic effects: the decrease of rain rate in relation to height and distance from the radar, clutter effects such as remaining clutter, eliminated clutter or shading effects from obstacles near the radar, visible as spokes, as well as the influence of the Bright Band. The correction algorithm is correspondingly based on these results. It consists of three modules. The first one is an altitude correction, which minimizes measuring effects. The second module corrects clutter effects and the third one realizes a mean adjustment to selected rain gauges. Two different radar products are used. The statistical analysis as well as module one and module two of the correction algorithm are based on frequencies of occurrence of the so-called PX-product with six reflectivity levels. For correction module 3 and for the validation of the correction algorithm rain rates are calculated from the 8 -bit-depth so-called DX-product. An application (2004 – 2006) and a validation (2007 – 2009) of this correction algorithm with rain gauges show a much higher conformity for <b>radar</b> <b>climatology</b> after the statistical correction. In the years 2004 to 2006 the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) decreases from 262 mm to 118 mm excluding those pair of values where the rain gauges are situated in areas of obviously corrupted radar data. The results for the validation period 2007 to 2009 are based on all pairs of values and show a decline of the RMSE from 322 mm to 174 mm...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of Colorado State University (CSU) Na lidar {{observations}} over full diurnal cycles from May 2002 to April 2006, a harmonic analysis was performed to extract semidiurnal perturbations in mesopause region temperature and zonal and meridional winds over Fort Collins, Colorado (40. 6 °N, 105. 1 °W). The observed monthly results are in good agreement with MF <b>radar</b> tidal <b>climatology</b> for Urbana, Illinois, and with predictions of the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA), sampled at the CSU Na lidar coordinates. The observed semidiurnal tidal period perturbation within the mesopause region {{is found to be}} dominated by propagating modes in winter and equinoctial months with a combined vertical wavelength varying from 50 km to almost 90 km and by a mode with evanescent behavior and longer vertical wavelength (100 – 150 km) in summer months, most likely due to dominance of (2, 2) and (2, 3) tidal (Hough) modes. The observed semidiurnal tidal amplitude shows strong seasonal variation, with a large amplitude during the winter months, with a higher growth rate above ∼ 85 – 90 km, and minimal amplitudes during the summer months. Maximum tidal amplitudes over 50 m/s for wind and 12 K for temperature occur during fall equinox. A detailed comparison with HAMMONIA predictions shows excellent agreement in semidiurnal phases. HAMMONIA-predicted semidiurnal amplitudes generally agree well with observations; however, HOMMONIA underestimates temperature amplitudes in some of the nonsummer months as well as zonal wind and meridional wind amplitudes in April and September but overestimates them in February. To reveal the effects of the atmospheric background on vertical propagation of tidal modes and their relative importance in the composite semidiurnal tide during different seasons, we use the lidar-observed monthly mean temperature and zonal wind from the same data set as well as HAMMONIA output to calculate the vertical wave number seasonal variations of the major tidal modes of the migrating semidiurnal tide. This leads to a qualitative understanding of the lidar-observed and HAMMONIA-predicted seasonal variation of the semidiurnal tidal perturbation...|$|R
40|$|A five-year (2006 – 10) radar-based {{climatology}} of tropopause folds and convective storms {{was constructed}} for Wales, United Kingdom, {{to determine how}} deep, moist convection is modulated by tropopause folds. Based on the continuous, high-resolution data from a very high frequency (VHF) wind-profiling radar located at Capel Dewi, Wales, 183 tropopause folds were identified. Tropopause folds were most frequent in January with a secondary maximum in July. Based on data from the U. K. weather <b>radar</b> network, a <b>climatology</b> of 685 convective storms was developed. The occurrence of convective storms was relatively high year-round except for an abrupt minimum in February–April. Multicellular lines (43. 5 %) were the most common morphology with a maximum in October, followed by isolated cells (33. 1 %) with a maximum in May–September, and nonlinear clusters (23. 4 %) with a maximum in November–January. Convective storms were associated with 104 (56. 8 %) of the tropopause folds identified in this study, with the association strongest inDecember. Of the 55 tropopause folds observed {{on the eastern side}} of an upper-level trough, 37 (67. 3 %) were associated with convective storms, most commonly in the form of multicellular lines. Of the 128 tropopause folds observed on the western side of an upper-level trough, 42 (32. 8 %) were associated with convective storms,most commonly isolated cells. These results suggest that more organized storms tend to form in environments favorable for synoptic-scale ascent. 1...|$|R
40|$|Low-level mesovortices are {{associated}} with enhanced surface wind gusts and high-end wind damage in quasi-linear thunderstorms. Although damage associated with mesovortices can approach that of moderately strong tornadoes, skill in forecasting mesovortices is low. The overarching goal of this work is to understand mesovortices and how they develop, to improve the skill in forecasting them. This was done by developing a climatology of mesovortices, which required a tracking algorithm, and numerical simulations were conducted to answer questions {{that could not be}} answered through the observational data. A climatology of mesovortices was constructed from 44 events during 2009 and 2010 to examine mesovortex characteristics and origins. Approximately 60 % of the mesovortices were cyclonic and were longer-lived and stronger at low levels than the anticyclonic mesovortices. A barotropic mechanism that redistributes ambient low-level vorticity was found to generate numerous cyclonic mesovortices in some events with strong vertical shear over lowest 500 m. The modeling component revealed that vorticity is generated in a region of strong horizontal shear between the ambient low-level winds and flow within the cold pool, and concentrated into mesovortices by releasing shearing instability. Upward tilting of baroclinic vorticity was found to generate mesovortices above the cold pool but did not produce significant vorticity near the surface. Low-level mesovortices developed when the updraft remained near the gust front instead of advecting rearward. Cold air is lifted by the updraft and moves rearward and descends, tilting down vorticity atop the cold pool and generating near-surface mesovortices. The initial downward tilting is large for moderate and strong cold pools where there is substantial horizontal vorticity. Stretching of vertical vorticity intensifies the mesovortices and produces the strongest vortices where negative buoyancy in the cold pool is not too strong. Presented in this paper is an algorithm for the tracking of mesovortices across multiple <b>radar</b> domains, a <b>climatology</b> of bow echo mesovortices, and a series of model simulations to evaluate the stability hypothesis. ...|$|R

Original radar products are used subject only to corrections within the signal processor without any further corrections on single radar images. The aim of this statistical correction is {{to make up for the}} average systematic errors caused by clutter, propagation, or measuring effects but to conserve small-scale natural variations in space. The statistical correction is based on a thorough analysis of the different causes of possible errors for the Munich weather radar. This analysis revealed the following basic effects: the decrease of rain amount as a function of height and distance from the radar, clutter effects such as clutter remnants after filtering, holes by eliminated clutter or shading effects from obstacles near the radar, visible as spokes, as well as the influence of the bright band. The correction algorithm is correspondingly based on these results. It consists of three modules. The first one is an altitude correction which minimises measuring effects. The second module corrects clutter effects and disturbances and the third one realises a mean adjustment to selected rain gauges. Two different sets of radar products are used.

The correction algorithm is created to post-correct climatological or statistical analysis of radar data with a temporal resolution larger than one year. The correction algorithm is used for frequencies of occurrence of radar reflectivities which enables its application even for radar products such as DWD's cell-tracking-product CONRAD.
