40|$|The {{geometry}} and {{the mechanics of}} generalized pseudo-rigid bodies are studied. The configuration space of a generalized pseudo-rigid bodies is the linear group, P:= GL+(n,R), of non-singular matrices with positive determinant. It admits {{the left and right}} actions of SO(n) and the two-sided action of SO(n) × SO(n). The left and <b>right</b> <b>SO(n)</b> actions on P are both free, so that P is made into respective principal fiber bun-dles according to the left and <b>right</b> <b>SO(n)</b> actions, and further left and right connections can be defined on the respective fiber bundles. However, the two-sided SO(n) × SO(n) action is not free on P, and hence P is not made into a principal fiber bundle with respect to this action. In spite of this, if P is restricted to an open dense subset P ̇, the isotropy subgroup at each point of P ̇ is a finite discrete group, so that the quotient space (SO(n) ×SO(n)) ̇ becomes a manifold, and further one can define a connection on P ̇, which will be called a bi-connection. The bi-connection is used to reduce the pseudo-rigid body system on T ∗P ̇ with the SO(n) × SO(n) symmetry. Though in the cotangent bundle reduction theorem and its variants, one usually assumes that the action of a Lie group on the configuration space is free, or that the isotropy subgroup of the Lie group is trivial, the reduction procedure works well if the isotropy subgroup is not trivial but a finite group. As an application of the reduction procedure, relative equilibria are discussed in relation with the reduced Hamilton and Lagrange equations of motion. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for a relative equilibrium in terms of an amended potential on the reduced phase space. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{effects on}} {{spontaneous}} ovulation {{associated with the}} unilateral or bilateral sectioning of the superior ovarian nerves (SON) were analyzed in guinea pigs at different time intervals of the estrous cycle. Day 1 of the estrous cycle {{was defined as the}} day when the animal presents complete loss of the vaginal membrane (open vagina). Subsequent phases of the cycle were determined by counting the days after Day 1. All animals were autopsied on the fifth day of the estrous cycle after surgery. Sectioning the right, left, or both SONs on day 5 (early luteal phase) resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of fresh corpora lutea. Ovulation increased significantly when the left SON (L-SON) was sectioned during late follicular phase (day 1) and medium luteal phase (day 8). When surgery was performed on days 1 or 8, neither sectioning the <b>right</b> <b>SON</b> (R-SON) nor sectioning the SON bilaterally had an apparent effect on ovulation rates. Similarly, ovulation rates were not affected when unilateral (right or left) or bilateral sectioning of the SON was performed during late luteal phase two (day 12). Unilateral or bilateral sectioning of the SON performed during the early luteal phase (day 5) was associated with a significant decrease in uterine weight. A comparable effect was observed when the L-SON was sectioned during late follicular phase (day 1), or medium luteal phase (day 8). No effects on uterine weight were observed when unilateral or bilateral sectioning of the SON was performed during late luteal phase. Our results suggest that in the guinea pig the SON modulates ovulation, and that the degree of modulation varies along the estrous cycle. The strongest influence of the SONs on ovulation occurs during early luteal phase, and decrease thereafter, being absent by late luteal phase. In addition, sectioning the left or the <b>right</b> <b>SON</b> caused different responses by the ovaries of adult guinea pigs. This paper discusses the mechanisms by which ovulation increased when the SON was surgically cut. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} effects that {{sectioning}} the superior ovarian nerve of infantile female rats has on their follicular development at different ages before puberty. Compared with the control group, sham-operated animals showed {{a significant decrease in}} the number of measured follicles in right and left ovaries, although no difference in the follicular atresia ratio was observed. Animals with a sectioned left superior ovarian nerve (SON), killed 12 days after surgery had a significant increase in the number of follicles in the ovaries. Most of the follicles were atretic. Sectioning the <b>right</b> <b>SON</b> induced contrasting effects in the ovaries of animals killed 4 and 16 days after surgery. Rats with a denervated (right) ovary showed a {{decrease in the number of}} follicles and a greater number of atretic follicles compared with the control group, whereas the innervated (left) ovary showed an increase in measured follicles compared with the control group. Bilateral sectioning had no apparent effect on the total number of follicles measured, although an increased number of atretic follicles in both ovaries was observed. Animals with a unilateral section of the SON, killed 8 and 12 days after surgery, showed a decrease in serum concen-trations of estradiol. In turn, animals killed 16 days after surgery showed a significant increase in estradiol and a decrease in the progesterone serum concentration. These results suggest that sympathetic innervation of the ovary via the SON has a stimulatory role in the regulation and differentiation of follicular growth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During the {{development}} of the female rat, a maturing process of the factors that regulate the functioning of the ovaries takes place, resulting in different responses according to the age of the animal. Studies show that peripheral innervation is one relevant factor involved. In the present study we analyzed the anatomical relationship between the neurons in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglia (CSMG), and the right or left ovary in 24 or 28 days old female pre-pubertal rats. The participation of the superior ovarian nerve (SON) in the communication between the CSMG and the ovaries was analyzed in animals with unilateral section of the SON, previous to injecting true blue (TB) into the ovarian bursa. The animals were killed seven days after treatment. TB stained neurons were quantified at the superior mesenteric-celiac ganglia. The number of labeled neurons in the CSMG of rats treated at 28 days of age was significantly higher than those treated on day 24. At age 24 days, injecting TB into the right ovary resulted in neuron stains {{on both sides of the}} celiac ganglia; whereas, injecting the left side the stains were exclusively ipsilateral. Such asymmetry was not observed when the rats were treated at age of 28 days. In younger rats, sectioning the left SON resulted in significantly lower number of stained neurons in the left ganglia while sectioning the <b>right</b> <b>SON</b> did not modify the number of stained neurons. When sectioning of the SON was performed to 28 days old rats, no staining was observed. Present results show that the number and connectivity of post-ganglionic neurons of the CSMG connected to the ovary of juvenile female rats change as the animal mature; that the SON plays a role in this communication process as puberty approaches; and that this maturing process is different for the right or the left ovary. </p...|$|E

40|$|Assume {{nothing is}} known about the probabilities of taxons except that the Grst taxon is more {{probable}} than the second one, the second is more probable than the third, and so on. Then to construct the optimal key, one can regard the ith taxon as having probability proportional to (i- I) ‘-l/ii_ 1. xntroduction Dichotomous keys are widely used in biology, mineralogy, pattern recognition, and other areas. Such a key is labelled c 7 Tnplete binary tree. The label of a leaf is the name of a taxon and the label of any ther node is an attribute. One goes to the <b>right</b> <b>son</b> of a node if the taxon has the corresponding attribute, otherwise one goes to the left son. Fig. 1 shows a key of dragonties of the sub-family Libellulinae [l]. The key is based on analysis of the wings of a dragonfly. The first attribute (Y ~ is equal to 0 if the last antenodal vein of the wing is complete, 1 if it is incomplete. The attribute cy 2 is equal to 0 if the sectors of the arculus (an element of the wing) are divided from the very base, and equal to 1 if there is a stem {{at the top of the}} sectors. etc. There are many ways to construct a key, and we want an efficient one. If one wants to reduce the volume of a key to the minimum, one can use the results in [2]. Our goal here is to construct keys with the minimum expected time of identification.
