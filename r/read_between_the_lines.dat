25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

500|$|Two {{full-length}} {{studies of}} Walpole were published after his death. The first, in 1952, {{was written by}} Rupert Hart-Davis, who had known Walpole personally. It was regarded {{at the time as}} [...] "among the half dozen best biographies of the century" [...] and has been reissued several times since its first publication. Writing when homosexual acts between men were still outlawed in England, Hart-Davis avoided direct mention of his subject's sexuality, so respecting Walpole's habitual discretion and the wishes of his brother and sister. He left readers to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> if they wished, in, for example, references to Turkish baths [...] "providing informal opportunities of meeting interesting strangers". Hart-Davis dedicated the book to [...] "Dorothy, Robin and Harold", Walpole's sister, brother, and long-term companion.|$|E
500|$|In Ved Vejen, Bang has masterfully {{developed}} his impressionistic style. While recognizing that impressionism was {{first and foremost}} a trend in painting, he explained in a letter sent to Peter Nansen from Prague {{that he was trying to}} achieve the same style in literature: [...] "Impressionistic is indeed the word. I am frantically striving to make every single impression clear and precise and distinctive, and so I never think about the whole" [...] Jean-Claude Polet adds that while he owes much to Zola, Daudet and Maupassant, he channels naturalism into a quite unexpected direction, that of impressionism. His characters are revealed through their responses or a slight turn of phrase along the lines of the Norwegian Jonas Lie or the Russian Turgenev. He does not explain, he merely presents a picture, providing the reader with impressions, allowing him to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> interpreting what lies behind the words. On meeting Claude Monet, he was told, [...] "You are the first impressionist writer." [...] A recognized example of his mastery of impressionism is the novel's opening scene where all the characters meet at the station.|$|E

Edmonds's correspondence with Basil Liddell Hart shows that Hart valued the official history and offered constructive criticism. Green wrote that when David French called the work [...] "official but not history", he had used Hart's words out of context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase [...] "official but not history", to describe the volumes.|$|E

50|$|Len Deighton {{has stated}} that Bernard's {{testimony}} in the books is not reliable. Samson is biased, especially towards his superiors, and is prone to regarding himself too highly. The true nature of his character can be gleaned from <b>reading</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> or alternatively from the sixth novel, Spy Sinker, which recounts {{the events of the}} previous books from a third-person perspective, and casts doubt upon Bernard's reliability as a narrator, especially in his assessment of his colleagues' capabilities and motives.|$|R
2500|$|Lord Franks is {{reported}} to have believed that, while there must be some criticism of government actions, as no government can be held to blame for the reckless aggression of another, there could be [...] "no hanging conclusion". To the charge of a whitewash, he {{is reported}} as saying that it should be remembered the report was produced in the aftermath of victory and that [...] "there is a time and place for blame", and that the report should be read carefully and to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> William Wallace of Chatham House also interpreted the Franks Report as containing two readings. According to Wallace, on first reading it [...] "exonerated the government in office of all blame", but could also be read as a coded document much more critical of British government policy from 1977 to 1982 and less damning of the intelligence apparatus.|$|E
2500|$|This very lesson {{carries over}} {{to explain how}} the four basic groups of animals and the four basic archetypal philosophies and personalities reveal a higher, Godly source when one is able to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and see how these {{opposing}} forces can and do interact in harmony. A person should strive to be like a Merkaba, that is to say, he should realize all the different qualities, talents and inclinations he has (his angels). They may seem to contradict, but when one directs his life to a higher goal such as doing God's will he (the man on the chair driving the chariot) will see how they all can work together and even complement each other. [...] Ultimately, we should strive to realize how all of the forces in the world, though they may seem to conflict, can unite when one knows how to use them all to fulfill a higher purpose; namely to serve God.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{analysis}} of Portal, Daniel Johnson points out that [...] "the larger chunk of Portals narrative exists in GLaDOS' dialogue", which tells [...] "a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution". He discusses how the [...] "backstage" [...] of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player ("the first flaw in the routine") to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player {{to return to the}} testing area (the [...] "front stage", where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view). Microsoft Game Studios developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises Portal for giving its audience [...] "room to do some imagination work" [...] by inviting them to <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately [...] "causes her to go crazy". Stephen Totilo notes the [...] "artful way" [...] in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout Portal despite [...] "little interactivity in how the story is told". [...] Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, [...] "I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if I ever have wanted a boss battle before." [...] Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a [...] "maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator".|$|E

Dragan Primorac made several public statements - he initially tried to stay completely neutral, but later released one where he listed some characteristics of the future president that he would want, without naming a candidate, but focusing on the fight against corruption. The reception was mixed – Večernji list said he chose no one, while Jutarnji list said that he chose Josipović, <b>reading</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> Josipović campaign later decided to include Primorac in their endorsement list and Primorac {{did not seem to}} come forward with a public rebuttal.

5000|$|Jibanananda scholar Clinton B. Seely has termed Jibanananda Das as [...] "Bengal's most {{cherished}} poet since Rabindranath Tagore". On the other hand, to many, reading {{the poetry of}} Jibanananda Das is like stumbling upon a labyrinth of the mind similar to what one imagines Camus's 'absurd' man toiling through. Indeed, Jibanananda Das's poetry is sometimes an outcome of profound feeling painted in imagery of a type not readily understandable. Sometimes <b>the</b> connection <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sequential <b>lines</b> is not obvious. In fact, Jibanananda Das broke the traditional circular structure of poetry (introduction-middle-end) and the pattern of logical sequence of words, lines and stanzas. Consequently, the thematic connotation is often hidden under a rhythmic narrative that requires careful <b>reading</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> following excerpt will bear the point out: ...|$|R

2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> with MTV." [...] "I would guess that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or <b>read</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler.

30|$|The {{data suggest}} that the {{participants}} tended to perceive that reading items typically measure the ability to comprehend what is written in the passage even though the ability to make an inference from the passage is also required. Comprehension of the literal meaning (reading <b>the</b> <b>lines)</b> was possibly deemed a prerequisite for comprehension of <b>the</b> unstated meaning (<b>reading</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines).</b> This view is not completely naïve since even language teachers often prescribe this approach (Alderson, 2000). For the participants, therefore, reading <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> might be <b>the</b> fundamental ability or skill needed in order to solve the reading items which demand an additional skill. Alternatively, they might have thought that understanding of the literal meaning would suffice to solve the items. The participants’ perception that these items measure the ability to comprehend the literal meaning is not considered distant from the test committees’ intentions since <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>reading</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> are hard to distinguish clearly (Alderson, 2000). In this sense, <b>the</b> gap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> test committee intentions and participants’ perception may not be crucial because students are likely to engage in reading to prepare for these reading items. However, if test developers wish to draw students’ attention to various specific subskills of reading (Brown & Abeywickrama, 2010; Hubley, 2012; Hughes, 2003), reading items may not necessarily have a direct impact on students’ attempt to acquire them.|$|R
