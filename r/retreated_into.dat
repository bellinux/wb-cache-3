5|$|The next German {{attack was}} at dawn on 9 June, when a heavy mortar barrage {{landed on the}} 9th Parachute Battalion positions. Then 'A' and 'C' Companies were {{attacked}} simultaneously. After taking heavy casualties, the Germans <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the woods surrounding the Château, where they reformed and attempted another unsuccessful attack an hour later.|$|E
5|$|As the Afrika Korps <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, {{as part of}} X Corps, was in pursuit. A {{series of}} engagements with the enemy followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men. After the battle at Takrouna, the 5th Brigade was {{withdrawn}} from the frontlines, having lost 38% of its strength. He remained a highly regarded officer, deputising as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence from the field in higher commands.|$|E

5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the troops}} of Urquiza and Eugenio Garzón had {{surrounded}} {{the army of}} Oribe near Montevideo. Their forces numbered roughly 15,000 men, almost double Oribe's 8,500. Realising that the Brazilians were approaching and knowing {{that there was no}} hope of victory, Oribe orderered his troops to surrender without a fight on 19 October, and <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> seclusion on his farm in Paso del Molino.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{wrote his}} memoirs of the Great War in 1919, which were {{translated}} into English the following year. In October 1920, an intruder broke into Scheer's house and murdered his wife, Emillie, his maid, and injured his daughter Else. The man then {{committed suicide in}} the cellar. Following the incident, Scheer <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> solitude. He wrote his autobiography, entitled Vom Segelschiff zum U-Boot (From Sailing Ship to Submarine), which was published on 6 November 1925.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Musa Qala (also Qaleh or Qal'eh) was a British led {{military}} action in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan, launched by the Afghan National Army and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) against the Taliban on 7 December 2007. After three days of intense fighting, the Taliban <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the mountains on 10 December. Musa Qala was officially reported captured on 12 December, with Afghan Army troops pushing into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a pivotal {{moment in the}} Southern campaign. The {{surprising}} victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats {{at the hands of}} Lord Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots' morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{defenders}} in {{the cattle}} pen <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the horse corral. After discharging their weapons, the {{small band of}} Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty. As the Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed.|$|E

5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy had {{initially}} opposed busing schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew {{to support the}} practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston's public schools via busing, Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility. The predominantly white crowd yelled insults about his children and hurled tomatoes and eggs {{at him as he}} <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the John F.

5|$|Missouri {{had a large}} Union {{presence}} {{throughout the}} Civil War, but also many civilians whose sympathies lay with the Confederacy. From July 1861 {{until the end of}} the war, the state suffered up to 25,000 deaths from guerrilla warfare, more than any other state. Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> Arkansas, leaving only the guerrillas to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him. William Anderson was initially given a chilly reception from other raiders, who perceived him to be brash and overconfident.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August, crusader scouts {{discovered}} {{the location of}} the Fatimid camp, which the crusaders immediately marched towards. According to most crusader and Muslim accounts, the Fatimids were caught unaware. Because of a somewhat ill-prepared Fatimid army, the battle was fairly short, although it still took some time to resolve, according to Albert of Aix. al-Afdal Shahanshah and his army <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> the heavily guarded and fortified city of Ascalon. The next day the crusaders learned that al-Afdal Shahanshah had retreated back to Egypt via boat, so they plundered what remained of the Fatimid camp. After returning to Jerusalem most of the crusaders returned to their homes in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} hundred men.|$|E
5|$|The {{four men}} who had stood at the pole with Amundsen were all asked to {{accompany}} their leader on the Maud drift. Bjaaland and Hassel declined; neither participated in any further polar ventures. Helmer Hanssen and Wisting both joined Maud; the latter took over the leadership when Amundsen left the expedition. In 1936 Wisting captained Fram on the ship's final voyage to Oslo, where it became a museum. Johansen, who {{had been unable to}} settle back into normal life on his return from Antarctica, became withdrawn and uncommunicative. He refused to discuss his experiences or his dispute with Amundsen, and <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> a life of depression and poverty. On 4January 1913 he shot himself in his Oslo lodgings.|$|E
5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, {{more than in}} previous elections that the party had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, {{but there was no}} significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had <b>retreated</b> <b>into</b> industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better in the south of England.|$|E
