40|$|Abstract. The work {{presented}} here deals with simulation assisted evaluation of fracture testing of ordinary <b>ceramic</b> <b>refractory</b> materials. Two tests are applied. One of them, a wedge splitting test, is already established for this purpose. An inverse evaluation procedure {{was developed to}} derive more information from the test results: It enables the simultaneous determination of the specific fracture energy, the tensile strength and the Young’s modulus. Moreover specific fracture energy can also be determined in {{the case that the}} test has to be interrupted at some residual load due to relatively low material brittleness. The other test method, a laser irradiation disc test, was developed in order to determine specific fracture energy and tensile strength for fine <b>ceramic</b> <b>refractory</b> materials behaving relatively brittle. From the time elapsed until crack initiation occurs (t 1) and a stable/instable transition of crack propagation takes place (t 2), respectively, the tensile strength and the specific fracture energy are calculated based on a simulation of the mode I fracture behavior which applies the fictitious crack model according to Hillerborg...|$|R
50|$|Insulation is an {{important}} part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as firebrick, castable <b>refractories</b> and <b>ceramic</b> fibre, are used for insulation. The floor of the furnace are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place. Ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its density and then its maximum temperature rating. For example, 8# 2,300 °F means 8 lb/ft3 density with a maximum temperature rating of 2,300 °F. The actual service temperature rating for ceramic fiber is a bit lower than the maximum rated temperature. (i.e. 2300 °F is only good to 2145 °F before permanent linear shrinkage).|$|R

30|$|Magnetite {{or other}} {{magnetic}} material {{is used by}} the steel industry for cleaning coal prior to combustion. One potential source of magnetite is CFA which can contains economically recoverable amounts of magnetic material. After removal of magnetic material from CFA, the remaining product can be useful for <b>refractory</b> and <b>ceramic</b> manufacturing since it contains appreciable amounts of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 (Rao et al. 1999). The characteristics of magnetic material in CFA vary depending on the coal source and operating conditions of the coal boiler (Zyryanov et al. 2011). The basic principle behind magnetic separation deals with the fact that materials having different magnetic moments experience varying forces {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field gradient. Thus, applying an external magnetic field can extract those materials with similar magnetic properties (Yavuz et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Refractory lining materials, {{which include}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>refractories</b> and nonfired {{heat-resistant}} concretes, {{have a very}} short lifespan during the turnaround time measured in years and sometimes months. Therefore, increasing the service life of thermal generating units by 1. 5 - 2 times will bring significant economic benefits. The main factor that determines the durability of refractory lining materials is the thermal resistance. It is possible to increase the thermal resistance by improving such physical and mechanical properties as strength and density. As for the <b>ceramic</b> <b>refractory</b> performance improvement, such technological methods as their structural and chemical modification by phosphate binder impregnation, as well as introduction of phosphate components into the ceramic batches during the molding process increase, in particular, their thermal stability. The use of aluminous and high-alumina cements contributes to a significant increase of not only strength, but also physical and thermal performance of heat-resistant concretes with different fillers. Switching {{to the use of}} chemical binders in the compositions of heat-resistant concretes (liquid glass with effective hardeners; silicate-block and phosphate binders) enables to develop high-heat resistant materials which do not soften {{in a wide range of}} heating temperatures from 400 °С to 1600 °С. The positive results on increasing the thermal resistance of heat-resistant composites can be obtained by reinforcing them with high temperature fibers...|$|R
