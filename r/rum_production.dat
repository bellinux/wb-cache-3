Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in <b>rum</b> <b>production.</b> Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

500|$|The Betsimisaraka economy {{remains largely}} agricultural, with many {{cultivating}} vanilla and rice. Manioc, sweet potatoes, beans, taro, peanuts {{and a variety}} of greens are also commonly cultivated; other staple crops include sugar cane, coffee, bananas, pineapples, avocado, breadfruit, mangoes, oranges and lychees. Cattle are not widely raised; more commonly, the Betsimisaraka may catch and sell river crabs, shrimp and fish, small hedgehogs, various local insects or wild boar, birds and lemurs in the forest. They also produce and sell homemade sugarcane beer (betsa) and <b>rum</b> (toaka). The <b>production</b> of spices for culinary use and for distillation into perfumes remains a major economic activity, with a perfume distillery located in Fenoarivo Atsinanana.

Central Mercedita closed down in December 1994, and its sugar mill site is abandoned and in ruins. The Serrallés rum distillery, however, is an expanding and successful company still operating from the same original location, in barrio Vayas, southeast of the intersection of routes PR-10 and PR-52. Central Mercedita, where the local sugar cane was processed, is now owned by Puerto Rico's [...] Autoridad de Tierras (English: Land Authority).

During the war, the French government requisitioned Martinique's <b>rum</b> <b>production</b> {{for the use of}} the French Army.

50|$|Tourism, trade, {{and other}} {{services}} are the primary economic activities, accounting for nearly 60% of the Virgin Island's GDP and about half of total civilian employment. Close to two million tourists per year visit the islands. The government is the single largest employer. The agriculture sector is small, with most food being imported. The manufacturing sector consists of rum distilling, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and watch assembly. <b>Rum</b> <b>production</b> is significant. Shipments during a six-month period of fiscal year 2016 totaled 8,136.6 million proof gallons.|$|E
50|$|Tourism {{is a key}} industry; an {{increasingly}} large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry features sugar and <b>rum</b> <b>production.</b> Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young. Hurricanes periodically devastate the economy.|$|E

5000|$|The Beenleigh Rum Distillery is {{the oldest}} {{registered}} distillery in Australia, and is a rare survivor of Australia's early sugar industry. It commenced operations in 1884 and was the legal successor to a floating moonshine still, the SS Walrus, which drifted between cane plantations and evading police in the early 19th century. The original proprietor, James Stewart, sold the boat's still to local entrepreneurs who used it to start the Beenleigh Rum Distillery. Between 1981 and 2005 a museum featuring displays {{on the history of}} sugar and <b>rum</b> <b>production</b> in the Beenleigh area was open at the distillery.

Sugar cane grows in the area and Cartavio has been home to the Cartavio Sugar Company since 1891. Once the site of <b>rum</b> <b>production</b> for Ron Cartavio (now produced in Perú), currently the sugar mill produces not only sugar but also up to 15 million litres of ethanol per year, which could be used by petroleum companies to replace the lead in petrol and thereby reducing the emissions of air pollutants.|$|E
