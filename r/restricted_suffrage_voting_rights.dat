50|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 {{brought with}} it famine, chronic {{unemployment}} and drastic wage cuts, especially amongst textile weavers and spinners, and this - coupled {{with a lack of}} <b>suffrage</b> (<b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> - led to calls for reform which culminated in the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 in Manchester, England when a peaceful demonstration of radical reformers was attacked by cavalry.|$|R
50|$|The Bayonet Constitution {{allowed the}} King to appoint his cabinet, but placed that cabinet under the {{authority}} of only the legislature. It required any executive actions of the monarch to be approved by the cabinet. Previous <b>suffrage</b> (<b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> was <b>restricted</b> to male subjects of the kingdom. The new constitution <b>restricted</b> <b>suffrage</b> to only Hawaiian, American or European male residing in Hawaii, {{as long as they were}} 21 years old, literate with no back unpaid taxes, and would take an oath to support the law of the land. By placing a new minimum qualifier of $3,000 in property ownership and a minimum income of $600, the new constitution disqualified many Native Hawaiians and naturalized Asians from voting.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the role}} of women in church life, the Protestant clergy, and as theologians {{remained}} limited. The role of women expanded over time and was closely associated with the movements for universal education and women's suffrage. Political and social movements for <b>suffrage</b> (<b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> and sobriety (see temperance movement and Prohibition) in the English-speaking world of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were closely associated with Protestant Christian women's organizations.|$|R

That June Arkansas became the first rebel state to be readmitted to the Union under the Reconstruction Acts. The Constitution of 1868 made racial discrimination illegal; provided <b>suffrage</b> (<b>voting)</b> <b>rights</b> for freedmen age 21 and older; provided for public schools for the first time, for both black and white children; and it established a state university.|$|R

5000|$|Belva Ann Bennett Lockwood (October 24, 1830 - May 19, 1917) was an American attorney, politician, educator, and author. She {{was active}} in working for women's rights.

5000|$|<b>Suffrage</b> - The <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> of women, African-Americans, and Native Americans {{were either}} not {{protected}} or specifically abridged. (In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited denial of suffrage due to race. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment prohibited denial of suffrage due to sex. In 1964, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment prohibited poll taxes, {{which were then}} being used in some states to discriminate against African-Americans without explicit racial provisions.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Over 21 {{million people}} were killed or injured in World War I; in many cases, all {{of the men in}} one family were killed, {{numerous}} cities in Europe were destroyed, and family life throughout the world was greatly affected. [...] While the United States suffered the fewest casualties, family life was still greatly affected as husbands were deployed and wives had to begin working. As the war draft suddenly removed many men from factory work, the factories began soliciting for women workers in traditionally male-dominated areas. [...] Therefore, women had less time to spend at home with the children, as many of them would have before the war. As fathers, uncles, brothers, and grandfathers deployed in military service, women filled their places in factories and offices, changing the ways young children and teens received home nurturing. Additionally, women moving into new roles in society had lasting effects on children and family life after the war. President Woodrow Wilson stated, [...] "We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?" [...] As women began working in the factories, more of society began to realize the need for women’s rights; while women had been granted <b>suffrage</b> (<b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> to varying degrees in several states beginning in the late 19th century, they were now guaranteed full suffrage throughout the United States by the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution passed in August, 1920. This also {{paved the way for the}} children of future generations by creating greater career opportunities for girls and women; as women gained a stronger voice, girls became more involved in the workforce and education and prepared for roles outside of the home. Additionally, family life was affected after the war as more and more women entered the work force, moving away from the traditional stay-at-home mother and housewife role.|$|R
50|$|Electoral rights {{include the}} <b>right</b> to <b>vote</b> in Members of Parliament, {{and the right}} to run for the House of Representatives. This is done by way of a secret ballot, and there is {{universal}} <b>suffrage,</b> with <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> given to both {{men and women of the}} age 18 and over who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. Freedom of association allows people to join with other individuals into groups that express, promote, pursue and defend common interests collectively. The Electoral Act 1993 is also important because it is one of the few ‘constitutional’ documents to contain entrenched provisions. These maintain the <b>rights</b> to <b>voting</b> and the size of the electorates which represent 'the people'. In the New Zealand context, entrenching provisions is one of the most effective ways to protect rights, as there is no possibility of total protection due to the doctrine of Parliamentary Sovereignty. However entrenching provisions would appear to indicate intent to protect rights. Section 6 of the Bill of Rights Act provides for judicial interpretation in favour of right-protecting interests, which allows judges to interpret around provisions in other legislation that may appear to impede human rights.|$|R

She attends a small private funeral for the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, hosted by her aunt, Queen Liliuokalani. Shortly after her return, she is visited by Sanford B. Dole, who explains that three U.S. legal commissioners are arriving, and that he and Thurston would like the Princess to host a small dinner for them. Though she is appalled at the impertinent request, he convinces her {{that it might be}} to her advantage too. At the dinner, Ka'iulani charms her visitors before surprising Thurston by publicly petitioning for an amendment to the annexation treaty to guarantee universal <b>suffrage</b> and <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> to all Native Hawaiians. She is disregarded by an appalled Thurston, who points out she is not a recognized diplomat before Dole stands up for the princess and declares he will petition the amendment for her. As the amendment gathers support amongst the dinner guests, Thurston leaves, embarrassed and angry.|$|R

40|$|We {{conduct an}} {{experiment}} to study different shareholder <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> regimes {{in a setting}} where shareholders provide incentives to a CEO for a risky project choice through a discretionary bonus scheme. We compare three different types of shareholder <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> (advisory, unconditionally binding, and conditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights)</b> to the baseline case where shareholders have no say on CEO pay. We make the following observations: (1) Advisory and conditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> do not distort CEO investment incentives. Unconditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> adversely affect the CEO’s investment incentives. (2) Unconditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> are an effective instrument to curb executive compensation. Advisory shareholder <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> have the opposite effect and can even increase executive compensation. (3) Most shareholders reject CEO bonus proposals whenever {{they have the right}} to do so. This effect is independent of the type of <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> in place and becomes more pronounced in case of poor project performance. (4) Advisory and conditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> have only limited impact on firm profit and executive compensation. In contrast, unconditionally binding <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> reduce both, firm profit and executive compensation significantly. Overall, our results suggest that regulators should carefully evaluate dysfunctional economic consequences of shareholder <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> before they are introduced or before existing rules are tightened...|$|R
