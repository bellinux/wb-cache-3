5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a <b>rattle</b> is formed. The <b>rattle</b> grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a <b>rattle</b> is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes snakes have {{enlarged}} scales, either {{single or}} paired, under the tail; these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The {{end of the}} tail may simply taper into a tip (as {{in the case of}} most snakes), it may form a spine (as in Acanthophis), end in a bony spur (as in Lachesis), a <b>rattle</b> (as in Crotalus), or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary.

This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky <b>rattle</b> and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E

The concert footage includes political and social statements made during the shows. It is the band's second feature film, following their 1988 rockumentary <b>Rattle</b> and Hum. Among several cinematic firsts, U2 3D was the first live-action digital 3D film.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural <b>rattle</b> and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from <b>Rattle,</b> plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
50|$|Henry Bingham {{made his}} life devenomizing snakes {{until he was}} bitten by a {{particular}} specimen. He rushed to Curtis Chemicals where a chemist analyzed his blood and offered him an experimental anti-venom serum to save his life. He was cured, but began to change into the <b>Rattler.</b> However, Henry found that the changes weren't permanent and he began seeking more samples of the anti-venom serum to maintain his <b>Rattler</b> form. Exercising his idea of hiding in plain sight, <b>Rattler</b> walked though the streets wearing a sign that was advertising Reptile World. He walked right into Curtis Chemicals, fought right past the guards, and stole some of the anti-venom serum. He returned to Reptile World and took the samples to perpetuate his powers, but Mary Jane Watson {{took a picture of}} Peter Parker in front of the store just as <b>Rattler</b> walked by. Not wanting to have his secret lair discovered, <b>Rattler</b> plotted to steal the film that was used. <b>Rattler</b> followed Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson back to Peter's apartment and ambushed them. Peter only feigned unconsciousness and then changed into Spider-Man to follow <b>Rattler.</b> Peter arrived at Reptile World and was zapped from behind while looking around. Upon regaining consciousness while tied to a chair, Peter is confronted by <b>Rattler</b> who tells him his origin as Peter claims that the serum is killing him. <b>Rattler</b> left Peter behind with some poisonous snakes and went to get more serum. Peter escaped, changed into Spider-Man, and began tracking <b>Rattler.</b> Upon finding <b>Rattler,</b> Spider-Man fought with him which ended with the serum's destruction. As the serum's effects began to fade, <b>Rattler</b> changed back to Henry Bingham who regained his sanity at last. Before dying from the side effects of the serum, Henry thanked Spider-Man for preventing him from being <b>Rattler</b> forever.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Rattler</b> {{had escaped}} from prison, Whirlo learned about this. When Two-Gun Kid visited the circus where Whirlo worked, Whirlo claimed that <b>Rattler</b> is after him for revenge {{after failing to}} defeat Rawhide Kid. Two-Gun Kid figured out that Whirlo was acting as <b>Rattler,</b> tracked {{him down to the}} circus, and unmasked him. Whirlo claimed that he did it for revenge on <b>Rattler</b> for having framed him before.|$|R

In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.

5|$|Like their {{previous}} tours, The Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this outlet for addressing {{political and social}} concerns. One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's canceling the state's observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studios in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band's experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 <b>Rattle</b> and Hum album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice <b>rattle</b> their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

5|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} Achtung Baby {{was marked by}} several {{releases}} in 2011. At the band's request, a documentary film about the album entitled From the Sky Down was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary It Might Get Loud in 2008. From the Sky Down documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from <b>Rattle</b> and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the <b>rattle</b> of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the decade, major changes were made to the conductorship of the orchestra. In 2006 Daniel Harding joined Michael Tilson Thomas as {{principal}} guest, and the following year Davis retired as chief conductor and was appointed president of the orchestra, its first since the death of Bernstein in 1990. Davis was succeeded as chief conductor by Valery Gergiev. In Gergiev's first season in charge, a complete cycle of Mahler Symphonies was given, with the Barbican Hall sold out for every concert. In 2009 Davis and the LSO celebrated 50 years of working together. In the same year the LSO took over from the Berlin Philharmonic as the resident orchestra at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, adding to a roster of international residences at venues including the Lincoln Center in New York, the Salle Pleyel in Paris and the Daytona Beach International Festival in Florida. In 2010 the LSO visited Poland and Abu Dhabi for the first time and made its first return to India since the 1964 world tour. The orchestra played at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, conducted by Sir Simon <b>Rattle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the Wild West, Heath Benson {{was a part}} of a {{group of}} aerialists until he ended up injured in a fall. Unable to {{continue}} the act, he was hired as a ringmaster for a traveling circus. At some point, he used his talents in a career of crime and became <b>Rattler.</b> <b>Rattler</b> began to loot towns and other settlers in the vicinity of the circus. After <b>Rattler</b> nearly killed one of his victims, Two-Gun Kid was drafted to bring him in. <b>Rattler</b> bested Two-Gun Kid and escaped after the first encounter. Two-Gun Kid suspected that <b>Rattler</b> was someone that worked in the circus. Two-Gun Kid suspected the aerialist Whirlo of being <b>Rattler</b> and challenged him to aerial combat which ended with Two-Gun Kid winning. Just then, the real <b>Rattler</b> shows up and challenges Two-Gun Kid to a rematch. Two-Gun Kid succeeded in knocking him out in aerial combat and unmasked him to be the circus ringmaster.

50|$|The <b>Rattler</b> mascot has its {{own stories}} of how it came to be. Legend holds that the {{football}} practice field had to be cleared of diamondback rattlesnakes on a regular basis, thus leading to the designation. The truth is that Brother Kinsky thought “Rattlers” would be fitting because there was already on campus <b>Rattler</b> Club whose members had recently begun The <b>Rattler</b> newspaper. There was debate {{as to whether the}} name was being run into the ground, but the students quickly said they wanted the <b>Rattler</b> nickname.|$|R
