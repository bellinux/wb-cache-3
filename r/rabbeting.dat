2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, <b>rabbeting,</b> routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for Nils Ericsons sluss ("Lock of Nils Ericson") he made detailed studies and minute calculations in 1845–1846. He concluded there were insufficient stonemasons in the Stockholm area, and therefore had limestone and granite {{brought in from}} other parts of Sweden, quarries Ericson knew well from his earlier projects. He constructed a circular saw turned inwards to cut the head each stock at equal level for the bottom of the caisson, an instrument which was, like virtually all heavy tasks during the project, hand operated by several men. [...] Empty barrels were used as rafts. Ericson gave directions for all sorts of tasks, including dredging, securing the <b>rabbeting</b> of planks, earth fillings, and determining the inclination of the caisson walls {{in order for them to}} withstand the pressure from the levees. [...] He had to use an expensive steam dredger, but could avoid a machine for the drainage which saved a lot of money. He also made great efforts to make the extensive piling for the foundation more efficient; the drop forge of the pile driver should hit the pile with a constant effect, why Ericson had the labourers lower the device as the pile sunk. The timbered caisson was built as a huge box on Djurgården, just north-east of the bridge Lilla Sjötullsbron, slightly more than 79 meters long, 16,5 meters wide and 6,2 meters high (266½×56×21 feet), subsequently towed into place before the ends were removed. [...] The temporary drydock on Djurgården is still discernible as a depression in the landscape. The construction work on the caisson began in May 1847 with the construction of barracks for 60 men and a smithy. [...] In the drydock keel blocks [...] tall were then placed and the bottom of the caisson was built upon them [...] a bed consisting of [...] deal, [...] beams, and 1inches of boards. The caisson was completed in August, water was let in and the building berth and the barrage were removed. [...] The floating was done in two hours 2-4 a.m., and its dimensions produced enthusiastic comparisons: [...] "larger than the Stockholm Cathedral!", [...] "...could house the entire Swedish Army and its paraphernalia." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>rabbet</b> (also {{known as}} a rebate in Britain) is a recess or groove cut into {{the edge of a}} piece of {{machinable}} material, usually wood. When viewed in cross-section, a <b>rabbet</b> is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut.|$|R
50|$|The rebate plane (also {{known as}} the <b>rabbet</b> plane) is a hand plane {{designed}} for cutting <b>rabbets</b> in wood. It's a simple tool, used in many Western countries, with hundreds of years of history. It was in use in England at least {{as early as the}} 11th century.|$|R
5000|$|SIR,Since I {{wrote to}} you, I have taken or deliver'd the poor Woman of three more <b>Rabbets,</b> all three half grown, {{one of them}} a dunn Rabbet; the last leap'd twenty three Hours in the Uterus before it dy'd. As soon as the {{eleventh}} <b>Rabbet</b> was taken away, up leap'd the twelfth <b>Rabbet,</b> which is now leaping. If you have any curious Person that is pleased to come Post, may see another leap in her Uterus, and shall take it from her if he pleases; which will be a great Satisfaction to the Curious: If she had been with Child, she has but ten Days more to go, so I do not know how many <b>Rabbets</b> may be behind; I have brought the Woman to Guildford for better Convenience.I am, SIR, Your humble Servant,JOHN HOWARD.|$|R
50|$|The rebate plane {{commonly}} has a {{depth stop}} and a fence {{which allows the}} width and depth of the <b>rabbet</b> to be gauged. They also are commonly equipped with a spur {{which is designed to}} score the wood as the <b>rabbet</b> is cut, giving a cleaner corner. This is particularly valuable when working across the grain.|$|R

5000|$|Picture frames have {{traditionally}} been made of wood, which {{is still the most}} common material, although other materials are used including silver, bronze, aluminum, and plastics such as polystyrene. A picture frame may be of any color or texture, but gilding is common, especially on older wooden frames. Some picture frames have elaborate molding which may relate to the subject matter. Complicated older frames are often made of moulded and gilded plaster over a plain wood base. Picture frames {{come in a variety of}} profiles, but generally the lengths of moulding feature a [...] "lip" [...] and <b>rabbet,</b> the function of which is to allow a space to hold in the materials in the frame. The lip extends usually about a quarter of an inch past the edge of the <b>rabbet.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to making length cuts, a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, <b>rabbet</b> or half lap joints. In addition some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence, allowing a rip cut to be performed.|$|R
50|$|Parallel to {{the base}} and {{slightly}} lower is a secondary surface, the fence, which may be a separate board, or may be a <b>rabbet</b> cut in{{to the base}}. The difference in height between the base and the fence is {{to allow for the}} offset of the blade in the hand plane.|$|R
