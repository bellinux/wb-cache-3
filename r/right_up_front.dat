500|$|South of Heaven was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production [...] "shoves [...] Lombardo's drumming <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>front</b> in the mix". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they [...] "couldn't top Reign in Blood", and that whatever they recorded would be [...] "compared to that album", he believed they [...] "had to slow down", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to [...] "keep people guessing" [...] as {{another reason for the}} musical shift. [...] "In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole", according to Slayer's official biography. [...] "They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums." ...|$|E

Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>front.</b> The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2.

I {{explained}} there weren't any others for that track, and I was relying on them to understand my idea for the production. While the drums and percussion parts were written out, it was definitely Herbie that grasped immediately that a bass guitar playing a lead riff could fill a large part of the spatial spectrum and he took my idea and turned some basic notes of mine, into his amazing bass riff. Then to top it off, he suggested playing it again an octave higher.
