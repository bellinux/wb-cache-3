Hong Kong Taxi Owners Association represents owners of taxi licences, and drivers, who are most frequently are not owners but who rent their vehicles on a daily basis, are represented by the Motor Transport Workers General Union.

Owners would dispute with drivers' groups as they seek to increase the daily <b>rental</b> <b>charge</b> each time taxi fares increased.|$|E

25|$|Celtic {{opened the}} {{original}} Celtic Park in the Parkhead area in 1888. The club {{moved to a}} different site in 1892, however, when the <b>rental</b> <b>charge</b> was greatly increased. The new site was developed into an oval shaped stadium, with vast terracing sections. The record attendance of 83,500 was set by an Old Firm derby on 1 January 1938. The terraces were covered and floodlights were installed between 1957 and 1971. The Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs should have an all-seated stadium by August 1994. Celtic was in a bad financial position in the early 1990s and no major work was carried out until Fergus McCann {{took control of the}} club in March 1994. He carried out a plan to demolish the old terraces and develop a new stadium in a phased rebuild, which was completed in August 1998. During this development, Celtic spent the 1994–95 season playing at the national stadium Hampden Park, costing the club £500,000 in rent. The total cost of the new stadium on its completion was £40million.|$|E

500|$|Stravinsky {{continued}} {{to revise the}} work, and in 1943 rewrote the [...] "Sacrificial Dance". In 1948 Boosey and Hawkes issued a corrected version of the 1929 score (B 16333), although Stravinsky's substantial 1943 amendment of the [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was not incorporated into the new version and remained unperformed, to the composer's disappointment. He considered it [...] "much easier to play... and superior in balance and sonority" [...] to the earlier versions. A less musical motive for the revisions and corrected editions was copyright law. The composer had left Galaxy Music Corporation (agents for Editions Russe de la Musique, the original publisher) for Associated Music Publishers at the time, and orchestras would be reluctant to pay a second <b>rental</b> <b>charge</b> from two publishers to match the full work and the revised Sacrificial Dance; moreover, the revised dance could only be published in America. The 1948 score provided copyright protection to the work in America, where it had lapsed, but Boosey (who acquired the Editions Russe catalogue) {{did not have the}} rights to the revised finale.|$|E

Avis includes it in all states except California and Texas, at least for renters who lack their own coverage. Other companies do not publicize where they include liability insurance in the basic <b>rental</b> <b>charge.</b> Some car rental companies offer more liability insurance for a fee.|$|E
