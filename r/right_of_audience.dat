25|$|The {{states of}} New South Wales and Queensland, however, {{maintain}} strongly independent bars, call to which requires extra training. In those states, solicitors' rights of audience before superior courts are unlimited, but infrequently exercised in practice. South Australia and Victoria {{also have an}} independent bar but solicitors have full <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> before all courts.|$|E
25|$|Queen's Counsel were {{traditionally}} {{selected from}} barristers, {{rather than from}} lawyers in general, because they were counsel appointed to conduct court {{work on behalf of}} the Crown. Although the limitations on private instruction were gradually relaxed, QCs continued to be selected from barristers, who had the sole <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the higher courts.|$|E
25|$|Solicitors in Scotland {{have full}} rights of {{audience}} in the Sheriff Courts throughout Scotland in both criminal and civil cases. They also have rights of {{audience in the}} District Courts (the lowest criminal court in Scotland), although these are now being replaced by Justice of the Peace Courts, in which a solicitor also has a full <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience.</b> When in court, a solicitor will normally wear {{a suit and tie}} together with a Scottish bar gown (a form of black robe).|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the passing}} of the Courts and Legal Services Act, only barristers, solicitors and the parties to a case had {{automatic}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the County Courts (as established by the County Courts Act 1984). Other parties, if they were in [...] "relevant legal employment", could also request <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> for a particular case. The Civil Justice Review found significant variations between courts as to who would be granted <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience,</b> however, and Part I of the Courts and Legal Services Act attempted to address this. Section 11 allows the Lord Chancellor to make an order giving <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> to anyone in County Court cases of a certain type.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} element of this Part was the extension <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the higher courts to solicitors and other legal professionals. Sections 27 and 28 of Part II give an advocate <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> and the <b>right</b> to conduct litigation if the advocate is qualified to do so, {{is a member of}} a professional body recognised by the Lord Chancellor and that body considers him qualified to conduct litigation. A person also has <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> if they have been directly granted it, for example by the Lord Chancellor in County Court proceedings. The most immediate effect of this is that solicitors can now gain <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the Crown Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, Court of Session, Privy Council, and House of Lords if they qualify as Solicitor Advocates. Solicitor's clerks also have <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the chambers of judges in the Crown Court and High Court, assuming they are being instructed by a qualified solicitor.|$|R
50|$|The Jersey legal {{profession}} has {{three types of}} Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and Notaries Public.

Jersey solicitors have no general <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience.</b> Notaries have no <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience.</b> The Law Society of Jersey is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the Dean of the Arches, {{referred to as the}} Master of the Faculties, who is normally an English QC.|$|R
25|$|Irish {{independence}} in 1921 was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or abhcóidí in Irish) and solicitors (or aturnaetha in Irish). There was some blurring {{of the distinction}} between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates for their clients in the Superior Courts.|$|E
25|$|Though this {{principle}} was {{implicit in the}} Act and in the King's new titles, and {{came out of a}} Commonwealth Conference, neither the British government nor the dominion governments seemed initially to grasp its significance. So while the Irish immediately put the principle into effect by assuming the right to select their own governor-general and to demand a direct <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> with the King (excluding British ministers), other dominions were much slower to go down this path, and when they did so, they were faced with determined, though ultimately futile, attempts to block such evolution in London.|$|E
25|$|Spain has a {{division}} {{but it does}} not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. Procuradores represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while abogados represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. Abogados perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with abogados, not with procuradores. In a nutshell, procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an abogado. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, only barristers had <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> {{in every}} court in England and Wales, and, , they still enjoy <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in every court in England and Wales. However, solicitors {{have always had}} <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in the magistrates' court and the county court. Solicitors' clerks have also {{traditionally}} been allowed {{to be heard in}} proceedings in chambers in the High Court, such as summonses for directions (now known as case management hearings), and subsequent changes have preserved these rights, as explained by District Judge Robert Hill {{in an article in the}} Law Society's Gazette.Also, in 1972 Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, the Lord Chancellor, exercising his powers under the Courts Act 1971, granted solicitors who appear for a defendant in the magistrates' court, the right to appear also in the Crown Court on any appeal or committal for sentence in the case. Lord Hailsham's announcement is here <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> were granted to a wider class of persons under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, s.27, as amended by the Access to Justice Act 1999, ss.36-39.

25|$|Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory boasting a legal {{profession}} {{based on the}} common law. The {{legal profession}} includes both barristers and solicitors with most barristers also acting as solicitors. Admission and Disciplinary matters in Gibraltar are dealt with by the Bar Council of Gibraltar and the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. In order for barristers or solicitors to be admitted as practising lawyers in Gibraltar they must comply with the Supreme Court Act 1930 as amended by the Supreme Court Amendment Act 2015 which requires, amongst other things, for all newly admitted lawyers as of the 1 July 2015 to undertake a year's course in Gibraltar law at the University of Gibraltar. Solicitors also have <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in Gibraltar's courts.|$|E
5000|$|In {{superior}} courts, generally only barristers or {{advocates have}} a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience.</b> Depending on jurisdiction, solicitors {{may have a}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> in Magistrates and County or District courts.

25|$|The second {{main feature}} was for <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience.</b> Mackay {{proposed}} that all lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, should require {{a certificate of}} competence {{to work in the}} higher courts, while their initial professional qualifications would allow them to practice in the lower courts. This proposal allowed solicitors to gain full <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> up to the House of Lords with the appropriate certification, and was widely disliked by barristers and judges. The idea that barristers would not automatically have <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> also irritated them, and the idea that the Lord Chancellor would be responsible for defining which bodies could grant these certificates undermined the principle that the legal profession should be independent from the Government.|$|R

50|$|Members of the Faculty of Advocates, {{known as}} advocates or counsel, {{and as of}} 1990 also some solicitors, known as solicitor-advocates, have {{practically}} exclusive <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> rights of audience in the court.

Barristers from England and Wales have no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience,</b> which caused controversy in 2011 (over an appeal from an immigration tribunal) and again in 2015 (over an appeal from a tax tribunal) when barristers recognised by the General Council of the Bar were {{denied the right to}} take an appeal on behalf of clients they had represented at tribunal.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, barristers did {{not deal}} with the public directly. This rigid {{separation}} no longer applies.

Despite this many solicitors often encountered hostility from judges when exercising their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>audience</b> for many years after {{the change in the}} law, particularly {{due to the fact that}} solicitors did not wear wigs or gowns and thus, in the judges' view (all of whom were, at that time, ex-barristers) were not 'dressed for court'.|$|E
