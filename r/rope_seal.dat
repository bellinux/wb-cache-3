50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|E

40|$|Achieving {{efficiency}} and performance goals of advanced aircraft and industrial systems are leading designers to implement high temperature {{materials such as}} ceramics and intermetallics. Generally these advanced materials are applied selectively in the highest temperature sections of the engine system including the combustor and high pressure turbine, amongst others. Thermal strains that result in attaching the low expansion-rate components to high expansion rate superalloy structures can cause significant life reduction in the components. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Designers require high temperature, low-leakage, compliant seals to mitigate thermal stresses and control parasitic and cooling airflow between structures.

Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the cam cover sealing design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the cam carriers.

40|$|High {{temperature}} seals {{are required}} for advanced hypersonic airframe applications. In this study, both spring tube thermal barriers and innovative wafer seal systems were evaluated under relevant hypersonic test conditions (temperatures, pressures, etc.) via high temperature compression testing and room temperature flow assessments. Thermal barriers composed of a Rene 41 spring tube filled with Saffil insulation and overbraided with a Nextel 312 sheath showed acceptable performance at 1500 F in both short term and longer term compression testing. Nextel 440 thermal barriers with Rene 41 spring tubes and Saffil insulation demonstrated good compression performance up to 1750 F. A silicon nitride wafer seal/compression spring system displayed excellent load performance at temperatures as high as 2200 F and exhibited room temperature leakage values that were only 1 / 3 those for the spring tube <b>rope</b> <b>seals.</b> For all seal candidates evaluated, no significant degradation in leakage resistance was noted after high temperature compression testing.

40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to fill insulation gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA rope seals braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Rope seals braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the carbon seals for different amounts of linear compression. Room temperature compression tests were performed to assess seal resiliency and unit preloads as a function of compression. The thermal barrier seal was tested in a subscale "char" motor test in which the seal sealed an intentional defect in the gap insulation. Temperature measurements indicated that the seal blocked 2500 F combustion gases on the upstream side with very little temperature rise on the downstream side...|$|E
40|$|Future {{turbine engines}} and {{industrial}} systems will be operating at increased temperatures to achieve more demanding efficiency and performance goals. In the highest temperature {{sections of the}} engine new material systems such as ceramics and intermetallics are being considered to withstand the harsh thermal environment. Components constructed of these low expansion-rate materials experience thermal strains and a resulting reduction of life when rigidly attached to high expansion-rate, superalloy support structures. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Previous seal research yielded several braided <b>rope</b> <b>seal</b> designs which demonstrated the ability to both seal {{and serve as a}} compliant mount. The hybrid seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with a superalloy wire sheath (cobalt based superalloy). The all ceramic seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with multiple ceramic (alumina-silica) sheath layers. Program goals for braided rope seals are to improve flow resistance and/or seal resilience. To that end, the current report studies the test results of: baseline and modified hybrid seals; two stage hybrid and two stage all-ceramic seal configurations; and single stage hybrid and single stage all-ceramic seal configurations for a range of seal crush conditions. Hybrid seal modifications include increasing the sheath braid angle and core coverage. For the same percent seal cross-sectional crush, results show that increasing the hybrid seal braid angle increased seal stiffness and seal unit load, resulting in flows approximately one third of the baseline hybrid seal flows. For both hybrid and all-ceramic seals, two stage seal configurations significantly outperformed single stage configurations. Two stage seal flows were at least 30 % less than the single stage seal flows for the same seal crush. Furthermore, test results of single stage seals indicate that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, a specific seal crush condition exists at which minimum flows are achieved (i. e. increasing seal crush beyond a certain point does not result in better flow performance). Flow results are presented for a range of pressures and temperatures from ambient to 1300 F, before and after scrubbing. Compression tests results show that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, seal preload and stiffness increase with seal crush, but residual seal interference remains constant...|$|E

Three {{days later he}} is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish Messiah. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of Yeshua, one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in Jerusalem before the Emperor arrives. Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, {{with the support of}} his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance. Numerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, like a prostitute named Mary Magdalene and a man named Bartholomew, seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigative methods soon begin to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of Caesar's wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now little more than a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, in the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and <b>ropes</b> <b>sealing</b> the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier running away in fear, and that he had not seen anything like this before.

40|$|The leading Aeronautics program within NASA is the High Speed Research Program (HSR). The HSR program's highest {{priorities}} are high pay-off technologies for airframe and propulsion systems {{required for a}} high speed civil transport (HSCT). These priorities have been developed collaboratively with NASA, FAA and the US Industry (Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric). Phase one of the HSR program started on 1990, and concentrated on the environmental challenges of minimizing NOx and noise. The first program goal {{is to reduce the}} NOx emission index to less than 5 (Concord NOx index is 20 and is unacceptable), in order to have little impact on the earth's ozone layer. The second goal is to reduce noise levels to FAR Stage 3 (or better), comparable to those of subsonic aircraft (far below the Concorde noise levels that require exemptions form less stringent standards). This requirement greatly impacts the nozzle design increasing its length and complexity and poses unique sealing challenges. Phase two started in 1993 and initiated work on the technologies required for an economical HSCT. Materials technologies under development include a ceramic-matrix-composite combustion liner, lightweight materials for the nozzle, as well long-life turbomachinery disk and blade alloys. Other required materials are being developed under the DOD-IHPTET program, where there is close cooperation. Economic goals translate into the development of technologies for tri-class service, 5000 nautical mile range aircraft with a ticket price no more than 20 % over the subsonic ticket price. The potential market could be as large as 1500 aircraft, according to a Boeing study. Technology alone will not enable this airplane, yet without enabling technologies "on the shelf", it will not occur. The HSCT engine will be the largest engine ever built and operate at maximum conditions {{for long periods of time}} posing a number of challenges. The HSR engine mission requires that rotating equipment stay at take-off condition temperatures for hours not minutes per flight. Hence rotating equipment and seals must operate for many thousands of hours at extreme temperatures. It is anticipated that the nozzle will be 12 feet long and roughly 4 ft. by 5 ft. in cross-section with a nominal airflow of 800 lbs/sec. The complex function of the nozzle (including an ejector for noise attenuation) combined with long life place new demands on nozzle seal design. Three inlet configurations are under consideration with attendant sealing challenges, as will be illustrated herein. Four of these engines are required to propel a 5000 nautical mile class vehicle which demand that component reliability be at the highest possible level. In response, an HSR seals session was implemented as a part of the 1997 -Seals and Secondary Flow Workshop. Overview presentations were given for each of the following areas: inlet, turbomachinery, combustor and nozzle. The HSCT seal issues center on durability and efficiency of rotating equipment seals (including brush seals), structural <b>seals</b> (including <b>rope</b> <b>seals</b> and other advanced concepts), and high-speed bearing and sump seals. Tighter clearances, propulsion system size and thermal requirements represent extremes that challenge the component designers. This document provides an initial step toward defining HSR seal needs.

40|$|On January 27, 2010 the City of North Little Rock, Arkansas {{received}} {{notification of}} {{the awarding of}} a Department of Energy (DOE) grant totaling $ 450, 000 in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) under the Project Title: Recovery Act: Hydroelectric Facility Improvement Project â€“ Automated Intake Clearing Equipment and Materials Management. The purpose of the grant was for improvements to be made at the Cityâ€™s hydroelectric generating facility located on the Arkansas River. Improvements were to be made through the installation of an intake maintenance device (IMD) and {{the purchase of a}} large capacity wood grinder. The wood grinder was purchased in order to receive the tree limbs, tree trunks, and other organic debris that collects at the intake of the plant during high flow. The wood grinder eliminates the periodic burning of the waste material that is cleared from the intake and reduces any additional air pollution to the area. The resulting organic mulch has been made available to the public at no charge. Design discussion and planning began immediately and the wood grinder was purchased in July of 2010 and immediately put to work mulching debris that was gathered regularly from the intake of the facility. The mulch is currently available to the public for free. A large majority of the design process was spent in discussion with the Corps of Engineers to obtain approval for drawings, documents, and permits that were required in order to make changes to the structure of the powerhouse. In April of 2011, the Cityâ€™s Project Engineer, who had overseen the application, resigned and left the Cityâ€™s employ. A new Systems Mechanical Engineer was hired and tasked with overseeing the project. The transfer of responsibility led to a re-examination of the original assumptions and research upon which the grant proposal was based. At that point, the project went under review and a trip was booked for July 2011 to visit facilities that currently had an IMD installed. This further study of facilities revealed that the implementation of the project as originally described, while proving the benefits described in the original grant application, would likely intensify sand intake. Increased sand intake would lead to an increase in required shutdowns for maintenance and more rapid depreciation of key equipment which would result in a loss of generation capacity. A better solution to the problem, one that continued to meet the criteria for the original grant and ARRA standards, was developed. A supporting day trip was planned to visit other facilities located on the Arkansas River to determine how they were coping with the same strong amounts of sand, silt, and debris. Upon returning from the trip to other Arkansas River facilities it was extremely clear what direction to go in order to most efficiently address the issue of generator capacity and efficiency. Of the plants visited on the Arkansas River, every one of them was running what is called a <b>rope</b> packing shaft <b>sealing</b> system as opposed to mechanical shaft seals, which the facility was running. Rope packing is a time proven sealing method that has been around for centuries. It has proved to perform very well in dirty water situations just like that of the Arkansas River. In April of 2012 a scope change proposal was submitted to the DOE for approval. In August of 2012 the City received word that the change of scope had been approved. Plans were immediately set in motion to begin the conversion from mechanical seals to a packing box at the facility. Contractors arrived on October 1 st, 2012 and the project team began unwatering the unit for disassembly. The seal conversion was completed on February 29 th, 2013 with start-up of the unit.
