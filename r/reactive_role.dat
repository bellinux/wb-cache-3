30|$|A {{learning}} Framework {{that emphasizes}} intentional teaching marks another departure from tradition because {{it focuses on}} teaching, learning and child development, rather than being oriented primarily to children’s developmental progress. Where free play is a feature of early childhood programs, child autonomy (or the lack of adult intervention) works to encourage children’s curiosity, foster confidence, and develop competence and independence.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} entrepreneurs' {{coping strategies}} to manage stakeholders' expectations. We develop and test four coping strategies (structural role redefinition, personal role redefinition, <b>reactive</b> <b>role</b> behavior and passive role behavior) to assess influence on new venture performance. The analysis considers potential moderating effects of entrepreneurs' perceived role-related stress. We {{draw from the}} general management, role theory, and entrepreneurship literature to develop hypotheses, tested using hierarchical regression based on responses from 183 Slovenian entrepreneurs. Results reveal that coping strategies focused on reducing expectations and/or working harder to meet expectations positively affect new venture performance. However, entrepreneurs' focus on suppressing perceived expectations negatively influences new venture performance. Furthermore, entrepreneur's role-related stress moderates the relationship between <b>reactive</b> <b>role</b> behavior and new venture performance. This study provides {{a better understanding of}} types of coping strategies available to entrepreneurs and practical consequences for new venture performance.

Keynote address {{at the annual meeting}} of the European Association for Practitioner Research on Improving Learning. November 27 - 29, Biel/Bienne, Switzerland. Educational design research is a genre of inquiry in which the design of innovative solutions to problems in educational practice provides the context for scientific investigation, yielding results that can also inform the work of others. Educational design research is theoretically-oriented (it uses existing theoretical insights to frame both research and development, and strives to contribute scientific understanding); interventionist (it aims to improve practice); collaborative (it requires multiple participants and varied expertise); responsively grounded (the findings from one phase influence subsequent directions); and iterative (it anticipates multiple cycles of inquiry and action). Practitioners are inherently involved in educational design research, most often in <b>reactive</b> <b>roles,</b> though sometimes as co-designers and occasionally as researchers. While rare, practitioners may also function as lead investigators in design studies. Due to the scope and complexity of educational design research, it presents a tremendous challenge. This is because it requires access to and fluency in multiple areas of literature (e. g. educational innovation, research methods, and the topic of inquiry); a diverse skill set (e. g. educational researcher, intervention designer, implementation facilitator); and – to do it well – substantial amounts of time. For those not able to devote major portions of their time to the effort (e. g. due to teaching load), the task may be insurmountable. Yet, despite the challenges, use of this approach is increasing. Powerful collaborations in multidisciplinary teams have been central to successful design studies. This presentation shares several examples of design research in which practitioners led in co-design and/or research roles, highlighting both struggles and successes as related to various functions (e. g. investigator, designer, implementer, reporter). It concludes with a call for those interested in design research to seek ways to understand, appreciate and support each function, acknowledging that individuals have varying affinities for the different tasks required...|$|R

Children {{needed to go to}} the circulation desk in person in order to get designated books and answer sheets. Children earned points to redeem for prizes by answering questions correctly.

(3) Children’s perceived learning outcomes of participation in the program included improving children’s attention span, the positive influence of messages delivered by books on children, and the positive progress of children’s reading, writing, logical thinking and interpersonal skills.
