40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{study is}} {{used to measure the}} surface topology and roughness of <b>radial</b> and <b>capture</b> spider silks on the micro- and nanoscale. This is done for silks of the orb weaver spider Argiope keyserlingi. Capture silk has a surface roughness that is five times less than that for <b>radial</b> silk. The <b>capture</b> silk has an equivalent flatness of λ/ 100 (5 – 6 nm deep surface features) as an optical surface. This is equivalent to a very highly polished optical surface. AFM does show the number of silk fibers that make up a silk thread but geometric distortion occurs during sample preparation. This prevented AFM from accurately measuring the silk topology on the microscale in this study. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Certain spider webs are {{composed}} of several types of micro-optical elements made from transparent optical materials. The silks (<b>radial</b> and <b>capture)</b> are almost exclusively protein. The nearly cylindrical silks have diameters in the range 0. 1 to several microns and cross-sectional morphology that is cylindrical-multi-layered,. as studied by transmission electron microscopy, The capture threads are coated with aqueous adhesive that also forms into nearly elliptical micro-lenses (adhesive droplets) mounted on the near cylindrical silks. The remaining elements of the web are the cement junctions tying the <b>radial</b> and the <b>capture</b> threads of the web together. These are irregularly shaped platelets. Progress to date on our research characterizing the optical properties and function of these transparent orb webs has been to interpret the reflection and transmission properties {{of the elements of}} the web, and the web as a whole, in natural lighting; to evaluate the optical finish of the surface of the silks and capture droplets; and to measure the principal refractive indices of radial silks using new immersion based methods developed for application to micron-sized, curved optical elements. Here we report the principal refractive indices, birefringence, dispersion and morphology of transparent spider silk subject to various chemical treatments. The morphology is measured using TEM. Insight into the physical origin of the refractive index properties will be discussed. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Climate studies require long data records {{extending}} {{the lifetime of}} a single remote sensing satellite mission. Precise satellite altimetry exploring global and regional evolution of the sea level has now completed a two decade data record. A consistent long-term data record has to be constructed from a sequence of different, partly overlapping altimeter systems which have to be carefully cross-calibrated. This cross-calibration is realized globally by adjusting an extremely large set of single- and dual-satellite crossover differences performed between all contemporaneous altimeter systems. The total set of crossover differences creates a highly redundant network and enables a robust estimate of radial errors with a dense and rather complete sampling for all altimeter systems analyzed. An iterative variance component estimation is applied to obtain an objective relative weighting between altimeter systems with different performance. The final time series of radial errors is taken to estimate (for each of the altimeter systems) an empirical auto-covariance function. Moreover, the <b>radial</b> errors <b>capture</b> relative range biases and indicate systematic variations in the geo-centering of altimeter satellite orbits. The procedure {{has the potential to}} estimate for all altimeter systems the geographically correlated mean errors which is not at all visible in single-satellite crossover differences but maps directly to estimates of the mean sea surface...|$|R
40|$|Crack {{propagation}} {{during the}} indentation {{test of a}} ferroelectric single crystal is simulated using a phase- eld model. This model is based on variational formulations of brittle crack propagation and domain evolution in ferroelectric materials. Due to the high compressive stresses near the indenter contact faces, a modi ed regularized formulation of the variational brittle fracture is coupled with the material model to prevent crack formation and interpenetration in the compressed regions. The simulation {{results show that the}} radial cracks perpendicular to the poling direction of the material propagate faster than the parallel ones, which is in agreement with experimental observations.

40|$|Based on the {{relationship}} between Archimedean copulas and l 1 -norm symmetric distributions, we propose a method to not only estimate the copula parameter but also select the copula model through the observation data in this paper. The strong consistency of the estimator is proved, and a Radial Information Criteria (RIC) is provided to select the appropriate Archimedean copula model fitting the data best. It can be extended to the multivariate cases conveniently because the selection is achieved by using the one-dimensional <b>radial</b> distribution to <b>capture</b> the dependence structure for multivariate data. The Monte Carlo simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed approach works well in parameter estimation and model selection for both bivariate and multivariate cases.

The MOCoPo (Measuring and mOdelling COngestion and POllution) collaboration collected more than 10 hours of data with a high resolution camera mounted underneath a helicopter flying almost immobile above a freeway in Grenoble. Along with the post-treatment method, this generates a noise in the position measurement {{of the center of}} gravity of the image associated with the vehicle. We present a method classically based on polynomial fitting but where the originality states in using the polar coordinates instead of the Cartesian ones as is usually done. Indeed the <b>radial</b> coordinate <b>capture</b> most of the physics of the act of driving a car: selecting a speed, whereas the polar angle is much more related to the geometry of the road. The method fits the space travelled whose derivative is the real instantaneous speed. This method is developed in two versions: piece-wise constant accelerations or piece-wise linear accelerations. In both cases the root mean square error of the position measurements is of less than 0. 4 m. The main advantage of this method is that it provides values of acceleration fully compatible with the physical limits found in the literature, without adding extra constraint...|$|R

40|$|Accurate image {{segmentation}} {{is one of}} the key problems in computer vision. In domains such as radiation treatment planning, dosimetrists must manually trace the outlines of a few critical structures on large numbers of images. Considerable similarity can be seen in the shape of these regions, both between adjacent slices in a particular patient and across the spectrum of patients. Consequently we should be able to model this similarity and use it to assist in the process of segmentation. Previous work has demonstrated that a constraint-based 2 D <b>radial</b> model can <b>capture</b> generic shape information for certain shape classes, and can reduce user interaction by a factor of three over purely manual segmentation.

It is shown that the capture cross section is {{much larger than the}} area of Jupiter orbit being inversely diverging at small particle energy. We show that the dynamics of captured particles is chaotic and is well described by a simple symplectic dark map. This dark map description allows to simulate the scattering and dynamics of 10 ^ 14 dark matter particles during the life time of the Solar System and to determine dark matter density profile as a function of distance from the Sun. The mass of captured dark matter in the radius of Neptune orbit is estimated to be 2 · 10 ^ 15 g.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of planetesimals in evolved gaseous disks, which orbit a solar-mass star and harbor a Jupiter-mass planet at a_p~ 5 AU. The gas dynamics is modeled with a three-dimensional hydrodynamics code that employes nested-grids and achieves a resolution of one Jupiter's radius in the circumplanetary disk. The code models solids as individual particles. Planetesimals are subjected to gravitational forces by the star and the planet, drag force by the gas, disruption via ram pressure, and mass loss through ablation. The mass evolution of solids is calculated self-consistently with their temperature, velocity, and position. We consider icy and icy/rocky bodies of radius 0. 1 - 100 km, initially deployed on orbits around the star within a few Hill radii (Rhill) of the planet's orbit. Planetesimals are scattered inward, outward, and toward disk regions of radius r>>a_p. Scattering can relocate significant amounts of solids, provided that regions |r-a_p|~ 3 Rhill are replenished with planetesimals. Scattered bodies can be temporarily captured on planetocentric orbits. Ablation consumes nearly all solids at gas temperatures > ~ 220 K. Super-keplerian rotation around and beyond {{the outer edge of}} the gas gap can segregate < ~ 0. 1 km bodies, producing solid gap edges at size-dependent <b>radial</b> locations. <b>Capture,</b> break-up, and ablation of solids result in a dust-laden circumplanetary disk with low surface densities of km-size planetesimals, implying relatively long timescales for satellite formation. After a giant planet acquires most of its mass, accretion of solids is unlikely to alter significantly its heavy-element content. The luminosity generated by solids' accretion can be of a similar order of magnitude to the contraction luminosity. Comment: 30 pages, 20 figures, 6 tables.

40|$|Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal We present GPU {{implementations}} of two fast force calculation methods, {{based on}} series expansions of the Poisson equation. One is the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method, {{which is a}} Fourier-like expansion of the density field in some basis set; {{the other is the}} Multipole Expansion (MEX) method, which is a Taylor-like expansion of the Green’s function. MEX, which has been advocated in the past, has not gained as much popularity as SCF. Both are particle-field method and optimized for collisionless galactic dynamics, but while SCF is a “pure ” expansion, MEX is an expansion in just the angular part; it is thus capable of <b>capturing</b> <b>radial</b> structure easily, where SCF needs a large number of radial terms. We show that despite the expansion bias, these methods are more accurate than direct techniques for the same number of particles. The performance of our GPU code, which we call ETICS, is profiled and compared to a CPU implementation. On the tested GPU hardware, a full force calculation for one million particles took ∼ 0. 1 seconds (depending on expansion cutoff), making simulations with as many as 108 particles fast on a comparatively small number of nodes. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{state-of-the-art}} approach of passive-ocean Modified Radial Basis Functions (MRBFs) that improves {{the recovery of}} time-variable gravity fields from GRACE. As is well known, spherical harmonics (SHs), which are commonly used to recover gravity fields, are orthogonal basis functions with global coverage. However, the chosen SH truncation involves a global compromise between data coverage and obtainable resolution, and strong localized signals may not be fully <b>captured.</b> <b>Radial</b> basis functions (RBFs) provide another representation, which has been proposed in earlier works to be better suited to retrieve regional gravity signals. In this paper, we propose a MRBF approach by embedding the known coastal geometries in the RBF parameterization and imposing global mass conservation and equilibrium behavior of the oceans. Our hypothesis is that, with this physically justified constraint, the GRACE-derived gravity signals can be more realistically partitioned into the land and ocean contributions along the coastlines. We test this new technique to invert monthly gravity fields from GRACE level- 1 b observations covering 2005 - 2010, for which the numerical results indicate that: (1) MRBF-based solutions {{reduce the number of}} parameters by approximately 10 %, and allow for more flexible regularization when compared to ordinary RBF solutions; and (2) the MRBF-derived mass flux is better confined along coastal areas. The latter is particularly tested in the Southern Greenland, and our results indicate that the trend of mass loss from the MRBF solutions is approximately 11 % larger than that from the SH solutions, and approximately 4 % ∼ 6 % larger than that of RBF solutions...|$|R
40|$|I {{introduce}} Profiler, a new, user-friendly program {{written in}} Python {{and designed to}} analyse the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxies. With an intuitive graphical user interface, Profiler can accurately model {{a wide range of}} galaxies and galaxy components, such as elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral and lenticular galaxies, nuclear sources, discs, bars, rings, spiral arms, etc., with a variety of parametric functions routinely employed in the field (Sérsic, core-Sérsic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat and Ferrers). In addition to these, Profiler can employ the broken exponential model (relevant for disc truncations or antitruncations) and two special cases of the edge-on disc model: namely along the major axis (in the disc plane) and along the minor axis (perpendicular to the disc plane). Profiler is optimised to work with galaxy light profiles obtained from isophotal measurements which <b>capture</b> <b>radial</b> gradients in the ellipticity, position angle and Fourier harmonic profiles of the isophotes, and are thus often better at capturing the total light than two-dimensional image-fitting programs. Additionally, the one-dimensional approach is generally less computationally expensive and more stable. In Profiler, the convolution of either circular or elliptical models with the point spread function is performed in two-dimensions, and offers a choice between Gaussian, Moffat or a user-provided data vector (a table of intensity values as a function of radius) for the point spread function. I demonstrate Profiler's features and operation by decomposing three case-study galaxies: the cored elliptical galaxy NGC 3348, the nucleated dwarf Seyfert I galaxy Pox 52, and NGC 2549, a structurally complex, double-barred galaxy which also displays a Type II truncated disc viewed edge-on.

40|$|Because of {{its high}} energy density, {{hydrogen}} is a desirable energy source for the achievement of a renewable energy landscape. Though production methods like thermolysis, electrolysis and biomass conversion, among others, {{are thought to be}} long term renewable solutions, catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR) is currently the predominant mechanism to produce hydrogen on an industrial scale. The highly endothermic, transport-limited reforming process has also been scaled down through process intensification to create efficient small-scale hydrogen-generating systems. One proposed geometry utilizes a catalytic finned cylinder that provides a manufacturable solution to enable high-efficiency heat exchange and SMR reaction. An accurate representation of the reactor performance characteristics is imperative to the design of small-scale systems. The Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, the respective dimensionless temperature and concentration gradients, are commonly used to model the transport characteristics. Previous works have outlined the significance of modeling techniques that include <b>radial</b> diffusion to <b>capture</b> the bulk-phase diffusive resistance. However, prior studies have either over-simplified the transport to neglect diffusion in the bulk fluid or employed CFD to include the relevant effects. A considerable limitation of CFD-derived solutions is a high degree of computational intensity. In the current study, local transport coefficients are determined for the SMR reaction in a catalytic microchannel. The 2 -D cylindrical transport equations are simplified based on approximations from prior work to represent the channel geometry. The applied assumptions dramatically decrease the model 2 ̆ 7 s computation time. A finite central-differencing scheme is implemented to solve the coupled transport equations with the reaction kinetics, and is solved through simultaneous matrix inversion. A kinetic model for SMR reactions is included as a model subroutine to describe the highly non-linear transport/kinetic interactions, while accounting for species adsorption/desorption to and from the catalyst. The transport model is compared to known solutions for the desired boundary conditions to validate the diffusive effects. The full model is validated against experimental data, and is able to reasonably predict the expected transport behavior and chemical kinetic interactions in the catalytic microchannel...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of studies concerning an asymptotically reduced equation set derived from the Boussinesq approximation describing rotationally constrained geophysical flow. The first investigation is concerned with a statistical identification of coherent and long-lived structures in rotationally constrained Rayleigh-Bénard convection. Presently, physical laboratory limitations challenge experimentalists while spatio-temporal resolution requirements challenges numericists performing direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. These challenges prevent an exhaustive analysis of the flow morphology in the rapid rotating limit. In this study the flow morphologies obtained from simulations of the reduced equations are investigated from a statistical perspective. Auto- and cross-correlations are computed from temporal and spatial signals that synthesize experimental data that may be obtained in laboratory experiments via thermistor measurements or particle image velocimetry. The statistics used can be employed in laboratory experiments to identify regime transitions in flow morphology, <b>capture</b> <b>radial</b> profiles of coherent structures, and extract transport properties belonging to these structures. These results provide a foundation for comparison and a measure for understanding the extent to which rotationally constrained regime has been accessed by laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations. A related study comparing the influence of fixed temperature and fixed heat flux thermal boundary conditions on rapidly rotating convection in the plane layer geometry is also investigated and briefly summarized for the case of stress-free mechanical boundary conditions. It is shown that the difference between these thermal boundary conditions on the interior geostrophically balanced convection is asymptotically weak. Through a simple rescaling of thermal variables, the leading order reduced system is shown to be equivalent for both thermal boundary conditions. These results imply that any horizontal thermal variation along the boundaries that varies on the scale of the convection has no leading order influence on the interior convection, thus providing insight into geophysical and astrophysical flows where stress-free mechanical boundary conditions are often assumed. The final study presented here contrasts the previous investigations. It presents an investigation of rapidly rotating and stably stratified turbulence where the stratification strength is varied from weak (large Froude number) to strong (small Froude number). The investigation is set {{in the context of the}} asymptotically reduced model which efficiently retains anisotropic inertia-gravity waves with order-one frequencies and highlights a regime of wave-eddy interactions. Numerical simulations of the reduced model are performed where energy is injected by a stochastic forcing of vertical velocity. The simulations reveal two regimes: one characterized by the presence of well-formed, persistent and thin turbulent layers of locally-weakened stratification: the other characterized by the absence of layers at large Froude numbers. Both regimes are characterized by a large-scale barotropic dipole in a sea of small-scale turbulence. When the Reynolds number is not too large a direct cascade of barotropic kinetic energy is observed and leads to an equilibration of total energy. We examine net energy exchanges that occur through vortex stretching and vertical buoyancy flux and diagnose the horizontal scales active in these exchanges. We find that baroclinic motions inject energy directly to the largest scales of the barotropic mode governed by the two-dimensional vorticity equation, and implies that the large-scale barotropic dipole is not the end result of an inverse cascade within the two-dimensional barotropic mode. An additional yet brief look into the linear vortical and wave modes is considered...|$|R
