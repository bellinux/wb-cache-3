50|$|The IDA lends to {{countries}} {{with the aim}} to finance projects that will develop infrastructure and improve education, healthcare, access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and environmental responsibility. It {{is considered to be}} the soft lending window of the World Bank, while the IBRD is considered to be the hard lending window. The association offers grants and loans with maturities ranging from 25 to 40 years, grace periods of 5 to 10 years, and interest rates of 2.8% or 1.25% depending on whether the borrower is a blend country and to which degree it is eligible. Regular IDA-eligible borrowers may take advantage of no-interest loans. Financial resources are allocated to eligible countries based on their success at implementing pro-growth and a poverty-reducing domestic policies. The IDA uses the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) development indicator to determine each country's place in a resource allocation index. It then prioritizes its lending to those countries which are indicated to be most promising in terms of favorable policies and aid effectiveness. The IDA adopted the Crisis <b>Response</b> <b>Window</b> in 2007 to enable the rapid provision of emergency financing in response to crises. The association adopted the Immediate Response Mechanism in 2011 to provide IDA borrowers with immediate access to withdraw undisbursed portions of their loans, should a crisis arise that meets the mechanism's criteria.|$|E
40|$|Variation in the {{incoming}} sheet material and {{fluctuations in the}} press setup is unavoidable in many stamping plants. The effect of these variations can have a large influence {{on the quality of}} the final stamping, in particular, unpredictable springback of the sheet when the tooling is removed. While stochastic simulation techniques have been developed to simulate this problem, there has been little research that connects the influence of the noise sources to springback. This paper characterises the effect of material and process variation on the robustness of springback for a semi-cylindrical channel forming operation, which shares a similar cross-section profile as many automotive structural components. The study was conducted using the specialised sheet metal forming package AutoForm TM Sigma, for which a series of stochastic simulations were performed with each of the noise sources incrementally introduced. The effective stress and effective strain scatter in a critical location of the part was examined and a <b>response</b> <b>window,</b> which indicates the respective process robustness, was defined. The incremental introduction of the noise sources allows the change in size of the stressstrain <b>response</b> <b>window</b> to be tracked. The results showed that changes to process variation parameters, such as BHP and friction coefficient, directly affect the strain component of the stressstrain <b>response</b> <b>window</b> by altering the magnitude of external work applied to forming system. Material variation, on the other hand, directly affected the stress component of the <b>response</b> <b>window.</b> A relationship between the effective stressstrain <b>response</b> <b>window</b> and the variation in springback was also established...|$|E

The black-box model stores the output <b>response</b> <b>windows</b> for a basic set of relative input arrival time combinations, and computes the output arrival time for any given input arrival time combination through the union of some combinations in the basic set.

40|$|Prospective memory, {{memory for}} future events, {{is used for}} remembering duties and {{obligations}} that all people must complete. Past research has contributed {{to our understanding of}} the bases of prospective memory tasks (time versus event) and the kinds of situations requiring prospective memory (appointments, chores, deadlines, and medications). However, research has yet to examine how prospective remembering unfolds over time. For example, very little is known about how such remembering is affected by the time from when the task is encoded to the time that a task must be conducted (the retention interval), the length of the time in which a response can be counted as correct (the <b>response</b> <b>window),</b> and the time from a warning signal, if given, to the time that the prospective task must be completed (the anticipatory lag). This research explored the accuracy and temporal precision to remember to complete a prospective memory task. An accurate prospective remembering involves responding within a <b>response</b> <b>window.</b> The precision of a prospective response refers to how close in time a response is to the ideal time expected of a response. Participants completed prospective memory tasks with three retention intervals (45 second, 60 second, and 7 5 second) and attempted to respond within a <b>response</b> <b>window</b> often seconds. Warning signals were either not presented or presented at five and fifteen seconds prior to the expected reaction time. The results indicated that a warning signal affected both the accuracy and precision of prospective remebering such that shorter anticipatory lags created greater accuracy and lower failure rates.

By contrast, if the <b>response</b> <b>window</b> occurred in a context that preceded the expected context, time-based performance was worse than having no context expectation at all.

A discussion {{of using the}} Discrete Fourier Transform (OFT) {{as a tool to}} process signals is included in Chapter 1. An introduction to the use of windows in processing signals is given at the beginning of Chapter 2. Performance parameters for windows are then discussed and presented for several specific windows. Important parameters include the mainlobe 3 -dB width, peak sidelobe level, and the integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLA). The mainlobe width is important for resolving signals of approximately equal magnitude. A low peak sidelobe level is important to allow detection of small signals. The ISLA is the ratio of sidelobe energy to mainlobe energy. A small ISLA is required to obtain good contrast. The frequency <b>responses</b> of various <b>windows</b> and their use in spectral analysis are examined in Chapter 3. Processed signals usually contain errors in phase, due to equipment errors and uncompensated system errors. An introduction to phase errors is given in Chapter 4. Phase errors cause perturbations in the frequency <b>responses</b> of <b>windows.</b> These perturbations cause increases in the peak sidelobe level, ISLA, and mainlobe width.
