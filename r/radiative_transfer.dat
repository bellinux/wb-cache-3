5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and <b>radiative</b> <b>transfer).</b>|$|E

In addition, a computational method is necessary to calculate near-field <b>radiative</b> heat <b>transfer.</b> In this study, the computational method is introduced and verification of the computational method is done by a proposed experimental approach. Near-field <b>radiative</b> heat <b>transfer</b> is compared with that of far-field using one half of a Wheatstone bridge circuit and an alignment procedure for controlling the distance between two parallel plates. To measure temperature effects of the near- and the far-field radiations, micro-sensors are designed and piezoelectric stages allowing sensitive relative positioning of two parallel plates are set up. Voltage read-outs acquired by a lock-in amplifier are converted to its temperature variation equivalent, and the comparison of near-field radiation with far-field radiation is presented for the two plate case.

25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The <b>radiative</b> <b>transfer</b> modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane and other hydrocarbons requires better infrared spectra.|$|E

In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Such shifts can be from such physical phenomena as coherence effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a dielectric medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio whistlers.

2500|$|Whether {{or not a}} tidally locked {{planet with}} the orbital {{characteristics}} of Gliese 581g is actually habitable depends on {{the composition of the}} atmosphere {{and the nature of the}} planetary surface. A comprehensive modeling study including atmospheric dynamics, realistic <b>radiative</b> <b>transfer</b> and the physics of formation of sea ice (if the planet has an ocean) indicates that the planet can become as hot as Venus if it is dry and allows carbon dioxide to accumulate in its atmosphere. The same study identified two habitable states for a water-rich planet. If the planet has a very thin atmosphere, a thick ice crust forms over most of the surface, but the substellar point remains hot enough to yield a region of thin ice or even episodically open water. If the planet has an atmosphere with Earthlike pressures, containing approximately 20% (molar) carbon dioxide, then the greenhouse effect is sufficiently strong to maintain a pool of open water under the substellar point with temperatures comparable to the Earth's tropics. This state has been dubbed [...] "Eyeball Earth" [...] by the author. Modeling of the effect of tidal locking on Gliese 581g's possible atmosphere, using a general circulation model employing an atmosphere with Earthlike surface pressure but a highly idealized representation of radiative processes, indicates that for a solid-surface planet the locations of maximum warmth would be distributed in a sideways chevron-shaped pattern centered near the substellar point.|$|E
