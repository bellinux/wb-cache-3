25|$|An {{increase}} in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial {{areas in the}} Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils. To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% {{increase in}} capacity when Route 4 was extended to Wimbledon. To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in South Wimbledon or Colliers Wood and a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon. This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed South London Metro at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon. The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur. New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), {{as well as an}} additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services. This plan may be in service by 2023.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many years}} {{there have been}} {{proposals}} to extend the line one stop southwards from Brixton to Herne Hill. Herne Hill station would be on a large <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> with one platform. This would remove a critical capacity restriction by {{eliminating the need for}} trains to reverse at Brixton. The Mayor of London's 2020 Vision, published in 2013, proposed extending the Victoria line [...] "out beyond Brixton" [...] by 2030.|$|E
50|$|Under ATAM's management, the Rimini-Miramare part of {{the line}} was {{numbered}} 10, which is now the number used to denote the Miramare-Fiera line, operated by diesel buses. However, the <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> in the overhead wires that allowed trolleybus services to terminate in Miramare was recently dismantled {{for the construction of}} a roundabout. At present, the only <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> on the system is at the Miramare Talassoterapico roundabout at Piazzale Giardini in Riccione.|$|E

50|$|There is an {{emergency}} platform on the <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> at Tai Hing North Station. A westbound Light Rail Vehicle can become an eastbound one via the loop and the emergency platform.|$|R
50|$|Minic, like Tri-ang railways, used 12-volt {{direct current}} with a two 'rail' system, which made <b>reversing</b> <b>loops</b> {{impossible}} without an insulated section. The competing German Faller system used alternating current, and had a compatible trolleybus system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the section}} from Riccione Terme to Riccione Piazzale Curiel, the {{overhead}} wire is of a rigid type cable. From Piazzale Curiel onwards, after the <b>reversing</b> <b>loop,</b> the wire is a floating type, with Swiss-style articulated hangers to eliminate kickback movement. At Piazzale Curiel {{there is also}} an automated exchange with infrared remote control.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 1900 the GLSt opened a depot in Dölitz, {{opposite}} what {{later became the}} Agra area (Agra-Geländes). Twelve years later, a second tramcar shed was opened. The <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> terminal east of this facility was opened prior to 13 July 1984. The depot continues in use and accommodates stock working Lines 9, 10, 11 and 16.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, the {{engineering}} of a terminus station such as Woodville Railway Station, New Zealand avoided {{this problem by}} building a balloon loop (<b>reversing</b> <b>loop)</b> so that trains can serve the main station in either direction without the need to reverse. In a midline station where it is desired to reverse a consist or locomotive, a double-track and turning wye arrangement are far more common.|$|E

The nearest London Underground station is Brixton on the Victoria line. There have been past proposals to extend the Victoria line to Herne Hill station on a large <b>reversing</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
50|$|Northbound goods trains {{could enter}} the yard {{by the same}} route, and could leave it by joining the former Caledonian main line {{at the north end}} of Kingmoor yard. The access towards the Waverley route was more complex. Trains drew southward from the yard to a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> at Stainton Junction, {{alongside}} the NBR route; after the engine ran round, the train could proceed directly on the NBR line, crossing the Caledonian main line by the original bridge.|$|E
50|$|A key {{advantage}} for three-rail track is <b>reverse</b> <b>loops,</b> {{where a train}} enters a loop through a turnout and then exits through the same turnout in order to change the train's direction. With two-rail track, when the track reverses on itself, this causes a short circuit. With three-rail track, because the center rail remains constant and the outer rails are electrically identical, this causes no problems.|$|R
5000|$|The line {{started at}} the Edward Street {{terminus}} of the Newry branch of the GNR(I), it passed under the viaduct of the GNR(I) line (see Craigmore Viaduct.) before stations at Craigmore and Millvale, the line terminated at Beesbrook, after a length of [...] The [...] line ascended steadily from Newry to Beesbook, with an average incline of 1 in 86, and a maximum of 1 in 50. <b>Reversing</b> <b>loops</b> were constructed at both terminii.|$|R
50|$|Previously, the Brighton {{line had}} {{branched}} {{off the end}} of the St Kilda Railway, requiring a <b>reverse</b> <b>loop.</b> the Melbourne Company line provided a more direct route into the city via Richmond and Princes Bridge. The Melbourne Railway Company purchased the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1862, and the St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company but was amalgamated with the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company to form the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company on 22 October 1864. subsequently all these railway businesses were acquired by the government-owned Victorian Railways in 1878.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, {{reconstruction}} work began at the station. This included, among other things, the raising and extension of the two remaining platforms to provide passengers with barrier-free access to the trains. At {{the same time a}} bus station was built with a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop.</b> The rebuilt station was officially opened in April 2004. Between 2009 and 2011, information for passengers at the station was also improved, mainly {{in the form of the}} installation of an electronic passenger information system.|$|E
50|$|In November 1907 Line 5 was {{extended}} from Gare d'Orléans (now known as Gare d'Austerlitz) to Gare du Nord where {{the station was}} built on a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop.</b> On 21 April 1908 Line 4 was opened from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt through Gare du Nord. In 1942, the old Line 5 station was closed and replaced with a through station, {{in preparation for the}} extension to Église de Pantin. The part of the old loop that was not destroyed during the building of RER Line B in the 1970s together with connecting lines to Lines 2 and 4 under the Boulevard de Magenta and the Rue de Dunkerque are now used for driver training (USFRT). The length of platforms on Line 4 were extended from 75m to 90m in the 1960s during the upgrading of the line for rubber-tyre operations.|$|E
50|$|The Parlor car {{was built}} {{as the final}} {{carriage}} in the Spirit of Progress consist. It entered service on 17 November 1937, in a royal blue scheme with two gold-leaf bands. Originally the car was planned to have flat ends, {{like the rest of}} the fleet. Later, the design was altered to provide for the rounded end, allowing for better views from the rear of the train. To ensure that the car was at the rear of the train on every run, the whole Spirit of Progress consist was reversed in the North Melbourne <b>Reversing</b> <b>Loop</b> in Melbourne, and on the triangle between Wodonga, Coal Sidings and Bandiana near Albury. This train, along with the wooden Albury Express with cars Yarra and Murray, were the only trains in Victoria where the guard was permitted to travel in a van adjacent to the locomotive, rather than in the rear carriage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReverse {{supply chain}} {{management}} is a significant issue for sustainable economy, product recovery and green thinking. The {{purpose of this study}} is to contribute product recovery management by designing open <b>loop</b> <b>reverse</b> supply chain network. The main difference between open loop and closed <b>loop</b> <b>reverse</b> supply chain is in returning of used products. In a closed <b>loop</b> <b>reverse</b> supply chain, used products are generally returned to original producers. But in an open <b>loop</b> <b>reverse</b> supply chain, used products are not returned to original producers, outsider firms recover them. This paper presents a mathematical model for multi stage and multi period reverse supply chain network, which maximizes total profit of the network. The proposed model determines facility locations and material flows between stages in each period. Numerical experiments showed the applicability and efficiency of the model...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{subdivision}} aims at {{constructing a}} coarser representation {{of an object}} given by a fine polygon mesh. In this paper, we first derive a mask for <b>reverse</b> <b>Loop</b> subdivision {{that can be applied}} to both regular and extraordinary vertices. The mask is parameterized, and thus can also be used in <b>reversing</b> variants of <b>Loop</b> subdivision, such as those proposed by Warren and Litke. We apply this mask not only to mesh geometry, but also to texture coordinates. This reverses the texture-mapping process described by DeRose, Kass and Truong, in which a texture originally defined for a coarse mesh was carried to the finer meshes obtained by subdivision. Combined with the forward subdivision, the proposed technique constitutes a multiresolution representation of textured subdivision surfaces. We illustrate its use with a set of examples...|$|R
50|$|The station opened {{when the}} Van Aken line was {{extended}} east from Lynnfield Road. The extension opened on July 30, 1930 {{at the same}} time that trains began using Cleveland Union Terminal.The station originally included a car yard with a reverse U for turning the trains around. A passenger station building was constructed within the radius of <b>reverse</b> <b>loop</b> in 1932. However, because of the need to generate income, the building was never used as a passenger station but was leased for use as a Texaco service station. In 1948, the reverse U was replaced by a regular turnaround loop.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the station, the train heads {{straight}} for 3 mi, until coming into some hills. Shortly thereafter, the train crosses Ferguson's Trestle (MP 285.87), named {{for a man who}} was hung from a locomotive there. The original trestle was featured in the 1988 TV movie Where The Hell's That Gold? starring Willie Nelson and Delta Burke. In filming, a planned explosion ended up getting out of hand and the bridge was burned down. Traffic was halted for a week while the C&TS built a temporary bridge; the following winter it rebuilt the trestle to match the original. About three miles (5 km) later, the train makes the first of 11 crossings into New Mexico, and climbs a ledge up to a lava mesa. Lava (291.55) has the old water tank from Antonito which was moved here in 1971. The track goes around a horseshoe curve which is also used as a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> to turn the rotary snow plow trains from Chama. The Cumbres and Toltec has two rotary snowplows, Rotary OM and Rotary OY.|$|E
5000|$|On systems where, {{for reasons}} of economy, the {{couplings}} are made non-reversible (e.g. by fitting the air brake pipe along {{one side of the}} car only), the use of a <b>reversing</b> <b>loop</b> will cause a proportion of the rolling stock to face the [...] "wrong" [...] way and it may not be possible to assemble a complete train in a depot, even if sufficient cars are on hand. This was the case on the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now part of the Northern line of London Underground). After the opening of a loop at Charing Cross (Embankment) in 1914 (replaced in 1926 by the present Kennington loop) car ends were marked [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] (later, when axles were designated by letters, the [...] "B" [...] car ends became [...] "D" [...] to match the adjacent axle), and it was not permitted to couple cars together if the ends to be coupled bore the same letter. It was found necessary to provide a turntable at Golders Green depot (near {{the other end of the}} line), for use when there was an imbalance of car directions.|$|E
50|$|Sundered by {{the county}} {{boundaries}} running {{down the center of}} the river, West Brownsville economically was integrated with cross-river Brownsville by a ferry dating back into the early 1800s when Brownsville became a riverboat building and outfitting center. With construction of boats on nearby large tributaries, the shallow banks of West Brownsville were a favorite location to tie up and outfit a new built water craft to outfit it and load cargoes. The modern-day Main Street is notable for featuring on-street running by freight trains {{down the center of the}} street. Along with right bank Brownsville on the opposite shore, West Brownsville and Brownsville hosted extensive rail yards jammed into the tight confines along both banks of the Monongahela River. One special feature at either end of the two railyards was they each shared a bridge joining two river crossing wyes that tied together to contain a rare true-life <b>reversing</b> <b>loop,</b> normally a feature only found in model railroading layouts. The yards serviced the extensive rail hopper car deliveries feeding the coking ovens up river along the southside of Brownsville, and were integral parts of the famous Pittsburgh Steal Industries. The Monongahela Railroad represented the Lake Erie, the PRR, and the B&O, and Norfolk and Western both utilized the trackage in the towns, which today is operated by the Norfolk and Southern successor, the Monongahela vanishing into the CONRAIL debacle.|$|E
