Richmond's Shadow wore all black, including a trench coat, a wide-brimmed fedora, and a full face-mask similar to the type worn by movie serial hero The Masked Marvel, instead of the character's signature black cape with <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> and red scarf.|$|E
25|$|Drummond {{changed the}} {{locomotive}} livery soon after joining the company, removing the <b>red</b> <b>lining,</b> edging instead in white, and adding 'HR' on the tenders or tanks and front buffer beams. These initials became 'Highland Railway' in full on the Castle class. After 1903, the locomotives were painted a darker green with no lining and labeled, 'The Highland Railway' on the tenders or tanks. Drummond {{moved to the}} Glasgow & South Western Railway in 1912.|$|E
25|$|R 704, {{which was}} {{displayed}} at the Festival of Britain in 1951 and retained its commemorative plaques, is today preserved at the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum. R 704 was painted in a one-off special livery of black with gold and <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> finished with stainless steel boiler banding for its display at the Festival. Although reverting to the standard VR R class livery on entering service, it retained the stainless steel trim and is currently displayed in this state.|$|E

25|$|From 1870 to 1905 the livery was Stroudley's 'Improved Engine Green', {{a golden}} ochre {{very similar to}} that used by his former employer, the Highland Railway. On {{passenger}} locomotives Improved Engine Green was finished with olive green borders lined with black, red and white. Frames and buffer beams were carmine red, lined with yellow and black. The wheels were Improved Engine Green with <b>red</b> <b>lining.</b> Cab roofs were white. Goods engines were all-over olive green with black borders, similar to the pre-1870 colours. If fitted with Westinghouse brakes the black borders were edged with red lines. Locomotives with names had the name applied in gold leaf to the tank side on tank locomotives, to a wheel splasher on tender locomotives. The letters were edged with a thin red line and given depth with black shading. This livery {{was one of the most}} ornate and distinctive used on British locomotives, and is remembered with nostalgia. Carriages were all mahogany in colour, with white roofs and black chassis gear. Initially the wood of the body was varnished, but as it became harder to maintain a high-quality varnish finish and it was painted in a similar-coloured paint. Panel lining and other details were picked out with gold leaf.|$|E
25|$|K 163: In {{regular service}} on the {{preserved}} Mornington Railway, hauling passenger services between Moorooduc and Mornington. The engine had been withdrawn from Government service in December 1968, at Ararat. It then sat idle for a few years, before being sold to the Frankston Apex Club in November 1973, {{and placed in the}} Frankston Jubilee Park. Within a few months it had been painted teal green above the frames. In 1984, the engine was sold to the Mornington Railway Preservation Society, and a boiler certificate was granted in July 1985. In November that year, the engine was moved to the Cresco sidings at Hastings for restoration, and moved under its own power for the first time ten months later. Fully restored in May 1987, and painted in a bright green scheme, with a similar layout similar to that of K190 at the time. By 1995 the engine had been repainted to a much darker green, with <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> and black smokebox and smoke deflectors, and as of 2004, the engine had gold boiler bands. The engine was under overhaul from 7 February to 21 November 2010, then it re-entered service, in the same livery but with the red changed to the same dark green, and regularly running without smoke deflectors. This overhaul utilised the boiler from K 191. The engine was used as the locomotive on train scene in part 3 of The Pacific.|$|E
500|$|After {{nationalisation}} in 1948, the locomotives' initial livery was {{a slightly}} modified Southern malachite green livery, where [...] "British Railways" [...] replaced [...] "Southern" [...] in Sunshine Yellow lettering on the tender sides. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained, {{with an additional}} [...] "S" [...] prefix, such as S21C1. [...] A short-lived second livery was an experimental blue with <b>red</b> <b>lining,</b> as applied to 35024 East Asiatic Company. This was replaced by British Railways express passenger blue with black and white lining. [...] From 1952, the locomotives carried the standard British Railways Brunswick green livery with orange and black lining and the British Railways crest on the tender tank sides. This livery was perpetuated after rebuilding.|$|E

2500|$|After nationalisation, some 5700s {{were painted}} in BR green {{with the words}} [...] "BRITISH RAILWAYS" [...] {{on the side of}} the pannier tanks, but unlined black soon became the {{standard}} for tank locomotives, with the BR crest on the sides of the pannier tanks. Some 5700s also had white and <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> on the pannier tanks and cab sides. The BR crest was changed in 1957.|$|E

[...] The Twelfth Doctor wears a white shirt with no tie, with his top button fastened, a dark blue cardigan (sometimes replaced with a waistcoat), navy trousers and black boots.|$|E
2500|$|Mallard wore {{a variety}} of liveries {{throughout}} its career.

2500|$|On 25 February 1943, 3801 {{worked the}} Newcastle Flyer {{for the first}} time. When joined by 3802 in April 1943, these engines were allotted to working the Melbourne Limited expresses between Sydney and Goulburn. In early 1947 3801 was given a heavy {{overhaul}} and was painted in its standard colour scheme of green with yellow lining. A Waratah emblem {{was added to the}} top of the nose cone in later years. In 1955 3801 was overhauled again, being painted black with <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> as a cost-cutting measure. It was around this time that diesel locomotives started appearing on the rails of NSW. These would take the [...] "glamour workings" [...] away from the 38 class, who would be confined to all-stations passenger and even goods trains.

60|$|The service was, as usual, of {{a length}} which {{severely}} tried the tarrying {{powers of the}} young people assembled; and it was not till the youth of all the other parishes had gone up that the turn came for the Welland bevy. Swithin and some older ones were nearly the last. When, at the heels of Mr. Torkingham, he passed Lady Constantine's pew, he lifted his eyes from the <b>red</b> <b>lining</b> of that gentleman's hood sufficiently high to catch hers. She was abstracted, tearful, regarding him with all the rapt mingling of religion, love, fervour, and hope which such women can feel at such times, and which men know nothing of. How fervidly she watched the Bishop place his hand on her beloved youth's head; how she saw the great episcopal ring glistening in the sun among Swithin's brown curls; how she waited to hear if Dr. Helmsdale uttered the form 'this thy child' which he used for the younger ones, or 'this thy servant' which he used for those older; and how, when he said, 'this thy child,' she felt a prick of conscience, like a person who had entrapped an innocent youth into marriage for her own gratification, till she remembered that she had raised his social position thereby,--all this could only have been told in its entirety by herself.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the conjuror was peculiar. He was {{not much more than}} five feet high, but so slightly formed that he reminded you rather of the boy than the dwarf. The upper part of his face was even delicately moulded; his sparkling black eyes became his round forehead, which was not too much covered by his short glossy black hair; his complexion was clear, but quite olive; his nose was very small and straight, and contrasted singularly with his enormous mouth, the thin bluish lips of which were seldom closed, and consequently did not conceal his large square teeth, which, though very white, were set apart, and were so solid that they looked almost like double teeth. This enormous mouth, which was supported by large jawbones, attracted the attention of the spectator so keenly that it was some time before you observed the prodigious size of the ears, which also adorned this extraordinary countenance. The costume of this being was not less remarkable than his natural appearance. He wore a complete under dress of pliant leather, which fitted close up to his throat and down to his wrists and ankles, where it was clasped with large fastenings, either of gold or some gilt material. This, {{with the addition of a}} species of hussar jacket of green cloth, which was quite unadorned with the exception of its vivid <b>red</b> <b>lining,</b> was the sole covering of the conjuror; who, with a light cap and feather in his hand, was now haranguing the spectators. The object of his discourse was a panegyric of himself and a satire on all other conjurors. He was the only conjuror, the real one, a worthy descendant of the magicians of old.|$|E
