25|$|The final {{generation}} of the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight coincided with its 50th anniversary in 1991. The added length, <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> skirts, wide tail, low nose, and split-grille with wraparound headlights gave this generation Ninety-Eight a more distinctive appearance than its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|In 1955 broad lower <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck {{script and}} hood ornament, {{bars on the}} hubcaps and gold-accented grille were added to {{distinguish}} Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch Dynaflow, in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard. Overall sales were 64,500.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{years after}} the first Viper Concept was revealed, the 2000 GTS-R concept was shown. Osamu Shikado was {{responsible}} for the vehicle's exterior which is 3inches lower and 2inches wider than the production Viper at the time. Shikado used race inspired lines with an aggressive stance. Some of these design cues were adapted to the 2003 production Viper. These included a higher belt line, a side gill, 'bump-up' <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> shape, and a more defined side crease. Viewed from above, the front-to-rear stripe now is tapered.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, for the 1954 model year, {{the model}} {{underwent}} a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling {{because of the}} way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.|$|E

25|$|Up front, all 1958 Oldsmobiles {{received}} one of General Motors' heavily styled front fascias and quad-headlights. Streaking {{back from the}} edge of the headlights was a broad belt consisting of two strips of chrome on regular 88s, three strips on Super 88s, and three strips (top and bottom thin, inside thick) on 98s that ended in a point at mid-body. The bottom of the <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> featured a thick stamping of a half tube that pointed forward, atop which was a chrome assembly of four horizontal chrome speed-lines that terminated into a vertical bar. The tail of the car featured massive vertical chrome taillight housings. Two chrome stars were fitted to the trunklid.|$|E
25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|A record 160,000 fans {{arrived at}} Atlanta Motor Speedway to witness Petty's final ride, {{and to watch}} the {{exciting}} championship battle. At the start, polesitter, Rick Mast and Brett Bodine battled into turn 1, with Bodine leading the first lap. On lap 2, the two cars tangled, and crashed in turn 1. Dale Earnhardt, who was running third, slipped by, and took over the lead. Several other cars were collected in the crash, and five of the championship contenders got through unscathed. Davey Allison, however, slowed to avoid the crash, and was tagged from behind in the left rear by Hut Stricklin. The left <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> was badly bent, but did not puncture the tire. Allison stayed out on the track, and the crew {{would be able to}} bend the bodywork away from the tire on the next pit stop.|$|E
25|$|Minor styling updates adorned the {{carry-over}} body design. For {{the first}} time, small chrome tailfins {{appeared on the}} <b>rear</b> <b>fenders.</b>|$|R

25|$|The first all-new Pontiac models {{appeared}} in 1949. They incorporated styling cues such as lower body lines and <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> that were integrated in the rear-end styling of the car.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. <b>Rear</b> <b>fender</b> skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, wrap-around rear glass and skirted <b>rear</b> <b>fender,</b> {{in favor of a}} design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E

5000|$|The squarish-looking Hackney {{bodies were}} of sheet steel; a running change added small fins atop the <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> on later models. Standard factory colors were red with white trim and wheels.|$|R
25|$|The Bel Air {{utilized}} a stainless-steel {{belt and}} rocker molding, identifying signature on the <b>rear</b> <b>fenders,</b> a glove compartment light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish {{itself from the}} lower-priced Biscayne series.|$|R
500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the swingarm, the reinforced <b>rear</b> <b>fender,</b> and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954 the Imperial Custom {{had a new}} grille {{consisting}} of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a chrome strip, which {{ran the length of}} the front door {{to the front of the}} door opening. The <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> chrome strip style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year's model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1958 the Roadmaster {{could only}} be ordered as the well {{equipped}} Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new [...] "drawer pull" [...] grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For {{the first time since}} 1948 there were no distinguishing VentiPorts on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.|$|E
50|$|Baker, Rauch & Lang built {{most of the}} Owen-Magnetic's coachwork, {{however in}} 1916-1917 a small series of open sports tourers were built by Holbrook that {{featured}} distinctive flat-topped and angled front and <b>rear</b> <b>fenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bel Air {{utilized}} a stainless-steel {{belt and}} rocker molding, identifying signature on the <b>rear</b> <b>fenders,</b> a glove compartment light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish {{itself from the}} lower-priced Biscayne series.|$|R
50|$|Car livery {{began to}} take a new look in 2004, with the cars having numbers on the <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> and {{sponsors}} on the door, which is opposite of what most stock cars traditionally have used.|$|R
2500|$|Each version {{included}} the color-coordinated upholstery and door panels, individually adjustable reclining seats, sports steering wheel, {{as well as}} the [...] of carpeted cargo room, a locking hidden compartment, and a roof rack. Special regional nameplates were on the <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> in addition to the unique medallions on the C-pillar.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Imperial was {{essentially}} a New Yorker with a custom interior. It had a Cadillac-style grille treatment that included circular signal lights enclosed in a wraparound ribbed chrome piece. Side trim was similar to last year's model, but the front fender strip ended at the front doors and the <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> molding was at the tire top level and integrated into the stone guard. Unlike the standard Imperial, the Imperial Crown had a side treatment in which the <b>rear</b> <b>fender</b> moldings and stone guard were separate. Body sill moldings were used on all Imperials, but were of a less massive type on the more massive Crown models. A special version of the limousine was available. It featured a unique leather interior and a leather-covered top that blacked out the rear quarter windows. Power windows were standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E

The hood of this WELD Super Snake is First all carbon fiber Super Snake hood. It also has carbon fiber trim parts, included side rocker panels, rear diffuser, spoiler, {{as well as the}} <b>rear</b> <b>fender.</b> Parts that featured WELD are its vinyl strips and Recaro seats.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 the Eldorado {{was removed}} from the Fleetwood series and {{reestablished}} as its own series. The '73 models received a facelift featuring new front and rear bumpers, egg-crate grille, decklid, <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> and taillamps.|$|R
50|$|The Drifter has {{a hidden}} rear mono-shock {{to make it}} appear to be a hard-tail, akin to a Harley-Davidson Softail. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> cover about half of the {{respective}} wheel, and are the most striking visual cue.|$|R
5000|$|The SV can be {{distinguished}} from its predecessors from its lack of [...] "eyelashes" [...] around the headlamps, wider <b>rear</b> <b>fenders</b> to accommodate the new 9 in rear wheels and Pirelli Cinturato tires, and different taillights. 150 SVs were produced.|$|R
