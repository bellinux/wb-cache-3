40|$|The {{description}} of the very complex damage and failure behaviour of fibre and textile reinforced composites in damage models is objective of various research efforts. Such models strongly depend {{on the nature of}} the <b>reinforcement</b> (<b>fabric,</b> uniaxial or multiaxial layup) and additionally on micro-cracking geometry. With respect to the practical applicability the number of input parameters of damage models should be in a reasonable way as low as possible. However, damage formulations have to be complex enough to cover the physic of the material and the anisotropic characteristic of damage in composites. Within this theoretical and experimental investigation BASTE’S phenomenological model where damage is defined as the change of the elasticity tensor, will be proposed as a suitable description approach. In combination with this model, the determination of the anisotropic stiffnesses by ultrasonic phase velocity measurements will be shown to be the predestined experimental method. A specific ultrasonic device was developed to provide a system for an efficient recovery of the stiffness tensor coefficients from convenient sets of velocity measurements. Linked to a tensile machine, it is possible to measure the anisotropic damage of fibre and textile reinforced composites. The approach has a smeared and general characteristic and is consequently independent and unlimited in terms of the composite reinforcement nature, crack geometry and failure mechanisms...|$|E

The new {{building}} wall material solid composite sandwich panel consists of panel and inserted layer material-steel wire nets of composite light bar, {{and it is}} called ALC (Autoclaved Lightweight Concrete) wallboard.

Although, for each procedure, the results appear consistent, different procedures result in a scatter of up to one order of magnitude in principal permeability values for each fabric at any given fibre volume fraction. The ratio of the principal permeability values varies by factors of up to 2. While experimental uncertainties and variability of the specimens affect the scatter in results for any single series of experiments, it is suspected that {{the main source of}} scatter in results from different procedures is related to human factors.

40|$|Sandwich structures, {{especially}} those with honeycomb and grid structures as the core material, are very commonly employed in aircraft structures. There is an increasing use of closed-pore rigid syntactic foams as core materials in sandwich constructions because they possess a number of favourable properties. The syntactic foams, owing to their structure and formation, behave differently under compression compared to other traditionally used core materials. In the present study, therefore, syntactic foam core sandwich constructions are evaluated for their behaviour under compression in both edgewise and flatwise orientations. Further, the work characterises the relative performance of two sets of sandwich materials, one containing glass-epoxy and the other, glass/carbon hybrid-epoxy skins. As non-standard geometry test specimens were involved, only a comparative evaluation was contemplated in this approach. The experiments indicate {{that the nature of}} the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>fabric</b> in the skin has a bearing on the test results in edgewise orientation. Thus, the tendency towards initiation of vertical crack in the central plane of the core material, which is a typical fracture event in this kind of material, was found to occur after a delay for the specimens containing the glass fabric in the skin.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the results from fatigue studies of wind turbine blade composite materials carried out at Montana State University (MSU) over the last seven years. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the DOE/MSU composite Materials Fatigue Database. The fatigue testing of composite materials requires the adaptation of standard test methods to the particular composite structure of concern. The stranded fabric E-glass reinforcement used by many blade manufacturers has required the development of several test modifications to obtain valid test data for materials with particular reinforcement details, over the required range of tensile and compressive loadings. Additionally, a novel testing approach to high frequency (100 Hz) testing for high cycle fatigue using minicoupons has been developed and validated. The database for standard coupon tests now includes over 4, 100 data points for over 110 materials systems. The report analyzes the database for trends and transitions in static and fatigue behavior with various materials parameters. Parameters explored are <b>reinforcement</b> <b>fabric</b> architecture, fiber content, content of fibers oriented in the load direction, matrix material, and loading parameters (tension, compression, and reversed loading). Significant transitions from good fatigue resistance to poor fatigue resistance are evident in the range of materials currently used in many blades. A preliminary evaluation of knockdowns for selected structural details is also presented. The high frequency database provides a significant set of data for various loading conditions in the longitudinal and transverse directions of unidirectional composites out to 10 {sup 8 } cycles.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} aimed at carrying out analysis of Energy Bags, reinforced fabric bags used for subsea {{compressed air energy storage}}. Subsea compressed air energy storage {{is a completely}} new method of large-scale energy storage designed to be integrated with direct-compression offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters. Energy Bags are impermeable bags anchored to the seabed at significant depths (e. g. 500 m) in which high pressure air, compressed by specially designed wind turbines and wave energy converters, is stored at pressures roughly equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding water. Energy Bags {{do not need to be}} particularly strong because most of the reaction to the pressure load is provided by the surrounding water, and high energy densities are available at such depths as 500 m. This thesis investigates the deformed shapes of Energy Bags and studies optimal designs. Three analysis methods are developed which vary in their complexity, ease of use, and accuracy. First, a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is derived which describes the deformed shape of an axisymmetric Energy Bag. This model is later used in an optimisation study to find the shapes of bag which minimise the cost of materials (<b>reinforcement,</b> <b>fabric,</b> and ballast) per unit of energy stored. Circumferential reinforcement, hanging masses from the inside of the bag (which it was hoped would lower the total cost) and fill level are all included as variables in the optimisation, and it is found that for reasonable materials costs an Energy Bag could cost less than £ 10, 000 /MWh when anchored at 500 m. This compares favourably with all other methods of large-scale energy storage. However, the bags used in the optimisation study have wide bases, which will require sealing against the seabed (unless water is to be allowed into the bags). Problems are encountered when trying to use the ODE method to find the shapes of partially inflated bags, and it is generally not very easy to use. Next, we carry out finite element analysis (FEA) of an axisymmetric Energy Bag using cable elements. This is much more user-friendly and flexible than the ODE method. Partially inflated bag shapes are found, and pressure-volume curves are presented which show the almost isobaric performance of an Energy Bag. It is found that material mass limits the extent to which the bag can be deflated before it becomes unstable. The axisymmetric FEA is used to study bags with much more realistic circumferential reinforcement than the ODE method, and we also look at bags with an unsealed base, which allow water in through the base as they deflate. A three-dimensional FEA tool is presented which models an Energy Bag as a cable-reinforced membrane using cable and membrane elements, and special measures had to be taken to deal with wrinkling. We assume that the bag is rotationally symmetric, comprising a number of symmetric lobes. The 3 D FEA is used to find the stress distribution in the membrane of the bag, however a converged solution cannot always be found. It is not certain why this is the case but it is anticipated that it is because deformed bags are not always rotationally symmetric. The 3 D FEA could also be used to model other membrane structures such as balloons, parachutes, roofs and sails, as well as nets. The standard cutting patterns for lobes in lobed balloons are analysed, and a new cutting pattern known as the Constant Tension lobe is generated. This is an extension of the Constant Radius lobe and takes into account the pressure gradient found in both air and water, minimising waste material. The Constant Tension lobe is particularly appropriate for Energy Bags because of the large pressure gradient in water. The Ultra High Performance Vessel architecture is also presented, upon which the design of the prototype Energy Bags is based. The fabric structure of an Ultra High Performance Vessel comprises only two sheets of fabric (rather than many separate lobes welded together), and tendon shortening and “bellows” serve to ensure that there is no meridional stress in the fabric. An analytical optimisation is used to show that the zero pressure bag that minimises cost of materials per unit of energy stored has equal costs of reinforcement and membrane. The axisymmetric FEA is also used to find the optimum bag size and maximum fill level for a bag which comes down to a single point at the base (as opposed to a wide base bag). Finally, testing of two 1. 8 m diameter superpressure Energy Bags has been commenced during the course of this work, and the prototypes and test rig are documented in this thesis. The prototypes were manufactured for us by Thin Red Line Aerospace Ltd., a Canadian manufacturer of deployable fabric structures for use in space. They are being cycled back-to-back in order to prove the concept, assess the performance of an Energy Bag over time, and identify any problems that need to be addressed. One of the bags had a few small leaks from the moment it was first inflated, but the other has remained airtight to date. It was found that if an Energy Bag is to be airtight, special attention must be paid to the welds at the seams and the sealing around the airline fittings.

Then, the textile reinforcements are typically cut into smaller pieces, stacked, draped and assembled into a dry assembly called a preform, the shape of which generally approaches that of the PMC part to be made.
