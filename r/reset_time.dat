Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to <b>reset</b> <b>time.</b> Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

He clashes with Robotnik and Metal Sonic {{throughout}} his journey, and saves Amy from the latter's clutches before ultimately defeating Robotnik. Two alternate endings exist, dependent on whether or not the player obtained a good future in each zone. In the game's good ending, Little Planet is returned to its rightful state and leaves Never Lake. In the game's bad ending, Robotnik uses the Time Stones to <b>reset</b> <b>time</b> and transform Little Planet back to its decaying, mechanized state under his rule, and Sonic returns to save it.|$|E
40|$|Reset {{control systems}} are a special type of {{state-dependent}} impulsive dynamic systems, {{in which the}} time evolution depends both on continuous dynamics between resets and the discrete dynamics corresponding to the <b>resetting</b> <b>times.</b> This work is devoted to investigate well-posedness of reset control systems, taking as starting point the classical definition of Clegg and Horowitz. Well-posedness {{is related to the}} existence and uniqueness of solutions, and in particular to the <b>resetting</b> <b>times</b> to be well defined and distinct. A sufficient condition is developed for a reset system to have well-posed <b>resetting</b> <b>times,</b> which is also a sufficient condition for avoiding Zeno solutions and, thus, for a reset control system to be well-posed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{continuous}} time {{neural network}} built with non-linear amplifiers which selects the largest item {{of a list}} is considered. The network receives and processes lists admitted one by one. If the processing and <b>resetting</b> <b>times</b> are imposed, our paper gives a method to find the circuit parameters assuring a correct operation. We {{take into account the}} capacitive coupling between input terminals and present complete existence and convergence results on the differential model. The main achieve-ment consists of simple bounds for the processing and <b>resetting</b> <b>times.</b> They are inferred by an original method of decoupling the system model into solvable linear differential inequalities. Also, a new procedure to impose the stationary state is given. All these results are valid under various parameter restrictions. They lead to a neat design procedure which starts from imposed processing and <b>resetting</b> <b>time</b> and list density to determine the threshold, the interconnection conductance, the amplifier gain, the bias current. Numerical examples check and interpret the results.

500|$|Stuart Craig {{returned}} as set designer, having designed {{the first four}} films' sets. There {{were a number of}} notable new sets in this film. The atrium in the Ministry of Magic is over 200 feet in length, making it the largest and most expensive set built for the Potter film series to date. Craig's design was inspired by early London Underground stations, where, he said, architects [...] "tried to imitate classical architecture but they used ceramic tile", as well as a Burger King on Tottenham Court Road in London, where [...] "there's a fantastic Victorian façade which just embodies the age". The set of Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place contains the Black family tapestry spread across three walls; when the producers told Rowling they wanted to visualise the details of each name and birth year, she faxed them a complete copy of the entire tree. The set of the Hall of Prophecies was entirely digitally built. During a fight scene which occurs there, prophecies crash to the ground and break; had it been an actual physical set, the <b>reset</b> <b>time</b> would have been weeks.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how to achieve responsiveness in cellular manufacturing systems, with special emphasis given to the rapid resetting between product runs. Findings from action research in cellular manufacturing systems are presented, along with a comprehensive methodology for resetting improvements based on performance evaluation. Summing up, it is argued that long <b>resetting</b> <b>times</b> mainly originate from drawbacks in the manufacturing organisation and not from the manufacturing technology in use. Manufacturing technology for fast and adjustment-free resetting is available today. Short and stable <b>resetting</b> <b>times,</b> however, are strongly dependent on the manufacturing organisation´s ability of continuously maintaining a high level of method utilization, competence development, and system utilisation. Short <b>resetting</b> <b>times</b> are only sustained, if all related work tasks are performed consistently with timeliness and quality. To reach these objectives, an improvement methodology - the RPE framework - is outlined in this thesis. This improvement methodology is derived from considerations of a scientific base for resetting processes. The scientific base and its implications are discussed in the thesis. The framework for resetting performance evaluation - RPE framework - proposed here offers a comprehensive improvement methodology for resetting processes. A detailed procedure on how to evaluate resetting performance on method-, organization-, and profitability levels is provided. The results from performance evaluation hence will guide the improvement work irrespective of the improvement methodology chosen. Further, the use of modern computer tools supporting resetting evaluation and improvement is suggested. Resetting improvement is a constant interplay between work methods, workforce performance, and system utilisation. The scientific evaluation of resetting performance, as proposed in this thesis, builds the base for successful and sustainable improvement of <b>resetting</b> <b>time</b> and responsiveness in cellular manufacturing systems...|$|R
