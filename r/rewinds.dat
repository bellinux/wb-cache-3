5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty <b>rewinds</b> to incorporate everything.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>rewinds</b> to 1910 Sargodha {{during the}} times of the British Raj. Javed, a Punjabi Muslim womaniser with a talent for reciting poetry, meets Aradhana, {{a young woman in}} the village, while being chased by the police. They become acquainted, but Javed's flirty nature upsets Aradhana. Javed insists she is special and focuses all his {{attention}} on her. He joins Aradhana's father in a protest for freedom from the British, but when officers begin to physically abuse the protestors, Javed hides while Aradhana's father is beaten. Aradhana is disgusted with him. To appease her, Javed allows himself to be beaten and arrested in front of her. She visits him in jail and tells him their love cannot happen, but he asks her to wait. Three months later, Javed is freed, but he learns that Aradhana was married a month before. Aradhana tells Javed in tears that she only got married to make her father happy. Soon after, Javed also must marry for his father's happiness. Aradhana comes to the wedding to see him one last time. During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana.|$|E

40|$|Helicases {{that both}} unwind and <b>rewind</b> DNA have central roles in DNA repair and genetic recombination. In {{contrast}} to unwinding, DNA <b>rewinding</b> by helicases has proved difficult to characterize biochemically {{because of its}} thermodynamically downhill nature.

We find that both enzymes are robust <b>rewinding</b> enzymes, which can work against opposing forces as large as 35 pN, revealing their active character. The generation of work during the <b>rewinding</b> reaction allows them to couple <b>rewinding</b> to DNA unwinding and/or protein displacement reactions central {{to the rescue of}} stalled DNA replication forks.

5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, the Prince hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When the Prince wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save the Prince, Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As the Prince mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. The Prince refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time <b>rewinds</b> to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and the Prince, still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that the Prince has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. The Prince kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, the Prince mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E

The game also feature a Rewind option to allows the player to restart an event to their last checkpoint if they wreck their vehicle or rewind their vehicle from a collision or missed opportunity. <b>Rewinds</b> are only available in limited quantities as their amount dependent on the difficulty level that the player has selected; Easy have 10 <b>Rewinds,</b> Normal have 5 <b>Rewinds,</b> Hard have 3 <b>Rewinds</b> and Extreme have 1 Rewind {{as well as the}} most difficult AI opponents.|$|E
25|$|The player {{character}} can only jump {{and move to}} the left or right, however several different gameplay mechanics are applied to the game depending on the level. For example, one level can be rotated 90 degrees in the direction the player is facing to alter the level's gravity and vertical orientation. A second mechanic involves the use of a rope to swing through a level. Players can wrap the rope around cogs to rotate them. Yet another gameplay mechanic used involves a timer in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. When the timer reaches zero time effectively <b>rewinds</b> backwards the amount of time originally on the clock. The player character is unaffected, however a second, ghost image of the character will follow the movements the player made until the clock expired. This process repeats until the player completes the level. Should the player touch another iteration of the player character they fail the level. Several other mechanics are used throughout the levels, such as objects that change Shuggy's size, and teleportation.|$|E

500|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{begins with}} Lara Croft's mansion {{exploding}} and being engulfed in flames. The game then <b>rewinds</b> {{back in time}} to a week before the explosion, just after the events of Tomb Raider: Legend. Lara is searching for Avalon, hoping it will lead her to an explanation for the disappearance of her long lost mother. Underneath the Mediterranean Sea, Lara discovers an ancient temple designating itself as [...] "Niflheim", one of the many Norse underworlds. Lara recovers one of Thor's gauntlets after a lengthy battle with Amanda Evert's mercenaries, and an encounter with an imprisoned Jacqueline Natla on Amanda's ship. Natla tells Lara that the Norse underworld, Helheim and Avalon {{are one and the same}} and that she will need to find Thor's Hammer to open the Underworld and find her mother. Lara soon discovers that she will have to find Thor's other gauntlet and his belt if she wants to find and wield the hammer. Natla provides Lara with a starting point for her search in this quest – coastal Thailand. In Thailand, Lara doesn't locate the next gauntlet, but she finds evidence that her father had retrieved it before he died. She also discovers a message that reveals her father and Natla had a working relationship which eventually soured. Lara is able to deduce where her father hid the missing gauntlet.|$|E
500|$|Although {{it holds}} {{significant}} differences from Remember Me, the game addresses similar themes {{of memory and}} identity. Life Is Strange was specified as an analogue look at human identity in contrast to Remember Me, the digital view of the same theme. Running on an improved version of Unreal Engine 3, it makes use of the tools and special effects like lighting and depth of field engineered for Remember Me as well as subsequent advances. Visual effects like post-processes, double exposure and overlapping screen space particles were used as an artistic approach to be displayed while the lead character <b>rewinds</b> time. The textures seen in the game were entirely hand painted, adapted to achieve what art director Michel Koch called [...] "impressionistic rendering". Elements were adjusted based on player feedback, with influences like The Walking Dead, Gone Home and Heavy Rain in mind. The Catcher in the Rye was an additional source of inspiration, whose protagonist Holden Caulfield shares a surname with Max, the game's lead. The characters were created using known archetypes, at first to establish an entry point for the player, and then to subvert them. For the sake of serving the realism, the supernatural elements were designed {{as a metaphor for}} the characters' inner conflict, and experts were consulted to tackle the subject of teen suicide. Twin Peaks also influenced the setting and characters, and is referenced within the game.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the VHS format, VHS tape rewinders were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of <b>rewinding</b> VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the <b>rewind</b> function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism. The rewinder would <b>rewind</b> the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard <b>rewind</b> function on VHS players. However some rewinder brands did have some frequent abrupt stops, which occasionally led to tape damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} machines recorded only {{in black}} and white and had no <b>rewind</b> mechanism, like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier; an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape. External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats, although the machines could <b>rewind</b> tapes; external rewinders were considerably faster than the <b>rewind</b> function.|$|R

500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment {{at the back of}} the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when the VCR malfunctions and the tape <b>rewinds</b> itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{alternate}} {{history has}} often shown how nuclear war could have arisen for certain crises. In the 1998 German-American mockumentary Der dritte Weltkrieg, Mikhail Gorbachev is ousted during his October 1989 visit to East Germany, after which the new hard-line government violently suppresses or preempts the Revolutions of 1989, and starts a seemingly contained conventional war which leads to an accidental nuclear exchange; the film then <b>rewinds</b> to show Gorbachev in East Berlin and ends with jubilant scenes from the [...] "different path" [...] of recorded history. [...] In 2013's What If...Armageddon 1962, John F. Kennedy is assassinated before becoming President (killed by an actual would-be assassin who lost his nerve after realizing his attack would also kill Kennedy's wife and children), and under Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership, the Cuban Missile Crisis leads to an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|The playing modes are {{wrapped in}} an [...] "overshell", which allow players to sign {{in or out}} of game console profiles, manage players in the band, and jump {{in or out of}} the game with any {{available}} instrument at any point, including while playing a song. Players also will have the ability to pause the game and make changes in difficulty; when leaving the pause menu, the song <b>rewinds</b> a few seconds to allow all players to synchronize before the scoring restarts. Due to the limitations in the number of local players on this generation of consoles, only four of the five parts (lead and bass guitar, drums, harmonized vocals, and keyboards) can be played in online and local career and competitive modes. The game attempts to provide the option of a local [...] "All Instruments" [...] quick play mode where all five parts are used allowing the full seven-member band to play; to side step system limitations the vocals are not assigned to a console player but instead are based on the input, if present, from Wireless USB-connected microphones, and the vocal results are not scored along with the other playing members.|$|E
