5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

25|$|Rising Storm {{was mostly}} well {{received}} by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting {{how the story}} echoes the journey to maturity. Another review, by VOYA, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying it was getting hard to <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> of the characters' relatives and leaders.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{expectations}} were high that Waterford would retain their Munster title and {{challenge for the}} All-Ireland once again. After a disappointing National League campaign and a nine-point loss to Clare {{in the first round}} of the championship a players meeting was held where it was indicated that some of the team no longer wanted McCarthy in charge. From that another meeting with the County Board was held where McCarthy resigned as manager. McCarthy had a successful reign over Waterford and most will <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> the great games that he was involved in but will also remember the fact that Waterford never reached an All-Ireland final under him.|$|E

This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, knowing what the manifestation is, and not wanting to give in to the darkness.|$|E

500|$|Lang's {{appointment}} as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral {{required him to}} spend three months annually as the canon in residence, with administrative and preaching duties. [...] Following his {{appointment as}} canon, he was also appointed Treasurer of the Cathedral. His preaching on Sunday afternoons {{caught the attention of}} William Temple, Lang's future successor at both York and Canterbury, who was then an undergraduate at Oxford. Temple observed that, in contrast to the Bishop of London's sermons, listening to Lang brought on an intellectual rather than emotional pleasure: [...] "I can <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> his points, just because their connexion is inevitable.... And for me, {{there is no doubt that}} this is the more edifying by far." [...] Lang was a member of the cathedral's governing body, the Dean and Chapter, and was responsible for the organisation of special occasions, such as the service of thanksgiving for King Edward VII's recovery from appendicitis in July 1902.|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 account on {{the early}} world of finance, Fifty Years in Wall Street, Henry Clews (who knew Little personally) penned that Little was [...] "generous and liberal to a fault with his brother speculators who had {{experienced}} misfortune...remarkable for his great memory, he could easily <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> the operations he made {{in the course of}} a day without making a note or a mistake," [...] and another stock market historian, Leonard Louis Levinson, said that he was [...] "a nervous perfectionist who personally attended to every detail...kind, magnanimous, honorable, and a genius in market maneuvers." [...] Having fallen into bankruptcy many times before, Little was a particularly sensitive debtor, and would often waive the debts held to him by others who fell on hard times; thus it came to be that, by the time of his death, Little was owed millions of dollars by others, of which only 150,000 was successfully collected by his friends and family, a modest sum given the size of his former wealth.|$|E
500|$|On Christmas Day, the Los Angeles Times ran a {{critical}} article entitled [...] "Suppression of the Facts Grants Stone a Broad Brush." [...] New York Newsday followed suit {{the next day}} with two articles – [...] "The Blurred Vision of JFK" [...] and [...] "The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant." [...] A few days later, the Chicago Sun-Times followed suit with [...] "Stone's Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K." [...] Jack Valenti, then {{president and chief executive of}} the Motion Picture Association of America, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement. He wrote, [...] "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God. Both JFK and Triumph of the Will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. Mr. Stone and Leni Riefenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction." [...] Stone recalls in an interview, [...] "I can't even <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> the threats, there were so many of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Wiesenthal {{worked for}} the American Office of Strategic Services for a year, and {{continued}} to collect information on both victims and perpetrators of the Holocaust. He assisted the Berihah, an underground organisation that smuggled Jewish survivors into the British Mandate for Palestine. Wiesenthal helped arrange for forged papers, food supplies, transportation, and so on. In February 1947, he and 30 other volunteers founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz to gather information for future war crimes trials. They collected 3,289 depositions from concentration camp survivors still living in Europe. However, as the US and the Soviet Union lost interest in conducting further trials, a similar group headed by Tuviah Friedman in Vienna closed its office in 1952, and Wiesenthal's closed in 1954. Almost all of the documentation collected at both centres was forwarded to the Yad Vashem archives in Israel. Wiesenthal, employed full-time by two Jewish welfare agencies, continued his work with refugees. As {{it became clear that}} the former Allies were no longer interested in pursuing the work of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Wiesenthal persisted, believing the survivors were obligated to take on the task. His work became a way to memorialise and <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> the people that had been lost. He told biographer Alan Levy in 1974: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Draft Morning" [...] is a {{song about}} {{the horrors of the}} Vietnam War as well as a protest against the {{conscription}} of men into the military during the conflict. The song was initially written by David Crosby but he was fired from the Byrds shortly after he had introduced it {{to the rest of the}} band. However, work had already begun on the song's instrumental backing track by the time of Crosby's departure. Controversially, McGuinn and Hillman decided to continue working on the song, despite its author no longer being a member of the band. Having only heard the song's lyrics in their original incarnation a few times, McGuinn and Hillman couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> of the words when they came to record the vocals and so decided to rewrite the song with their own lyrical additions, giving themselves a co-writing credit in the process. This angered Crosby considerably, since he felt, with some justification, that McGuinn and Hillman had stolen his song. Despite its troubled evolution, [...] "Draft Morning" [...] is often considered one of David Crosby's best songs from his tenure with the Byrds. Lyrically, it follows a newly recruited soldier from the morning of his induction into the military through to his experiences of combat and as such, illustrates the predicament faced by many young American men during the 1960s. The song also makes extensive use of battlefield sound effects, provided for the band by the Los Angeles comedy troupe The Firesign Theatre.|$|E
500|$|After The Grand Duke, the {{partners}} {{saw no reason}} to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer. They did not speak to each other. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been [...] "completely bridged over," [...] and [...] "the most cordial relations existed between us." [...] He stated that [...] "Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name." ...|$|E

50|$|The method {{described}} above is a brute-force search algorithm. With large patch and/or image sizes, this technique {{can be very}} time consuming as pixels are constantly being re-examined to find the lowest correlation score.

An even more efficient algorithm involves remembering column sums from the previous row (in addition to <b>remembering</b> <b>all</b> values from the previous pixel). Techniques that save previous information can greatly increase the algorithmic efficiency of this image analyzing process.|$|R
