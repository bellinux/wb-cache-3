5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> {{farmers of}} pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E

5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful.

5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|In Barker v.

Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E

5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E

The film was shelved at the {{outbreak}} of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.|$|E

5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The <b>remedy</b> <b>for</b> the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
