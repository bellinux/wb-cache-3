50|$|It was {{recognised}} {{that most}} mission profiles {{did not require}} the rocket and could not afford its fuel consumption. The original goal of intercepting high-flying bombers also seemed to be receding in favour of missiles, for both offence and defence. The Mirage's rocket was thus mounted as a <b>removable</b> <b>pod</b> which could be replaced with a 90 imp gal jet fuel tank for additional range. Only the high altitude interception would still use it.|$|E

50|$|The 180V {{nickel-cadmium}} pack {{consisted of}} 30 SAFT STM5-180 6V 180Ah batteries in six <b>removable</b> <b>pods</b> under {{the floor of}} the car, delivering over 50 mi of range, and used an automatic watering system for easy battery maintenance. The nickel-iron pack consisted of 30 Eagle-Pitcher 6V 200Ah batteries in six pods under the floor and delivered over 60 mi of range. The TEVan owner's manual stated 80 mi of range.|$|R
5000|$|Two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) {{thrusters}} were {{mounted in}} two separate <b>removable</b> <b>pods</b> on the orbiter's aft fuselage, located between the SSMEs and the vertical stabilizer. The OMS engines provided significant thrust for coarse orbital maneuvers, including insertion, circularization, transfer, rendezvous, deorbit, abort to orbit, and to abort once around. [...] At lift-off, two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) were used to take the vehicle to an altitude of roughly 140,000 feet.|$|R

50|$|The Fairchild XC-120 Packplane was an American {{experimental}} {{transport aircraft}} first flown in 1950. It was {{developed from the}} company's C-119 Flying Boxcar, and was unique in the unconventional use of <b>removable</b> cargo <b>pods</b> that were attached below the fuselage, instead of possessing an internal cargo compartment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955, 100 B-47E-Is were {{modified}} to carry two <b>removable</b> external <b>pods,</b> one mounted {{on either side}} of the bomb bay, with each pod containing four AN/ALT-6B jammers. The pods were known as [...] "Tee Town pods" [...] (for Topeka, Kansas, location of Forbes AFB) and so these aircraft were known as [...] "Tee Town B-47s". They retained their normal bombing capability.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand's most eastern home islands, the Chatham Islands {{were linked}} with the main islands of New Zealand with a {{combined}} air freight and passenger service using a unique <b>removable</b> passenger <b>pod</b> that was placed into the hold of their Bristol Freighter aircraft. Extra sound insulation was used to drown out the Bristol's Hercules engines and earplugs were provided. Windows in the pod lined up {{with those in the}} fuselage. The flight time was approximately three hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for air freight transportation has prompted studies of large, aerodynamically efficient cargo-optimized aircraft {{capable of carrying}} intermodal containers, which are typically 8 x 8 x 20 ft. Studies have accordingly been conducted within NASA to ascertain the specifications and projected operating costs of such a vehicle, {{as well as to}} identify critical, development-pacing technologies. Attention is here given not only to the rather conventional, 10 -turbofan engined configuration thus arrived at, but numerous innovative configurations featuring such concepts as spanloading, <b>removable</b> cargo <b>pods,</b> and ground effect...|$|R
25|$|A {{full-face}} mask encloses both {{mouth and}} nose, which {{reduces the risk}} of the diver losing the air supply compared to a half mask and demand valve. Some models require a bailout block to provide alternative breathing gas supply from the umbilical and bailout cylinder, but are not suitable for accepting an alternative air supply from a rescue diver, while a few models accept a secondary demand valve which can be plugged into an accessory port (Draeger, Apeks and Ocean Reef). The unique Kirby Morgan 48 SuperMask has a <b>removable</b> DV <b>pod</b> which can be unclipped to allow the diver to breathe from a standard scuba demand valve with mouthpiece.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1943, the North American Aircraft {{design team}} {{began work on}} a fighter design that could travel over [...] without refueling. It {{consisted}} of a twin-fuselage design, somewhat similar to the experimental German Messerschmitt Bf 109Z [...] "Zwilling". Although based on the lightweight experimental XP-51F, which would later become the P-51H Mustang, {{it was actually a}} new design. North American Design Chief Edgar Schmued incorporated two P-51H Mustang fuselages lengthened by the addition of a [...] fuselage plug located behind the cockpit where additional fuel tanks and equipment could be installed. These were mounted to a newly designed center wing section containing the same six [...]50 caliber M3 Browning machine guns as a single-engine Mustang, but with more concentrated fire. The first XP-82 prototype (s/n 44-83886) was equipped with a <b>removable</b> centerline gun <b>pod</b> housing eight additional [...]50 caliber M3 Brownings, but this did not feature on production aircraft. An even more powerful centerline gun pod containing a 40mm cannon was considered, but was never built. The outer wings were reinforced to allow the addition of hard points for carrying additional fuel or [...] of ordnance. The two vertical tails were also from the XP-51F, but incorporated large dorsal fillets for added stability in case of an engine failure. The aircraft had a conventional landing gear with both wheels retracting into bays under each fuselage center section.|$|R
