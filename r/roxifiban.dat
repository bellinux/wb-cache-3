40|$|A {{number of}} non-peptide orally active RGD mimetic prodrug such as Orbofiban, Sibrafiban, SR 121566, <b>Roxifiban</b> and others {{entered into the}} {{clinical}} evaluation stage. Some of these agents were terminated and some are still in clinical trials. The present study examined the platelet GPIIb/IIIa binding profiles for the active form of <b>Roxifiban,</b> Sibrafiban, SR 121566 and Orbofiban using 3 H-Roxifiban active form (XV 459), 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen. Either DMP 728, Orbofiban, Sibrafiban, SR 121566 or <b>Roxifiban</b> active form {{as well as other}} RGD mimetic bind to the same binding site (s) on human platelets as evident from the competitive inhibition of binding of each other to human platelet. Additionally, <b>Roxifiban</b> active form competed with FITC labeled GPIIb/IIIa antagonist cyclic RGD peptidomimetic (XL 086) as demonstrated using confocal microscopy technique. <b>Roxifiban</b> active form (XV 459) demonstrated the highest potency in inhibiting 3 H-XV 459, 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen binding to human platelets as compared to the others. Structure activity relationship within the isoxazoline <b>Roxifiban</b> series showed that substituent at the Î±-carbon next to the carboxy terminal represents an exosite for the affinity binding to human platelets leading to slow platelet dissociation rate. These data indicated a distinct binding profile for <b>Roxifiban</b> (high affinity to both activated and resting platelets associated with a relatively slow Koff) as compared to others. These differences might determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmackokinetics of the different GPIIb/IIIa antagonists...|$|E

We have also described an attempt to resolve the key synthetic intermediate by diastereomeric ester formation.

40|$|Platelet {{accretion}} into arterial thrombus in stenotic arterial ves-sels involves shear-induced {{platelet activation}} and adhesion. The Cone and Plate(let) Analyzer (CPA) {{is designed to}} simulate such conditions in vitro under a rotating high shear rate in whole blood. In the present study, we evaluated various experimental conditions (including aspirin, temperature, and calcium con-centration) and investigated the effects of small molecules along with peptide glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on platelet adhesion using the CPA system. Concentration-dependent ef-fect of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists on shear-induced plate-let adhesion showed marked differences in potencies: IC 50 34, 35, 91, 438, and 606 nM for DPC 802 (a specific glycopro-tein IIb/IIIa antagonist), <b>roxifiban,</b> sibrafiban, lotrafiban, and or-bofiban (free acid forms), respectively, and IC 50 values of 43...|$|E
