5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates,</b> as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E

500|$|In Queensland, Australia {{there are}} many areas for high {{protection}} of the bluespotted stingray, three being the Shoalwater, Corio Bay's Area Ramsar Site, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. A major threat to the bluespotted stingray is the destruction of coral reefs mainly in the north Western Pacific. The rays dwell in these reefs and the destruction and pollution from fertilizers and pesticides hurt them. The ray is commonly caught in the Java Sea by fishermen trawling and by Danish seine boats in large quantities. The bluespotted stingray {{is the second most}} significant species out of the sharks, <b>rays,</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate</b> family to be fished, contributing to about [...] per boat in 2006-2007.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|E

5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other <b>ray</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate</b> species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of <b>rays</b> are vestigial, <b>and</b> mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|R

40|$|Elasmobranch (shark, <b>ray,</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate)</b> populations {{around the}} world are in decline, and {{effective}} conservation measures are urgently needed. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) placed in locations important for key life-history stages may form part of an effective conservation strategy. In this context, we examined the seasonal abundance and population structure of the short-tailed stingray (Dasyatis brevicaudata) at an offshore MPA in northeastern New Zealand, and the reported use of this location as a mating ground. Diver surveys were conducted from 2004 to 2007 at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve (PKIMR). During this time, we observed: (i) a substantial increase in adult and subadult numbers, particularly females during the suggested breeding season, and a corresponding increase in females bearing fresh mating scars; and (ii) large numbers of smaller (probably immature) D. brevicaudata individuals of both sexes from spring to autumn. These results suggest that the PKIMR acts as both a mating aggregation location and a nursery for this species. We suggest that for coastal stingrays such as D. brevicaudata, small MPAs may be effective at protecting key life-history stages, but that as movements outside of reserve boundaries also occur, additional management tools may also be necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{effectiveness}} of the collaboration between stakeholders and scientists in the construction of a bio-economic model to simulate management strategies for the fisheries in Iberian Atlantic waters. For three years, different stakeholders were involved in a model development study, participating in meetings, surveys and workshops. Participatory modelling involved the definition of objectives and priorities of stakeholders, a qualitative evaluation and validation of the model for use by decision-makers, and an iterative process with the fishing sector to interpret results and introduce new scenarios for numerical simulation. The results showed that the objectives of the participating stakeholders differed. Incorporating objectives into the design of the model and prioritising them was a challenging task. We showed that the parameterization of the model and the analysis of the scenarios results could be improved by the fishers’ input: e. g. <b>ray</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate</b> stocks were explicitly included in the model; and the behaviour of fleet dynamics proved much more complex than assumed in any traditional modelling approach. Overall, this study demonstrated that stakeholder engagement through dialogue and many interactions was beneficial for both, scientists and the fishing industry. The researchers obtained a final refined model and the fishing industry benefited for participating in a process, which enables them to influence decisions that may affect them directly (to shape) whereas non-participatory processes lead to management strategies being imposed on stakeholders (to be shaped) ...|$|R
50|$|Electric {{fish can}} be {{classified}} into two types: pulse fish or wave fish. Gymnarchus niloticus is a wave fish, producing a near-sinusoidal discharge of around 500 Hz. The electric discharge is produced from an electric organ that evolved from muscle, as {{can also be seen}} in Gymnotiform electric fish, electric <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates.</b> The convergent evolution between the South American Gymnotiforms and the African Mormyridae is remarkable, with the electric organ being produced via the substitution of the same amino acid in the same voltage-gated sodium channel despite the two groups of fish being on different continents and the evolution of the electric sense organ being separated in time by around 60 million years.|$|E
50|$|The {{favorite}} prey of {{the great}} hammerhead are <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates,</b> especially stingrays. The venomous spines of stingrays are frequently found lodged inside its mouth and {{do not seem to}} bother the shark as one specimen caught off Florida had 96 spines in and around its mouth. Great hammerheads primarily hunt at dawn or dusk, swinging their heads in broad angles over the sea floor so as to pick up the electrical signatures of stingrays buried in the sand, via numerous ampullae of Lorenzini located {{on the underside of the}} cephalofoil. The cephalofoil also serves as a hydrofoil that allows the shark to quickly turn around and strike at a ray once detected. Off Florida, large hammerheads are often the first to reach newly baited sharklines, suggesting a particularly keen sense of smell.|$|E

40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the survival of rays, which are caught commercially in a target trawl fishery in the Bristol Channel, and subsequently discarded. The study was proposed by the NFFO and categorized by Defra and Cefas as priority for support. All <b>ray</b> <b>and</b> <b>skate</b> species are commonly marketed as skate. The status of several <b>skate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ray</b> stocks in the Northeast Atlantic is of concern, with some species classified as depleted while others are locally extirpated. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) estimate the short-term discard survival rates of thornback rays; (2) estimate the longterm discard survival rates of the most commercially important <b>ray</b> species; <b>and</b> (3) investigate the effect of codend weight on ray discard survival. The short-term survival estimates were made using specially designed holding tanks to retain thornback rays on board during three 4 -day trips on the FV ‘Our Olivia Belle’. These holding tank experiments were supplemented with a tagging programme in which 900 thornback, small-eyed, blonde <b>and</b> spotted <b>rays</b> were caught, tagged and released. Information on tagged rays, when caught again in the future, will be used to estimate the longer-term survival of discarded rays. Consequently, the results from the tagging programme can only be presented once sufficient tags have been returned, and will be included in a future report. The short-term survival experiments showed that for every three thornback rays returned to sea in the Bristol Channel ray fishery, an estimated two survive for at least 3 days. The few tag returns received so far show that discarded rays are surviving for at least 45 days. The study indicated that as total catch weight and tow duration increases, the survival rate for discarded rays decreases; also, that large thornback rays do not have greater rates of survival than small rays. The implications of these results for the management of ray fisheries are discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|The knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), {{also known}} as the pointed sawfish or narrow sawfish, is a species of sawfish in the family Pristidae, part of the Batoidea, a {{superorder}} of cartilaginous fish that includes the <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates.</b> The sawfishes are characterised by the long, narrow, flattened rostrum or extension on their snout.

50|$|Two {{types of}} fish inhabit the {{demersal}} zone, {{those that are}} heavier than water and rest on the seabed, and those that have neutral buoyancy and remain just above the substrate. In many species of fish, neutral buoyancy is maintained by a gas-filled swim bladder which can be expanded or contracted as the circumstances require. A disadvantage of this method is that adjustments {{need to be made}} constantly as the water pressure varies when the fish swims higher and lower in the water column. An alternative buoyancy aid is the use of lipids; these are less dense than water and squalene, commonly found in shark livers, has a specific gravity of just 0.86. In the velvet belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax), a benthopelagic species, 17% of the bodyweight is liver and 70% is lipids. Benthic <b>rays</b> <b>and</b> <b>skates</b> have smaller livers with lower concentrations of lipids; they are therefore denser than water and they do not swim continuously, intermittently resting on the seabed. Some fish have no buoyancy aids but use their pectoral fins which are so angled as to give lift as they swim. The disadvantage of this is that, if they stop swimming, the fish sink, and they cannot hover, or swim backwards.|$|E
