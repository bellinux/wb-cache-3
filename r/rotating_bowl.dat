50|$|A typical conical-cylindrical {{solid bowl}} {{centrifuge}} design contains a <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> unit {{connected to a}} conveyor with a gear system. The gear system allows the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> and the conveyor to rotate at different speeds {{but in the same}} direction. Commonly, the conveyor operates at the speed between 1900 and 2400 rotation per minute, while the bowl unit operates at 100 rotation per minute higher.|$|E
50|$|In {{conveyor}} decanter centrifuges {{the conveyor}} or scroll fits inside a <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> and carries the solids settled against the wall, pushing them across a beach towards the underflow where the solids discharge. The conveyor allows {{for an increase}} in separation efficiency and feed capacity.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{separator}} is {{a closed}} (hermetic) centrifuge; {{it can be}} a chamber or conical plate bowl. This centrifuge can accommodate a system with a maximum pressure of 8 bars.

2500|$|Another {{effect of}} ball {{imbalance}} (either static or dynamic) {{is the ability}} to introduce gyroscopic effects on the rotation. The component of imbalance along the rotation axis provides a leverage that can change the orientation of the axis on its horizontal plane, an action physicists call precession. It is basically the same thing as a spinning toy top [...] "going around in a circle." [...] In the case of a <b>rotating</b> <b>bowling</b> ball, as it moves along the lane, there is only time for its total rotation axis to move along a short arc, but this is enough to reorient the total rotation so that some of the forward-roll becomes side-roll, increasing the side-roll provided in the bowler's delivery, thereby achieving more hook. It is possible to use dynamic ball balancing to achieve a stronger gyroscopic effect than static balancing alone.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} methods of tangential, radial, axial velocities evolving in hydrocyclone and {{the characteristics of the}} velocity distributions defined {{in the course of the}} experiments. The definition of the cut-size diameter based on the so-called equilibrium model requires a review according to the authors. In the sense of the model there are only twoo forces acting on a unique particle settling: the centrifugal force and the one, opposite of the motion, resistance strength, and it does not take into consideration, that liquid flows in hydrocyclon. In the hydrocyclone the medium flowing inwards from the tapered cloak wall has a transport velocity and so an effect on the settling onto a particle may not be apart from attention to let. In the hydrocyclone the phenomenon of an air core taking shape in his axis line was explained by means of the basis equations of the hydrostatics till now. The authors demonstrated that the development of the air core is justifiable also with the necessities of the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowls</b> on an actual example...|$|R

The player must then wait for the moving table above the prize chute to be open, and must press the second button to drop the candy. If the candy on the table gets pushed away by the candy that falls on the table, then the candy will fall into the prize chute.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{technique}} to study starch gelation is {{by using a}} Brabender Viscoamylograph. It is a common technique used by food industries to determine the pasting temperature, swelling capacity, shear/thermal stability {{and the extent of}} retrogradation. Under controlled conditions, starch and distilled water is heated at a constant heating rate in a <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> and then cooled down. The viscosity of the mixture deflects a measuring sensor in the bowl. This deflection is measured as viscosity in torque over time vs. temperature, and recorded on the computer. The viscoamylograph provides the audience with the beginning of gelatinization, gelatinization maximum, gelatinization temperature, viscosity during holding, and viscosity at the end of cooling.|$|E

50|$|The Falcon Concentrator {{is a type}} {{of gravity}} {{separation}} device for the recovery of valuable metals and minerals. There are three types of Falcon Concentrators: Falcon Semi-Batch (SB), Falcon Continuous (C) and Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF). All models of Falcon Concentrator rely on the creation of centrifugal forces by way of a rapidly <b>rotating,</b> vertical <b>bowl</b> in order to stratify and separate particles based on weight. The amount of gravitational force generated and the method of collecting these heavier particles differs for each model.|$|R
50|$|The Ontario conference {{started out}} with the top six placed teams from the regular season. The third placed team hosted the sixth place team and the fourth placed team hosted the team in fifth place. The winners then took on the top two placed teams in the conference semi-finals and the semi-final champions compete for the Yates Cup. According to the <b>rotating</b> CIS <b>Bowl</b> schedule, the Ontario champions, in 2008, host the Atlantic conference champions for the Mitchell Bowl {{national}} semi-final game.|$|R
50|$|The Falcon Semi-Batch (SB) {{centrifugal}} concentrator {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} recovery of free (liberated) precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The machine generates forces up to 200 times {{the force of gravity}} (200 G's) and makes use of a two-stage <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> for mineral separation. The smooth-walled lower portion is for particle stratification and then a fluidized upper portion is used for the collection of the heavier particles. The machine is stopped periodically to rinse and collect the valuable concentrate from the bowl. The Falcon SB concentrator is used for gold recovery at many mines around the word, including Quadra Mining's Robinson mine in the United States, Newcrest Mining's Telfer Gold Mine in Australia and the Sadiola Gold Mine (owned principally by AngloGold Ashanti and IAMGOLD) in Mali.|$|E
50|$|With {{the help}} of helical screw conveyor, solid bowl {{centrifuges}} separate two substances with different densities by the centrifugal force formed under fast rotation. Feed slurry enters the conveyor and is delivered into the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> through discharge ports. There is a slight speed difference between the rotation of conveyor and bowl, causing the solids to convey from the stationary zone where the wastewater is introduced to the bowl wall. By centrifugal force, the collected solids moves along the bowl wall, {{out of the pool}} and up the dewatering beach located at the tapered end of the bowl. At last the solids separated go to solid discharge while the liquids go to liquid discharge. The clarified liquid flows through the conveyor in the opposite direction through adjustable overflow parts.|$|E
50|$|The conical plate {{centrifuge}} is used {{to remove}} solids (usually impurities) from liquids or to separate two liquid phases from each other {{by means of an}} enormously high centrifugal force. The denser solids or liquids which are subjected to these forces move outwards towards the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> wall while the less dense fluids moves towards the centre. The special plates (known as disc stacks) increase the surface settling area which speeds up the separation process. Different stack designs, arrangements and shapes are used for different processes {{depending on the type of}} feed present. The concentrated denser solid or liquid is then removed continuously, manually or intermittently, depending on the design of the conical plate centrifuge. This centrifuge is very suitable for clarifying liquids that have small proportion of suspended solids.|$|E

50|$|A {{much smaller}} model (which does not {{resemble}} the Chef or Major at all), the Kenwood Chefette, {{has also been}} produced. The Chefette is basically a hand-mixer on a stand, and for the A340 version the <b>bowl</b> <b>rotates</b> {{by the action of}} the tools and food rotation. Later versions may have a power driven bowl. Liquidiser and coffee grinder attachments are available for it.|$|R
50|$|Bows are {{exchanged}} {{between the}} host and the guest receiving the tea. The guest then bows {{to the second}} guest, and raises the bowl {{in a gesture of}} respect to the host. The guest <b>rotates</b> the <b>bowl</b> to avoid drinking from its front, takes a sip, and compliments the host on the tea. After taking a few sips, the guest wipes clean the rim of the bowl and passes it to the second guest. The procedure is repeated until all guests have taken tea from the same bowl; each guest then has an opportunity to admire the bowl before it is returned to the host, who then cleanses the equipment and leaves the tea room.|$|R
50|$|The Falcon Continuous (C) {{centrifugal}} concentrator {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as cassiterite, tantalum and scheelite. It is also used for coal cleaning and pre-concentration of gold bearing ores. The machine generates forces up to 300 times {{the force of gravity}} (300 G's) and operates by using a smooth-walled, <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> to stratify the material into heavier and lighter fractions then uses pneumatic valves to control the amount of heavy material that reports to the concentrate collection stream. It does not use any fluidization water and relies entirely on centrifugal force for separation. The Falcon C concentrator is used in various process plants around the world, such as the Tanco mine in Canada, the Sekisovskoye mine in Kazakhstan and the Renison tin mine in Tasmania.|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} machine noise result in health issues {{for those people}} exposed to the machine for {{extended}} periods. Machine noise is becoming a more significant design consideration, often because of legislative requirements. Decanting centrifuges are machines with a <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl.</b> They {{have a number of}} noise sources, the most significant being structural noise, vortex/turbulence noise and siren noise. Due to the size, mass and speed of the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl,</b> the bowl is the main source of structural noise. The structural noise is produced by all surfaces that are directly coupled to the bowl’s bearings. Due to the speed of rotation of the bowl, the turbulence from the various trailing edges generates broad spectrum vortex noise. Siren noise due to air flow through the bowl also generates significant noise especially at the lower harmonics of the bowl rotation frequency. Strategies to reduce decanter machine noise include: •	Decoupling the surfaces of the from the main bearings of the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> and hence reduce the amount of structurally transmitted noise. •	Smoothing the surface of the bowl to minimise the edges that produce vortices that are shed and produce vortex/turbulence noise. •	As siren noise is produced due to flow through the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl,</b> which is integral to the function of the decanter, the exit ports should be designed so that the noise is produced within parts of the sound spectrum that have low noise levels...|$|E

The idea underpinning this novel method is that the rotating liquid surface will form a parabolic reflector which will focus light into a unique focal point. By measuring {{the height of the}} focal point, g could be determined to m s- 2. We discuss the pedagogical merits of this method compared to more traditional methods for measuring g, and how it can be implemented as an experimental problem at different educational levels...|$|E

50|$|Spiral mixers are {{specialist}} {{tools for}} mixing dough. A spiral-shaped agitator remains stationary while the <b>bowl</b> <b>rotates.</b> This method enables spiral mixers {{to mix the}} same size dough batch much quicker and with less under-mixed dough than a similarly powered planetary mixer. Spiral mixers can mix dough with less agitator friction than planetary mixers. This allows the dough to be mixed without increasing its temperature, ensuring the dough can rise properly.|$|R

In the beginning, lighthouse lamp had a steady flame. When ships began to confuse this with city lights, {{it was decided to}} use a flickering light in light houses. The lighthouses at Chennai and Mamallapuram use dischargeable lamps, which <b>rotate</b> inside a <b>bowl</b> of mercury. In recent days, LED lights are preferred.|$|R
40|$|Overend et al [68] {{designed}} a viscometer {{to measure the}} viscosity of slurries that {{have a tendency to}} settle. This viscometer consists of a rotating ribbed rotor surrounded by a stationary slotted sleeve; this system is then placed eccentrically within an inclined <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl.</b> It, is claimed that this overcomes most of the difficulties encountered when attempting to obtain accurate measurements for these types of mixtures. If the mixture being sheared within the annulus does not represent the true composition of the slurry being, tested then the results are expected to be inaccurate. The presence of sediment {{at the bottom of the}} rotor or the formation of large masses of particles within the flow domain will affect the accuracy of the measurements obtained. This dissertation studies the amount of flow through the slotted sleeve and the region, or regions, of low shear rate within the flow domain. Assuming that end-effects are unimportant and that the slurries can be replaced by a single-phase fluid, three two-dimensional models are proposed. These models are designed to capture the large-slot construction of the sleeve and the, approximate, non-Newtonian behaviour of the slurries. The first two models solve analytically (using a regular perturbation scheme) and numerically (using a finite volume method) the moderate-and large-Reynolds-number flow, and the third model uses a finite volume method to study the flow patterns developed by pseudoplastic fluids. The results show that the mixing of the slurry is expected to be enhanced by moving the concentric system (i. e., the rotor and the slotted sleeve) close to the <b>rotating</b> <b>bowl</b> and using low to moderate speeds for the rotor and bowl. In addition, when the cylinders rotate in the same directions, two (counter-rotating) eddies are present within the flow domain; whereas, only one eddy (rotating counter-clockwise) is ++present when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The presence of eddies in the former situation inhibits the flow through the sleeve; while, for moderate rotorspeeds, the flow through the sleeve is enhanced in the latter. When the slurry assumed pseudoplastic, we observe a region of low shear rate located near the dividing streamline present within the flow field. The distribution of shear rate within the flow field is shown to be affected by factors such as the rate of diffusion of the apparent viscosity and the value of the power law index. Therefore, this study suggests that for certain types of slurries, concentrations of particles exist within the domain and that the mixing of slurries can be impeded by the presence of eddies within the main flow field...|$|E

50|$|As {{a member}} of the Bowl Championship Series, the Sugar Bowl hosted the BCS National Championship Game twice (2000 and 2004). However, from the 2006 season to the 2013 season, the BCS National Championship Game had been a {{stand-alone}} event, following one week after the New Year's Day bowl games.

5000|$|In {{horizontal}} decanter centrifuges, {{as shown}} in figure 1, the rotating assembly is mounted horizontally with bearings on each end to a rigid frame, which provides a good sealing surface for high-pressure applications. The feed enters through one end of the bearings, while the gearbox is attached to the other end and is operated below critical speed. Capacities range up to 40000 lb of solids per hour with liquid feed rates of up to 300 gal per minute. The horizontal machine is arranged in a way that slurry can be introduced at the centre of a <b>rotating</b> horizontal cylindrical <b>bowl.</b> The scroll discharge screw forces the solids to one end of the bowl as it is collected on the walls.

50|$|From 1998 to 2013, the {{top teams}} in Division I FBS {{played in the}} BCS. It {{consisted}} {{of four or five}} bowl games, with a national championship game either <b>rotating</b> among the <b>bowl</b> sites (prior to the 2006 season) or played as a separate game. The BCS succeeded two other systems that were put in place after the 1991 season {{in order to ensure that}} one national champion could be crowned at the end of the season. The original Bowl Coalition consisted of the SEC, the Big Eight Conference (later succeeded by the Big 12), the Southwest Conference (SWC), the ACC, the Big East, and Notre Dame. The BCS added the Pac-10 (now known as the Pac-12) and the Big Ten, while the SWC dissolved in 1996.

5000|$|The {{machines}} utilise {{the principles}} of a centrifuge to enhance the gravitational force experienced by feed particles to effect separation based on particle density. The key components of the unit are a cone shaped [...] "concentrate" [...] <b>bowl,</b> <b>rotated</b> at high speed by an electric motor and a pressurized water jacket encompassing the bowl. Feed material, typically from a ball mill discharge or cyclone underflow bleed, is fed as a slurry toward {{the centre of the}} bowl from above. The feed slurry contacts the base plate of the vessel and, due to its rotation, is thrust outward. The outer extremities of the concentrate bowl house a series of ribs and between each pair of ribs is a groove. During operation the lighter material flows upward over the grooves and heavy mineral particles (usually of economic value) become trapped within them. Pressurized water is injected through a series of tangential water inlets along the perimeter of each groove to maintain a fluidized bed of particles in which heavy mineral particles can be efficiently concentrated. The Knelson concentrator typically operates as a batch process, with lighter gangue material being continuously discharged via overflow and a heavy mineral concentrate periodically removed by flushing the bowl with water.|$|R

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 114 - 114. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 242 In the {{pet food}} industry, Salmonella is getting greater scrutiny {{because it is}} considered a “reasonably foreseeable hazard” {{with the implementation of}} the Food Safety Modernization Act. Specifically, there is zero tolerance for any serotype of Salmonella in pet foods. Salmonella contamination was responsible for 78 % of the Class I recalls in pet food {{according to the most recent}} Reportable Food Registry Report (FDA, 2015). One potential method of Salmonella mitigation shown to be effective was through coating the exterior of the kibble with a powdered dry acidulant, such as sodium bisulfate (SBS; Jones-Hamilton, Co.). Sodium bisulfate coating on both dog and cat kibbles was shown to provide complete mitigation of Salmonella within 14 -d storage (Jeffrey et al., 2014). However, it is thought that the use of dry acidulant with a palatant for coating kibble may negatively impact palatability of a dry dog food. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine if the use of a dry acidulant, SBS, would influence the palatability of a dry dog food. A single dry extruded all life stages dog food was collected from a commercial pet food manufacturer before the coating step. The kibble was coated with either 2. 2 % spray dried chicken liver + 0. 2 % SBS or 2. 2 % spray dried chicken liver + 0. 2 % powdered silica (control). A total of 20 beagles were used in a standard 2 -bowl forced choice palatability test method for 2 d. Dogs were fed 400 g of both diets once per day, with <b>bowls</b> <b>rotated</b> daily to address side bias. Results were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (Cary, NC). The inclusion of SBS did not affect daily preference of diet (P = 0. 23). Furthermore, there was no effect of day (P = 0. 18) or the interaction of treatment × day (P = 0. 98). These results demonstrate that palatability is not affected by the inclusion of SBS with a palatant in the coating of dog food kibble. Considering that the inclusion of SBS has been shown to be effective at mitigating Salmonella in pet food and no negative effects on palatability were observed, the use of a dry acidulant in a dog food coating gives the industry a promising method to control Salmonella contamination of finished dog foods...|$|R
