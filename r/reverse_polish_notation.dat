25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E
500|$|The Sinclair used a {{slightly}} different <b>Reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>Notation</b> method; lacking an enter key, the operation keys enter a number into the appropriate register and the calculation is performed. [...] For example, [...] "(1+2) * 3" [...] could be calculated as: C 1 + 2 + 3 × to give the result of 9.0000 00 ( [...] , or 9). [...] The [...] "C" [...] key performs a [...] clear; pressing it sets the calculator to a state with zero in the internal registers. [...] Pressing [...] "C" [...] followed by number keys then [...] "+" [...] effectively adds the number entered to the zero and stores it internally {{to be worked on}} in subsequent calculations. [...] If the [...] "-" [...] key is pressed instead, the number is subtracted from zero, effectively entering a negative number.|$|E
500|$|It {{displays}} only {{in scientific}} notation, with a five digit mantissa and a two digit exponent, although a sixth digit of the mantissa was stored internally. Because {{of the way}} the processor was designed, it uses <b>Reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> (RPN) for inputting calculations. RPN meant that the difficult implementation of brackets, and the associated recursive logic, was not necessary to implement in the hardware, but the effort was instead offloaded to the user. Instead of an [...] "Equals" [...] button, there is an [...] "Enter" [...] button that tells the calculator when a value has been entered, and then the operators are entered in after the operands. For example, on some devices to evaluate [...] "(1+2) x 3", the sequence entered would be [...] "3 enter 2 enter 1 + x." [...] The Sinclair Scientific entry procedure is slightly different as it lacks an enter key and has a limited number of internal registers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961 Dijkstra first {{described}} the shunting-yard algorithm, {{a method for}} parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation, in the Mathematisch Centrum report. It {{can be used to}} produce output in <b>Reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> (RPN) or as an abstract syntax tree (AST). The algorithm was named the [...] "shunting yard" [...] algorithm because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard.

2500|$|The HP 12c {{financial}} calculator {{is still}} produced. It {{was introduced in}} 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the [...] "HP 12c platinum edition" [...] which added more memory, more built-in functions, {{and the addition of}} the algebraic mode of data entry.|$|E
2500|$|The world's first all-electronic desktop {{calculator}} was the British Bell Punch ANITA, {{released in}} 1961. It used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes and Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [...] "Nixie" [...] tubes for its display. The ANITA sold well {{since it was}} the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick. The tube technology was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a [...] CRT, and introduced <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> (RPN).|$|E

50|$|Prefix {{notation}} {{has seen}} wide application in Lisp s-expressions, where the brackets are required since the operators {{in the language}} are themselves data (first-class functions). Lisp functions may also be variadic. The Tcl programming language, much like Lisp also uses <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> through the mathop library. The Ambi programming language uses <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> for arithmetic operations and program construction.|$|R
2500|$|Calculated Industries {{competed with}} the HP 12c in the {{mortgage}} {{and real estate}} markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the “I”, “PV”, “FV” to easier labeling terms such as [...] "Int", [...] "Term", [...] "Pmt", and not using the <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation.</b> However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman, a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the [...] "Construction Master {{is the first in}} a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators" [...] which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard (HP) {{had been}} {{developing}} a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was {{unlike the other}} basic four-function pocket calculators then available {{in that it was}} the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule. The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like [...] "8 plus 5" [...] is, using RPN, performed by pressing [...] "8", [...] "Enter↑", [...] "5", and [...] "+"; instead of the algebraic infix notation: [...] "8", [...] "+", [...] "5", [...] "=". It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.|$|E
2500|$|The tube {{technology}} of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured Friden EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a [...] cathode ray tube (CRT), and introduced <b>Reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>Notation</b> (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times {{the cost of an}} electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: Sharp introduced the CS-10A, which weighed [...] and cost 500,000 yen ($), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).|$|E

5000|$|As of 2011, Hewlett-Packard was {{offering}} the calculator models 12C, 12C Platinum, 17bII+, 20b, 30b, 33s, 35s, 48gII (RPL) and 50g (RPL) which support <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation.</b> While calculators emulating classical models {{continue to support}} classical <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation,</b> new <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> models feature a variant of <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation,</b> where the [...] key behaves as in RPL. This latter variant is sometimes known as entry RPN. In 2013, the HP Prime introduced a 128-level form of entry RPN called advanced RPN.

50|$|Later LCD-based calculators in {{the early}} 1980s such as the HP-10C, HP-11C, HP-15C, HP-16C, and the {{financial}} calculator, the HP-12C also used <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation.</b> In 1988 Hewlett-Packard introduced a business calculator, the HP-19B, without <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation,</b> but its 1990 successor, the HP-19BII, gave users the option of using algebraic notation or <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation.</b>|$|E

This calculator popularized <b>reverse</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>notation</b> among the scientific and engineering communities.
