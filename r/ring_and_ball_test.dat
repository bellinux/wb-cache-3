40|$|Diploma {{thesis is}} {{particularly}} focused on ageing of asphalt mixtures and asphalt binders. In the theoretical part {{an array of}} methods simulating short term and long term ageing consequently is introduced. The main objective of the practical part was {{to carry out the}} long-term ageing test method BSA (Braunschweiger Alterung). Thereafter, specimens testing for stiffness properties according to CSN EN 12697 - 26 were made. After conducting the measurement on those, asphalt binder was extracted and processed to follow-up testing. The testing consisted of a range of methods – Penetration CSN EN 1426, <b>Ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>test</b> CSN EN 1427, Determination of the Frass breaking point CSN EN 12593, Determination of complex shear modulus CSN EN 14770 and Dynamic viscosity using a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR).

40|$|Foamed asphalt mixes {{are gaining}} ground as {{effective}} alternatives to asphalt {{base and sub-base}} standard layers in Europe and in other countries worldwide. As {{a significant amount of}} research is being conducted to advance sustainable practices for road pavements, foaming asphalt mixes have become a valid option to common asphalt paving technologies. Several advantages and the environmental benefits of foamed asphalt mixes have been debated and assessed. The present study aimed to evaluate: (1) the foaming characteristics of several bitumens sourced from different refineries with the same classification grade; (2) the physical, rheological, and chemical properties of bitumens before and after foaming; and (3) the effectiveness of a foaming additive in the enhancement of final product performance. Results showed that the same penetration-grade bitumen can provide very different results in terms of foaming properties (expansion ratio and half-life) depending on its chemical composition (differential scanning calorimetry and optical microscope analysis). The experimental program also assessed how the foaming process affected the physical and rheological behavior of bitumens (penetration, <b>Ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>test,</b> dynamic viscosity, complex modulus, and phase angle) ...|$|E

This additive is a long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon and termed as S in this study. The properties evaluated included the rheological properties of the modified bitumen. The properties were evaluated using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), rolling thin film oven (RTFOT), pressure aging vessel (PAV), and Viscometer, Penetro meter, <b>Ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>test.</b> Results from the study indicated {{that the effect of}} S on the binder depends on the quantity of the additive used and test temperature. The general trend is with an increase in the additive the binder viscosity decreases at high temperature, however at low temperature the binder becomes more stiffen, this results in considerable reduction of the penetration and increasing the softening point. Adding S to the binder showed considerable increase in complex modulus and decrease phase angle of the modified bitumen at both medium and high temperatures, with minimal effect on the aging of the binder...|$|E

With the aim of clarifying this issue, a study comparing a hot mix asphalt with a WMA prepared using the foaming process technology.

The long term related performance of the mixtures is compared by means of complex modulus and fatigue <b>testing.</b> Penetration <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ball</b> <b>tests</b> are undertaken on the recovered bitumens, {{as well as the}} ageing evolution, characterised by the Fourier Transform Infrared analysis.

This procedure is meant to assess the recyclability of mixtures through production of Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in the laboratory in a realistic way. With the chosen aging protocol (divided into short and long-term ageing), the results of interlaboratory tests are presented. A bituminous material with a 35 / 50 penetration pure bitumen, taken from an LCPC fatigue carrousel experiment is submitted to the ageing protocol. The recovered bitumen is analysed by means of classical empirical <b>tests</b> (penetration <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ball),</b> rheological <b>tests</b> (complex modulus) as well as a physico-chemical test (infra red spectroscopy) to asses the binder evolution throughout ageing. The results coming from the round robin test show that the ageing of the plant mix is similar to the ageing of the mix manufactured in the laboratory and subjected to the short-term ageing protocol, for all the indicators <b>tested</b> (penetration, <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ball,</b> DSR <b>and</b> FTIR).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{rheological}} properties of bitumen (asphalt) binder penetration grade 60 - 70 modified with an additive Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR). SBR is an elastomer {{which is the}} important sort of synthetic rubber. It is a copolymer which consists of organic compound styrene and butadiene chain which makes up its molecular structure. Bitumen is visco-elastic material where temperature and rate of load application have a great influence on their performance. The properties evaluated include the rheological properties of the modified bitumen binder. These properties were complex shear modulus G* using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), short term aging by Rolling Thin Film Oven Test (RTFOT), long term aging by Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV), viscosity by Rotational Viscometer (RV), penetration by Penetro meter and softening point by <b>Ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>test.</b> Results obtained from the study indicated the effect of SBR on the binder, and also depends on the quantity (%) of the additive used and test temperature. The binders were mixed with various percentages of the SBR at the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 % by weight of bitumen binder. Using the SBR showed prominent results in improving the viscoelastic properties of ordinary bitumen. The effects of SBR modifier influenced significantly the rheological behavior of bitumen by increasing its complex shear modulus (G*) and increasing the resistance of mixture against permanent deformation (Rutting). Despite the advantages of SBR on bitumen performance at high temperatures, it does not show a considerable influence on the intermediate temperature performance of bitumen. In addition, results show that increasing the additive content increases the viscosity of modified bitumen. This in return resists the compactive effort {{and there will be}} low stability values and there will be more chances for fatigue cracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} mechanistic procedures for design, maintenance, and rehabilitation of highway and airport pavements {{has been recognized}} for many years. Mechanistic methods {{are based on the}} principles of mechanics in contrast to the particular purpose and empirical procedures that are often used. The objective of this study is the development of Mechanistic-Empirical design method by the implementation of hydrated lime effect in the proposed pavement section. Enhancing the paving material performance-related properties during design is an important step to minimize the efforts, pavement layers’ thicknesses and cost as well as develop the serviceability and design life. This can be done by modifiers, and one of the effective modification materials is the hydrated lime. Accordingly, the advantages of hydrated lime in the resistance to fatigue cracking and permanent deformation are utilized as main factors in the adopted Mechanistic-Empirical approach of this study. To achieve the objective of this study, three types of asphalt concrete mixtures that represent the pavement asphaltic courses (Wearing, Leveling and Base) of the asphalt concrete layer were produced and evaluated. As mineral filler materials, ordinary limestone dust and hydrated lime were used in this study. Five different hydrated lime percentages were selected, namely 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 percent as partial replacement of limestone dust filler by total weight of aggregate besides a control mixture without hydrated lime. For the hydrated lime modified mix design, the introducing of lime into the mixtures was done by adding dry hydrated lime by total aggregate weight following the normal procedure for adding mineral filler. The experimental programme conducted in this study comprises of four main steps. Firstly, evaluate the effect of hydrated lime (HL) on asphalt cement physical properties. Penetration and the softening point (<b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>ball)</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted to study the influence of hydrated lime on asphalt cement consistency and stiffness. Secondly, the design of asphalt concrete mixtures following Marshall design procedure. The use of Marshall apparatus is to obtain the optimum asphalt content in specific values of stability, air void and density for control and hydrated lime modified mixes. This method also covers the evaluation of mixtures’ resistance to plastic flow (Marshall stability and flow). Thirdly, determine and evaluate the control and hydrated lime modified Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement mechanical responses to the two major distresses (fatigue cracking and rutting) that generally occurred in the pavement. In particular, these distresses could give an indication of failure criteria in the mechanistic-empirical design process. Finally, evaluation of pavement mixtures resistance to moisture damage regarding the effect of hydrated lime. The determined optimum asphalt contents by Marshall design procedure as related to the effect of hydrated lime were used in preparing further mixes specimens with different geometry and size for fatigue and rutting tests. The testing temperatures for permanent deformation and resilient modulus were 20 oC, 40 oC and 60 oC, for fatigue it was 20 oC and for the moisture susceptibility the temperature was 25 oC. The fatigue and permanent deformation tests were done under the repeated loading using the pneumatic repeated load system (PRLS). The addition of 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|Bitumen in pure form is not {{suitable}} for modern roads and present traffic. This hasforced engineers to modify bitumen to improve its performance during service life. Two routes are known for bitumen modification, namely: chemical and physical modifications. Therefore, there are chemical and physical modifiers. Among physical modifiers polymers (thermoplastics, rubbers and thermosets) are the most interesting ones. Rubbers are very good bitumen modifiers. In this work, non-vulcanized rubbers were incorporated into bitumen. The resulting range of blends showed higher and intermediate performance compared to the base bitumen. The improved properties are lower penetration degree and higher softening point. The low temperature property such as Frass breaking point was not improved. New formulae for estimating bitumen’s performance using the results of conventional Frass <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> & <b>ball</b> <b>tests</b> were introduced. The morphology of the blends depending on the rheological properties and compatibility of the rubber with bitumen was different. Polybutadiene formed a continuous phase mixture in bitumen. This was observed due to the compatibility of this rubber with bitumen. Due to lesser compatibility between polymer and bitumen, SBRs and natural rubber formed polymeric inclusion dispersed in bitumen...|$|R
