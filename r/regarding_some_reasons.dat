40|$|In {{addition}} to theoretical arguments advocating various advantages of industrial networking, {{many examples of}} good practices and positive experiences can be found worldwide. Therefore, in many countries political measures have implemented to boost strategic partnership between companies. Nevertheless, examples of good practices of networking in the hospitality business are still relatively rare. In this paper, results of {{a study on the}} potentials for good practice in this <b>regard</b> and <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> for the current state of poor networking in the Slovene hospitality sector are presented. The research consists of two parts. Managers of hospitality companies and leaders of two formal networks were interviewed for this purpose. The quantitative approach with Likert-type ordinal scale was used with the former group, while semi-structured interview and qualitative analysis was employed for the latter. The results revealed some interesting differences in the operational focus between formal and informal networks in terms of goals sought by their members. Strategic cooperation with the suppliers {{turned out to be the}} most common field of networking, while the principal obstacles for more intensive networking seem to lie in the conservative character of managers in the hospitality business, distrust and lack of time and organizational knowledge. This research fills the gap in dealing with industrial networking by confronting formal and informal strategic cooperation praxes in hospitality business...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the rule}} of Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia, Macedonia was {{recognized}} {{for the first time}} as an individual ethnic and political entity. Yet, <b>some</b> <b>regard</b> the <b>reason</b> for the recognition of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia by Tito and his government as a pragmatic decision, inasmuch as the Macedonian national consciousness seemed a rather strong force, whose suppression might have been a demanding task. The notion of a Greater Macedonia was also regarded as a crucial resource for Tito’s expansionist ideas. The ideal was a greater Balkan Federation through the inclusion of Bulgaria and Greece. These plans stopped when Greek and Yugoslav communists split due to the discord between Tito and Joseph Stalin.|$|R
40|$|Poets and memoirists {{have known}} for millennia that the written word can clarify, beautify and heal, as the {{students}} of Room 5 C often discover. Writing, of course, is also a key tool of peaceful social change. As such, the written word can be where personal and social change, structure and agency, meet in the classroom. Yet how often is this power leveraged in our juvenile detention home schools? How often do we ask juvenile offenders to be critical participants, even leaders, in their communities? Freire would remind us that the problems juvenile offender-students face are themselves the best curriculum. This presentation and workshop will equip participants with peace education curriculum that will empower student writers to find their voice {{as a first step}} towards taking action for global justice. In this way, personal and social change become quite connected. This curriculum challenges students to reflect on actions for social justice which they can pursue, as well as critically examine why disparities still exist. Participants will be invited to take part in an example successful classroom activity and to engage in dialogue <b>regarding</b> <b>some</b> theoretical <b>reasons</b> for its success. Hence participants, especially any classroom teachers, will engage in reflective practice regarding their own classroom. The workshop will end with generating specific policy recommendations, based on the barriers to peace education that workshop participants currently observe. This dialogue can then facilitate the inclusion of peace education in every classroom...|$|R
