Machine learning-based approaches have been widely applied in this area. However, the recognition performance of current approaches could still be improved. Our novel approach is to combine support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), which can complement and facilitate each other. During the hybrid process, we use SVM to separate biological terms from non-biological terms, before we use CRFs to determine the types of biological terms, which makes full use {{of the power of}} SVM as a binary-class classifier and the data-labeling capacity of CRFs. We then merge the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>SVM</b> <b>and</b> CRFs. To remove any inconsistencies that might result from the merging, we develop a useful algorithm and apply two rules. To ensure biological terms with a maximum length are identified, we propose a maximal bidirectional squeezing approach that finds the longest term.

We examined the performance of four approaches with GENIA corpus and JNLPBA 04 data. The combination of SVM and CRFs improved performance.

40|$|Cloud {{detection}} of remote sensing imagery is quite challenging {{due to the}} influence of complicated underlying surfaces and the variety of cloud types. Currently, most of the methods mainly rely on prior knowledge to extract features artificially for cloud detection. However, these features {{may not be able to}} accurately represent the cloud characteristics under complex environment. In this paper, we adopt an innovative model named Fuzzy Autoencode Model (FAEM) to integrate the feature learning ability of stacked autoencode networks and the detection ability of fuzzy function for highly accurate cloud detection on remote sensing imagery. Our proposed method begins by selecting and fusing spectral, texture, and structure information. Thereafter, the proposed technique established a FAEM to learn the deep discriminative features from a great deal of selected information. Finally, the learned features are mapped to the corresponding cloud density map with a fuzzy function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 172 Landsat ETM+ images and 25 GF- 1 images with different spatial resolutions are used in this paper. For the convenience of accuracy assessment, ground truth data are manually outlined. Results show that the average RER (ratio of right rate and error rate) on Landsat images is greater than 29, while the average RER of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is 21. 8 and Random Forest (RF) is 23. The results on GF- 1 images exhibit similar performance as Landsat images with the average RER of 25. 9, which is much higher than the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>SVM</b> <b>and</b> RF.

30|$|You can {{see that}} LSTM {{classifier}} has the lowest precision value but its recall is the highest. The high value of recall indicates that LSTM classified the spoken utterance almost completely. However, many written sentences were also falsely classified {{as we can see}} from the low value of precision. On the other hand, we achieve the lowest recall and highest precision when using the CRF classifier. This indicates that a few written sentences were mixed selected, but not all the spoken utterances were selected. The results also demonstrated that both of the classification F scores <b>and</b> accuracies, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>SVM,</b> CRF, <b>and</b> LSTM classifiers are comparable. Therefore, in this work, we chose to compare multiple classification models, since we are interested to see how each classifier does in predicting the spoken degrees that are assigned to the utterances. For SVM, the RBF kernel has a slightly better performance than the linear one. Therefore, the RBF kernelwas used to select spoken utterances for LM training in the latter experiment.|$|R

40|$|The Support Vector Machines (SVMs) {{had been}} showing a high {{capability}} of complex hyperplane representation and great generalization power. These characteristics {{lead to the}} development of more compact and less computational complex methods than the One-versus-Rest (OvR) and One-versus-One (OvO) [1] classical methods in the application <b>of</b> <b>SVMs</b> in multiclass problems. This paper proposes a new method for this task, named Truth Table Fitting Multiclass SVM (TTF-MCSVM), in which less SVMs are used than other classical methods. The main objective of this research is {{the development of a new}} method to be applied in problems with very large number of classes, like in the recognition of East Asian languages characters (e. g. Japanese and Chinese kanji). The TTF-MCSVM is based on the combination of many simple binary SVMs, like the OvR and OvO. The N classes are divided in M combinations of two groups, where M is: M = ⌈log 2 N ⌉ (1) Each of the two groups in each combination will correspond to a new pseudoclass and each pair of pseudo-classes forms a grouping. As the M groupings are binary, they can be applied to M simple <b>and</b> independent binary <b>SVM.</b> This approach can be also represented by the encoding scheme described in [2]. However, the principal point in this work is to analyze the use of encodings with a fixed length M, which is the minimal encoding size for a problem with N classes. Considering the classes Ck (1 <k<N), if the groupings are consistent (i. e. each Ck class has a different associated pseudo-class combination), the M groupings can be arranged in a Boolean truth table, where the inputs are the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> all <b>SVMs</b> <b>and</b> the output is the winner class, which is chosen by the overlap of the decision hyperplanes <b>of</b> the <b>SVMs.</b> During the training phase, each SVM is trained independently, and the margin is maximized to divide the two pseudo-classes <b>of</b> that <b>SVM.</b> On the test phase, the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the M <b>SVMs</b> are applied on the truth table and, if the groupings are correct, it will be possible to choose the winner class...|$|R

To fulfil the aims of this research, recently acquired dated 08 / 02 / 2016 Sentinel- 2 and dated 22 / 02 / 2016 Landsat- 8 images of Istanbul were obtained and image pre-processing steps like atmospheric and geometric correction were employed.

40|$|Land use {{land cover}} (LULC) changes {{frequently}} in ecotones {{due to the}} large climate and soil gradients, and complex landscape composition and configuration. Accurate mapping of LULC changes in ecotones is of great importance for assessment of ecosystem functions/services and policy-decision support. Decadal or sub-decadal mapping of LULC provides scenarios for modeling biogeochemical processes and their feedbacks to climate, and evaluating effectiveness of land-use policies, e. g. forest conversion. However, it remains a great challenge to produce reliable LULC maps in moderate resolution and to evaluate their uncertainties over large areas with complex landscapes. In this study we developed a robust LULC classification system using multiple classifiers based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and posterior data fusion. Not only does the system create LULC maps with high statistical accuracy, but also it provides pixel-level uncertainties that are essential for subsequent analyses and applications. We applied the classification system to the Agro-pasture transition band in northern China (APTBNC) to detect the decadal changes in LULC during 2003 - 2013 and evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} implementation of major Key Forestry Programs (KFPs). In our study, the random forest (RF), support vector machine (<b>SVM),</b> <b>and</b> weighted k-nearest neighbors (WKNN) classifiers outperformed the artificial neural networks (ANN) and naive Bayes (NB) in terms of high classification accuracy and low sensitivity to training sample size. The Bayesian-average data fusion based on the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> RF, <b>SVM,</b> <b>and</b> WKNN achieved the 87. 5 % Kappa statistics, higher than any individual classifiers and the majority-vote integration. The pixel-level uncertainty map agreed with the traditional accuracy assessment. However, it conveys spatial variation of uncertainty. Specifically, it pinpoints the southwestern area of APTBNC has higher uncertainty than other part of the region, and the open shrubland is likely to be misclassified to the bare ground in some locations. Forests, closed shrublands, and grasslands in APTBNC expanded by 23 %, 50 %, and 9 %, respectively, during 2003 - 2013. The expansion of these land cover types is compensated with the shrinkages in croplands (20 %), bare ground (15 %), and open shrublands (30 %). The significant decline in agricultural lands is primarily attributed to the KFPs implemented in the end of last century and the nationwide urbanization in recent decade.
