40|$|This {{appendix}} is {{the result}} of the joint effort of the two authors, and consists of a sketch ofthe paleography of the ED IIIb Umma region. It does not constitute a complete survey of the topic; rather it includes a selection of signs salient for the correct reading and interpretation of the texts edited herein. In order to provide diachronic continuity to our discourse, we chose to take into consideration the corpus of texts of the ED IIIb Umma region, including the so-called archive of Lugalzagesi, i. e. the most recent Ummaite Pre-Sargonic group of texts. This work was made possible and considerably facilitated by the possibility of collating the great part of the texts discussed, either personally or by means of high-quality photographs. The idea for this contribution originated from the practical need to distinguish pairs (or clusters) of signs sharing common features (e. g. AGRIG, GUL, and U 3, GURUS and KAL), or to identify and describe peculiar signs (e. g. GIBIL and ZA 7). The absence of a <b>reference</b> <b>sign</b> list also played a decisive role committing the authors to such an effort...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} Factored Translation Models (FTMs) for {{improving}} a Speech into Sign Language Translation System. These FTMs allow incorporating syntactic-semantic information during the translation process. This new information permits to reduce significantly the translation error rate. This paper also analyses different alternatives {{for dealing with the}} non-relevant words. The speech into sign language translation system has been developed and evaluated in a specific application domain: the renewal of Identity Documents and Driver’s License. The translation system uses a phrase-based translation system (Moses). The evaluation results reveal that the BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) has improved from 69. 1 % to 73. 9 % and the mSER (multiple <b>references</b> <b>Sign</b> Error Rate) has been reduced from 30. 6 % to 24. 8 %...|$|R

By recognizing the traffic signs automatically, it helps the driver to recognize the signs properly when drivig, to avoid accidents caused by mis-recognized the traffic signs. The system {{is divided into two}} stages : detection stage to localize signs from a whole image, and classification stage that classifies the detected sign into one of the <b>reference</b> <b>signs.</b> A geometric fragmentation technique, a method somewhat similar to Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to detect circular sign. Then a ring partitioned method that divides an image into several ring-shaped areas is used to classify the signs.

40|$|Annotations are an {{important}} resource in corpus-based linguistic research. In fact, the most important feature of a modern signed language corpus should be {{that it has been}} annotated rather than simply transcribed. Digital multi-media annotation software can now transform language recordings into machine-readable texts using gloss-based annotations without it first being necessary to transcribe these utterances, provided that sign tokens are identified and discriminated according to type. Further annotations can subsequently be appended to these units. However, unique identifiers of sign types (or ‘ID-glosses’) can only be used if a comprehensive reference lexical database of the language already exists. In order to create a basic multi-purpose <b>reference</b> <b>signed</b> language corpus, therefore, linguists should prioritize annotation using ID-glosses above transcription. The effort expended in creating a transcription that does not facilitate the unique identification of sign types will not result in a machine-readable corpus in any meaningful sense, contrary to expectations. 26 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{innovative}} approach to on-line handwritten signature verification based on optimal feature representation (OFR) and neural-network-driven fuzzy reasoning (NND-FR); OFR is introduced here and {{is different from}} feature selection and generation. To create a <b>reference</b> <b>signing</b> model of a person, a set of shape features and dynamic features are extracted from a set of original signatures. Subsequently, for each distinctive feature, an averaged prototype and a consistency function are calculated using genetic optimization, this procedure derived from our concept of optimal feature representation. Two NND-FR systems are trained using the prototype and consistency function of each feature. For verification, every feature is compared against its optimal reference using the NND-FR scheme, evaluating separately the form and dynamics of a questioned signature. Our verifier was tested using 1923 signatures from 36 signers {{in the context of}} random and skilled forgeries, resulting in a misclassification rate as low as 0. 14 %...|$|R

In a liar game we have two players, the Questioner and the Responder.

This project discusses strategies for which it is possible to solve the liar game using the minimum number of questions and further shows links between the liar game and coding theory. The project begins by highlighting the different types of liar games and the particular liar game that is of focus within this project. The basic concepts of coding theory are introduced in the second chapter using the work of Welsh [11]. In particular, we will see that there is a code which optimally solves the liar game with one lie and n = 10 6...|$|R
