We consider the effect of adoption of non-binding pay nfirms on actal remuneration behavior using a unique country example.

These pay nfirms affected pay in firms with actual compensation below and above <b>reference</b> <b>values.</b> Further we find that <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> changed compensation in all types of firms, although executive compensation increased more in firms with more dispersed ownership and control.

40|$|Purpose: Aim of {{this review}} {{is to provide}} an {{overview}} for clinicians of pediatric <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> from 1995 - 2008, regarding muscle strength, aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity and submaximal performance. Primary objective is {{to provide information about}} which <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> are most appropriate for practical use. Summary of key points: Twelve studies provide <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> for muscle strength, nine for aerobic capacity, one for anaerobic capacity and four regarding submaximal performance. Conclusion: Based on this review, no specific advice can be given for using <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> regarding muscle strength, due to a large heterogenity of used tests. For aerobic and anaerobic capacity, <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> from Ortega et al. can be advised. When submaximal testing, <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> from Li et al. seem to be most practical applicable. Recommendation for clinical practice: When using <b>reference</b> <b>values,</b> clinicians should consider if the values are appropriate for use, regarding the specific problems a child presents. Abstract Purpose: to provide <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> for children and adolescents with spastic Cerebral Palsy, classified at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I and II, for the Shuttle Run Test, Muscle Power Sprint Test and 10 x 5 -meter Sprint Test. Summary of key points: for all tests, an increase in performance was observed with increasing height. Subjects classified at GMFCS level I performed better than subjects classified at GMFCS level II on all tests. Conclusion: the <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> are presented as height-related <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> with the use of percentile charts for GMFCS level I and II separately. Recommendation for clinical practice: the <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> present an overview of a child's performance. They do not tell if an intervention is indicated, as all children and adolescents with Cerebral Palsy have subnormal levels of aerobic and anaerobic capacity. Hopefully the levels of fitness will increase in the future as a result of more activity-related therapy interventions and an active lifestyle...|$|R

40|$|During {{successive}} approximation analog to digital conversion {{a series of}} successive digital <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> is selected that converges towards a digital representation of an analog input signal.

The comparison results define a series of successively narrower ranges of digital values that contain a digital representation of the analog input signal. Use of a plurality of comparator results for selecting the steps in the digital <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> makes it possible to reduce uncertainty about whether the comparison result has settled. This in turn makes it possible to reduce the sizes of the successive ranges, which speeds up convergence. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial <b>reference</b> <b>value</b> set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think {{there will be plenty of}} time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E

Therefore the question arises {{whether or not the}} commonly used <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> of the Euro-pean Community (ECCS) for lung function, may still be accepted today. Measured values for elderly are classified by extrapolation beyond the range of refer-ence equations. Material and methods: Lung function was examined by pneumotachography for recording static lung volumes and flow-volume-curves in 257 asymptomatic non smoking males, aged 20 - 90 years. Results were com-pared to the <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> of ECCS, SAPALDIA, LuftiBus, and NHANES. Results: For analysis age and height dependence of in-vestigated respiratory parameters (VC, FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 %FVC, PEF, MEF 75, 50, 25) can for simplicity be de scribed by linear functions (y = a. height(H) -b. age (A) +c). The forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV 1, was calculated by FEV 1 = 0. 0432. H- 0. 0347. A- 2. 114; where H- height, A- age; r = 0. 78. Mean FEV 1 for younger subjects was found to be 106. 1 ± 11. 2 % of the ECCS <b>reference</b> <b>values</b> and 97. 8 ± 11. 7 % in older subjects. For all parameters investigat-ed linear regressions on age were steeper than de-scribed by the ECCS <b>reference</b> <b>values.</b> The regression of lung function to height largely follows the ECCS prescriptions.
