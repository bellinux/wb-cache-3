They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, {{on the nature of}} the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase.

25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same <b>retention</b> <b>time),</b> which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E

Primary sludge (PS) and thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) were studied in two lab-scale AnFBRs using High-density polyethylene (HDPE) as carrier media. PS was investigated at various organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 9 to 18 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) /m 3 -d corresponding to hydraulic <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (HRTs) of 2 to 4 days, with maximum COD and volatile suspended solid (VSS) removal efficiency of 70 % and 72 %, respectively. For TWAS, VSS destruction efficiency varied from 53 % at an HRT of 4 days and OLR of 12 kg COD/m 3 -d to 61 % at an HRT of 8 days and an OLR of 6 kg COD/m 3 -d. The results showed that mesophilic anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor is highly effective for COD removal and VSS reduction of municipal biosolids compared with conventional anaerobic digestion. Furthermore, the specific bacterial community activity tests showed a significant difference between solid <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> (SRT) based on general VSS and <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> based on the activity of methanogenic, acidogenic, and acetogenic microbes.
