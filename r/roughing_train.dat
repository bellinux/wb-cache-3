40|$|An {{important}} recent {{trend in}} the steel industry {{is the development of}} processes for casting steel closer to the final product size. The continuous casting of thin slabs with thickness of only a few centimeters allows hot direct rolling to be performed in-line with conventional finishing mill, eliminating the need for a <b>roughing</b> <b>train...</b>|$|E
40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the <b>roughing</b> <b>train</b> of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|E

40|$|Two-component {{high-speed}} particle image velocimetry {{measurements of}} the underfloor flow field in the rail symmetry-line of three different 1 : 50 high-speed train configurations hauled over a smooth ground, a rough ground and a ground with sleepers were conducted in a water towing tank at a train speed of 4 m/s (Reynolds number= 0. 25 â¢ 106). The high-speed train configurations were realised by changing the underfloor roughness of the 4 -unit generic high-speed train model (two end-cars and two mid-cars). The reference train model represents a conventional non-articulated high-speed train with inter-car gaps and two bogies per car. A completely smooth underbelly was achieved by removing the bogies and covering all the gaps as the third train configuration without bogies and all gaps left open reflects a <b>rough</b> <b>train</b> underbelly. The results revealed that any underfloor irregularities such as bogies, bogie housings, inter-car gaps or cavities accelerates the underfloor flow concluding that a smooth train underfloor decreases the chance of ballast flight. Furthermore, the risk of ballast flight is lower for a trackbed with monoblock sleepers and a lowered ballast level than for a trackbed with bi-block sleepers...|$|R

The reference train model consisting of four cars, features inter-car gaps and two bogies per car. These features are removed and all gaps are closed for the smooth train configuration, while the <b>rough</b> <b>train</b> configuration reflects all gaps but no bogies. The lowest underfloor flow velocities and velocity gradients at the ground are observed for the smooth train model {{on the ground with}} sleepers. Further the measurements reveal that any additional irregularity of the underbody leads to accelerated flow regions in the otherwise Couette-like flow which increase the possibility of ballast flight. Therefore it is concluded that a smooth underbody can lower the risk of ballast flight. The results obtained for the reference train model are compared to those of a full scale measurement. It is shown that the results of the water towing tank experiments with the down-scaled train model reflect the main characteristics of the underfloor flow of the full scale measurements...|$|R

Duncan goes back to school where he has a principal that doesn't want him there and a jerk that won't get off his case. So for a little payback, Troy tries to set Duncan up by hiding a gun. It works, but the reaction is far more than what Troy wanted. This leads to Duncan seriously thinking about his control over his emotions and if he truly belongs in the world with humans. When he returns home, it is demolished and Margaret is missing. He tracks down his mother and her kidnapper, a monster from Monster Island. He and the monster have a brutal fight which ends (at least as far as Duncan is concerned) with Duncan blasting the monster with flame, leaving the monster badly burned but alive.
