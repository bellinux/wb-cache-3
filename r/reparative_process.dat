Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability {{that leads to a}} significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function. A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11. A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time. Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop bronchiolitis obliterans progressing to ARDS. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's <b>reparative</b> <b>process.</b> A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with co-morbidities. Several studies report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury.|$|E

60|$|We have as yet spoken only of {{the removal}} of parts, when not {{followed}} by morbid action: but when the operation is thus followed, {{it is certain that}} the deficiency is sometimes inherited. In a former chapter instances were given, as of a cow, the loss of whose horn was followed by suppuration, and her calves were destitute of a horn {{on the same side of}} their heads. But the evidence which admits of no doubt is that given by Brown-Sequard with respect to guinea-pigs, which after their sciatic nerves had been divided, gnawed off their own gangrenous toes, and the toes of their offspring were deficient in at least thirteen instances on the corresponding feet. The inheritance of the lost part in several of these cases is all the more remarkable as only one parent was affected; but we know that a congenital deficiency is often transmitted from one parent alone--for instance, the offspring of hornless cattle of either sex, when crossed with perfect animals, are often hornless. How, then, in accordance with our hypothesis can we account for mutilations being sometimes strongly inherited, if they are followed by diseased action? The answer probably is that all the gemmules of the mutilated or amputated part are gradually attracted to the diseased surface during the <b>reparative</b> <b>process,</b> and are there destroyed by the morbid action.|$|E

50|$|Acromioclavicular joint dislocations are graded from I to VI. Grading {{is based}} upon the degree of {{separation}} of the acromion from the clavicle with weight applied to the arm. Grade I is slight displacement of the joint, and a badly stretched or partially torn AC ligament. It has the normal separation of <4 mm. Grade II is a partial dislocation of the AC joint with a complete disruption tear of the AC joint and a partial disruption of coracoclavicular ligament. The AC gap is >5 mm. Grades I and II never require surgery and heal by themselves, though physical therapy may be required. Grade III is complete disruption of AC and CC ligaments. On plain film the inferior aspect of the clavicle will be above the superior aspect of the acromion. This can also be assessed with an MRI scan, which will also demonstrate disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments (the degree depending on the severity of AC joint disruption) as well as tearing of the joint capsule. The joint will be very tender and swollen on examination. Grade III separations most often do not require surgery and shoulder function should return to normal after 16-20 weeks. However, there will be some physical deformity of the shoulder with a noticeable bump resulting from the dislocation of the clavicle. Grades IV-VI are complications on a 'standard' dislocation involving a displacement of the clavicle, and will almost always require surgery. Dynamic US is critical to detect mild (grade I) dislocations, especially because they may present as a normal joint in static images. Doppler US may also be used to increase diagnostic confidence to detect low-grade injuries because it depicts <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> to injured ligament.|$|E

40|$|Inflammation plays a {{key role}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of atherosclerosis. The more we discover about the molecular pathways involved in atherosclerosis, the more we perceive the importance of monocytes in this process. Circulating monocytes are components of innate immunity, and many pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules facilitate their adhesion and migration to the vascular endothelial wall. In addition to the accumulation of lipids and formation of atherogenic 'foam' cells, monocytes may promote atherosclerotic plaque growth by production of inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and reactive oxidative species. However, the contribution of monocytes to atherogenesis is not only limited to tissue destruction. Monocyte subsets are also involved in intraplaque angiogenesis and tissue <b>reparative</b> <b>processes.</b> The aim of this overview is to discuss the mechanisms of monocyte activation, the pivotal role and importance of activated monocytes in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, their implication in the development of acute coronary events, and their potential in cardiovascular <b>reparative</b> <b>processes</b> such angiogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{microenvironment}} in carcinomas recruits mesench- ymal {{cells with}} an abnormal proangiogenic and invasive phenotype. It {{is not clear}} whether mesenchymal tumor cells (MTCs) derive from the activation of mature fibroblasts or from their stem cell precursors. However, stromal cell activation in tumors resembles in several aspects the mesenchymal rearrangement which normally occurs during <b>reparative</b> <b>processes</b> such as wound healing. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) {{play a crucial role in}} developmental and <b>reparative</b> <b>processes</b> and have extra- ordinary proangiogenic potential, on the basis of which they are thought to show great promise for the treatment of ischemic disorders. Here, we show that MTCs have proangiogenic potential and that they share the transcrip- tional expression of the best-known proangiogenic factors with MSCs. We also found that MTCs and MSCs have the same molecular signature for stemness-related genes, and that when co-implanted with cancer cells in syngeneic animals MSCs determine early tumor appearance, probably by favoring the angiogenic switch. Our data (1) reveal crucial aspects of the proangiogenic phenotype of MTCs, (2) strongly suggest their stem origin and (3) signal the risk of therapeutic use of MSCs in tumor- promoting conditions...|$|R
40|$|Hair cell {{degeneration}} and {{the repair}} process due to differing types of trauma {{have been studied}} extensively in the organ of Corti. It has been determined that, during scar formation, after differing types of trauma to the auditory sensory system, the reticular lamina is maintained with adherens junctions and tight junctions. We investigated the repair process within the vestibular epithelium. Hair cell degeneration was induced by the unilateral application of streptomycin to the inner ears of guinea pigs. Whole mount preparations of all five vestibular organs were processed and examined by fluorescence, light and electron microscopy. Scar formation was seen as early as 4 days post-treatment with streptomycin and was noted to coincide with hair cell degeneration. Neighboring supporting cells swelled and filled the space beneath the degenerating hair cell. Between three and five supporting cells participate in the <b>reparative</b> <b>process.</b> The distribution of cytokeratin is also altered during scar formation. The area once occupied by the hair cell becomes filled with cytokeratin-rich processes of supporting cells. It appears that differing numbers of supporting cells {{are involved in the}} <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> within the vestibular sensory epithelium as compared to the auditory system. The reticular lamina remains intact at all times. This may possibly prevent mixing of fluids between different compartments in the inner ear and dysfunction of the vestibular sensory organs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our work}} {{is to examine the}} influence of prolonged administration of an opioid, on the course of the <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> of a multiple post-injection wound inflicted upon a white rat’s skin, doing so by way of using light microscopy. The studies were carried out on 24 mature white male rats, aged 4. 5 - 7. 5 months, with weights of 130 - 150 g. For histological examination, the skin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The preparations were studied and photographed at the magnification of ob. х 8, ey. x 15 and ob. x 40, ey. x 10. The «Aver Media» computer system was employed for micropreparations photography. The set levels of light microscopy reveal that the administration of an opioid for a 2 week period does not affect the <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> of a multiple post-injection wound. Moreover, in most wound canals, the formation of a complete regenerate can be seen. However, after 4 weeks of nalbufin administration, the processes of wound healing slowed and were complicated by the formation of microabscesses. After 6 weeks of opioid administration, destructive changes in the skin were detected. These, in turn, led to the incomplete regenerate formation in the multiple postinjection wound. The experimental results, hence, show the negative effect of prolonged administration of opioid on the reparative processes in the skin...|$|E
40|$|Background: Most {{cases of}} {{congenital}} clubfoot {{treated with the}} Ponseti technique require percutaneous Achilles tenotomy to correct the residual equinus. Clinical evidence suggests that complete healing occurs between the cut tendon stumps, but there {{have not yet been}} any detailed studies investigating this <b>reparative</b> <b>process.</b> This study was performed to assess Achilles tendon repair after percutaneous section to correct the residual equinus of clubfoot treated with the Ponseti method. Method: A prospective study analyzed 37 tenotomies in 26 patients with congenital clubfoot treated with the Ponseti technique, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year after the section. The tenotomy was performed percutaneously with a large-bore needle bevel with patient sedation and local anesthesia. Ultrasonographic scanning was performed after section to ascertain that the tenotomy had been completed and to measure the stump separation. In the follow-up period, the <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> was followed ultrasonographically and assessed at 3 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year posttenotomy. Results: The ultrasonography performed immediately after the procedure showed that in some cases, residual strands between the tendon ends persisted, and these were completely sectioned under ultrasound control. A mean retraction of 5. 65 mm +/- 2. 26 mm (range, 2. 3 to 11. 0 mm) between tendon stumps after section was observed. Unusual bleeding occurred in one case and was controlled by digital pressure, with no interference with the final treatment. After 3 weeks, ultrasonography showed tendon repair with the tendon gap filled with irregular hypoechoic tissue, and also with transmission of muscle motion to the heel. Six months after tenotomy, there was structural filling with a fibrillar aspect, mild or moderate hypoechogenicity, and tendon scar thickening when compared with a normal tendon. One year after tenotomy, ultrasound showed a fibrillar structure and echogenicity at the repair site that was similar to a normal tendon, but with persistent tendon scarring thickness. Conclusions: There is a fast <b>reparative</b> <b>process</b> after Achilles tendon percutaneous section that reestablishes continuity between stumps. The reparative tissue evolved to tendon tissue with a normal ultrasonographic appearance except for mild thickening, suggesting a predominantly intrinsic repair mechanism.
