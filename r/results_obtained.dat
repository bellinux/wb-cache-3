5|$|Einstein's work, {{as well as}} {{experimental}} <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by Jean Perrin, later inspired Norbert Wiener in the 1920s to use a type of measure theory, {{developed by}} Percy Daniell, and Fourier analysis to prove {{the existence of the}} Wiener process as a mathematical object.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas {{and his collaborators}} obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians {{have gone on to}} prove rigorously some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.|$|E
5|$|Most people {{infected}} with HIV develop specific antibodies (i.e. seroconvert) within three to twelve {{weeks of the}} initial infection. Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen. Positive <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.|$|E

5|$|The <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by the Morea {{scientific}} expedition {{underscored the}} {{need to create a}} permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, {{in the form of the}} French School at Athens.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his doping violation, Papp was disqualified from all <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> after mid-2001.|$|E

25|$|If the k rooks {{differ in}} some way from each other, e.g., they are {{labelled}} or numbered, all the <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> so far must be multiplied by k!, the number of permutations of k rooks.|$|E

25|$|Users rarely make {{full use}} of larger {{character}} sets in forming passwords. For example, hacking <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> from a MySpace phishing scheme in 2006 revealed 34,000 passwords, of which only 8.3% used mixed case, numbers, and symbols.|$|E
25|$|The <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> can be unpredictable, but {{sometimes}} excellent results are obtained producing images {{that would otherwise}} be unobtainable. This process can be coupled with solarisation so that the end product resembles a negative and is suitable for printing in the normal way.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Epstein reconsidered {{the linear}} and {{quadratic}} Stark effect {{from the point}} of view of the new quantum theory. He derived equations for the line intensities which were a decided improvement over Kramers' <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by the old quantum theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{courtroom}} was stunned, especially Maître Paillet, as {{he listened}} to Orfila, his client and defence witness, explain the misleading <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by the local experts with the Marsh test. It was not the test that gave the erroneous results, but rather, the test was performed incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|They {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that telerobotic approaches could permit direct study of the samples on the Mars surface via telepresence from Mars orbit, permitting rapid exploration and use of human cognition to take advantage of chance discoveries and feedback from the <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> so far.|$|E
25|$|Invariance {{properties}} imply uniform {{performance on}} a class of objective functions. They have been argued to be an advantage, because they allow to generalize and predict {{the behavior of the}} algorithm and therefore strengthen the meaning of empirical <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> on single functions.

25|$|Convergent and {{discriminant}} validity have been measured comparing the <b>results</b> <b>obtained</b> by ASEX with those obtained by other tests.

25|$|Industrial {{engineering}} is {{a branch of}} engineering that concerns the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, material and process.
