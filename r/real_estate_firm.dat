Two hypotheses were examined: the synergy hypothesis and the informational asymmetries hypothesis. <b>Real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> earn higher excess returns when they participate with non-real <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> than when they participate with <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms.</b> The opposite is true for non-real <b>estate</b> <b>firms.</b> Both <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> participants and non-real estate participants earn positive and statistically significant excess returns with {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. The result of this study is consistent with the synergy effect as a source of gain from the joint venture. It is also consistent with the notion that <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> have institutional characteristics in the form of better information about local <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> markets and/or superior management and technical expertise that allow <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> to achieve larger gains from joint ventures at the expense of non-real <b>estate</b> <b>firms.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} return {{relationships}} between listed banks and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> in seven Asian economies {{before and after}} the Asian financial crisis. We find that listed banks were exposed to <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> risk both {{before and after the}} crisis, but that the exposure increased in the post-crisis period. After the crisis, the hidden risk of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> collateral in the bank lending process was explicit, as was evidenced by the increased sensitivity and the structure break. In terms of causality, the returns of listed <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>firms</b> are found to Granger-cause the returns of listed banks.

The intrusion of the Southwest Corridor coupled with and possibly contributing to a decision by Boston banks to cut back mortgage lending (redline) there began a cycle of disinvestment which led to the deterioration of the housing stock, slumlording and abandonment particularly in the central neighborhood along the edges of the corridor.

Because the ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common, in which all partners have to agree on any action, {{as opposed to a}} straightforward partnership, it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements to be done, and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era.
