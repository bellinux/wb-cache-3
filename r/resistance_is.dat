5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> {{a consequence of the}} motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHeat {{transfer}} {{characteristics of}} three typical heat carriers, i. e. saturated steam, thermal oil and flue gas, for indirect paddle dryer were studied. The convective {{heat transfer coefficient}} (HTC) of the three heat carriers were theoretically calculated. The contact resistance and penetration <b>resistance</b> <b>were</b> also determined by the penetration model. In the examined range, the significance of different heat <b>resistances</b> <b>were</b> investigated.

In the thermal oil based drying system, both the convective resistance and the penetration <b>resistance</b> <b>were</b> significant.

5|$|Drug {{resistance}} poses {{a growing}} problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. <b>Resistance</b> <b>is</b> now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years {{and the availability of}} substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.|$|E

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> present.|$|E
5|$|Rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> {{also the}} reason {{at least one}} {{historical}} human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{magnitude}} of cellular and shunt conductance of Necturus gastric antral mucosa was studied by (a) comparing the cellular PD response to transepithelial PD response during changes of ionic {{activity in the}} serosal bathing solution and (b) by measurement of current spread within the epithelial sheet.

40|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{and the distribution}} of R factors in Salmonella strains were surveyed using 1, 980 strains isolated in Japan from 1955 to 1973. <b>Resistances</b> <b>were</b> mostly restricted to sulfanilamide (SA), tetracycline (TC), and streptomycin (SM), and combinations thereof.

5|$|In {{the comic}} book {{adaptation}} of , Batwoman (Kate Kane) appears {{as a member of}} Batman's Insurgency. She is also married to Renee Montoya in this continuity. At the end of the Year Three series she and Huntress fight Wonder Woman of Superman's Regime, with the latter being accidentally killed by the Amazon; while Wonder Woman is shocked by this, a furious Kate beats her into submission. Her grudge towards Wonder Woman continues into Year Four, where she also suffers the death of Renee after she overdosed on enhancement pills. When the Regime and the Greek Gods battle at the Hall of Justice, Kate gets revenge on Wonder Woman by strangling her with her own Lasso of Truth, recreating Huntress' experience. However, while she acknowledged she wants Diana dead, she lets her live as a sign that she is a better person. In Year Five, when an underground <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> built up and named after the Joker, she confronts them in their hideout and tells them the Joker is not a man who should be honored. In the conclusion of the series, she seemingly sacrifices herself when she helped transport the other universe's Justice League to their world.|$|E

5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion <b>resistance</b> <b>is</b> needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E
