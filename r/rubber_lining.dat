5000|$|The {{full-scale}} IsaMills allowed MIM {{to refine}} the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed {{to allow it to}} split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold <b>rubber</b> <b>lining</b> and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). [...] While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand.|$|E

40|$|Wheel axles are {{critical}} components on the train, {{and subjected to}} strict inspections and maintenance. With its placement underneath the train units, they are naturally susceptible of shocks and impact loads from ice, snow, gravel and collisions with animals. Due date the axles are protected with an organic coating solution. The {{problem is that the}} loads from impacts and shocks are large, and the coating is worn away. This result in bare steel that starts to corrode. In addition, the impact loads can cause local damages in the axle surface that can be point where fatigue cracks can be initiated. The objective of this master thesis has been to evaluate and test alternative protective coatings for train axles. In collaboration with NSB a set of requirements for the new solution have been set up. Based on the requirements, operating conditions and a literature study of different types of protective coatings, a selection of four coatings have been made. The properties which was detrimental for the selection was; the impact resistance, corrosion resistance, adhesion to the substrate and experience from similar applications. A test program was set up to document and test the properties of the different coatings. A thermal sprayed NiCrBSi, Electrodeposited Ni-SiC, <b>Rubber</b> <b>lining,</b> and a 3 -layer organic epoxy coating was tested. Through the test program there were possible to see a trend of the performance of each coating. The thermal sprayed and the electrodeposited coating showed positive adhesion properties, but negative properties in corrosion and impact resistance. The two organic coatings; <b>rubber</b> <b>lining</b> and epoxy coating showed good properties in all the tests. In the impact test at - 65 degree C the <b>rubber</b> <b>lining</b> became brittle and lost the adhesion to the substrate resulting in large damage. The 3 -layer epoxy coating is the best solution for protection of the axles. There are no modifications of the substrate surface, and the adhesion is good. Coating 4 performs well in the salt spray test. The impact resistance of the coating is excellent. The coating had consistently the best performance throughout the test program, and are therefore the chosen coating system...|$|E

40|$|A {{prefabricated}} building was designed in 1965 by the Committee for Antarctic Buildings and built in 1966 at Syowa Station. This building is of box-frame structure, {{which can be}} easily assembled in short time for multi-purpose establishment in the Antarctic area, such as sleeping quarters, mess hut, laboratory, etc. Therefore, even expedition members without any experiences in such construction are able to put it together. With the said building, thickness of the panel and its weight are exceptionally much more {{than those of the}} standard type, since the building is expected to accommodate deep frozen food as a cold storage. Of course, there is no changes in basic design. The outline of this building for cold storage is as follows : [table] Each panel contains insulation material of 100 mm thick which is sandwiched by water-proof plywood. Exterior surface of the panel is covered with stainless steel sheet and in-terior is lined with vinyl resin coated steel sheet. This {{prefabricated building}} has the following features : 1. For the jointed part of each corner of the structure, the unique prefabricated Lshaped corner-wall is employed. Since it is manufactured under a standard size, other components of the establishment, such as roof, floor, and side-wall can also be standardized. Besides, such tightly fastened prefabricated corner completely eliminates the fundamental weakpoint that has been unavoidable so far withstanding shock and tortion. 2. As for the jointing method of two panels, a long sized bolt of 13 φ is tightly screwed across the both adjacent frames, thus the surface of the both frames being tightly put together each other. In this method, only the bolting at two points in a panel substitutes for the traditional connecting method that is less endurable against shock and tortion. 3. Each jointed surface of the panel is finished with foamed chloroprene rubber, so that the gaps at the jointed surface can be completely eliminated. This foamed <b>rubber</b> <b>lining</b> has another merit that the elasticity of the rubber makes the errors characteristic to the assembly of the customary prefabricated structure practically ignorable...|$|E

The logo for the company boasted the car as being [...] "Valveless, Gearless, and Clutchless" [...] which was indeed true. The engine for the first vehicles was an air-cooled 3-cylinder [...] "porcupine head" [...] two cycle engine which the owner needed to prepare a mixture of fuel and oil in order to run. The vehicle's transmission was a friction drive, consisting of a flat spinning flywheel mounted on the engine which was set at right angles to a <b>rubber</b> <b>lined</b> steel drive wheel which slid from side to side on a drive shaft mounted in parallel to the rear axle. Sprockets {{on the end of the}} drive shaft relayed power to the rear wheels via a pair of chains, one per wheel. The friction drive was prone to slippage due to environmental conditions (water) and if the rubber drive wheel was allowed to rest against the spinning flywheel for a long period of time it would develop a flat spot which would produce an uneven power transfer. The transmission was infinitely variable, however, allowing the user to simply progressively slide the rubber covered wheel from a neutral position at the center of the flywheel to a position closer to the edge of the flywheel to vary the gear ratio.|$|R

50|$|Polymers for example, can be {{attacked}} by aggressive chemicals, and if under load, then cracks will grow by {{the mechanism of}} stress corrosion cracking. Perhaps the oldest known example is the ozone cracking of rubbers, where traces of ozone in the atmosphere attack double bonds in the chains of the materials. Elastomers with double bonds in their chains include natural rubber, nitrile rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. They are all highly susceptible to ozone attack, and can cause problems like vehicle fires (from <b>rubber</b> fuel <b>lines)</b> and tyre blow-outs. Nowadays, anti-ozonants are widely added to these polymers, so the incidence of cracking has dropped. However, not all safety-critical rubber products are protected, and, since only ppb of ozone will start attack, failures are still occurring.|$|R
