EPR experiments carried out on aqueous solutions of N-acyloxy-pyridinethione analogues like 1 (R = adamantyl, cyclohexyl) in the presence of h-cyclodextrin, demonstrated that photochemically produced alkyl radicals are involved in an adduct with beta-cyclodextrin which works as a cage preventing the interaction of such radicals with the medium.

30|$|Producing clay {{composites}} can {{be achieved}} by four methods: in situ interactive polymerization, in situ synthesis, melt intercalation, and solution intercalation. Researchers have applied suitable blending methods, such as shear, high pressure, centrifuge, and ultrasonication mixing, for producing a high performance composite. Ultrasonication {{is one of the most}} important methods for increasing intergallery spacing between silicate layers and dispersing them in the polymers. Ultrasound treatment can help in terms of easily achieving exfoliated clay structure and increasing d-spacing in comparison to non-sonicated samples [11, 12]. Furthermore, ultrasonication widely affects the polymer itself, and as a result, changes composite properties. Therefore, power and time of sonication are critical and should be seriously considered in composite preparations [13, 14, 15]. Acoustic cavitations, bubbles, and their collapses are the main reasons for chemical reactions (sonochemistry) and physical changes in the substances which are exposed to ultrasound radiation. Bubble violent explosion generates extreme temperatures and pressures inside the bubbles and solvent. So, the materials in the solvent are disintegrated and several highly reactive radicals would be generated. Several chemical reactions can occur between these active <b>radicals</b> and <b>substances</b> in the medium. Finally, more chemical bonds, like H and covalent bonds will be generated [14, 16, 17].|$|R

All showed reduced survival compared to control. The effect varied with the biochemical defect involved and the chain length of the pyrene fatty acid. Reduced survival was observed in cells deficient in plasmalogens (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata) and in cells deficient in peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (bifunctional enzyme deficiency), which accumulated pyrene-fatty acids. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy fibroblasts accumulated pyrene-fatty acids and showed increased UV sensitivity only when exposed to longer-chain pyrene fatty acids. UV radiation resistance was lowest in cells with combined impairment of plasmalogen synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy), suggesting that UV sensitivity correlates inversely with the ratio of plasmalogens to <b>radical</b> producing <b>substances.</b> Fibroblasts deficient in plasmalogens gained normal UV resistance when their plasmalogen levels were normalized by hexadecylglycerol.

40|$|BackgroundThere is {{increasing}} evidence that diabetic retinopathy {{is caused by}} the action of free radicals. Radical scavengers like vitamin C and superoxide dismutase (SOD) may influence the outcome and progression of diabetic retinopathy, but no systematic review of the literature has been published to examine this hypothesis. ObjectivesThe aim of the current research was to review the literature in a standard systematic way in order to assess the effects of vitamin C and superoxide dismutase on diabetic retinopathy in methodologically robust trials. Search strategyWe tried to obtain studies from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Selection criteriaOnly randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of vitamin C, superoxide dismutase or both in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy were considered. Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently read all abstracts, titles or both and wanted to assess risk of bias and to perform data extraction. Discrepancies were planned to be resolved by consensus or by the judgement of a third author. Main resultsA total of 241 publications were identified by the electronic searches. of these, 28 were identified as potentially containing information about the treatment of patients with diabetic retinopathy using vitamin C or SOD and were read in full. No trial evaluated the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with vitamin C or SOD. Authors' conclusionsNo research to date has adequately examined the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with vitamin C or SOD {{in such a way as}} to indicate whether this form of intervention has a significant impact on the progress of this clinical condition. the potential role of these substances in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy remains open to debate, and it is suggested that future research focusing on patient-oriented outcomes should address this important issue. Diabetic retinopathy or eye disease is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Laser therapy currently is the primary means in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. It nevertheless is a procedure which destroys important cells in the eye. There are theories that so-called free <b>radicals</b> (<b>substances</b> which are thought to be harmful to body tissues) might be influenced by new medications to prevent or slow down vision loss in people with diabetes. Preliminary studies with vitamin C and 'superoxide dismutase' suggest that they may have an important role in treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, our thorough search to detect sound clinical studies with these compounds did not identify any relevant trial. Future updates of this review may find important new information about this potentially hopeful new therapy.

Photochemical reactions lead to the formation of by-products that can exhibit different toxicological properties from the original compound. For this reason the photochemical behavior of the herbicide acifluorfen (5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of different solvents was studied. Photochemical reactions were carried out using a high-pressure mercury arc and a solar simulator. Kinetic parameters and quantum yields were determined. The identification of photoproducts was performed by mass spectrometry and [1 H] nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Nitrofluorfen, hydroxy-nitrofluorfen, 2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenol, 5 -trifluoromethyl- 5 '-nitrodibenzofuran, and other derivatives were identified. The photochemical reactions were also carried out in the presence of either a singlet or a triplet quencher, and in the presence of either a radical initiator or a <b>radical</b> inhibitor. <b>Substances</b> used as inhibitors of the excited levels T 1 and S 1 showed that photodegradation of acifluorfen begins from a singlet state S 1 through a pi,pi* transition. The role of free radicals in the photodegradation of acifluorfen was determined and a radical mechanism was proposed.

It {{was found that}} the presence of a small amount of MnII (0. 3 – 1. 2 mg/l) greatly increased the degradation rate of atrazine, with the formation of by-product compounds of a lower molecular weight and a greater polarity (as indicated by shorter retention times in HPLC chromatography). However, the presence of either bicarbonate or tert-butanol had a negative effect on the degradation of atrazine. With an increase of bicarbonate concentration, the oxidation rate of atrazine by MnII-catalysed ozone was substantially reduced and a correspondingly higher residual ozone was observed. In the presence of tert-butanol, greater reductions of the degradation rate of atrazine were observed and the decomposition of ozone was greatly retarded, resulting in a higher residual ozone; this was the case for either ozone oxidation alone or MnII-catalysed ozone oxidation. These results appear to confirm that the degradation of atrazine by ozone in the presence of MnII follows a radical mechanism. It is believed that MnII catalyses the decomposition of ozone through the formation of intermediate manganese species (such as MnIV), leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals.

50|$|Mechanisms {{that does}} not involve a carbocation {{intermediate}} may react through other mechanisms that has other regioselectivity that is not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as free radical addition. Such reactions {{are said to be}} anti-Markovnikov, since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction. Similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to propene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free <b>radical</b> ionizing <b>substances</b> such as peroxides. The explanation is that HBr produces a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction procedure less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. In this case the terminal carbon is a reactant which produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product, in the case of propene.|$|R

In the present study, the ability of melatonin (an antioxidative and immunoregulatory hormone) to protect against β-cell damage induced by streptozotocin (STZ; a diabetogenic and free <b>radical</b> generating <b>substance)</b> or IL- 1 β exposure was examined. In vitro, melatonin counteracted STZ- but not IL- 1 β-induced islet suppression, indicating that the protective effect of melatonin is related to interference with free radical generation and DNA damage, rather than NO synthesis. In vivo, non-immune mediated diabetes induced by a single dose of STZ was prevented by melatonin. Furthermore, the effects of proinflammatory cytokines were examined in islets obtained from mice with a targeted deletion of the iNOS gene (iNOS -/- mice) and wild-type controls. The in vitro data obtained show that exposure to IL- 1 β or (IL- 1 β + IFN-γ) induce disturbances in the insulin secretory pathway, which were independent of NO or PGE 2 production and cell death. Initially after addition, in particular IL- 1 β seems to be stimulatory for the insulin secretory machinery of iNOS –/- islets, whereas IL- 1 β acts inhibitory after a prolonged period. Separate experiments suggest that the stimulatory effect of IL- 1 β involves an increased gene expression of phospholipase D 1 a/b. In addition, the formation of new insulin molecules appears to be affected, since IL- 1 β and (IL- 1 β + IFN-γ) suppressed mRNA expression of both insulin convertase enzymes and insulin itself...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a new, {{low cost}} and easy method, {{hydroxyl}} radical trapping method, {{was employed to}} investigate the photo-activity of UV/TiO 2 photocatalytic reaction. The Taguchi method was utilized to optimize the preparation of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) thin-film reactor through the modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The optimal yield of hydroxyl radicals was then evaluated by calculating the conversion ratio of salicylic acid under the optimal conditions. in the experiments, salicylic acid {{was used as the}} free-radical scavenger and the formation of three different intermediates were examined to shed light on the trend and kinetics of reaction of hydroxyl <b>radical</b> with organic <b>substance</b> under different operation conditions. The results indicated that the yield of hydroxyl radicals increased with increasing irradiation intensity and dissolved oxygen level. The optimal experimental conditions obtained in this study were irradiation with intensity of 2. 9 mW cm(- 2) on salicylic acid at concentration of 250 mg L- 1 by both agitation and aeration processes (dissolved oxygen level = 8. 2 mg O- 2 L- 1) at pH 5. Such conditions could achieve the optimal hydroxyl radical yield of 5. 1 x 10 (- 17) M. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} body of experimental studies demonstrating the toxic effects of oxygen-derived free radicals. Evidence supports an important role for free radicals in ischemic injuries, inflammation, and chemical-induced tissue injury. Free radicals are involved in normal biochemical processes like oxidative reduction and cellular metabolism; however, they also mediate disease processes. The participation of oxygen free radicals in lysis of red cells is important in some situations of intravascular hemolysis. This article will review neutrophil-derived oxygen free radicals, emphasizing: (1) their effects on the erythro-cyte and (2) how these effects may be attenuated. Neutrophil-derived oxygen free <b>radical</b> generation Many <b>substances</b> are capable of activating neu-trophils to release reactive oxygen products, in-cluding bacteria and their constitutive compo-nents, the membrane activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), opsonized zymosan, immune com-plexes, chemotactic peptides derived from comple-ment components, and synthetic oligopeptides such as N-formyl-methionyMeucyl-phenylalanine [1 - 7]. When the neutrophil s activated, a series of meta-bolic activities is stimulated. Collectively, these changes are termed the "respiratory burst. " The respiratory burst is associated with increased oxy-gen uptake, NADPH production from the hexose monophosphate shunt, and the reduction of oxy-gen, forming superoxide anion (02) and H 20 2, The majority of oxygen consumed by the leuko-cytes is converted into superoxide anion or reactiv...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to achieve a fortifying product Apple, Quince and Sea Buckthorn Nectar rich in antioxidants (vitamin C, ?-carotene) and dietary fibers (cellulose, pectic substances) from fruit. In the experiments were used fruit (apples, quinces and sea buckthorn) with a high content of these nutrients. The antioxidants are chemical substances that inhibit, decompose or prevent forming of free <b>radicals</b> or other <b>substances</b> that induce the cancerogenesis. Also, dietary fibers are another group of natural compounds with important role in prevention of the digestive diseases. In the experiments were used biochemical methods for analysis of fruit and processed products (determination of soluble dry substance, glucides, proteins, lipids, mineral elements, total acidity, vitamin C, ?-carotene, cellulose, pectic substances etc.). Also were performed microbiological analysis and sensorial analysis for processed products. In order to obtain the product Apple, Quince and Sea Buckthorn Nectar, four variants of experiments were carried out at the laboratory level. Following the sensorial and biochemical analyses, the optimum variant of the product Apple, Quince and Sea Buckthorn Nectar was selected, namely the variant V 3 in which the ratio apple puree and quince puree was 1 : 1 and the percentage of added sea buckthorn juice was of 3 %...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to a high}} {{content of}} rutin (2 - 10 %), dried {{buckwheat}} leaf and flower (DBLF) formulations were shown to be efficient {{in the treatment of}} vascular diseases. In order to find a cost effective way for the extraction of antioxidants, the effects of ethanol/water ratio and temperature on the extraction efficiency of phenolic compounds and the mechanisms of antioxidant action of the extracts were tested. Extraction with ethanol/water mixture (80 : 20, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature, after the mixture was just brought to boil was demonstrated to be an efficient and cheap way for obtaining a high yield of rutin (49. 94 ± 0. 623 mg/g DBLF). The most abundant phenolic compounds in DBLF extracts were rutin and chlorogenic acid. Flavonoids, especially rutin, were shown to be the most responsible for the antioxidant activity in all investigated lipid model systems, acting as free <b>radical</b> scavengers, electron-donating <b>substances</b> and chelators of iron ions. In β-carotene bleaching tests, the extracts with the highest activity were as efficient as BHT (butylated hydroxytoluole). Regarding the results of antihemolytic and Schaal oven tests, the extracts demonstrated remarkable ability to inhibit the oxidative destruction of erythrocytes and to prolong the beginning of the oxidation process in sunflower oil.
