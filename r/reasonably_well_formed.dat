The northern branch is steeper and more rugged. The northern flank contains some particularly magnificent rain forests. The southern section of the track follows an early convict built road on Mount Keira, some of which is still visible.

40|$|Possible early {{events in}} protein folding may be studied by {{dissecting}} proteins into complementary fragments. Two fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 [CI 2 -(20 - 59) and CI 2 -(60 - 83) ] associate {{to form a}} native-like structure in a second-order reaction that combines collision and rearrangement. The transition state of the reaction, analyzed by the protein engineering method on 17 mutants, is remarkably similar to that for the folding of the intact protein [...] a structure that resembles an expanded version of the folded structure with most interactions significantly weakened. The exception is that the N-terminal region of the single alpha-helix (the N-capping box) is completely formed in the transition state for association of the fragments, whereas it is <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> <b>formed</b> for the intact protein. Preliminary evidence on the structures of the individual fragments indicates that both are mainly nonnative, lacking native secondary structure and having regions of nonnative buried hydrophobic clusters. The association reaction does not result from the collision of a subpopulation of two fully native-like fragments but involves a considerable rearrangement of structure...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice {{carrying}} the diphtheria toxin A gene driven by mouse γ 2 -crystallin promoter sequences manifest microphthalmia due to ablation of fiber {{cells in the}} ocular lens. Here we map ablation events in the lens by crossing animals hemizygous for the ablation construct with transgenic mice homozygous for the in situ lacZ reporter gene driven by identical γ 2 -crystallin promoter sequences. By comparing the spatial distribution of lacZ-expressing cells and the profile of γ-crystallin gene expression in the lenses of normal and microphthalmic offspring, the contribution of specific cell types to lens development were examined. The results suggest that phenotypically and developmentally distinct populations of lens fiber cells are able {{to contribute to the}} lens nucleus during organogenesis. We also show that dosage of the transgene and its site of integration influence the extent of ablation. In those mice homozygous for the transgene and completely lacking cells of the lens lineage, we show that the sclera, cornea, and ciliary epithelium are reduced in size but, otherwise, <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> <b>formed.</b> In contrast, the anterior chamber, iris, and vitreous body are not discernible while the sensory retina is highly convoluted and extensively fills the vitreous chamber. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. In {{this thesis}} we studied large-vocabulary {{continuous}} speech recognition. We considered the components necessary to realise a large-vocabulary speech recogniser and how {{systems such as}} Sphinx and HTK solved the problems facing such a system. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been a common approach to acoustic modelling in speech recognition in the past. HMMs are well suited to modelling speech, since {{they are able to}} model both its stationary nature and temporal e ects. We studied HMMs and the algorithms associated with them. Since incorporating all knowledge sources as e ciently as possible is of the utmost importance, the N-Best paradigm was explored along with some more advanced HMM algorithms. The way in which sounds and words are constructed has been studied extensively in the past. Context dependency on the acoustic level and on the linguistic level can be exploited to improve the performance of a speech recogniser. We considered some of the techniques used in the past to solve the associated problems. We implemented and combined some chosen algorithms to form our system and reported the recognition results. Our nal system performed <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> and will <b>form</b> an ideal framework for future studies on large-vocabulary speech recognition at the University of Stellenbosch. Many avenues of research for future versions of the system were considered...|$|R

40|$|As file {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} being deployed on ever larger systems with many cores and multi-gigabytes of memory, scaling the internal data structures of file systems has taken greater importance and urgency. A doubly-linked list is a simple and very commonly used data structure in file systems {{but it is not}} very friendly to multi-threaded use. While special cases of lists, such as queues and stacks, have lock-free versions that scale <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> the general <b>form</b> of a doubly-linked list offers no such solution. Using a mutex to serialize all operations remains the de-facto method of maintaining a doubly linked list. This severely limits the scalability of the list and developers must resort to ad-hoc workarounds that involve using multiple smaller lists (with individual locks) and deal with the resulting complexity of the system. In this paper, we present an approach to building highly concurrent data structures, with special focus on the implementation of highly concurrent doubly-linked lists. Dubbed "advanced doubly-linked list" or "adlist" for short, our list allows iteration in any direction, and insert/delete operations over non-overlapping nodes to execute in parallel. Operations with common nodes get serialized so as to always present a locally consistent view to the callers. An adlist node needs an additional 8 bytes of space for keeping synchronization information. The Data Domain File System makes extensive use of adlists which has allowed for significant scaling of the system without sacrificing simplicity...|$|R
