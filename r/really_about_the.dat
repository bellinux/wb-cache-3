You {{could argue that the}} film isn’t <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust, but about the {{generation}} that grew up in its shadow, which is what the book insists. But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it's about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} and second season, the search for Laura Palmer's killer served as the engine for the plot, and {{captured}} the public's imagination, although the creators admitted this was largely a MacGuffin; each episode was <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> interactions between the townsfolk. The unique (and often bizarre) personalities of each citizen formed a web of minutiae that ran contrary to the town's quaint appearance. Adding to the surreal atmosphere was the recurrence of Dale Cooper's dreams, in which the FBI agent is given clues to Laura's murder in a supernatural realm {{that may or may not}} be of his imagination. The first season contained only eight episodes (including the two-hour pilot episode), and was considered technically and artistically revolutionary for television at the time, and geared toward reaching the standards of film.|$|E

500|$|The Hustler is {{fundamentally}} {{a story of}} what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing. Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: [...] "My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused— and then he wins his pool game." [...] Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing The Hustler as [...] "one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen his moment, and this is his moment of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E

500|$|Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph {{lamented the}} eleven months that {{passed since the}} series seven cliffhanger, and stated that [...] "for all its square-jawed silliness and bonkers conspiracies, Spooks still {{delivers}} high-class escapism at its slickest, most glamorous and entertaining." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk felt that the episode's plot was [...] "mere background noise," [...] and that the series [...] "is about hilariously artificial encounters between the characters, clumsily manufactured dramatic tension, and a denouement involving someone being prevented {{in the nick of}} time from detonating something/killing somebody/triggering a global economic collapse." [...] Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman said that the plot was [...] "all gibberish," [...] but cited the episode was <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> return of Ruth, a development Mullaney praised, stating Ruth [...] "has been much missed since she was framed and sent into faked-death exile."

[...] Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after twenty years of nonstop touring and recording, and [...] "everybody needed some time." [...] The tour collected $15 million in box office before it even began, and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003. Due to [...] "extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand," [...] the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows, running between February and June 2004.

500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where it can go, you gotta let it go if {{you are not going to}} commit."

500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{midway through}} the twentieth century until 1969, {{ownership}} of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs <b>really,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E

500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there.
