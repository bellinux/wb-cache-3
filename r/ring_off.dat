25|$|Players are not {{permitted}} to carry the ring over the two blue lines; they can advance the ring over the line only by passing it to another player. The ring must be touched by any other player first, but {{does not need to be}} under control before the passer take possession again (e.g., the passer bounces the <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> a player's skate and then picks it up). If a player touches the ring consecutively on both sides of the blue line their team loses possession and the opposing team is given a free pass. If the ring goes over both blue lines, the team that passed it may not touch it until the opposing team does or attempts to get the ring.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Age of Middle-earth, {{the lords}} of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom to conquer them all, abandoning {{a great part}} of his power to it in order to dominate, through it, at a distance, the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final {{coalition}} of men and elves battle Sauron’s forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor cuts the One <b>Ring</b> <b>off</b> of Sauron's finger, thereby destroying his physical form. Unfortunately, Isildur decides {{to take care of the}} Ring himself, but the evil influence of the Ring corrupts Isildur, preventing him from destroying it in Mount Doom. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, found and owned by Gollum for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Saturday, May 5, Mayweather {{defeated}} Cotto in 12 rounds by a unanimous decision, improving his record to 43–0. Mayweather used movement and outboxed Cotto {{in the middle of}} the ring for the first few rounds. Beginning in rounds three and four Cotto cut the <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> from Mayweather, forcing the latter to fight from the ropes. However, Mayweather seemed to outfight Cotto from the ropes with his combinations and by rolling with most of Cotto's punches. Cotto had more success in the middle rounds, landing his jab and body shots on Mayweather and effectively trapping him on the ropes. The later rounds were controlled by Mayweather, who boxed more in the center of the ring late in the fight. In the 12th round Mayweather's uppercut stunned and hurt Cotto, but Cotto was able to fight until the end. The judges scored the fight a unanimous decision for Mayweather by scores of 118–110, 117–111, and 117–111. After the fight, Mayweather said Cotto was the toughest fighter he ever faced.|$|E
500|$|While {{trying to}} enjoy a book as he floats in a swim <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> a crowded beach, Goodman is {{interrupted}} by undersea adventurer Hammer Nelson, who invites Goodman to help him fight underwater crime. [...] Don Quixote-like, the overeager Nelson sees crime where there is none, interrupting swimmers and boaters at play. [...] The pair {{set out to find}} a Russian submarine—and find one, but Nelson mistakes it for a monster to be subdued with his speargun. [...] Goodman realizes Nelson's insanity, abandons the adventurer, and returns to his book.|$|E
500|$|Debra met Steve Williams, known {{on-screen}} as Stone Cold Steve Austin, in 1998; {{they moved}} in together in 2000. On September 13 of that year, they married at The Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, and she changed her name to Debra Williams. On June 15, 2002, police responded to {{a call to the}} couple's residence in San Antonio, Texas, and found Debra with bruises and a bloody nose. On August 14, the authorities arrested Austin and charged him with misdemeanor assault. He pleaded no contest on November 25 and received a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and an order to carry out eighty hours of community service. Austin filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, and the divorce was finalized on February 5, 2003. Marshall later auctioned her wedding <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> on eBay for $27,100 and donated a portion of the proceeds to [...] "Safe Place", an organization which assists the victims of domestic abuse.|$|E

500|$|O'Hara next {{played an}} {{unconventional}} {{role as a}} timid socialite who joins the army as a cook in Henry Hathaway's Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), which tells the fictional story of the first class of the United States Military Academy in the early 19th century. The film was disagreeable to O'Hara because Payne dropped out {{and was replaced by}} George Montgomery, whom she found [...] "positively loathsome". Montgomery attempted to make a pass at her during the production, prolonging his kiss with her after the director had yelled [...] "cut". Later that year, O'Hara starred opposite Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar and Anthony Quinn in Henry King's swashbuckler The Black Swan. O'Hara recalled that it was [...] "everything you could want in a lavish pirate picture: a magnificent ship with thundering cannons; a dashing hero battling menacing villains... sword fights; fabulous costumes...". She found it exhilarating working with Power, who was renowned for his [...] "wicked sense of humor". O'Hara grew very concerned about one scene in the picture in which she is thrown overboard in her underwear by Power, and sent a warning letter home to Ireland in advance. She refused to take her wedding <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> in one scene which resulted in screen adjustments {{to make it look like}} a dinner ring. Though the film was praised by critics and is seen as one of the period's most enjoyable adventure films, the critic from The New York Times thought O'Hara's character lacked depth, commenting that [...] "Maureen O'Hara is brunette and beautiful—which is all the part requires".|$|E
2500|$|When {{playing as}} Frodo, {{there are two}} meters on screen. One {{represents}} his health; the other represents his [...] "purity." [...] As soon as Frodo puts on the One Ring, he begins to draw the gaze of Sauron, and his purity begins to diminish. If the purity meter empties before he takes the <b>Ring</b> <b>off,</b> he will become corrupted, and the game will end. Once he removes the Ring, the meter will begin to fill again. [...] Gandalf also has two meters; health and magic spirit. As he uses magic, his spirit meter will begin to deplete. When it is empty, {{he can no longer}} cast spells. He can refill the meter by drinking miruvor. Aragorn has only one meter; his health bar.|$|E
2500|$|After Stalin's {{death from}} {{pulmonary}} edema {{brought on by}} the stroke, Beria's ambitions sprang into full force. In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to dart forward to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Sebag-Montefiore to [...] "wrenching a dead King's <b>ring</b> <b>off</b> his finger"). While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared [...] "radiant", [...] "regenerated", and [...] "glistening with ill-concealed relish." [...] When Beria left the room, he broke the somber atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva called [...] "the ring of triumph unconcealed." [...] Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. [...] "He's off to take power," [...] Mikoyan recalled muttering to Khrushchev. That prompted a [...] "frantic" [...] dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin.|$|E

2500|$|During the [...] "Blackest Night" [...] storyline, {{when the}} public learned that {{everyone}} who died are rising as undead Black Lanterns, Luthor isolates himself in his safehouse in fear that all the people he had murdered over the years would also reanimate and seek revenge on him. His fear is justified as his victims, including his deceased father, arrive, seeking to feast on his avarice-filled heart. However, Luthor escapes after receiving a power ring fueled by the orange light of avarice and becomes a deputy of the Orange Lanterns. Luthor arrives at Coast City and joins the battle against the Black Lantern Corps. Luthor engages battle with the Black Lantern versions of Superman and Superboy. However, the Agent Orange Larfleeze wants Luthor's <b>ring</b> <b>off,</b> as the alien {{does not want to}} share his power with him, resulting in them battling each other for it despite all of the dangers around them. Luthor is able to use the essences of all of the people he has killed as his own Orange Lanterns, and seeks to add Superman to their numbers. Luthor is quickly overwhelmed by his greed, and sets out to steal the rings of his fellow inducted Lanterns, taking Scarecrow's yellow ring and attempting to steal Mera's red one, but is held back by the Atom (wielding the ring-staff of the Indigo tribe) and the Flash wearing a Blue Lantern Ring. When deputy Violet Lantern Wonder Woman uses her magical lasso to restrain Luthor, under its spell of truth, Luthor is forced to confess that he secretly wants to be Superman. When Nekron is defeated, Larfleeze takes the ring from Luthor, leaving him powerless, and allows Luthor to remain on Earth with the Green Lanterns (although Sinestro notes {{that this is the first}} time Larfleeze has given anyone anything).|$|E
