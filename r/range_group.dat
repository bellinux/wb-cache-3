2500|$|The North <b>Range</b> <b>Group</b> is the basal {{unit for}} the Cuyuna Range. It {{is divided into}} three {{structural}} units: South Range (The rocks of the South Range are assigned to the Mille Lacs group.), North Range and the Emily District each with its own characteristic stratigraphy and structure. The rocks of the South and North ranges are separated by a major north-verging thrust fault, and both are overlain unconformably by the Emily District. The rocks of the North Range [...] assigned to the North <b>Range</b> <b>Group,</b> [...] are divided into three formations, the Mahnomen, Trommald and Rabbit Lake. The North Range of the Cuyuna Range was regionally metamorphosed during the Penokean orogeny, which peaked between 1,870 and 1,850 million years ago. The iron ore of the Cuyuna is a Lake Superior-type iron-formation similar to other iron formations in the region.|$|E

40|$|This {{post hoc}} {{analysis}} assessed the evidence behind common reimbursement practices by evaluating {{the relationship of}} body mass index (BMI) ranges (35 [*]kg/m(2)) with treatment effects of exenatide twice daily among patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients received exenatide twice daily added to insulin glargine in two 30 -week studies (exenatide twice daily vs insulin lispro, n[*]=[*] 627; exenatide twice daily vs placebo, n[*]=[*] 259). No association of baseline BMI with changes in efficacy variables was observed. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) reductions were significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and similar across BMI <b>range</b> <b>groups</b> in the lispro-comparator study and greater for exenatide versus placebo in the placebo-controlled study. Significant weight loss occurred with exenatide across BMI <b>range</b> <b>groups</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), while weight increased with both comparators. Achievement of HbA 1 c < 7. 0 % (< 53 [*]mmol/mol) without weight gain was greater for exenatide versus comparators. Systolic blood pressure decreased across BMI <b>range</b> <b>groups</b> with exenatide in the lispro-comparator study (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001); changes in lipids were not clinically meaningful. Minor hypoglycaemia was less frequent for exenatide versus insulin lispro. These findings suggest that BMI alone should not limit clinical decision-making or patient access to medication...|$|R
