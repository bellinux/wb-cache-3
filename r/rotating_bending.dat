In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> tests. For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> test rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> tests are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending specimens. Agreement is good, with the results from the <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side. Some factors which may contribute to these differences are the different type of loading and the simplified calculation of the stress intensity factor in the <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> tests. ...|$|E

S-N properties obtained in both <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> and axial loading were compared with each other. It was found that S-N curve in the axial loading appeared a little lower than that in the <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> due to the differences of stress distributions and critical volumes for both loading types.

In addition, the fracture surfaces of this alloy revealed very rough in the usual life region, whereas a characteristic smooth area was observed on the fracture surfaces of specimens failed in the surface inclusion-initiated fracture and in very high cycle regime.

40|$|The {{influence}} of secondary processing conditions on an aluminium {{metal matrix composite}}, comprising of an AA 2124 matrix and 3 Jlm particulate SiC reinforcement at 25 volume percent was investigated. The metal matrix composite (MMC) was extruded at three different temperatures, 350 °C, 450 °C and 550 °C, {{at a ratio of}} 20 : 1 and at three different ratios, 5 : 1, 10 : 1 and 20 : 1, at a temperature of 450 °C. It was subsequently solution heat treated and naturally aged. A mechanical property assessment was carried out using standard tensile and <b>rotating</b> <b>bend</b> fatigue test methods to determine the properties of the material extruded under each condition. A novel technique using a Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) Microscope was developed to prepare polished specimens and microtextural analysis was performed by FIB imaging. Additionally, techniques were successfully established, through the use of FIB milling and polishing, to provide site-specific electron transparent films, permitting detailed examination ofthe microstructure with a transmission electron microscope. Material extruded at 550 °C exhibited a lower yield strength than material extruded at 350 °C and 450 °C, which was attributed to grain coarsening and recrystallisation. Evidence of recrystallisation was found during texture analysis by X-Ray diffraction, where there was a reduction in the intensity of the fibre texture in the extrusion direction. The phenomenon was also observed during irticrostructural analysis work, where recrystallised grains at grain boundaries were observed. Higher extrusion ratios offered a small improvement in tensile properties, due to an enhanced fibre texture within the microstructure. Microtextural examination gave evidence of the existence of both high angle grain and low angle grain boundaries for the material extruded at 350 °C. It is believed that a subgrain structure was partially transformed during extrusion, through subgrain rotation, leading to the formation of high angle grain boundaries. This microstructure was found to offer the optimum mechanical properties. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|For multiaxially-loaded parts several stress-based fatigue {{assessment}} concepts are applicable mostly taking uniaxial test results as basis. These approaches {{work well in}} case of proportional loading states, but on contrary, for non-proportional stress conditions, implying a change of the principal stress direction, deviations in the fatigue life estimation may occur. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the cyclic multiaxial material behavior experimentally and to proof the applicability of stress-based methods to assess the fatigue strength. The investigated base materials incorporate the commonly applied crankshaft steels 50 CrMo 4 and 34 CrNiMo 6 without surface-layer post-treatments.

40|$|Abstract Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} is a {{degradation process}} of mechanical/tribological properties (toughness, wear etc.) of mating steel surfaces. This {{is caused by}} the presence and interaction of hydrogen with applied stresses. Therefore, it is important to quantify the hydrogen content which could be dissolved under applied stresses in steel. Water contamination of lubricants is often considered as a reason of hydrogen embrittlement of rolling bearings. Thus the effect of water and %RH (relative humidity) on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of steel was studied experimentally under different operating conditions. Two types of steels were used, that are silver steel and AISI- 52100 ball bearing steel. The testing conditions used in various tests, were percent relative humidity (%RH), temperature, <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> stresses, uni-axial tensile stress, rolling and sliding in combination with <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> stresses. As a first task, the hydrogen content was quantified in as-received specimens of bearing steel. The spread of hydrogen content was measured in radial and axial directions of the as-received bearing steel bars. This was done to show the importance of the internal hydrogen embrittlement effects of the initial hydrogen content. Sample melting technique (SMT) was used to quantitatively analyze the total content of hydrogen in all specimens using a hydrogen analyzer. In addition to this, Elastic Recoil Detection Technique (ERDT) was employed to qualitatively analyze the local hydrogen content distribution in soft and hard AISI- 52100 bearing steel. Secondly, the influence of applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen content into respective steel specimens was studied. A <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> set up was used through a lathe machine. Water was used as a source of hydrogen charging of the testing samples in all <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> tests. The influence of <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> stresses on the absorption of hydrogen was studied in silver steel and in bearing steel bar samples. Further, a universal fatigue testing machine was used to study the effect of cyclic released uni-axial tension on the absorption of hydrogen in the bearing steel. Similarly, the influence of Sliding and Rolling on the absorption/desorption of hydrogen content was studied in combination of <b>rotating</b> <b>bending</b> stresses using the same lathe machine. Mild and water quenched silver steel bar specimens were used to study the influence of quenching and applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen. Finally, the experiments were conducted on SKF- 624 deep groove ball bearing (DGBB) under isolated operating environment. Non water absorbing grease was used as lubricant. Tests were run for 10 % of L 10 life of deep groove ball bearing. Two different amplitudes of pure radial loading were selected for testing under high and low relative humidity of the operating environment. Total content of hydrogen was measured in the inner ring, outer ring and 7 -balls of DGBB (deep groove ball bearing) using the hydrogen analyzer. Results are presented for total dissolved (or absorbed) hydrogen content in various components as a function of bearing shaft revolutions and operating conditions. Results obtained revealed a dependence of total content of hydrogen on the number of inner ring shaft revolutions. Hydrogen seems to accumulate in the specimens with the increase of number of stress cycles or shaft revolutions...|$|E

Twists occur in quiescent flagella in both the presence and absence of spoke heads, indicating that spoke–central pair interactions are not needed to generate torque for twisting. Central pair orientation in propagating bends was also similar in wild type and spoke head mutant strains, thus orientation is a passive response to bend formation.
