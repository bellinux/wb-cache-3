5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. <b>Rest</b> <b>periods</b> are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E

Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E

5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had the good fortune to become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During <b>rest</b> <b>periods,</b> the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of varying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> between {{consecutive}} ambulatory bouts in community-based outcomes. Ambulation was assessed in 97 community-dwelling older adults (mean (SD) age 69. 2 (7. 7) years) using an accelerometer (activPAL™) worn on the upper thigh for 7 consecutive days. The volume, pattern and variability of ambulation were calculated over a range of maximum <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> (1 – 30 s). Outcomes with a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 1 to 6 s did not vary due to device functionality. Non-linear regression (power law, r 2 > 0. 99) showed that increasing the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> from 6 to 30 s resulted in changes in volume (increased duration spent walking, and decreased number of bouts), variability (S 2 increased) and pattern (α decreased), and a linear relationship with an increase in average bout length. With a MRP of 6 s, 6 % of the cohort achieved the public health guidelines of 150 min of ambulation/week accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min, which increased to 40 % using a maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 30 s. Modifying the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> impacts on volume, pattern and variability measures of community based ambulation, and attainment of public health guidelines. This highlights the need for standardised algorithms to aid interpretation and explicit reporting of the maximum <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> to aid comparison between studies...|$|R

40|$|Prosthetic {{migration}} {{has been}} identified as a marker for future revision of cemented total hip reconstructions. This could be tested at a pre-clinical stage with dynamic loading experiments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of <b>resting</b> <b>periods,</b> which are a considerable part of the daily activity cycle, on the migration characteristics of femoral cemented stems. Ten polished Exeter stems were implanted in composite femurs and loaded either with a continuous load or a discontinuous load. Continuous loading involved 345, 600 loading cycles at 1 Hz, whereas the discontinuous loading involved loading at 1 Hz for 2. 5 hours and a <b>resting</b> <b>period</b> of 21. 5 hours for a period of four days. Hence, a total of 36, 000 loading cycles were applied to these reconstructions. The subsidence patterns of the prostheses were considerably affected by the <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> The prostheses exhibited a step-wise migration pattern with migration steps of about 50 microns after every <b>resting</b> <b>period,</b> whereas the continuously loaded prostheses showed a more gradual migration pattern. The final subsidence of the specimens when loaded with <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> was significantly less than the subsidence measured without <b>resting</b> <b>periods.</b> However, these specimens were loaded with fewer loading cycles. If this was taken into account, the discontinuously loaded specimens had a four fold higher average migration per loading cycle than the specimens that were loaded continuously. In conclusion, the <b>resting</b> <b>periods</b> had a considerable effect on the migration patterns, which should be realized when these stems are analyzed with pre-clinical tests...|$|R
