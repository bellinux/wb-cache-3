40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the economic feasibility of production and commercialization project of Hay Enriched Extruded (HEE) as a complete diet for horses. The study was based on survey data and quotation activities involving price from the land preparation (<b>repair,</b> <b>planting</b> and fertilization) to the processing of the product at the factory (extrusion) and marketing. Transportation costs and taxes were also considered. Discounted Cash Flow (30 years) was {{used to calculate the}} profitability indicator and the Profit and Loss Statement (PLS). Calculations were developed using Microsoft Office Excel® spreadsheets. Three production scenarios were simulated with different consumer prices: Scenario 1 - equivalent to the complete diet, where the ingredients are supplied together, but purchased separately; Scenario 2 - Considering a value 10 % higher than the complete diet; Scenario 3 - Considering a value 20 % higher than the complete diet. We observed that the project was economically viable in the three suggested scenarios with positive Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return greater than 9. 4 % and payback of 11 to 2 years. The results enable us to conclude that the product may be a promising investment for both product quality and ease of use as the rapid return on invested capital...|$|E
