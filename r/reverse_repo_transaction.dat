5000|$|In a repo {{the party}} B {{acts as a}} lender of cash, whereas the seller A is acting as a {{borrower}} of cash, using the security as collateral; in a <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> (A) is the lender and (B) the borrower.A repo is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer (effectively the lender or investor) receiving securities for collateral to protect himself against default by the seller. The party who initially sells the securities is effectively the borrower. Many types of institutional investors engage in <b>repo</b> <b>transactions,</b> including mutual funds and hedge funds. [...] Almost any security may be employed in a repo, though highly liquid securities are preferred as they are more easily disposed of {{in the event of}} a default and, more importantly, they can be easily obtained in the open market where the buyer has created a short position in the repo security by a <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> and market sale; by the same token, non liquid securities are discouraged. Treasury or Government bills, corporate and Treasury/Government bonds, and stocks may all be used as [...] "collateral" [...] in a <b>repo</b> <b>transaction.</b> Unlike a secured loan, however, legal title to the securities passes from the seller to the buyer. Coupons (interest payable to the owner of the securities) falling due while the repo buyer owns the securities are, in fact, usually passed directly onto the repo seller. This might seem counterintuitive, as the legal ownership of the collateral rests with the buyer during the repo agreement. The agreement might instead provide that the buyer receives the coupon, with the cash payable on repurchase being adjusted to compensate, though this is more typical of sell/buybacks.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> {{is simply}} the same {{repurchase}} agreement from the buyer's viewpoint, not the seller's. Hence, the seller executing the transaction would describe it as a [...] "repo", while the buyer in the same transaction would describe it a [...] "reverse repo". So [...] "repo" [...] and [...] "reverse repo" [...] {{are exactly the same}} kind of transaction, just being described from opposite viewpoints. The term [...] "reverse repo and sale" [...] is commonly used to describe the creation of a short position in a debt instrument where the buyer in the <b>repo</b> <b>transaction</b> immediately sells the security provided by the seller on the open market. On the settlement date of the repo, the buyer acquires the relevant security on the open market and delivers it to the seller. In such a short transaction, the buyer is wagering that the relevant security will decline in value between the date of the repo and the settlement date.|$|R

50|$|LAF {{is used to}} aid {{banks in}} {{adjusting}} the day to day mismatches in liquidity. LAF helps banks to quickly borrow money in case of any emergency or for adjusting in their SLR/CRR requirements. LAF consists of <b>repo</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> operations. Repo or repurchase option is a collaterised lending i.e. banks borrow money from Reserve bank of India to meet short term needs by selling securities to RBI with an agreement to repurchase the same at predetermined rate and date. The rate charged by RBI for this transaction is called the repo rate. Repo operations therefore inject liquidity into the system. <b>Reverse</b> <b>repo</b> operation is when RBI borrows money from banks by lending securities. The interest rate paid by RBI {{in this case is}} called the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate. <b>Reverse</b> <b>repo</b> operation therefore absorbs the liquidity in the system. The collateral used for <b>repo</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> operations are Government of India securities. Oil bonds have been also suggested to be included as collateral for Liquidity adjustment facility. In LAF, money transaction is done via RTGS(Real time Gross settlement). (RTGS is an online money transfer method).|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate is {{the rate at}} which banks can park surplus funds with reserve bank.

In this monetary policy statement, {{it has been}} decided that the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate would not be announced separately but will be linked to <b>repo</b> rate. The <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate will be 100 basis points below repo rate. The liquidity adjustment facility corridor, that is the excess of <b>repo</b> rate over <b>reverse</b> <b>repo,</b> has varied between 100 and 300 basis points. The period between April 2001 to March 2004 and June 2008 to early November 2008 saw a broader corridor ranging from 150-250 and 200-300 basis points respectively.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a considerable {{growth in the}} market for repurchase agreements (RPs), both in terms of daily activity and in the numbers and types of par-ticipants in the market. Many years ago RPs, or “repos” as they are frequently called, were used primarily by large commercial banks and government securities dealers as an alternative means of financing their inventories of government securities, but their use has expanded substan-tially in recent years. RPs are now used regularly by a variety of institutional investors in addition to banks and dealers, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) uses <b>repo</b> <b>transactions</b> to implement monetary policy directives and to make investments for foreign official and monetary authorities. This article describes RPs and their principal uses and discusses the factors influencing the growth and development of the RP market over the past few years. What is a Repo? A standard repurchase agreement involves the acquisi-tion of immediately available funds through the sale of securities with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase the same securities on a date certain within one year at a specified price, which includes interest or its equivalent at an agreed upon rate. 1 <b>Repo</b> <b>transactions</b> have many characteristics of secured lending arrangements in which the underlying securities serve as collateral. Under this characterization, the sale of securities under an agreement to repurchase is a type of collateralized borrowing and represents a liability to the “seller, ” reflecting the con-tractual obligation to transfer funds to the “buyer ” on the final maturity date of the agreement. A reverse RP (technically a matched sale-purchase agreement) is the mirror image of an RP. In a <b>reverse</b> <b>repo,</b> securities are acquired with a simultaneous commitment to resell.

Methodology of the study is based on literature review, data and case study analysis. In this paper, we aim to define inefficiencies of Turkish repo markets to develop policy suggestions in the light of early liberal era experience of Turkey and also financial failure lessons. In this context, we conclude three suggestions for policy makers.

50|$|In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses <b>repo</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> to {{increase}} or decrease money supply in the economy. The {{rate at which the}} RBI lends to commercial banks is called the repo rate. In case of inflation, the RBI may increase the repo rate, thus discouraging banks to borrow and reducing the money supply in the economy. As of June 2017, the RBI repo rate is set at 6.25% and the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate at 6.00%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>Repo</b> rate is {{the short}} term {{borrowing}} rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. The Reserve bank uses this tool when it feels {{there is too much}} money floating in the banking system. An increase in the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate means that the banks will get a higher rate of interest from RBI. As a result, banks prefer to lend their money to RBI which is always safe instead of lending it others (people, companies etc.) which is always risky.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to using repo as a funding vehicle, repo traders [...] "make markets". These traders have been traditionally known as [...] "matched-book repo traders". The {{concept of a}} matched-book trade follows closely {{to that of a}} broker who takes both sides of an active trade, essentially having no market risk, only credit risk. Elementary matched-book traders engage in both the <b>repo</b> and a <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> within a short period of time, capturing the profits from the bid/ask spread between the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> and repo rates.

50|$|The {{underlying}} security for many <b>repo</b> <b>transactions</b> {{is in the}} form of government or corporate bonds.

25|$|However, {{even after}} sidelining CRR as an instrument, {{there was still}} less {{liquidity}} and skewedness in the market. And thus, on {{the recommendations of the}} Narsimham Committee Report (1998), The RBI brought together a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). It commenced in June, 2000, and it was set up to oversee liquidity on a daily basis and to monitor market interest rates. For the LAF, two rates are set by the RBI: <b>repo</b> rate and <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate. The repo rate is applicable while selling securities to RBI (daily injection of liquidity), while the <b>reverse</b> <b>repo</b> rate is applicable when banks buy back those securities (daily absorption of liquidity). Also, these interest rates fixed by the RBI also help in determining other market interest rates.|$|R

5000|$|Repo rate is {{the rate}} at which RBI lends to its clients {{generally}} against government securities. Reduction in Repo rate helps the commercial banks to get money at a cheaper rate and increase in Repo rate discourages the commercial banks to get money as the rate increases and becomes expensive. <b>Reverse</b> <b>Repo</b> rate is {{the rate at}} which RBI borrows money from the commercial banks. The increase in the Repo rate will increase the cost of borrowing and lending of the banks which will discourage the public to borrow money and will encourage them to deposit. As the rates are high the availability of credit and demand decreases resulting to decrease in inflation. This increase in <b>Repo</b> Rate and <b>Reverse</b> <b>Repo</b> Rate is a symbol of tightening of the policy.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Repo</b> <b>transactions</b> {{occur in}} three forms: {{specified}} delivery, tri-party, {{and held in}} custody (wherein the [...] "selling" [...] party holds the security during the term of the repo).

The first form—specified delivery—requires the delivery of a prespecified bond at the onset, and at maturity of the contractual period. Tri-party essentially is a basket form of transaction, and allows for a wider range of instruments in the basket or pool. In a tri-party <b>repo</b> <b>transaction</b> a third party clearing agent or bank is interposed between the [...] "seller" [...] and the [...] "buyer".
