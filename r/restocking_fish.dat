50|$|The case {{preceding}} this Supreme Court {{case was}} {{decided in the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals. This court heard Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, in 2006 and decided the case in 2007. Then-Circuit Judge Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the court. In this decision the court stated {{that in order to}} meet the statute facilities could not use restoration enhancements (<b>restocking</b> <b>fish,</b> restoring habitat, etc.) to meet the National Performance Standard (NPS). Additionally, the court remanded the case to the EPA for clarification of EPA rules regarding NPS determination by CBA and the use of a variance for facilities claiming excessive costs to implement mandated technology. And most importantly to this case, the court decided that a CBA is not consistent with the requirement or using the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact. The statutory language requires the EPA's selection of BAT be driven by technology. Cost can only be used to determine if remediation can be reasonably borne by the industry and determining the specific technology that meets the standards at the lowest cost. Thus suspending this aspect of Phase II as stated above.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} problem of an {{integrated}} management of fisheries by using fish farming {{as a tool for}} <b>restocking</b> <b>fish</b> populations depleted by overfishing pressure. We first use a simple heuristic dynamic model, taken from a classical example of mathematical bioeconomics, in order to prove that fish restocking may be an efficient tool for sustainable fishery management in situations where excessive fishing effort is going to cause irreversible stock collapse. Then we propose a two-compartments bieconomic mathematical model, with age structure and age specific harvesting and restocking, to mimic integrated interactions between aquaculture and open sea fisheries, where reared fish are used as substitutes for marine catches. The model proposed in this paper tries to fill a gap between the rich mathematical bioeconomic literature, mainly devoted to the description of open sea fisheries and/or marine protected areas, and the very poor literature on mathematical bioeconomic modeling of interactions between fish farming and fisheriesdynamical systems, bioeconomic models, fisheries, Livestock Production/Industries, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, C 62, Q 22,...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{non-native}} crayfish species in Europe, focusing mainly on the Czech Republic. The main species of interest was the signal crayfish. Its biology in relation to invasive spreading was evaluated. The most recent list of its known populations in the Czech Republic was compiled. These data were subsequently compared, updated and enriched with new locations based on this field monitoring. Its occurrence was evaluated largely in the Vysočina Region, in the area of Velké Meziříčí. As it turned out, the center of the signal crayfish occurrence in the Czech Republic is located really in the area of its original introduction thirty years ago in our country, {{in the vicinity of the}} Velké Meziříčí. During that time, signal crayfish have successfully expanded into the surroundings waters, both naturaly (downstream and upstream migration) and with human aid (with <b>restocking</b> <b>fish,</b> direct distribution by the public). It occupied all possible types of habitats, from running waters of the two major rivers Balinka and Oslava to their tributaries creeks of different size and character. It found suitable living conditions also in some ponds, particularly those less intensively farmed. Signal crayfish was recorded in areas, where noble crayfish Astacus astacus is still relativelly widely present, in some place even forming sympatric populations. The work was also focused on epibionts Branchiobdella sp., their presence or absence on caught crayfish. Their occurance was also recorded and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} whether the <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> of a species, which {{is confined to}} an estuary, perform {{as well as its}} wild stock, and has estimated their contribution to the commercial fishery and egg production. The biological characteristics of the 2001 and 2002 year classes of Acanthopagrus butcheri, which had been cultured and introduced into the Blackwood River in south-western Australia at seven and four months old, respectively, were thus determined from samples collected regularly between 2002 and 2014. The <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> could always be distinguished from the wild stock because their otoliths retained the pink colouration of the alizarin complexone with which they had been stained prior to release. Detailed analyses demonstrated the growth and maturity schedules of <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> were only slightly inferior to those of the wild stock and the mean gonad weights of the females of these two groups did not differ significantly in any month. As increasing numbers of restocked A. butcheri attained the MLL of 250 mm for retention, their contribution to the commercial fishery increased from 6 % in 2005 to 74 % in 2010. That contribution subsequently declined to 39 % in 2012 and 10 % in 2014, due predominantly to the introduction of the very strong 2008 year class in the commercial catches, the first substantial recruitment into the population since 1999. <b>Restocked</b> <b>fish</b> were estimated as contributing ~ 55 % to the eggs produced in 2008, suggesting that substantial numbers of the 2008 year class were derived from spawning by <b>restocked</b> <b>fish.</b> The results of this and a previous genetic study imply that restocking is an effective and appropriate way for replenishing stocks of an estuarine species such as A. butcheri, especially as its recruitment is highly episodic...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} whether <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> {{of a species}} perform {{as well as its}} wild stock, and has estimated their contribution to the fishery and egg production. Approximately 220, 000 juvenile Acanthopagrus butcheri, whose otoliths were stained purple with alizarin complexone, were released into the Blackwood River Estuary in 2002 / 03. The purple stain in their otoliths was still clearly visible in 2014. Data on the biological characteristics and annual contributions to the small commercial fishery of restocked and wild stock A. butcheri were analysed. The growth of <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> was only slightly less than that of the wild stock and the differences between their maturity schedules were relatively small. As increasing numbers of restocked A. butcheri attained the MLL of 250 mm for retention by the commercial fisher, their contribution to the fishery increased progressively from 6 % in 2005 to 74 % in 2010.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{replenish}} a heavily depleted population of Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri, in 2002 - 03, 220, 000 4 - 8 month old juveniles of this species, cultured using broodstock from the Blackwood River Estuary, were released into this system. During subsequent monitoring by Potter et al. (2008) over the next 3. 5 years, <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> were readily able to be distinguished from wild A. butcheri because their otoliths contained a purple stain (alizarin complexone) {{that had been used}} to mark all cultured fish before release. The results of that monitoring program showed that the restocking had led to a substantial increase in the abundance of A. butcheri in the estuary. Their biological comparisons, using data for <b>restocked</b> and wild <b>fish</b> collected in 2002 - 05 and also data for wild fish collected in the two years leading up to the restocking, appeared to indicate that cultured individuals did not grow as well, or mature as rapidly, as wild fish. As the monitoring of the study of Potter et al. (2008) ended in 2005 when the oldest of the restocked A. butcheri were still young (about 4 yrs), the extent to which <b>restocked</b> and wild <b>fish</b> would differ in their growth and reproductive performance as they became older could not be determined by that study. Furthermore, as the <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> were only beginning to become large enough to be legally caught and retained by fishers, it was also not known whether <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> would substantially contribute to catches of A. butcheri in the Blackwood River Estuary. Moreover, the genetic consequences of the restocking program, and their implications for the ongoing conservation of A. butcheri in the estuary, had not been investigated. In this study, additional samples of A. butcheri from the Blackwood River Estuary have been obtained from the catches of a commercial gillnet fisher in 2006, 2007 and 2009, resulting in a full data set for fish spanning 2000 - 09. Analyses of biological data revealed that, since the restocking, the growth of wild A. butcheri has changed, with the lengths at a given age of fish hatched in more recent years typically being least. A comparison of the data for the 2001 and 2002 cohorts of <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> with corresponding data for wild individuals hatched in 2001 and 2002 showed that the <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> grew more similarly to wild fish than previously thought, with the difference becoming less than 5...|$|R

40|$|Acanthopagrus butcheri was restocked in an estuary {{in which}} it had become depleted. The <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> were cultured in 2001 and 2002 using {{broodstock}} from that estuary. These fish, whose otoliths had been stained with alizarin complexone, were released into the estuary and their biological performance tracked for seven to eight years. The 2002 cohort, introduced at circa four months old in autumn, survived far better than the 2001 cohort, introduced at circa seven months old in winter, when freshwater discharge peaks and temperatures are low. While <b>restocked</b> <b>fish</b> matured and grew nearly as fast as wild fish, the increase in density {{was accompanied by a}} reduced growth of wild fish. Genetic comparisons, using seven microsatellite loci, demonstrated that the expected heterozygosity and relatedness of restocked and wild A. butcheri, which is naturally characterized by low levels of genetic polymorphism, were similar. Although culturing did not demonstrably increase the level of inbreeding, it did result in the loss of some rare alleles. The biological and genetic results, together with the contribution of restocked A. butcheri to the commercial catch for this species in the estuary rising to 62 - 74 % by 2007 - 2010, demonstrates the efficacy of using restocking to replenish depleted A. butcheri stocks...|$|R

Subsequent monsoon-associated debris flows severely altered the stream channel structure within and downstream of the burned area and reduced or extirpated local populations of fishes.
