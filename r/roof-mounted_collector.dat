40|$|Report {{describes}} {{system which}} meets 64 percent {{of hot water}} requirements of 120 room motel. Key system components include 1, 000 square foot, <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>collector</b> array, 1, 000 gallon storage tank, tube-in-shell heat exchanger, and three domestic hot-water tanks. Report contains calibration instructions for differential temperature controllers, shutdown procedures, and operation guidelines, performance analysis, and manufacturers' maintenance literature...|$|E
40|$|Report {{describes}} solar modular domestic-hot-water and space-heating system {{intended for}} use in small single family dwelling where <b>roof-mounted</b> <b>collectors</b> are not feasible. Contents include design, performance, and hardware specifications for assembly, installation, operation, and maintenance of system...|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive guy wires support <b>roof-mounted</b> solar-energy <b>collectors.</b> Mounting system withstands 120 mph winds with no roof penetrations. Collectors {{circulate}} 50 percent {{ethylene glycol}} solution eliminating need for drain system for freeze protection. Heat exchanger transfers energy to {{domestic hot water}} which heats to 140 F...|$|R
50|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has {{developed}} a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting. This design uses a <b>roof-mounted</b> light <b>collector,</b> large-diameter optical fiber, and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables. Essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting.|$|R
40|$|Report {{describes}} {{heating and}} cooling system which furnishes 90 percent of annual heating load, 70 percent of cooling load, and all hot water for two-story building. <b>Roof-mounted</b> flat-plate <b>collectors</b> allow three distinct flow rates and are oriented south for optimum energy collection. Building contains fully automated temperature controls is divided into five temperature-load zones, each with independent heat pump...|$|R
50|$|Grosvenor Place holds a 4 NABERS energy rating. Sunshades {{provide the}} primary energy saving measure and {{eliminate}} sky glare. The sunshades are angled {{depending on their}} orientation to the sun. Other sustainability features include high performance thermal glass to minimise heat transfer, <b>roof-mounted</b> solar <b>collectors,</b> a large off-peak powered thermal energy storage plant that meets all tenancy day time demands, sustainable LED lighting technology and a 6,000 litre rainwater tank.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} homes and small {{apartment}} buildings have demonstrated combining a large internal water tank for heat storage with <b>roof-mounted</b> solar-thermal <b>collectors.</b> Storage temperatures of [...] are sufficient to supply both domestic hot water and space heating. The first such house was MIT Solar House #1, in 1939. An eight-unit apartment building in Oberburg, Switzerland was built in 1989, with three tanks storing a total of [...] that store more heat than the building requires. Since 2011, that design is now being replicated in new buildings.|$|R
40|$|Sunlight {{supplies}} 39 {{percent of}} heat load, saving 9 barrels of fuel oil in one heating season. Report describes system installation in two-story, single-family residence. Energy is collected with <b>roof-mounted</b> air flat-plate <b>collectors,</b> stored in rock bin, {{and transferred to}} water preheat tank whenever system is storing energy; heat pump supplies heat to house...|$|R
40|$|Image {{processing}} {{procedures for}} calculating {{the energy that}} <b>roof-mounted</b> solar <b>collectors</b> can potentially supply in a metropolitan area are presented. Satellite multispectral imagery from which land cover types can be determined digitally was sampled in order to estimate the percentage of land area occupied by flat or south-facing roof tops in residential and commercial/industrial areas. Procedures were applied to the various power subdistricts of the western San Fernando valley of California, and {{it was found that}} on the average 120 % of the existing power demand could be met if only half the useable rooftop area were utilized, amounting to 385 MW of peak power and indicating the applicability of solar cells to power generation in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{builders}} {{have shown}} considerable interest in combining {{the features of}} active and passive solar space heating systems into a hybrid system employing active collection and some form of passive discharge/storage device. We examined the performance and economics of a hybrid. air-based, residential system using 18. 5 m of <b>roof-mounted</b> air <b>collectors</b> and a hollow-core slab that discharges directly to the space by radiation and convection. In addition to space heating, the system provides domestic hot water heating and summer cooling by night venting of the slab. The system {{is assumed to be}} installed in a fairly "t. jght" new huse with a floor area of 140 m and 7 m of south-facing glazing...|$|R
