50|$|Between May 1 and July 13, 1931 the Hungarian National Bank {{paid out}} 200 million pengős {{in gold and}} foreign exchange. At the same time Hungary’s foreign debt reached 4,300 million pengos with {{interests}} costing 300 million pengos a year. With the gold and foreign exchange reserves virtually depleted, the gold cover of the pengős fell from 40% to 20%. By the summer of 1931 the National Bank no longer maintained enough foreign exchange to continue making interest payments. The government suspended the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> and ended the payment of interest in foreign exchange on long-term foreign debts. In response to the economic crisis Hungary faced, foreign creditors agreed to temporarily suspend debt payments.|$|E
40|$|The {{ports and}} harbors of Japan are {{operated}} by local public bodies {{that act as}} port authorities. The systems for constructing port facilities are roughly classified into two types depending on their sources of revenue. In the first type of system (used mainly for channels, breakwaters, berths, etc.), the national government and the port authority share the cost of construction. In {{the second type of}} system (used for cargo handling facilities, reclaimed lands etc.), the port authority raises funds by itself through a port-related bond-financed project, under which it issues bonds. One characteristic of such bond-financed projects is that the costs of operating the facility and redeeming the bonds are funded through usage fees for the cargo terminal and profit from the sale of reclaimed land. The authors first described Japan’s port facilities and the structure of port and harbor management, and analyzed the financial situation of port authorities. Next, the authors pointed out that as the capital, maintenance, and management costs of port facilities grow in response to the new risks of large-scale natural disasters and other factors, port authorities are being forced to take measures to address this. Lastly, using the example of Hakata Port, the authors argued that incentive assistance to shipping companies and logistics companies could effectively address the conflicting demands of reinforcing international competitiveness, strengthening disaster restoration capabilities, and enabling the smooth <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> in bond-financed projects. Based on the above analysis, the authors propose that facility usage fees and land prices be reduced through incentive subsidies as a measure to reduce the deficits of port authorities. This will enable the early <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> and an increase in local tax revenue, since a greater number of businesses can be attracted, as shown in the case study of Hakata Port...|$|E

The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and the Republicans endorsed the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> war <b>bonds</b> either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The Democrats wanted to redeem the bonds with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to analyze the allocation of fund proceeding from the bond issuance, to analyze the provision of sinking funds for the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bond,</b> and to analyze the financial performances of BPD Jatim. The primary data was collected by interviewing with the financial analyst of PT.

This study finds that the bond issuance fund was allocated entirely for the employees consumption loan purpose. The provision of the sinking funds for the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bond</b> at the maturity date is projected to be sufficient. It is found that through the bond issuance, BPD Jatims financial performance would be better off.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the building was paid for, at least partially, by the issuance <b>of</b> <b>bonds.</b> In June 1981, George Foster, who owned the Ginger Blue Resort in the nearby McDonald County community of Ginger Blue, found in the resort's attic one <b>of</b> these <b>bonds,</b> dated June 19, 1871, that offered a face value of $100, plus 10 percent annual interest. When accounting for the interest over 110 years, the value was estimated at $3,574,636.84.

25|$|The {{mortgage}} bonds were {{a way for}} {{the bank}} to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bonds</b> with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. When prices rebounded and stabilized at 92–96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99–102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow Land Bank had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution <b>of</b> 1905, the <b>bond</b> price dropped to 68 rubles. After the revolution, the market recovered and in early 1913 Vilnius Land Bank had 146.5 million rubles worth <b>of</b> mortgage <b>bonds</b> outstanding. In 1913 they traded at an average of 86 rubles.|$|R
50|$|Until late 2014 {{there existed}} eight undated gilts, which {{made up a}} very small {{proportion}} of the UK government's debt. They had no fixed maturity date. These gilts were very old: some, such as Consols, dated from the 18th century. The largest, War Loan, was issued in the early 20th century. The <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> these <b>bonds</b> was {{at the discretion of}} the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the outstanding amounts were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War Loan, would be redeemed in early 2015. The last four remaining gilts, with coupons of 2.5% or 2.75%, were redeemed on 5 July 2015.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prolific}} author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, {{was the first}} to refer to dedicated portfolios as “cash matching” portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond portfolio immunization. In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of “duration” for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the coupon payments and <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bond</b> and links changes in interest rates to the volatility <b>of</b> a <b>bond’s</b> value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the “average period.” In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration <b>of</b> the <b>bonds</b> held in a portfolio to the duration <b>of</b> liabilities those <b>bonds</b> would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the “weighted-average time period.” None of these earliest researchers cited each other’s work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.|$|R
50|$|Not all of Frizer's {{business}} dealings were honest. In 1593, collaborating with Nicholas Skeres (who was also present at Marlowe's killing), {{he was involved}} in lending money to one Drew Woodleff. Woodleff signed a bond for £60 in exchange for some guns that Frizer supposedly had in storage. Frizer then claimed to have sold them on Woodleff's behalf, but for only £30. The effect of this was that Frizer, who had never offered any guns for sale, had made Woodleff a loan of £30, to be repaid by the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> the £60 <b>bond,</b> an interest rate of 100%. Woodleff later signed a bond for £200 in favour of Thomas Walsingham, agreeing the forfeit of land to him in default of payment, to extricate himself from his bond to Frizer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{yield to}} {{maturity}} (YTM), book yield or <b>redemption</b> yield <b>of</b> a <b>bond</b> or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the internal {{rate of return}} (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond will be held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments will be made on schedule. Yield to maturity is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the price <b>of</b> the <b>bond.</b> The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualised yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest); [...] thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 × 1.05 = 1.1025.|$|R
40|$|The Social Security {{trust funds}} are {{projected}} to become exhausted in 2033, according to the 2013 Social Security Trustees Report. If Congress does not act before then, the trust funds {{would be unable to}} pay full Social Security benefits on time. The Social Security Act does not specify what would happen to benefits if the trust funds became insolvent. However, it is clear that full Social Security benefits could not be paid on time because the Antideficiency Act prohibits government spending in excess of available funds. After insolvency, Social Security would continue to receive tax income, from which approximately 77 % of benefits could be paid. Either full benefit checks would be paid on a delayed schedule or reduced benefits would be paid on time. In either case, Social Security beneficiaries and qualifying applicants would remain legally entitled to full benefits and could take legal action to claim the balance of their benefits. Social Security solvency could be restored by cutting Social Security’s spending, increasing its income, or some combination of the two. Over the long range (i. e., over the next 75 years), the Social Security trustees estimate that the trust funds have a shortfall of $ 9. 6 trillion in present value terms, or 2. 72 % of taxable payroll. The sooner Congress acts to fill this gap, the smaller the changes to Social Security need to be, because earlier changes could be spread to a larger number of workers and beneficiaries {{over a longer period of}} time. If Congress waits until the moment of insolvency to act, the trust funds’ annual deficits could be eliminated with benefit cuts of about 23 % in 2033 that will gradually rise to about 27 % by 2087. Congress could also eliminate annual deficits by raising the Social Security payroll tax rate from 12. 40 % to 16. 1 % in 2033, then gradually increasing it to 17. 2 % by 2086. To maintain annual balance after 2086, larger benefit reductions or tax increases would be required. Prompt action to restore Social Security solvency would be advantageous. The combined trust funds began to run annual cash-flow deficits in 2010. Cash-flow deficits require the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> government <b>bonds</b> accumulated in earlier years. Cash-flow deficits do not affect Social Security directly. However, if the non-Social Security portion of the federal budget is in deficit, <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> trust fund <b>bonds</b> puts additional pressure on the overall federal budget. Earlier changes would allow workers and beneficiaries time to adjust their retirement plans. Finally, if Congress were to act today, the benefit cuts or tax increases necessary to restore solvency until 2087 would be smaller than those needed if Congress waited until the trust funds became insolvent to act...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{identifies}} {{a number}} of key areas of economic modernization - modernization of property, modernization of financial system, modernization of regional governance and modernization of social sphere. The problems that arise in these areas and their solutions are noted. Disclosure of modernization of the real sector of the economy is made. Mechanisms of technological renovation and restructuring, the sources of the rapid modernization of public production are defined. Modernization of property includes: mass privatization of state property, aimed at its commercial use and creation of favorable economic environment for small business development. Modernization of the financial system must follow the path of reducing the tax burden on business and increasing the role of banks (assets of the banks should not be less than 150 % of GDP). Technological upgrade in the real sector will allow raising productivity by 2 - 3 times in the next 7 - 10 years, to halve energy intensity of GDP, to create material conditions for manufacturing of innovative products. The restructuring will help diversify the economic structure and exports, create competitive advantages for taking leading position in the field of aerospace engineering, production and export of electricity and electric machine manufacturing products, production of finished goods made from synthetic materials of forest products over time to become the world's leader. A prerequisite condition of rapid modernization are doubling investment rate on the basis <b>of</b> large-scale privatization, <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> government <b>bonds,</b> formation <b>of</b> the Russian market funds of "long" money (funded pensions, insurance, mutual funds and development of banking system) ...|$|R
40|$|Evidence on the {{magnitude}} of risk aversion is essential in understanding the behavior of asset prices. Both the equity premium puzzle and the credit spread puzzle {{address the problem of}} a reasonable size of agents’ risk aversion. The estimation of risk aversion is, however, impeded by the fact that observed prices depend on risk preferences and probability beliefs. The market for German redemption lottery bonds (Tilgungsanleihen) constitutes an exceptionally clean environment to study investors’ risk preferences independent of subjective probability beliefs as the probabilities of price changes caused by redemption lotteries are objectively known. The focus of this thesis is to analyze the systematic <b>redemption</b> risk <b>of</b> lottery <b>bonds.</b> Our contribution to the literature is twofold. On the theoretical side, we develop a fully specified dynamic equilibrium model to price redemption lottery bonds. On the empirical side, we employ the valuation model to estimate implied risk aversion coefficients from transaction prices <b>of</b> German lottery <b>bonds.</b> Our most important findings are threefold: estimated relative risk aversion coefficients are significantly positive, of moderate magnitude, and time dependent...|$|R
