It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and asked if she were there, and if he might come in. The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed, and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in French and English.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the statistically significant differences, if any, in computational skills proficiency and attitude toward arithmetic among Chapter 1 [...] eligible elementary school pupils resulting from two different remediation programs in elementary mathematics. ^ The subjects of the investigation included 200 pupils in grades 2 to 6 from three public elementary schools in an urban school district. The pupils were divided into two groups [...] a control group which received remediation through the school district 2 ̆ 7 s <b>regular</b> <b>approach</b> and an experimental group which received remediation through a commercial approach known as Prescription Learning. ^ The study was conducted for one school year. An ex post facto design was used to examine the results. Posttest measures of computational skills proficiency were provided by Achievement Development Scale Scores on the computation section of the California Achievement Tests (Form A, 1970). Posttest measures of attitudes were provided by the Dutton Attitude Toward Arithmetic Survey (1962). The results of the posttests were analyzed by analysis of variance to determine whether there were any statistically significant differences between the control and experimental groups. ^ The findings revealed a statistically significant difference in computational skills proficiency in favor of the experimental treatment for primary pupils in grades 2 and 3. However, since the final N for this group was relatively low, these findings were considered tentative. There were no significant differences in computational skills proficiency between the control and experimental groups for the intermediate pupils in grades 4 to 6 and there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in attitude for either the primary or intermediate subjects. ^ The findings led to the following conclusions: (1) The Prescription Learning remediation approach is tentatively considered more effective for improving computational skills proficiency at the primary level. (2) Further studies should be pursued with primary grades children to determine whether these findings are replicated. (3) The Prescription Learning approach has no effect beyond the <b>regular</b> <b>approach</b> on computational skills proficiency at the intermediate grades level. (4) The Prescription Learning remediation approach has no effect beyond the <b>regular</b> <b>approach</b> on attitude toward arithmetic. ...|$|E
