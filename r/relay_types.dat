40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for multimedia services {{has led to}} the extensive use of fixed wireless outdoor networks, where the transmitted information signals arrive to the final destination through a relay node, creating a dual-hop transmission. Due to the increased demand for bandwidth and the spectral congestion at low frequencies, operation at frequencies above 10 GHz satisfying the Line-Of-Sight condition is required. At this frequency range, the dominant fading mechanism exposing spatial and temporal stochastic properties is rain attenuation, typically modeled as a lognormal flat fading channel when expressed in dB (log-lognormal in linear scale). In this paper, the outage performance of a dual hop system using several radio <b>relay</b> <b>types</b> is presented and physical prediction models with analytical formulas are proposed, employing spatially correlated lognormal fading channels.

40|$|There {{has been}} some concern that, as nuclear power plants age, {{protective}} measures taken to control and minimize the impact of fire may become ineffective, or significantly less effective, and hence result in an increased fire risk. One objective of the Fire Vulnerability of Aged Electrical Components Program is to assess the effects of aging and service wear on the fire vulnerability of electrical equipment. An increased fire vulnerability of components may lead to an overall increase in fire risk to the plant. Because of their widespread use in various electrical safety systems, electromechanical relays were chosen to be the initial components for evaluation. This test program assessed the impact of operational and thermal aging on the vulnerability of these relays to fire-induced damage. Only thermal effects of a fire were examined in this test program. The impact of smoke, corrosive materials, or fire suppression effects on relay performance were not addressed in this test program. The purpose of this test program was to assess whether the fire vulnerability of electrical relays increased with aging. The sequence followed for the test program was to: identify specific <b>relay</b> <b>types,</b> develop three fire scenarios, artificially age several relays, test the unaged and aged relays in the fire exposure scenarios, and compare the results.

40|$|A {{generalized}} relay {{identification method}} is proposed {{in this paper}} for time delay and non-minimum phase processes. A distinct merit of the proposed method is that the process gain can be uniformly derived from a single run of the relay test, independent of the <b>relay</b> <b>type</b> being unbiased or biased. An analytical relay response expression is derived for assessing the process response under an unbiased or biased relay test. A frequency response algorithm is also derived for estimating the multiple frequency response points of the process. By categorizing cases of the model parameters to be identified, the corresponding identification algorithms are developed using fitting conditions established for the process response at the oscillation frequency. Based on the improved estimation of multiple frequency response points, a recursive least-squares identification algorithm is then proposed for obtaining further enhanced fitting accuracy over a user specified frequency range, e. g., the low frequency range often concerned in practical controller tuning. Illustrative examples from the recent literature are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
