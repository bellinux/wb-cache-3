40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an omnidirectional-vision-based {{localization}} and mapping system which can detect whether a <b>robotic</b> <b>mower</b> {{is contained in}} a permitted area. We exploit a robot-centric mapping framework that exploits a differential equation of motion of the landmarks, which are referenced {{with respect to the}} robot body frame. The estimator in our system generates a 3 D point-based map with landmarks. Concurrently, the estimator defines a boundary of the mowing area with the estimated trajectory of the mower. The estimated boundary and the landmark map are provided for the estimation of the mowing location and for the containment detection. We validate the effectiveness of our system through numerical simulations and present the results of the outdoor experiment that we conducted with our <b>robotic</b> <b>mower...</b>|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Design, Manufacturing and Production ManagementInternational audienceConsidering {{the rapidly}} {{expanding}} market for mowing robots to homeowners the noticeable {{question that arises is}} {{what are the}} safety-guided design requirements that could be applied to production management via safety standards? Standardization attempts to protect human during the interaction with this device. It makes an effort to confine residents by implementing more legible guidelines. There is no correct or incorrect list of hazards, only a list that customers and designers agree that is necessary to be handled. However, the requirements may differ in the design stage. All the design requirements shall be included in the physical system design of the <b>robotic</b> <b>mower.</b> In this paper, the authors believe that it is essential to put forward a comprehensive and systematic list of corrective or preventive measures in order to provide a safety checklist throughout the design stages of robot use.

40|$|Problem Knowledge is {{becoming}} ever more vital in today’s economy and organisations are realising {{the need to}} act on the advantages it provides. Knowledge is complex and contradictory, making it difficult to be created and managed by organisations. Purpose The purpose of this research is to see how knowledge is created and subsequently managed within an environment characterised by progress and innovation, and to identify the most problematic areas in knowledge creation processes as well as suggest improvements. Method Overall, qualitative methods were used in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted with management level within three product development units, two of these were only used for support to the third and main case, <b>Robotic</b> <b>Mowers.</b> Issues of trustworthiness and ethical implications were confronted in order to provide the most advantageous method to conduct the study. Result Knowledge creation at <b>Robotic</b> <b>Mowers</b> originates from both external and internal sources. The most important external source and activity to create knowledge are suppliers/consultants and the most important internal sources is the use of tests. Further, the unit has a highly informal approach to the creation of knowledge and the management of it. Support to knowledge creation is mainly found in cultural aspects. Conclusion The unit’s knowledge creation is dependent on informal and unstructured interaction among group members and to external parties. Overall, low managerial control is exercised and the group has developed a strong culture that enhances informal ways of knowledge creation and its management. The main problem of knowledge creation is that the group fails to realise a long-term need, which is revealed through inadequate efforts in trying to turn tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{navigating}} an autonomous agent based on the textures present in an environment. Specifically, the autonomous agent in question {{is that of a}} <b>robotic</b> lawn <b>mower.</b> If we can successfully differentiate the textures of the cut and uncut lawn surfaces, then we can track the boundary between them and mow in a pattern as a human would. The system uses the wavelet transform as the basis to perform texture analysis. The wavelet transform extracts meaningful features from the input images by breaking the image into different frequency subbands. Different subbands will isolate different features in the input image. In this way, we can generate a frequency signature of the image. After performing the wavelet transform, we perform a post-processing stage on these resulting features in an attempt to make them more acceptable to our classifier. These processed features are then grouped into vectors and then classified. The result is a clustered image based on texture. Once we have the image segmented based on the textures present in the image, we then determine the boundary between them by use of a boundary detection algorithm. In this way we can give a <b>robotic</b> lawn <b>mower</b> the ability to track this boundary and mow as a human would mow. While we avoid the actual implementation of this algorithm on a real platform due to the hazardous nature of lawn mowing in general, we do show how this algorithm can be easily adapted to the task of sidewalk tracking. In this alternate task, the robot tracks the boundary {{on both sides of the}} sidewalk, giving the robot the ability to follow the sidewalk. In doing so we not only show the adaptability of our algorithm to another task but also show its implemention on a mobile robot platform. 1...|$|R
40|$|To study {{experimentally}} {{the interactions}} of the Radio Duty Cycling (RDC), MAC and Routing over Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocols for wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) a test facility is being built {{in the garden of}} a countryside house because observations will be easier to interpret far from potentially disturbing radio transmitters and from reflecting structures causing multi-path interferences. The facility consists in a WSAN, with a dozen static motes, positioned all over a 1000 m 2 lawn, one mobile mote, affixed on a <b>robotic</b> lawn <b>mower,</b> and one gateway mote, located near a veranda, where computers and test equipment are housed. The position and the transmission power of the static motes should force the RPL routing algorithm to select as many as possible multi-hop routes. As a survey of the relevant literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] did not provide sufficient practical data to implement this last requirement, we undertook themselves a practical study of radio links,inspired by the experimental work reported in [5] and [6], but using modern motes available on today’s market. We believe some of our observations can be useful for anybody designing a WSAN. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
5000|$|A {{lawn mower}} (mower) is a machine {{utilizing}} {{one or more}} revolving blades to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by {{the design of the}} mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by muscle, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically one cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; [...] "walk-behind" [...] mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled [...] "walk-behind" [...] types, or more often, are [...] "ride-on" [...] mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it. A <b>robotic</b> lawn <b>mower</b> ("lawn-mowing bot", [...] "mowbot", etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own, or less commonly by an operator by remote control.|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots, such as vacuum {{cleaning}} robots and <b>robotic</b> lawn <b>mowers,</b> {{have become part}} of our daily lives. While they work fully autonomously in well-defined environments, the demand for mobile robots in unstructured and unforeseeable areas, such as search-and-rescue scenarios or planetary exploration, is growing. These robots are not required to have full autonomy, but should rather be tools which support researchers or rescue workers by providing information about a remote environment. For this, they should offer basic autonomy functions, for example obstacle avoidance or autonomous returning. Robots for such tasks often have to be small and agile, which prevents them from carrying heavy sensors and batteries, and thus also limits their computational resources. Therefore, the implemented autonomous capabilities have to work efficiently. This thesis focusses on the task of robot homing, which is the ability of a robot to return to its starting position after moving away. Since the method should work in unknown, unstructured terrain, it is divided into a local navigation task, which aims at detecting and avoiding obstacles, and a global navigation task, which uses only bearing angles to landmarks to memorize and retrace a path. The method is applicable to ground-based robots equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a stereo camera, an omnidirectional camera and odometry sensors. Local obstacle avoidance is accomplished by creating a moving geometric grid map of the immediate surroundings of the robot. For this, the robot computes disparity images from the stereo image pairs and combines them to a dense grid map using the robust and accurate pose estimates obtained by fusing IMU data, visual odometry measurements and robot odometry data. From that, the robot estimates the traversability of the terrain and computes a cost map, which it uses to plan safe paths in a given direction. In contrast, no metric distance information is required for the global path learning and homing task. Instead, the robot only records landmark bearing angle configurations at certain locations along its path. The landmark observations are stored hierarchically by their degree of translation invariance in an efficient and scalable, novel data structure called Trail-Map (Translation Invariance Level Map). For retracing this path back to the home position, the robot computes homing vectors by comparing the current landmark configuration with the stored reference configuration. By combining the local and global navigation approach, a visual homing method for unstructured terrain is achieved, which has very low memory requirements and offers runtimes constant with respect to the length of the traversed path...|$|R
