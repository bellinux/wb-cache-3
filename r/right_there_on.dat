500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody".|$|E
500|$|Of {{working with}} Stewart and The-Dream, Lopez stated that: [...] "What I love about great {{producers}} and writers {{is that they}} can take you and transport you right into this moment, but not change you. And that's what I feel like Tricky and Dream did with this record. They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still {{very much a part of}} who I am and will always be, and they put it <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody. Shetler particularly noted the lyric [...] "Our love could run the world" [...] as a good example of the optimism in the song.|$|E
500|$|On April 9, 2005, Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson {{were cast}} as the goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. Johnson, who was {{starring}} in the Canadian television series Instant Star (2004–2008), had auditioned to play Wendy's sister Julie; that role later went to Amanda Crew, who originally auditioned to play Erin. Johnson said that she wore a rocker jacket during her second reading and was in a bad mood. As she was leaving, the filmmakers called her back to read for Erin, with the dialogue in her scene being sarcastic. Johnson thought that her dry sense of humor, which the filmmakers caught, helped her land the role. Regarding his role, Lemche said that Ian [...] "spouts some interesting facts {{that seem to be}} just <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the tips of his fingers". Lemche researched most of Ian's information. During read-throughs, he often asked Morgan about Ian's facts; to help him, Morgan wrote Lemche notes and gave him URLs to research the information Ian gives out.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{critics call}} Fear and Loathing Thompson's {{crowning}} achievement in gonzo journalism. For example, {{journalist and author}} Mikal Gilmore said the novel [...] "feels free wheeling when you read it [...] it doesn't feel accidental. The writing is <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> the page — startling, unprecedented and brilliantly crafted". Critics believe that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{should be considered a}} work of gonzo journalism because the characteristics of gonzo journalism are all characteristics seen in the novel.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E

2500|$|The filmmaker defended {{himself in}} an {{interview}} with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: [...] "Actually I do [...] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name <b>right</b> <b>there</b> saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> <b>right</b> up <b>on</b> the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point.

60|$|He walked {{straight}} down Oneida Street {{and along the}} Main Street just {{as hard as he}} could go. There was only one purpose in his mind,--suicide.

60|$|Yet when {{after those}} few {{unpleasant}} moments of hesitation Lambert boldly accepted {{the situation and}} with much simple dignity took his seat at the table, everyone immediately accepted him as an equal, nor did anyone question his <b>right</b> to sit <b>there</b> <b>on</b> terms of equality with Lord Walterton or Sir Michael Isherwood.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{most of the}} Squirrels {{material}} has been, technically speaking, cover versions, they {{are by no means}} a typical cover band. They have a theatrical stage sense derived from Alice Cooper and The Tubes (for a while in the mid-1990s, their stage paraphernalia included a working guillotine), and an approach to arrangements that Morgan has described as [...] "&hellip; the Frankenstein method of song arrangement&hellip; 'Well, we like these verses, but the chorus on that song is way better. So we'll just graft it <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> make a whole new beast.' We just start fooling around, and then we go 'Hey, this Alice Cooper song fits <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>there,</b> and to hell with the chorus.

[...] "It {{gives me the}} same feeling of pitiless force that the Atlantic does upon a cold, dark, winter day.

60|$|He was <b>right.</b> <b>There</b> <b>on</b> {{the rough}} {{planking}} {{of the carriage}} way lay the old pioneer, motionless, {{just as he had}} fallen not five minutes before.

His eyes were closed as if in sleep, and no sign of injury could be seen.|$|E
5000|$|John J. O'Connor at the New York Times wrote, [...] "A {{great deal}} of time and money has gone into this production, and it's <b>right</b> up <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the screen... The nagging problem at the heart of [...] "The Stand" [...] is that once the story settles early on into its {{schematic}} oppositions of good versus evil, sweet old Mother Abagail versus satanic Flagg, monotony begins to seep through the superstructure... Muddled, certainly, but Stephen King's 'The Stand' [...] is clever enough to keep you wondering what could possibly happen next." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{party was}} {{fortunate}} in obtaining immediate passage to Fort Get <b>There,</b> <b>on</b> St. Michael's Island, which is situated sixty {{miles above the}} entrance to the Yukon.

6000|$|Fifty {{yards or}} more {{down the slope}} we met. I showed him a great splotch of blood on a flat stone. [...] "We'll find him not far down," [...] I said. So we slid and crawled, and held to brush and rocks, {{following}} that bloody trail until {{we came to a}} ledge. From there I espied the bear lodged against a manzanita bush. He lay on his back, all four paws extended, and he was motionless. R.C. and I sat down <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the ledge.|$|E

They're dying, they're dying <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the rope, trying to crawl as a dying man would try to crawl away from a tiger that was eating him. And my Gawd!

6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{pretty soon}} they begun to pass us, driftin' {{down the river}} in canoes an' rafts. They was pullin' out. We kept track of them. When a hundred an' ninety-four had passed, we didn't see no reason for keepin' on. So we turned tail and started down. A cold snap had come, an' the water was fallin' fast, an' dang me if we didn't ground on a bar--up-stream side. The Blatterbat hung up solid. Couldn't budge her. 'It's a shame to waste all that grub,' says I, just as we was pullin' out in a canoe. 'Let's stay an' eat it,' says he. An' dang me if we didn't.
