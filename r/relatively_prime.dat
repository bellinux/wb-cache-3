40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new measure of tail risk spillover: the {{conditional}} coexceedance (CCX), {{defined as the}} number of joint occurrences of extreme negative returns in an industry, conditional on an extreme negative return in the financial sector. The empirical application provides evidence of significant volatility and tail risk spillovers from the financial sector to many real sectors in the U. S. economy from 2001 to 2011. These spillovers increase in crisis periods. The CCX in a given sector is positively related to its amount of debt financing and negatively related to its valuation and investment. Therefore, real economy sectors—which require relatively high debt financing and whose value and investment activity are <b>relatively</b> lower—are <b>prime</b> candidates for stock price volatility and depreciation {{in the wake of a}} financial sector crisis. Evidence also suggests that the higher the industry’s degree of competition, the stronger the tail risk spillover from the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|Amnesic {{patients}} have difficulties recognizing when stimuli are repeated, {{even though their}} responses to stimuli can change {{as a function of}} repetition in indirect tests of memory – a pattern known as priming without recognition. Likewise, experimental manipulations can impair recognition in healthy individuals while leaving <b>priming</b> <b>relatively</b> unaffected, and <b>priming</b> and recognition have been associated with distinct neural correlates in these circumstances. Does this evidence necessarily indicate that priming and recognition rely on distinct brain systems? An alternative explanation is that recognition is merely more sensitive to amnestic insults and experimental manipulations than is priming, and that both priming and recognition are produced by a single brain system. If so, then experimental manipulations would tend to drive priming and recognition in the same direction, albeit to a greater extent for one versus the other in some circumstances. We found evidence to the contrary – that manipulating study duration has opposite effects on priming versus recognition. Studying objects for one-quarter second led to worse recognition than studying objects for 2 [*]s, whereas the opposite was true for priming (greater for one-quarter-second study than two-second study). Furthermore, distinct electrophysiological repetition effects were associated with priming versus recognition. We therefore conclude that study duration had opposite effects on priming and recognition, and on the engagement of implicit versus explicit memory systems. These findings call into question single-process accounts of priming and recognition, and substantiate previous behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging dissociations between implicit and explicit memory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment that demonstrates syntactic priming in three- and four-year-old children, exploring the effect the relative frequency of a construction has on children‟s structural experience in language acquisition. We selected a priming paradigm {{in the form}} of a „snap‟ game in an attempt to elicit both forms of transitive and ditransitive alternations. While children have been shown to frequently produce both forms of the ditransitive alternation, the passive form of the transitive alternation is very infrequent in both children‟s own productions, and child-directed speech. Participants described a set of cards that depicted both transitive and ditransitive events after hearing the experimenter describe a lexically unrelated transitive or ditransitive event. We found priming for both children and our adult control group; however children showed stronger priming for the less frequent construct, while showing <b>relatively</b> weak <b>priming</b> for the more frequent ditransitive construct. Results provide further evidence for an implicit learning theory; children were more susceptible to priming of an infrequent structure and this effect was robust and increased over a significant period of time. Thus, frequency plays a significant role in children's experience during language acquisition...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} priming {{of visual}} search by repeated target location or color in two patients with left visual neglect and extinction, following strokes {{centered on the}} right inferior parietal lobe. Both patients, like the healthy controls we tested, showed intact priming, with performance speeded when either the location or color of a singleton target was repeated over successive trials in a standard search condition (Experiment 1). This was observed both from and to targets on the contralesional (left) side. Moreover, priming of search was still observed even when a return of fixation back to display-center was required between successive trials (Experiment 2). When briefer displays were used (Experiment 3), the patients often failed to detect left targets. This situation revealed an important dissociation: Whereas location priming only arose from preceding left targets that had been consciously detected, color priming (possibly arising within the intact ventral stream) did not depend on awareness of the preceding target. There was considerable color priming from missed targets. These findings demonstrate <b>relatively</b> intact <b>priming</b> of visual search by color and location in patients with right parietal damage, and also reveal that location priming may differ from color priming in requiring awareness...|$|R

40|$|Animal {{research}} has established that effects of hormones on social behaviour depend on characteristics of {{both individual and}} environment. Insight from research on humans into this interdependence is limited, though. Specifically, hardly any prior testosterone experiments in humans scrutinized the interdependency of testosterone with the social environment. Nonetheless, recent testosterone administration studies in humans repeatedly show that a proxy for individuals' prenatal testosterone-to-estradiol ratio, second-to-fourth digit-ratio (2 D: 4 D ratio), influences effects of testosterone administration on human social behaviour. Here, we systematically vary {{the characteristics of the}} social environment and show that, depending on prenatal sex hormone priming, testosterone administration in women moderates the effect of the social environment on trust. We use the economic trust game and compare one-shot games modelling trust problems in relations between strangers with repeated games modelling trust problems in ongoing relations between partners. As expected, subjects are more trustful in repeated than in one-shot games. In subjects prenatally <b>relatively</b> highly <b>primed</b> by testosterone, however, this effect disappears after testosterone administration.
