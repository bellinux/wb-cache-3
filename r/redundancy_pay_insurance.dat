40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{estimate}} {{the determinants of}} bargaining over <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay,</b> {{and its impact on}} employment variation and financial performance, using the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey. The estimates indicate that bargaining over <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> is more prevalent in plants with a strong union presence. However, voluntary negotiation of <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> does not appear to reduce employment variability in the face of small demand shocks. Bargaining over manual <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> has an insignificant impact on plants' financial performance, while bargaining over nonmanual <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> has a large significant positive effect. The authors' findings may explain the positive attitudes to <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> reported by some employers, and reinforce the general conclusion of cross-country studies that firing constraints in Britain may be relatively unimportant in preventing labor market flexibility...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a discussion on}} <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> in Australia. <b>Redundancy</b> is a situation wherein an employer does not want the job of an employee to be continued. Under redundancy, the fault is not from the employee. Factors that trigger redundancy include technological changes, outsourcing and corporate restructure. Before reforms to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, workers {{in the country are}} given <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay.</b> However, the Work Choices reforms eliminated <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> guarantees and ousted laws related to it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model of employment, non-statutory <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> and wage determination. An interesting {{feature of this}} model is that the contract curve is vertical. Some of the predictions of the model are confronted with the available British data on non-statutory firing costs, from the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey. The estimates indicate: first, that bargaining over <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> is more prevalent in plants with a strong union presence; second, that bargaining over <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> has no impact on recent employment variation for plants in the sample; and third, that financial performance is unaffected by manual bargaining, but is positively associated with non-manual bargaining.

40|$|Redundancy {{payments}} for collective dismissals {{are incorporated into}} a Shapiro-Stiglitz model of efficiency wages. It is shown that a fixed payment will lower wages, leave employment and welfare unaffected {{if there are no}} wage-dependent taxes, no additional firing costs and if unemployment benefits are not altered by redundancy payments. If payroll taxes exceed firing costs and unemployment benefits are independent of <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay,</b> employment and welfare will rise with redundancy payments. If these payments are also a function of previous wages, positive employment effects will be mitigated. A substitution of wage-dependent for lump-sum redundancy payments can lower employment, allowing for a continuous variation of effort. collective dismissal, efficiency wages, employment, <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay,</b> welfare...|$|R

40|$|Popular {{characterizations}} of union preferences {{assume that the}} income of laid-off union members is exogenous. There is evidence, however, of intra-union distribution schemes such as severance payments, unemployment insurance, retraining arrangements and early retirement schemes. This paper develops a model of wage and severance pay determination by a trade union and a firm bargaining in a right-to-manage framework. The important point differentiating the model in this paper from the orthodox union model {{is that it is}} efficiency-improving {{in the sense that it}} makes full-insurance possible and marginal productivity is equal to the opportunity cost of labour. Moreover, with <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> on the bargaining agenda, both the right-to-manage and the efficient bargaining union models are characterized by the same efficiency conditions. This has implications for empirical research which attempts to distinguish between these two models, since the outcome of both models is the same. Finally, the union-firm bargaining model can also be compared with the outcome of the implicit contract model with <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay.</b> There is an important difference between the two approaches, however. While the result in this paper derives from an imperfectly competitive labour market where unions and firms bargain over wages and <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay,</b> the implicit contract result derives from a perfectly competitive labour market in which competitive forces lead to an efficient outcome.
