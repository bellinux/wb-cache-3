5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{runs out}} to a supermarket parking lot where he witnesses a lawyer, Alistair Pepper (Richard Cox), being confronted {{by a man named}} Sammael (Rodney Eastman). Sammael <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and a bolt of lightning arcs from his fingers to strike Pepper dead; however, when Black reaches Sammael, he finds a pistol at the killer's feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
500|$|Behind the king, {{holding his}} hands to his head, is Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk (21), another {{opponent}} of the Constitution, known for being on a Russian payroll. Below him is another opponent of the Constitution, Antoni Złotnicki (22). An anonymous [...] black-clad French royalist (23) is shown looking terrified at the scene, seeing another revolution in the making. He <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over the king's head.|$|E
60|$|The next word failed on <b>his</b> lips; he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in {{the dead}} silence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and pointed over Miss Garth's shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Raising one's hands is an {{encouraged}} option. There {{are many}} hadith that describe how Muhammad <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> during du'a. Some hadith describe him having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> way up high in emergency situations. Many scholars agree {{that if it}} is not an extreme situation that Muhammad did not <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> above <b>his</b> head. The exact manner that many scholars in Islam describe how high the hands should be raised during a regular Du'a is up to the shoulders with palms placed together.|$|R
60|$|Just then Mabane {{broke loose}} from the man {{with whom he had}} been struggling, and rushed to Arthur's assistance. The Baron <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and shouted {{something}} in German. Instantly our assailants seemed to melt away. The Baron stepped on to the strip of lawn and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and {{he thought it would be}} a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|Between 4:00pm and 5:00am the {{following}} day, the Polish 10th Armored Division, Polish 19th Armored Division, Polish 4th Infantry Division and Polish 5th Infantry Division, totaling about 10,300troops and the Internal Security Corps {{under the command}} of Poplavsky entered Poznań. A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators. At 7:30am on June29 the Prime Minister arrived and infamously declared on the local radio station that [...] "any provocateur or lunatic who <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the people's government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off." ...|$|E
500|$|The dead {{rise from}} their graves around Michael's feet; some emerge to walk towards Heaven, others towards Hell. They are tiny {{compared}} to Christ and the saints. Lorne Campbell notes that these panels display a deeply pessimistic view of humanity, with the damned far outnumbering the saved, especially compared to Stefan Lochner's Cologne panel, where the saved crowd {{the entrance to}} Heaven. The dead undergo a gradual transformation as they move from panel to panel. The souls rising at Michael's feet show little expression, becoming more animated as they move to either side; horror and desperation become especially visible {{on the faces of}} the damned as they move towards Hell. On the left, the saved all have, according to Jacobs, [...] "the same beatific expressions", but their postures gradually change from facing Christ and Michael to looking towards Heaven's gate, notably with the couple below Mary– the man turns the woman's gaze away from Michael, towards Heaven. This contrasts with another couple on the opposite panel who face Hell; the woman is hunched over as the man <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in vain to beseech God for mercy.|$|E

6000|$|The {{master of}} the Boy Jim was seen to <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in reply to the salutation, and his voice came strong and cheerily over the sea, {{but he was too}} far off to be heard distinctly, so Billy <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> again by way of saying, [...] "All right, my boy!" ...|$|R

6000|$|FREDA turns {{slowly and}} looks up at SIR WILLIAM; he involuntarily [...] <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his mouth.

6000|$|He <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> forehead--his silk hat was on {{the table}} rim upwards; he had put it there with a despairing gesture as he came in--he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> forehead.

6000|$|MRS. JONES. No, Sir, I don't say that, sir. I think there's a {{great deal}} of good in him; though he does treat me very bad sometimes.

Not long ago he gave me a blow here [touches her breast] and I can feel it now. So I think I ought to leave him, don't you, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|Could {{you know}} the customs and the {{character}} of red Martians you would appreciate the depth of meaning that that simple act conveyed {{to me and to}} all about us who witnessed it.

60|$|But though I do {{not believe}} in {{exhibitions}} of God's anger, I do believe in exhibitions of his mercy. When men by their folly and by the shortness of their vision have brought upon themselves penalties which seem to be overwhelming, to which no end can be seen, which would be overwhelming were no aid coming to us but our own, then God <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> not in anger, but in mercy, and by his wisdom does for us that for which our own wisdom has been insufficient.|$|E
