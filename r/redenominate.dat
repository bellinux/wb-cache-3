50|$|In August 2010 Bank Indonesia {{proposed}} to <b>redenominate</b> the rupiah by truncating {{the last three}} zero digits (dividing by 1000). The redenomination is meant to simplify daily transactions, which often run into millions of rupiah. The plan under consideration would be completed by 2015 at the soonest, but more likely by 2020. It would reduce the exchange rate with the US dollar from about 13,500 rupiah to 13.5. The plan has raised public concern that the monetary policy may devalue the currency.

40|$|AbstractRedenomination, {{suddenly}} came {{up again}} in 2010, when the central bank of Indonesia announced their plan to <b>redenominate</b> rupiah currency up to three zeroes. Many questions came up, what {{is the impact of}} redenomination, or is it the same as sanering policy that happened in 1950. Although the governor of the central bank of Indonesia, Darmin Nasution has confirmed that redenomination is different with sanering, it still cause pro and contra. Many countries have already implemented redenomination, and many of them succeeded, but many of them fail. To make redenomination success the most important things are low inflation rate, stable economic growth, guarantee of price stability and good socialization to the society. The objectives of this study are to know the impact of implementing redenomination in Indonesia from Indonesia citizens’ perspective. The variable that is used in this study is only one, redenomination with 8 indicators. The sample data is taken from 100 peoples, who know what is redenomination. The results have been analyzed by using Structural Equation Modelling. The result shows that the greatest impact of redenomination according to Indonesia citizens is restoring the credibility of Indonesia (lambda loading = 0. 87), followed by that redenomination is favorable for Indonesian citizens (lambda loading = 0. 86) ...|$|E
40|$|On 14 th August 2007, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) {{through its}} {{governor}} made public its proposal to restructure and <b>redenominate</b> the naira by dropping two zeros or moving two decimal {{points to the}} left from the currency and issuing more coin denominations {{with a view to}} ensuring macroeconomic stability and efficient payment system. The announcement, which took many by surprise, generated a lot of debate among Nigerians and non-Nigerians within and outside the country. While some are of the view that the CBN deserves commendation for the bold step, others are condemning the entire proposal, yet another group try to synthesise the various views from political economy perspectives. Although, the scheme has since been suspended, stakeholders and observers continue to express their views and opinions about the desirability and timeliness of the policy. Accordingly, this paper appraises the suspended naira redenomination scheme in the light of its objectives. The paper is descriptive with presentation based on literature survey and desk analysis. The paper confirms that currency redenomination is based on some happenings within a country and its outcome depends on various fiscal and monetary policies aimed at stabilising the economy. It further posits that redenomination of the naira is not completely a bad policy despite the problems associated with it. It however, suggests that the new strategy should be thoroughly studied and understood, and should go beyond its psychological and portability effects; it should be associated with broader macroeconomic and fiscal objectives. ...|$|E
