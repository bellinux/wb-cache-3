5|$|Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a {{retailer}} striving to keep Indians in the area, as they represented {{a source of}} cheap labor. He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.|$|E
5|$|The final {{task of the}} Einsatzgruppen in Poland was {{to round}} up the {{remaining}} Jews and concentrate them in ghettos within major cities with good railway connections. The intention was to eventually <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> the Jews from Poland, {{but at this point}} their final destination had not yet been determined. Together, the Wehrmacht and the Einsatzgruppen also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet-controlled territory.|$|E

By default, it <b>removes</b> <b>all</b> zero-variance features, i.e. features that have the same value in all samples. In our system, the parameter of VarianceThreshold is set “threshold = (0.12  × (1  −  0.12))”.|$|R

5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E
5|$|By this point, {{supplies}} of the Beaufighter {{and the new}} Mosquito had improved dramatically, and {{the decision was made}} to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to Monica tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' Flensburg radar detector, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.|$|E
5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> {{but two of the}} spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay glitches, a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered among the worst games {{not only in the}} Sonic series but also in the video game medium. Sega delisted the game from retailers in 2010 following its decision to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|Following these decisions, the General Assembly {{attempted}} to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> three justices from their positions, but lacked the two-thirds majority required for impeachment. The Assembly then {{attempted to}} abolish the Court of Appeals and create a new one, beginning the Old Court-New Court controversy. The members of the existing court – Owsley, John Boyle, and Benjamin Mills – continued functioning in that role, while a new court of four pro-relief justices was organized by the legislature. For a time, both courts {{claimed to be the}} court of last resort in Kentucky, but by 1826, supporters of the Old Court won control of the legislature and abolished the New Court.|$|E

It took workers several days to clean the buildings and <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of its windows replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E
5|$|The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian Customs Union) {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010. The Customs Union's priorities were the elimination of intra-bloc tariffs, establishing a common external tariff policy {{and the elimination of}} non-tariff barriers. It was launched as a first step towards forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with economic integration and were set to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E

5|$|The European Center for Antiziganism Research, {{which works}} against {{negative}} attitudes toward Romani people, {{filed a complaint with}} German prosecutors on 18 October 2006, based on Borat's references to Gypsies in his film. The complaint accuses him of defamation and inciting violence against an ethnic group. As a consequence, 20th Century Fox declared that it would <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> parts referring to Romani people from trailers shown on German television {{as well as on the}} film's website.|$|E
5|$|The {{court ruled}} in favor of conservationists and upheld the {{precedence}} of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> feral animals from the mountainside. This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Secret Rings {{received}} average reviews. Reviewers praised its visual {{style and}} considered the game as a whole to be an improvement from prior entries, but were critical of its controls, which some claimed took time to get used to, and its inconsistent difficulty. Sega released a sequel in 2009, Sonic and the Black Knight; the two form {{what is known as}} the Sonic Storybook series. Sonic and the Secret Rings was de-listed from retailers in 2010, following Sega's decision to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores in order to increase the value of the brand.|$|E

5|$|As the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army made {{preparations}} for its war against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory {{messages to the}} Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on {{the second anniversary of}} its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply {{came in the form of}} a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart {{a chance to}} make a film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood <b>remove</b> <b>all</b> references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
