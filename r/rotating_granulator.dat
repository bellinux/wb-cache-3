5000|$|Thick {{juice is}} fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is {{dissolved}} into it, {{and the resulting}} syrup is called mother liquor. The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a massecuite, from [...] "cooked mass" [...] in French. The massecuite is passed to a centrifuge, where the High Green syrup {{is removed from the}} massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predeterminedtime, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a <b>rotating</b> <b>granulator</b> where it is dried using warm air.|$|E
