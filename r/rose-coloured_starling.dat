50|$|The rosy {{starling}} (Pastor roseus) is a passerine {{bird in the}} starling family, Sturnidae, {{also known}} as the <b>rose-coloured</b> <b>starling</b> or rose-coloured pastor. The species was recently placed in its own monotypic genus, Pastor, and split from Sturnus. This split is supported by recent studies, though other related species within its new genus are not yet known for certain.|$|E
40|$|Biometric and plumage data on {{breeding}} <b>Rose-coloured</b> <b>Starlings</b> Sturnus roseus {{showed that}} the species is partially sexually dimorphic in size and plumage colour. Both sexes develop a brood patch, although it is most frequently found in females. Although males are generally more intensely coloured than females, there is much age-related overlap in colouration which makes sexing difficult. A discriminant equation based on wing and tarsus lengths was produced to provide an additional tool for sex classification. It is not always possible to differentiate male and female <b>Rose-coloured</b> <b>Starlings</b> Sturnus roseus {{on the basis of}} their plumage features. Typical breeding adult males have pink upper and underparts, a long and glossy black crest, black throat, nape, undertail coverts and dark brown/ black axillaries. Typical adult females also have pink upper and underparts, but usually not as brilliant and pure-coloured as those of males. Females also have a short crest, brown throat, nape and undertail coverts...|$|R

In autumn the hills are magnificently decorated with the gold-colored domes of the hazelnut trees, columns of birch-trees, towering plane trees, and green thickets. High in the mountains, in {{the upper part of}} the Garalashsay gorge, is a nesting-place of black storks. These rare birds are the pride and joy of Uzbekistan. They are written down in the [...] "Redbooks" [...] in many countries as an endangered species. Early in the spring when the Amasay depression is flooded, flocks of ducks, wild geese, pelicans and grey herons are found here. This territory serves as a nesting place for <b>rose-coloured</b> <b>starlings,</b> shrikes, and sandpipers.|$|R
