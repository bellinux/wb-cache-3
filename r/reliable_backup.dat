This paper proposes an independent switch control strategy, which ensures seamless transition between charging and discharging control modes. The proposed control is based on pulse-width modulation blocking and is shown to ensure the fastest mode transition between control modes. The proposed control also elucidates an accurate method for identification of control modes, which is important to independent switch control.

50|$|Although preseason games had no {{importance}} in the standings, Bennett spoke {{of the importance of}} setting a winning tone for the season. Bennett had to abandon his plans of using a two-back offense, {{due to a lack of}} any quality running backs other than James Wilder. With no second running back standing out in practice, he instead chose to use a single-back offense that would enable tight ends Jimmie Giles and Jerry Bell to be on the field at the same time. The team was not able to find a <b>reliable</b> <b>backup</b> to Wilder until the early-season signing of former Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Problems with the pass defense were exposed in the first preseason game, in which the reserves turned a 20-0 lead into a 42-27 defeat. Bennett expressed concern over the lack of a pass rush, and the way that Steelers receivers were able to jump inside of Buccaneer defenders on slant routes. Pittsburgh third-string quarterback Scott Campbell connected twice with Weegie Thompson for touchdowns on such routes, once burning Anthony Washington for 34 yards. Ron Holmes debuted in the following week's loss to Atlanta, although the pass defense saw little improvement. The special teams performed well, but quarterback Jack Thompson struggled in his attempt to reclaim the starting job. The team's first win under Bennett came in New Orleans, the site of the franchise's first victory. The defense played better, while DeBerg led the team on two long touchdown drives. By the end of preseason, Bennett began to back off of his original assessment of the team as a playoff contender, with linebacker being the only position on the team he expressed confidence in.

40|$|Abstract—Multicast {{benefits}} {{data center}} group communication in both saving network traffic and improving application throughput. Reliable packet delivery {{is required in}} data center multicast for data-intensive computations. However, existing reliable multicast solutions for the Internet are not suitable for the data center environment, {{especially with regard to}} keeping multicast throughput from degrading upon packet loss, which is norm instead of exception in data centers. We present RDCM, a novel reliable multicast protocol for data center network. The key idea of RDCM is to minimize the impact of packet loss on the multicast throughput, by leveraging the rich link resource in data centers. A multicast-tree-aware backup overlay is explicitly built on group members for peer-to-peer packet repair. The backup overlay is organized {{in such a way that}} it causes little individual repair burden, control overhead, as well as overall repair traffic. RDCM also realizes a window-based congestion control to adapt its sending rate to the traffic status in the network. Simulation results in typical data center networks show that RDCMcanachievehigher application throughput and less traffic footprint than other representative reliable multicast protocols. We have implemented RDCM as a user-level library on Windows platform. The experiments on our test bed show that RDCM handles packet loss without obvious throughput degradation during high-speed data transmission, gracefully respond to link failure and receiver failure, and causes less than 10 % CPU overhead to data center servers.

Currently, if an EMR shutdown occurs, even for a moment, patient safety and care can be seriously impacted. Our goal {{was to determine the}} methodology needed to develop an effective and <b>reliable</b> EMR <b>backup</b> system. Methods: Our "independent backup system by medical organizations " paradigm implies that individual medical organizations develop their own EMR backup systems within their organizations. A "personal independent backup system " is defined as an individual privately managing his/her own medical records, whereas in a "central backup system by the government " the government controls all the data. A "central backup system by private enterprises " implies that individual companies retain control over their own data. A "cooperative backup system among medical organizations " refers to a networked system established through mutual agreement. The "backup system based on mutual trust between an individual and an organization " means that the medical information backup system at the organizational level is established through mutual trust. Results: Through the use of SWOT analysis it can be shown that cooperative backup among medical organizations is possible to be established through a network composed of various medical agencies and that it can be managed systematically. An owner of medical information only grants data access to the specific person who gave the authorization for backup based on the mutual trust between an individual and an organization.
