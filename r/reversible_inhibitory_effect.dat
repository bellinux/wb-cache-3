The effect of glutamate on MEPP and EPP {{is caused by}} the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, as it was eliminated by MCPG, an inhibitor of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. The depression of evoked EPP, but not MEPP frequency was removed by inhibiting the NO production in the muscle by L-NAME and by ODQ that inhibits the soluble NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase. The glutamate-induced depression of the frequency of spontaneous MEPP is apparently not caused by the stimulation of the NO cascade.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), was to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} vapor-phase bioreactor system for the destruction of trichloroethylene (TCE) from contaminated groundwater. A field demonstration was per-formed using groundwater at the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site contaminated with a complex mixture of organic chemicals. This site is managed and operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. for the Department of Energy (DOE). Analysis of the data generated during the test can be summarized in three major observations. First, TCE was degraded in the presence of all the organics found in the steam strip condensate. This was observed during treatment of both the steam strip condensate and condensate amended with TCE to increase its concentration relative to the other components. The conclusion that TCE was being biodegraded was supported by performing mass balance control experiments with the reactor and by tracking recalcitrant chemicals also present in the steam stripper condensate. Second, there appeared to be an initial lag period of up to 24 hours before onset of TCE degradation in the reactor. The source of this lag was not determined but could be related to either an acclimation of the microorganisms to other chemicals found in the condensate or <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> on TCE degradation. The duration of TCE degradative activity was relatively short for only 2 to 5 days. compared to previous demonstrations where TCE was the sole contaminant. However, several of the runs were interrupted due to mechanical and not biological issues.

The degree of oxygen inhibition was dependent on the concentration of oxygen, and increasing nitrate concentrations could not overcome the inhibition. The inhibitory effect of oxygen was maximal at approximately 0. 2 % oxygen saturation. The inhibition appeared to be specific for nitrate uptake. Nitrite uptake was not affected by these low levels of aeration, and nitrite reduction was only partially inhibited in the presence of oxygen.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} toxic action of fluoroacetate is analyzed in {{the perspective of}} scientific developments of the past 30 years. Stereospecific enzymatic conversion of fluoroacetate via fluoroacetyl –CoA + Oxalacetate to (-) -erythrofluorocitrate in mitochondria is the metabolic pathway that converts the nontoxic fluoroacetate to the toxic intra-cellular effector molecule. The mode of toxic effect of (-) -erythrofluorocitrate cannot be equated with its <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on a mitochondrial enzyme (aconitase) as had been originally thought by Peters (1963) and is still propagated in textbooks.

WEB 2086 was infused intravenously over 1 min followed immediately by ketoprofen administration over 1 s (both drugs = 3 mg/kg), {{in a group of}} six healthy male Friesian calves. Depending on the PAF concentration, a reversible (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 9) mol/l) and irreversible (10 (- 5) - 10 (- 7) mol/l) platelet aggregation was observed. The reversible aggregation was completely blocked by pretreatment of the animal with WEB 2086 and ketoprofen. The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> observed during the irreversible aggregation were 47. 22 %, 54. 00 % and 88. 00 % at 10 (- 5), 10 (- 6) and 10 (- 7) mol/l PAF, respectively. Moreover, the aggregation obtained in these condition became <b>reversible.</b> Maximal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of WEB 2086 and ketoprofen on PAF-induced platelet aggregation in calves was observed within 30 min after administration of both drugs.

Identifying alternative molecular targets would enable us to develop different therapeutic strategies for better management of these tumours. Methods: Glioblastoma (MO 59 K and KNS 60) and medulloblastoma cells (ONS 76) were used in this study. Telomerase <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of MST- 312, a chemically modified-derivative of epigallocatechin gallate, in the cells were assessed using telomere repeat amplification protocol. Gene expression analysis following MST- 312 treatment was done by microarray. Telomere length was measured by telomere restriction fragments analysis. Effects of MST- 312 on DNA integrity were evaluated by single cell gel electrophoresis, immunofluorescence assay and cytogenetic analysis.

40|$|An antibody-dependent {{cellular}} cytotoxicity (ADCC) {{system in}} which herpes simplex virus-infected Chang liver cells are used was assessed for its dependency on cellular energy, ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis, and cytoskeletal structures such as microfilaments and microtubules. The cytotoxic reaction was only slightly inhibited when glycolysis was blocked in a glucose-free medium containing 10 − 2 M 2 -deoxy-d-glucose. It was more substantially inhibited when respiration was blocked with 10 − 2 M sodium azide. The reaction was totally ablated, however, only when both glycolysis and respiration were suppressed. This <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of energy deprivation was mediated solely {{at the level of}} the effector cell. Ribonucleic acid synthesis or protein synthesis by the effector cells was not required, as shown by the fact that neither actinomycin D, cycloheximide, nor emetine significantly inhibited ADCC. The ADCC reaction was partially inhibited by cytochalasin B, whose <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> was rapidly <b>reversible,</b> and was completely and irreversibly inhibited by cytochalasin A. Cytochalasin A acted on the effector cells rather than the target cells. The reaction was also partially inhibited by colchicine, whose <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> was directed solely against the effector cells and was slowly <b>reversible.</b> The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of cytochalasin B and colchicine, when used in tandem at submaximal inhibitory concentrations, were slightly more than additive. The results suggest a cooperative role for effector cell microfilaments and microtubules in mediating ADCC. Kinetic studies of ongoing herpes simplex virus ADCC reactions after initial centrifugation showed that the lytic step requires expenditure of metabolic energy as well as intact function of both microfilaments and microtubules. These findings, in concert with previous data, indicate that the ADCC process against herpes simplex virus-infected Chang liver cells can be resolved into adhesion and lytic steps. The lytic step can be readily distinguished from the adhesion step by its increased sensitivity to low ambient temperature or metabolic energy deprivation, its sensitivity to thermal inactivation, its requirements for extracellular divalent cations, and its dependence on normal function of both microfilaments and microtubules...|$|R

40|$|Human {{carcinoma}} HEp- 3 {{lost its}} tumorigenic and metastatic potential upon prolonged culture in vitro. This change {{was accompanied by}} a reduced production of plasminogen activator (PA) of the urokinase type (uPA), which is secreted by HEp- 3 cells, a change in response to effectors that modulate uPA production, and an alteration of cell morphology. Similar but more rapid changes occurred when malignant HEp- 3 cells were exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). uPA activity in the culture medium dropped below 50 % of the control level within 6 h after the addition of DMSO and became undetectable after 24 h of treatment. This drop in uPA activity was not caused by an increased production of PA inhibitors. The cell-associated uPA decreased to 25 to 30 % of the control level within 6 h of DMSO treatment and remained at this level for at least 96 h; the reduced uPA production was partially accounted for by a rapid decrease in the functional and chemical concentration of uPA mRNA. In contrast, the concentrations of most of the abundant mRNA species {{did not appear to be}} significantly affected, and cell growth was only slightly inhibited in the presence of DMSO. Malignant HEp- 3 cells treated with DMSO responded to cholera toxin with an enhanced production of uPA, and their morphology became indistinguishable from that of nonmalignant HEp- 3 cells grown in vitro for prolonged periods of time. All of the above changes were fully and rapidly <b>reversible.</b> The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of DMSO on PA production appears to be specific for uPA of human cell lines...|$|R

40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{entry into}} cells is a multistep process that engages the host cell machinery. The {{proteasome}} is a large, ATP-dependent, multisubunit protease that plays {{a critical role}} in the maintenance of cell homeostasis. A battery of assays were used to demonstrate that proteasome inhibitors blocked an early step in HSV entry that occurred after capsid penetration into the cytosol but prior to capsid arrival at the nuclear periphery. Proteasome-dependent viral entry was not reliant on host or viral protein synthesis. MG 132, a peptide aldehyde that competitively inhibits the degradative activity of the proteasome, had a <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on HSV entry. HSV can use endocytic or nonendocytic pathways to enter cells. These distinct entry routes were both dependent on proteasome-mediated proteolysis.

The result that aspirin benefit is detectable at daily low-doses (at least 75 mg), the same used {{for the prevention of}} cardiovascular disease, positions the antiplatelet action of aspirin at the center of its antitumor efficacy. At low-doses given every 24 h, aspirin is acting by a complete and persistent inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 in platelets (in the pre-systemic circulation) while causing a limited and rapidly <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on COX- 2 and/or COX- 1 expressed in nucleated cells. Aspirin has a short half-life in human circulation (approximately 20 min); nucleated cells have the ability to resynthesize the acetylated COX-isozymes within a few hours, while platelets do not. COX-independent mechanisms of aspirin, such as the inhibition of Wnt/ b-catenin and NF-kB signaling and the acetylation of extra-COX proteins, have been suggested {{to play a role in}} its chemo-preventive effects, but their relevance remains to be demonstrated in vivo at clinical doses. In conclusion, the results of clinical pharmacology and the analysis of randomized and epidemiological studies suggest that colorectal cancer and atherothrombosis share a common mechanism of disease, i. e. enhanced platelet activation in response to injury at distinct sites...|$|E

Its effect upon glucose- and sulfonylurea-induced insulin release was investigated in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. After twenty-five minutes' pretreatment and at concentrations ranging between 0. 8 and 8. 1 muM, verapamil caused a dose-related inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release during both the early and late phase of the secretory process. At a concentration of 0. 8 muM, the degree of inhibition was more marked when the exposure time to verapamil prior to stimulation with glucose was increased to sixty minutes.

40|$|In the {{selective}} catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with NH 3 over activated carbon (AC), deactivation occurs over time {{in the presence of}} SO 2. This work distinguishes the multiple roles of SO 2 in the gas phase versus the solid deposition product and clarifies the effects of the physicochemical properties of AC on NO conversion. The deposition products were detected using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) coupled with mass spectrum (MS) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The results showed that the activated carbon loses less de-NOx activity when it has more CO- and CO 2 containing groups with decomposition temperatures over 900 K. The Raman spectra revealed that the disorder of the microcrystalline structure of the graphite has a positive linear correlation with NO conversion regardless of the presence of functional groups. The deposition products were analyzed by Gaussian-Lorentz deconvolution of the TPD spectra, and it was discovered that the sulfur-containing species included sulfate and strongly adsorbed SO 2 /SO 3; the NH 3 -containing species included NH 4 HSO 4 and freely adsorbed NH 3; and the ratios of SO 2 /SO 3, NH 4 HSO 4 and NH 3 were approximately 31 mol %, 42 mol %, and 26 mol %, respectively. NH 4 HSO 4 does not notably inhibit NO conversion, even with a high loading amount.

Both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia, hereinafter {{referred to as}} suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (Streptococcus sanguis, Veillonella atypica, and Prevotella denticola, {{hereinafter referred to as}} nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. All bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. Sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. These were added in various proportions to the CPO cultures. Parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and P(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6 -day-old cultures. Compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. No osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. These results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. Further characterization of the P. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. P. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in CPO cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects.

A rapid Cu 2 +-induced increase of plasmalemma conductance starting from 5 [mu]M Cu 2 + was shown. Cu 2 +-induced plasmalemma conductance (ClGm) was nonselective and potential-independent, resembling the conductance of nonselective ionic leakage of the plasmalemma. The K+ channel conductance was shown to be unaltered by Cu 2 +, {{and a decrease in}} plasmalemma Cl- channel conductance at Cu 2 + concentrations above 5 [mu]M was found. The depression of Cl- channels and ClGm were time-, dosage-, and Ca 2 +-dependent processes, revealing a great similarity in all parameters, with Ca 2 + causing the preventive effect by shifting the effective Cu 2 + concentrations to higher levels. This phenomenon may be explained by the same Cu 2 +-modified target on the plasmalemma both for ClGm and Cl- channel depression. In addition, a <b>reversible,</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of Cu 2 + (> 10 [mu]M) on the light-stimulated H+-ATPase electrogenic pump in the plasmalemma was demonstrated.

In particular, a highly reproducible and <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of high cell density on HCV replication was observed: high levels of HCV RNA and protein can be detected in actively growing cells but decline sharply when the replicon cells reach confluence. Arrested cell growth of confluent cells has been proposed {{to be responsible for}} the inhibitory effect. Indeed, other means of arresting cell growth have also been shown to inhibit HCV replication. Here, we report a detailed study of the effect of cell growth and confluence on HCV replication using a flow cytometry-based assay that is not biased against cytostasis and reduced cell number. Although we readily reproduced the inhibitory effect of cell confluence on HCV replication, we found no evidence of inhibition by serum starvation, which arrested cell growth as expected. In addition, we observed no inhibitory effect by agents that perturb the cell cycle. Instead, our results suggest that the reduced intracellular pools of nucleosides account for the suppression of HCV expression in confluent cells, possibly through the shutoff of the de novo nucleoside biosynthetic pathway when cells become confluent. Adding exogenous uridine and cytidine to the culture medium restored HCV replication and expression in confluent cells. These results suggest that cell growth arrest is not sufficient for HCV replicon inhibition and reveal a mechanism for HCV RNA inhibition by cell confluence...|$|E

40|$|Objective-To assess {{anti-inflammatory}} {{effects of}} carprofen (CPF), CPF enantiomers, and N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in sheep. Animals- 8 sheep. Procedure-Sheep with SC tissue cages were used. After intracaveal injection of 1 % carrageenan, sheep were given single doses of racemic (Rac; 50 : 50 mixture of S[+] and R[-] enantiomers) -CPF (4. 0 mg/kg), R(-) CPF (2. 0 mg/kg), S(+) CPF (2. 0 mg/kg), L-NAME (25 mg/kg), and placebo (PLB) IV in a crossover design. Results-Rac-CPF and S(+) CPF inhibited serum thromboxane(2) (TXB(2)) and exudate prostaglandin (PG) E(2) generation significantly for 32 hours. Maximal inhibitory effect for serum TXB(2) was 79 +/- 3 % for Rac-CPF and 68 +/- 6 % for S(+) CPF The Rac-CPF and S(+) CPF induced 50 to 98 % <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> for exudate PGE(2) generation during a 4 - to 32 -hour period. The R(-) CPF and L-NAME attenuated serum TXB(2) generation significantly. The R(-) CPF {{did not affect}} exudate PGE(2) production, whereas L-NAME potentiated exudate, PGE(2) generation by 30 % during 4 to 32 hours. The S(+) CPF and L-NAME increased leukotriene B(4) generation and WBC recruitment in exudate although significance was achieved only at a few time points. Increase in skin temperature over inflammatory cages was effectively inhibited by Rac-CPF and S(+) CPF but not by R(-) CPF Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Carprofen is a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor in vivo in sheep, and its anti-inflammatory effects are attributable only to S(+) CPF in Rac-CPF. Nitric oxide may enhance eicosanoid production and accelerate the acute inflammatory process...|$|E
40|$|Background: Considering {{the high}} {{secretion}} of gastric acid in peptic ulcer, its known complications {{and failure to}} previous therapeutic regimens, and also regarding history of prescribing peppermint essential oil {{in the treatment of}} gastric disorders and lack of information about interactions between peppermint essential oil and secretion of acid by parietal cells, this study was performed. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 60 male rats, species Sprague Dawley. Rats were divided in 6 equal groups. Each group received normal saline (0. 9) and menthol with doses of 0. 9, 2. 7, 9, 27 and 90 mg/kg by plastic cannula, respectively. Gastric secretion was extracted from pylorus. Gastric acidity was evaluated using titration by NaOH. Data analysis was performed by t-test, paired t-test, one way ANOVA and tukey's test. Results: Rate of gastric acid secretion was constant in rats received normal saline, while it increased in rats received peppermint essential oil. Peppermint essential oil with dose of 9 mg/kg decreased acid secretion from 100 to 61. 1 Â± 3. 8 percent at the beginning of prescribing. Increasing dose aggravated the efficacy of peppermint essential oil on inhibiting acid secretion. The maximum of effect was seen in dose of 27 mg/kg. The effect of peppermint essential oil was reversible and after washing stomach with normal saline, this inhibitory effect was disappeared. Conclusion: It seems that peppermint essential oil has dose-dependent and <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> on gastric acid secretion. So, it is recommended to patients with gastritis to decrease prescribing anti-secretory drugs...|$|E
40|$|GnRH neurons {{integrate}} {{internal and}} external cues to control sexual maturation and fertility. Homeostasis of energy balance and food intake correlates strongly with the status of reproduction. Neuropeptides secreted by the hypothalamus involved in modulating energy balance and feeding may play additional roles in the regulation of reproduction. Hypocretin (Hcrt) (also known as orexin) is one such peptide, primarily controlling sleep/wakefulness, food intake, and reward processing. There is {{a growing body of}} evidence indicating that Hcrt/orexin (Hcrt) modulates reproduction through interacting with the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in mammals. To explore potential morphological and functional interactions between the GnRH and Hcrt neuronal systems, we employed a variety of experimental approaches including confocal imaging, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology in transgenic zebrafish, in which fluorescent proteins are genetically expressed in GnRH 3 and Hcrt neurons. Our imaging data revealed close apposition and direct connection between GnRH 3 and Hcrt neuronal systems in the hypothalamus during larval development through adulthood. Furthermore, the Hcrt receptor (HcrtR) is expressed in GnRH 3 neurons. Electrophysiological data revealed a <b>reversible</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of Hcrt on GnRH 3 neuron electrical activity, which was blocked by the HcrtR antagonist almorexant. In addition, Hcrt had no effect on the electrical activity of GnRH 3 neurons in the HcrtR null mutant zebrafish (HcrtR−/−). Our findings demonstrate a close anatomical and functional relationship between Hcrt and GnRH neuronal systems in zebrafish. It is the first demonstration of a link between neuronal circuits controlling sleeping/arousal/feeding and reproduction in zebrafish, an important animal model for investigating the molecular genetics of development...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there were no}} {{significant}} differences between the two groups in terms of the mean <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> at either the proximal tibia or distal femur via agar disc diffusion bioassay (proximal tibia, p =  0.33; distal femur, p =  0.63). Although a previous report had shown that high-dose cefazolin could be used for prophylaxis in an animal study [11], surgeons should keep in mind that, based on our findings, when they consider IV cefazolin at a dose of 2  g for preoperative prophylaxis, it should be used with care. This is especially true for patients with reduced renal function. In addition to the results that showed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects,</b> we found that the mean <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> in the two groups (cefazolin dose of 1 versus 2  g at both the proximal tibia and distal femur) were less than the mean <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of the standard MIC of serum cefazolin at 30  µg/ml. Pearson’s correlation analyses showed that {{there were no significant}} correlations between the intraosseous concentrations and the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> in either the proximal tibia (r =  0.18, p =  0.52) or distal femur (r = − 0.29, p =  0.30). Higher cefazolin dosages would not provide higher <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects.</b> At this point, we hypothesize that the standard MIC of intraosseous cefazolin may not be directly related to the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects,</b> which are different from the relationship between the standard MIC of serum cefazolin and its <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> via the agar disc diffusion bioassay. In addition, the intraosseous area may contain a threshold <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> of cefazolin that gives no greater <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effect</b> from a higher dose of cefazolin. Further studies are needed to test the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>effects</b> of intraosseous cefazolin directly with the standard MIC of intraosseous cefazolin rather than relative tests with the standard MIC of serum cefazolin.|$|R
