In this light, the SKA enables us to do an ultimate test in cosmology by measuring the expansion rate of the Universe in real time. This can be done by a rather simple experiment of observing the neutral hydrogen (HI) signal of galaxies at two different epochs. The signal will encounter a change in frequency imprinted as the Universe expands over time and thus monitoring the drift in frequencies will provide a real time measure of the cosmic acceleration. Over a period of 12 years one would expected a frequency shift of the order of 0. 1 Hz assuming a standard Lambda-CDM cosmology. Based on the sensitivity estimates of the SKA and the number counts of the expected HI galaxies, it is shown that the number counts are sufficiently high to compensate for the observational uncertainties of the measurements and hence allow a statistical detection of the frequency shift.

Eutectic alloys provide cost effective alternative to those expensive hypereutectic alloys. However, the tribological performances of the eutectic alloys needed rigorous evaluation and the objectives of this dissertation were to investigate the ultra-mild wear (UMW) mechanisms of eutectic Al- 12. 6 %Si alloys, chemical and mechanical properties of tribolayers and their long term stability at elevated temperatures under boundary lubricated conditions. Sliding experiments were conducted using 5 W 30 engine oil on three etched Al-Si alloys containing 12 - 25 % silicon at temperatures between 25 °C and 160 °C for sliding cycles up to 6 × 106 <b>revolutions.</b> Statistical <b>measurements</b> based on optical profilometer were carried out to quantify UMW damage parameters and volumetric loss. A criterion to asses UMW damage was then developed. Numerical models containing single- and multi-particle were developed to conduct a parametric study investigating the effect of different matrix yield strength and strain hardening characteristics, and the tribofilm formation on UMW damage parameters. UMW in Al- 18. 5 %Si alloy lasted up to 104 cycles at 5. 0 N load. In the eutectic alloy, three stages of UMW were identified at 25 and 100 °C at 2. 0 N load, and UMW performance at 100 °C {{was found to be}} superior to that at 25 °C. At elevated temperatures, island-like tribofilm formation on silicon particles and the composition of oil-residue layer were the characteristic differences compared to 25 °C. The island like-tribofilm consisted of zinc sulphide and short chain zinc pyrophosphate, and the ORL was formed by mixing of tribofilm with aluminum matrix. The long term durability of ORL investigated for different Al-Si alloys at 100 °C elucidated the effectiveness of it in maintaining UMW. Findings from the numerical study were in good agreement with experimental observations. The parametric study showed that higher yield strength and strain hardening exponent of the matrix, and presence of tribofilm on silicon were beneficial in prolonging UMW and delayed the transition of UMW-I to UMW-II stage. The experimental findings suggested that the eutectic alloy {{can be used as a}} cost effective replacement of the hypereutectic alloys...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – New {{measures}} in marketing are invariably created {{by using a}} psychometric approach based on Churchill’s “scale development” procedure. This paper aims to compare and contrast Churchill’s procedure with Rossiter’s content-validity approach to measurement, called C-OAR-SE. Design/methodology approach – The comparison of the two procedures is by rational argument and forms the theoretical {{first half of the}} paper. In the applied second half of the paper, three recent articles from the Journal of Marketing (JM) that introduce new constructs and measures are criticized and corrected from the C-OAR-SE perspective. Findings – The C-OAR-SE method differs from Churchill’s method by arguing for: total emphasis on achieving high content validity of the item(s) and answer scale – without which nothing else matters; use of single-item measures for “basic” constructs andfor the first-order components of “abstract” constructs; abandonment of the “reflective” measurement model, along with its associated statistical techniques of factor analysis and coefficient alpha, arguing that all abstract constructs must be measured as “formative”; and abandonment of external validation methods, notably multitrait-multimethod analysis (MTMM) and structural equation modeling (SEM), to be replaced by internal content-validation of the measure itself. TheC-OAR-SE method can be applied – as demonstrated in {{the last part of the}} article – by anyverbally intelligent researcher. However,less confident researchersmayneedtoseek the assistance of one or two colleagues who fully understand the new method. Practical implications – If a measure is not highly content-valid to begin with – and none of the new {{measures in}} the JM articles criticized is highly content-valid – then no subsequent psychometric properties can save it. Highly content-valid measures are absolutely necessary for proper tests of theories and hypotheses, and for obtaining trustworthy findings in marketing.

40|$|At GSI Darmstadt the {{technique}} of Isochronous Mass Spectrometry (IMS) has been developed for direct mass measurements of exotic nuclides. In this method a cocktail beam of highly-charged ions is produced via projectile fragmentation or fission, separated in the FRagment Separator (FRS) and injected into the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) operated in an isochronous mode. The mass of the exotic nuclei can be deduced from precise <b>revolution</b> time <b>measurements</b> by a time-of-flight (TOF) detector placed in the ESR. In the detector ions passing a thin foil release secondary electrons, which are transported to two microchannel plate (MCP) detectors in forward and backward directions by electric and magnetic fields. In this work the performance characteristics of the detector were investigated by simulations and by offline and online experiments and significantly improved. In particular the timing performance and the rate capability were measured and enhanced. The detection efficiency improvements developed in previous work were verified {{and the use of}} thinner carbon foils {{to increase the number of}} turns of the ions in the ring were implemented. This work also forms a basis for the development of a dual detector system for IMS in the collector ring at FAIR. In this work the main contributions to the TOF detector timing such as the transport time of the secondary electrons, the electron transit time through the MCPs and the method of determination of the event time from the MCP signals (event time determination) were analyzed and improved. The timing accuracy of the TOF detector was investigated by coincidence time-of-flight measurements. The timing uncertainty of a single branch of the detector with standard settings was measured in the laboratory with an alpha-source and amounts to sigma(branch) = 48 ps. In an online experiment at the ESR using MCPs with 5 µm pore sizes the timing accuracy was measured as sigma(branch) = 48 ps with a stable 20 ^Ne beam and sigma(branch) = 45 ps with 238 ^U fission fragments. Those measurements were performed for the kinetic energy of the secondary electrons (K) equals 700 eV. To improve the transport time of secondary electrons the TOF detector was modified for higher values of electric and magnetic fields. An improved time spread sigma(branch) = 37 ps was obtained in the measurements with alpha-particles using MCPs with 10 µm channel diameter for an kinetic energy of 1400 eV of the secondary electrons. The contribution from the transit time through the MCP channels to the time spread was investigated with alpha-particles as a function of different electron yields from the carbon foils. Using a higher thickness of the carbon foil timing is not improved significantly. Therefore, 10 µg/cm^ 2 is an optimum for the carbon foil thickness in the matter of efficiency and timing. In case of a foil with a Cs-compound on the surface, for which the number of secondary electrons is increased by a factor of 10, the timing was improved to sigma(branch) = 27 ps (K= 1400 eV). A newly constructed anode design improves the bandwidth of the MCP detector by a factor of 2 leading to a reduction in the width of the MCP signals by a factor of two to an improvement of the rise time by about 20 %. The signal shape of the MCP detector influences the determination of the revolution times of the ions in the ring and thus the mass measurement accuracy. Due to the high revolution frequencies of the ions in the ESR (~ 2 MHz) a high rate capability detector is required. The rate acceptance of the MCP detector was improved in the offline experiments by a factor of 4 due to the larger number of channels of MCPs with 5 µm pore size. At each turn in the ESR the ions pass the foil and lose energy. According to simulations the decrease of the foil thickness by a factor of two allows to double the number of ion revolutions in the ring. To store ions for a longer time in the ESR a thinner carbon foil with a thickness of 10 µg/cm^ 2 and MCPs with a 5 µm channel diameter were installed in the TOF detector and used for the first time in the online experiments. The results of the experiments measured with 10 ^Ne^ 10 + stable beam and 238 ^U fission fragments were compared to the results of the previous experiments. In the previous experiments a carbon foil with a thickness of 17 µg/cm^ 2 coated with 10 µg/cm^ 2 of CsI on both sides, which caused a calculated energy loss of 86 keV (86 ^As^ 33 +, 386. 3 MeV/u) and MCPs with 10 µm pore size were used. For the carbon foil of 10 µg/cm^ 2 the calculated energy loss is 31 keV, that is a factor of 2. 7 less than for the thicker foil. Summing up the results, with thinner carbon foil and higher rate resistance MCPs with 5 µm pore sizes in the TOF detector up to ten times more ion revolutions in the ring were observed. With larger number of turns in the ring one increases the detection efficiency and the mass measurement accuracy...|$|R

This thesis {{presents}} {{design and}} construction details of a 12 Dofs biped walking robot. Bipedal walking {{is one of the}} most challenging research fields on humanoid robots. So this work aimed at providing experience on bipedal walking and to be pre-study of {{design and construction}} of a full humanoid robot. Therefore, biped robot design has no head and arms. Robot structure is formed by four subassemblies with torso, hip, knee and ankle. Kinematic structure is 6 -Dof at the leg, 3 Dof at the hip, one at the knee and two at the ankle. The biped robot’s total weight is 55 kg and its height is 142 cm. Humanoid robots are autonomous robots, because they can adapt to changes in their environments or their self and continue to reach their goal. This is the main difference between humanoid and other kinds of robots. In this context, some of the capacities of a humanoid robot may include, among others: self-maintenance, autonomous learning, avoiding harmful situations to people, property and itself, safe interacting with human beings and the environment. Humanoid robots are created to imitate some of the same physical and mental tasks that humans undergo daily. Scientists and engineers from many different fields combine their efforts to create a robot as human-like as possible. The main goal for the robot is that one day it will be able to both understand human intelligence, reason and act like humans. If humanoids are able to do so, they could eventually work in collaboration with humans to create a more productive and higher quality future. Another important benefit of developing humanoid robot is to understand the human body s biological and mental processes. Asimo {{is one of the most}} successful humanoid robot project for all times. Honda and Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center develop it since middle of the 1980 ’s. Until today, 12 different prototypes are developed and manufactured. The most popular one of these prototypes is announced in 2005 with name of New Asimo. HRP is another milestone humanoid robot prototype, is developed by AIST, METI and NEDO in Japan. In the past several years, successful prototypes HRP 4 -C and HRP- 4 are announced to public. In order to define design criteria belongs to assembly groups; hip, knee and ankle, a beam model simulation is used with a pre-defined dimensions and mass. Bipedal robots in literature are considered in defining masses and dimensions for beam model simulation. Beam robot model has 12 Dofs and 35 kg mass totally. Joints’ angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are revealed form results of computer simulation based on beam model. Simulated walking speed of the beam model is 1 km/h under condition of predefined foot trajectories. In the presence of the simulation results, an inquiry list is generated and design criteria of bipedal robot studied in this thesis is derived from results and that inquiry list. After clarification of the goals and defining the frame of the project, verbal construction structures of joints’ mechanical systems are derived. These schemes, states systems inputs and outputs in terms of energy, signal, matter, and defines interactions between them. System’s elementary function structure is expressed with Koller elementary function figures using the verbal construction structure. A concept design that meets the requirements of design criteria and project goals, is introduced and improvements and detailing of project is made based of this concept design. Concept design describes location, shapes, manufacturing techniques and power transmission system of the joints. Mechanical structure and units such as motors, couplings etc. are explained in the section of robots joints detailed design. During the design phase, parts that are seem to be critical according to their structure, are analyzed with finite element methods and necessary improvements are done. All Dofs are driven by dc motors. Harmonic drive units are used to reduce the velocity which is provided by motors. Also, it provides stiff and robust mechanical structure because of it has no backlash. Axes of the at hip joint, intersect at one point. Thus, inverse kinematic calculations are fairly straightforward. Incremental encoders are mounted to motor shafts to feedback the system. Moreover, initial conditions are defined by absolute encoders, are located to rotary axes of the each hip joints. Lower and upper legs consist of U-profiles containing all actuation and transmission mechanism of the knee and ankle joints. An industrial computer with real-time operating system, all motor drivers and sensors interfaces and a battery are situated on an upper body upon the hip joints. Knee and ankle joints are driven by vertically placed actuators through ball screw mechanism. Actuators and transmission driving higher than the driven rotating Dofs. In such a kinematic configuration, the center of mass of the robot moves also higher in vertical with respect to that of robots with direct driven joints. The knee joint has 90 degrees motion range, and it is driven by a ball screw mechanism which is actuated by a dc actuator placed in the upper leg. To provide the required conversion ratio, ball screw mechanism is used to as velocity reducer. In a same way to the hip joint, the incremental encoder is mounted to the dc motor shaft of the knee joint, and also, the absolute encoder is placed on the knee joint shaft to get rid of the measurement errors which may occur because of transmission mechanisms. In the lower leg, 2 Dofs of the ankle joints are driven by dc electrical actuators. Driving torque of the actuators is transmitted to the ankle joints by ball screw mechanism similar to the knee joint. The ball screw mechanism are guided on a polyamide part which is mounted on lower leg, therefore only linear displacements are allowed to the mechanism. Complexity of the power transmission of the ankle joint causes uncertain feedback by only incremental encoder. Therefore, additional absolute encoders are mounted to each ankle joints. Besides, 6 axes force-torque sensors are placed over feet to measure the forces and torques which are required for the control loop. The sensory system of the biped robot includes incremental and absolute encoders at all 12 joints and two force-torque sensors at each ankle. The components of the interaction forces exerted by the ground on the biped robot will be measured. The incremental encoders attached to the motor shafts to measure the angular displacements relative to initial values of each joint. Resolution of the incremental encoder which is 500 increments per <b>revolution</b> satisfies qualified <b>measurement</b> with highly stiff harmonic drive gears. Since an incremental encoder measures differentiation of angular positions, initial angular position of all joints must be measured by absolute encoders. The absolute encoders which are integrated to shafts of joints measure the initial values of joints before the biped robot stars walking. Measurement errors of the absolute encoders are negligible thanks to its 12 -bit resolution pre revolutions. The biped robot consist of 12 Maxon dc motors driven by Epos motor drivers. The motor drivers drive dc motors with respect to trajectory data which is received from the computer via canbus. The embedded computer receives data from absolute encoders and force-torque sensors and transmits data to motor drivers via canbus. The computer which is installed embedded real time Linux operating system will provide the trajectories for static walking and control algorithms for dynamic walking. To simulate the biped robot model and control algorithm, Msc-Adams and Matlab-Simulink software packages are used. Simulink is responsible for the pattern generation and the dynamic controller, and Adams is responsible for the biped robot model. Reference joint trajectories are generated by Simulink and are sent to Adams. Adams solves the inverse dynamics of the biped robot and sends joint torques and contact forces back to Simulink. Feet paths are generated off-line and also desired ZMP references are generated off-line in accordance with the foot placements. To solve the inverse kinematics problem of the biped robot model, feet and torso paths must be known simultaneously. Torso path is generated to ensure dynamic balance of the robot. In torso path generation model predictive control and linear inverted pendulum model is used. Adams takes reference joint trajectories as inputs and gives joint torques and contact forces as outputs. CAD drawings of the parts are imported into Adams and all material properties and constraints are defined in Adams environment. Subsequent to selection of ready to use units and final design, electronic components and control equipments that takes place in the project are defined and interactions between each other is explained. Besides, computer simulation derived for beam model, is rerun for new designed model and angular displacements, angular velocities and torques are calculated with a high accuracy. Design and selection of ready to use units are validated with new simulation results. Following to design cycle, technical drawings for manufacturing and assemblies are drawn according to convenient manufacturing techniques and tolerances are defined. Manufacturing folder which contains technical drawings and all necessary information for manufacturing is created. Sequent, in the light of problems encountered during assemblies and first trials, some modifications are done and final design is released. After construction and assembly process and integration electrical components, joint’s basic functions and control system has been tested with movements in the air. The transmission mechanism of the hip, knee and ankle joints, are tested under various input. All sensors have been put in use and joint position references successfully controlled. The next step is, put the robot on ground and perform the actions are done in air. After test stage, experimentation of biped walking will start. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
