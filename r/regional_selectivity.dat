Despite the much greater affinity of flibanserin for the 5-HT1A receptor, and {{for reasons that are}} unknown (although it might be caused by the competition with endogenous serotonin), flibanserin occupies the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in vivo with similar percentages.

Methods: We discuss the two problems and show how they might lead to potential biases when trying to obtain result s from the National Cohort that are representative for the total population of Germany. We suggest that the long-running German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) should be used as a reference data set for population means and as a control sample for detection of learning effects (panel effects) induced by information about the results of individual medical examinations. Results : We present a wide range of topics and indicators which are available in both the German Socio - Economic Panel Study (SOEP) and the National Cohort (NaKo). These items can be harmonized to make the datasets comparable. The range of topics that overlap between SOEP and NaKo include socio-demographic variables, general indicators, socio-psychological environment, and to a limited extent biomarkers.

40|$|A {{versatile}} microreactor platform {{featuring a}} novel chemical-resistant microvalve array {{has been developed}} using combined silicon/polymer micromachining and a special polymer membrane transfer process. The basic valve unit in the array has a typical ‘transistor’ structure and a PDMS/parylene double-layer valve membrane. A robust multiplexing algorithm is also proposed for individual addressing of a large array using a minimal number of signal inputs. The in-channel microvalve is leakproof upon pneumatic actuation. In open status it introduces small impedance to the fluidic flow, and allows a significantly larger dynamic range of flow rates (∼ml min− 1) compared {{with most of the}} microvalves reported. Equivalent electronic circuits were established by modeling the microvalves as PMOS transistors and the fluidic channels as simple resistors to provide theoretical prediction of the device fluidic behavior. The presented microvalve/reactor array showed excellent chemical compatibility in the tests with several typical aggressive chemicals including those seriously degrading PDMS-based microfluidic devices. Combined with the multiplexing strategy, this versatile array platform can find a variety of lab-on-a-chip applications such as addressable multiplex biochemical synthesis/assays, and is particularly suitable for those requiring tough chemicals, large flow rates and/or high-throughput parallel processing. As an example, the device performance was examined through the addressed synthesis of 30 -mer DNA oligonucleotides followed by sequence validation using on-chip hybridization.

Pretreatment with the calcium blockers delayed gastric emptying of phenol red in a dose-dependent manner. Verapamil was the most effective of the agents tested. Verapamil and diltiazem inhibited gastric acid secretion in the pylorus-ligated rat without affecting pepsin output. Cinnarizine was ineffective in this model. When the perfused lumen of the anaesthetized rat was used, verapamil was found to inhibit responses to carbachol or histamine more than those to pentagastrin. Further, we found a greater sensitivity to verapamil for basal compared with vagal-stimulated (2 -deoxy-D-glucose) acid secretion.

With exposure on GD 9 – 12, CPF elicited global elevations in 5 HT 1 A and 5 HT 2 receptors and in the 5 HT presynaptic transporter. The GD 17 – 20 treatment elicited larger effects that displayed selectivity for regions with 5 HT nerve terminals and that were preferential for males. Although similar receptor up-regulation was seen after PN 1 – 4 exposure, the effects were larger in regions with 5 HT cell bodies; in addition, the presynaptic transporter was down-regulated in the nerve terminal zones of females. The PN 11 – 14 exposure had much smaller effects on receptors but still elicited transporter suppression with the same <b>regional</b> and sex <b>selectivity.</b> Although CPF exposure on GD 17 – 20, PN 1 – 4, or PN 11 – 14 altered the ability of 5 HT to modulate adenylyl cyclase, this change did not correspond with the effects on 5 HT receptors, suggesting an additional set of effects on proteins that transduce the 5 HT signal.

The second finding is the clustering of NFT in columns of supra- and infra-granular layers of association cortex. We review recent evidence confirming these findings and comment on their possible significance. We consider that the most attractive hypothesis to explain {{the vulnerability of the}} olfactory system and association cortex is the persistent neural plasticity of these regions. On this basis there would be no need to postulate a progressive spreading process. The columnar distribution of clustered NFT can be well understood in the context of recent concepts of columnar organization of the cerebral cortex. The original interpretation that this distribution of NFT reflects pathology in neurons subserving cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections seems to us to have stood the test of time. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

We exposed rhesus monkeys to ETS during gestation and through 13 months postnatally, or postnatally only (6 – 13 months). At the conclusion of exposure, we examined cerebrocortical regions and the midbrain for cell damage markers and lipid peroxidation. For perinatal ETS, two archetypal patterns were seen in the various regions, one characterized by cell loss (reduced DNA concentration) and corresponding increases in cell size (increased protein/DNA ratio), and a second pattern suggesting replacement of larger neuronal cells with smaller and more numerous glia (increased DNA concentration, decreased protein/DNA ratio). The membrane/total protein ratio, a biomarker of neurite formation, also indicated potential damage to neuronal projections, accompanied by reactive sprouting.

An initial {{study showed that}} phenotypes of activated astrocytes and microglia from aging rat cerebral cortex persisted in primary cultures (Neurobiol. Aging 19 (1998), 97). We extend these findings by examining effects of age on the activation of glial cultures from adult rat brain in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory stimulus. Mixed glia from F 344 male rats, aged 3 and 24 months, cultured from cerebral cortex (Cx), hippocampus (Hc), and striatum (St), were assayed for cytokines implicated in Alzheimer’s disease: IL- 1, IL- 1, IL- 6, and TNF-. Regional differences across all age groups included consistently lower expression of these cytokines in glia derived from Cx than Hc and St. Aging increased basal IL- 6 mRNA and secretion by 3 -fold in glia from Cx and Hc.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine {{pathophysiology}} and antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia by using positron emission tomography (PET). The high affinity radioligand [11 C]FLB 457 was used for determination of dopamine D 2 receptor binding in the thalamus and the cortex of nine drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia and eight control subjects. The D 2 receptor binding was significantly lower in the right medial thalamus in the patient group. With the moderate affinity radioligand [11 C]raclopride, the D 2 receptor binding in the striatum and the thalamus was determined in eighteen drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia and seventeen control subjects. In concordance with previous studies, no significant group {{differences were found in}} the D 2 receptor binding in the striatum. However, in the right thalamus the D 2 receptor binding was significantly lower in patients, thus confirming the preliminary results from the study using [11 C]FL 13 457. Taken together, these results indicate pathology of the thalamus, a brain region with widespread connections to regions implicated in schizophrenia. Despite a relatively low D 2 receptor occupancy the atypical drug clozapine is efficacious also in patients that do not respond to classical antipsychotics. It has been suggested that 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonism may be an important mechanism underlying the atypical properties of clozapine. In this thesis, the selective 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonist M 100907 was used for treatment of two patients with schizophrenia. The results indicate that clinical treatment with M 100907 is well tolerated and that the dosage was sufficient to induce high 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy in the frontal cortex. M 100907 can thus be proposed as a suitable tool for evaluation of 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonism in schizophrenia. Other authors have suggested that the clinical superiority of clozapine is related to a preferential effect in limbic and cortical dopaminergic systems. This hypothesis of <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> was examined in seven patients with schizophrenia. Striatal D 2 receptor occupancy was determined with [11 C]raclopride whereas [11 C]FLB 457 was used for the determination of D 2 receptor occupancy in the thalamus and in the cortex. In the haloperidol-treated patients the D 2 receptor occupancy was relatively high and similar in all regions, whereas in the clozapine-treated patients the D 2 receptor occupancy was relatively low, and of the same magnitude in all regions. The hypothesis of <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> was thus not supported. Based on previous PET studies an optimal interval for D 2 receptor occupancy during antipsychotic treatment has been suggested. A therapeutic window for serum drug concentration has been reported for the classical antipsychotic drug perphenazine.

40|$|Phasic {{changes in}} {{dopamine}} activity {{play a critical}} role in learning and goal-directed behavior. Unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoke phasic increases in the firing rate of the majority of midbrain dopamine neurons – results that predict uniformly broadcast increases in dopamine concentration throughout the striatum. However, measurement of dopamine concentration changes during reward has cast doubt on this prediction. We systematically measured phasic changes in dopamine in four striatal subregions [nucleus accumbens shell and core (Core), dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum] in response to stimuli known to activate a majority of dopamine neurons. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in awake and behaving rats, which measures changes in dopamine on a similar timescale to the electrophysiological recordings that established a relationship between phasic dopamine activity and reward. Unlike the responses of midbrain dopamine neurons, unpredicted food reward and reward-predictive cues evoked a phasic increase in dopamine that was subregion specific. In rats with limited experience, unpredicted food reward evoked an increase exclusively in the Core. In rats trained on a discriminative stimulus paradigm, both unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoked robust phasic dopamine in the Core and DMS. Thus, phasic dopamine release in select target structures is dynamic and dependent on context and experience. Because the four subregions assayed receive different inputs and have differential projection targets, the <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> of phasic changes in dopamine has important implications for information flow through the striatum and plasticity that underlies learning and goal-directed behavior.

To test whether vasopressin can influence neuronal development by acting on the outgrowth of neuronal processes, we determined the neurotrophic action of the memory-enhancing peptide, vasopressin, in neurons derived from the cerebral cortex, a site of integrative cognitive function and long-term memory. Exposure to V 1 receptor agonist significantly increased multiple features of nerve cell morphology, including neurite length, number of branches, branch length, number of branch bifurcation points and number of microspikes. The dose–response profile of V 1 receptor agonist-induced neurotrophism exhibited a biphasic function, with lower concentrations inducing a significant increase while higher concentrations generally induced no significant effect. The neurotrophic effect of V 1 receptor activation did not require growth factors present in serum. Analysis of the <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> of the vasopressin-induced neurotrophic effect revealed significant V 1 receptor agonist-induced neurotrophism in occipital and parietal neurons, whereas frontal and temporal neurons were unresponsive. Results of experiments to determine the mechanism of vasopressin-induced neurotrophism demonstrated that vasopressin-induced neurotrophism is dependent on V 1 a receptor activa-tion, requires L-type calcium channel activation and activation of both pathways of the phosphatidylinositol signaling cascade, inositol trisphosphate and protein kinase C.

Treatment with okadaic acid led to a rapid and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1 and ERK 2 (p 44 / 42 (mapk)). The phosphorylation was markedly reduced after treatment of the cultures with the microbial alkaloid K- 252 a (a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor) or the MAP kinase kinase (MEK 1 / 2) inhibitor PD 98059. K- 252 a and PD 98059 also ameliorated the okadaic acid-induced cell death. Inhibitors of protein kinase C, Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, or tyrosine kinase were ineffective. These results indicate that sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway, as seen after e. g., ischemia, may selectively harm specific subsets of neurons. The susceptibility to MAP kinase activation of the CA 3 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells may {{provide insight into the}} observed relationship between cerebral ischemia and dementia in Alzheimer's disease...|$|E
40|$|The N-glycosylation {{pattern of}} the neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM), isolated from brains of newborn mice, has been analyzed. Following digestion with trypsin, generated glycopeptides were fractionated by serial immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing polysialic acid (PSA) units or the HNK 1 -carbohydrate epitope. Subsequent analyses of the resulting (glyco) peptides by Edman degradation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) revealed polysialylated glycans to be exclusively linked to glycosylation sites 5 (Asn 431) and 6 (Asn 460), whereas glycans carrying the HNK 1 -epitope could be assigned to sites 2 (Asn 297), 5, 6, and, to a lesser extent, site 3 (Asn 329). PSA-, HNK 1 -, and non-PSA/HNK 1 -glycan fractions were characterized by carbohydrate constituent and methylation analyses as well as MALDI-TOF-MS in conjunction with chromatographic fractionation techniques. The results revealed that the core structures of PSA-glycans represented predominantly fucosylated, partially sulfated 2, 6 -branched isomers of triantennary as well as tetraantennary complex-type glycans, whereas carbohydrate chains bearing the HNK 1 -epitope were dominated by diantennary species carrying in part bisecting GlcNAc residues. Non-PSA/HNK 1 -glycans exhibited a highly heterogeneous pattern of partially truncated, mostly diantennary structures being characterized {{by the presence of}} additional fucose, bisecting GlcNAc and/or sulfate residues. In conclusion, our results revealed that the glycosylation pattern of murine NCAM displays high structural and <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity,</b> which might {{play an important role in}} controlling the biological activities of this molecul...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; Batten disease) are collectively {{the most}} {{frequent}} autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disease of childhood, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Several lines of evidence have highlighted the important role that non-somatic compartments of neurons (axons and synapses) play in the instigation and progression of NCL pathogenesis. Here, we report a progressive breakdown of axons and synapses in the brains of two different mouse models of NCL: Ppt 1 −/− model of infantile NCL and Cln 6 nclf model of variant late-infantile NCL. Synaptic pathology {{was evident in the}} thalamus and cortex of these mice, but occurred much earlier within the thalamus. Quantitative comparisons of expression levels for a subset of proteins previously implicated in regulation of axonal and synaptic vulnerability revealed changes in proteins involved with synaptic function/stability and cell-cycle regulation in both strains of NCL mice. Protein expression changes were present at pre/early-symptomatic stages, occurring in advance of morphologically detectable synaptic or axonal pathology and again displayed <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity,</b> occurring first within the thalamus and only later in the cortex. Although significant differences in individual protein expression profiles existed between the two NCL models studied, 2 of the 15 proteins examined (VDAC 1 and Pttg 1) displayed robust and significant changes at pre/early-symptomatic time-points in both models. Our study demonstrates that synapses and axons are important early pathological targets in the NCLs and has identified two proteins, VDAC 1 and Pttg 1, with the potential for use as in vivo biomarkers of pre/early-symptomatic axonal and synaptic vulnerability in the NCLs...|$|E
40|$|Small-conductance Ca(2 +) -activated K(+) {{channels}} (SK channels) {{underlie the}} prolonged postspike afterhyperpolarization (AHP) observed in many central neurons and {{play an important}} role in modulating neuronal activity. However, a lack of specific and reversible blockers of these channels hampers their study in various experimental conditions. Because previous work has shown that bicuculline salts block these channels, we examined whether related alkaloids, namely laudanosine quaternary derivatives, would produce similar effects. Intracellular recordings were performed on rat midbrain dopaminergic neurons and hippocampus CA 1 pyramidal cells. Binding experiments were performed on rat cerebral cortex membranes. Laudanosine, methyl-laudanosine, and ethyl-laudanosine blocked the apamin-sensitive AHP of dopaminergic neurons with mean IC(50) values of 152, 15, and 47 microM, respectively. The benzyl and butyl derivatives were less potent. Methyl-laudanosine had no effect on the I(h) current, action potential parameters, or membrane resistance of dopaminergic cells, or on the decrease in input resistance induced by muscimol, indicating a lack of antagonism at GABA(A) receptors. Interestingly, 100 microM methyl-laudanosine induced a significant increase in spiking frequency of dopaminergic neurons but not of CA 1 pyramidal cells, suggesting the possibility of <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity.</b> Binding experiments on laudanosine derivatives were in good agreement with electrophysiological data. Moreover, methyl-laudanosine has no affinity for voltage-gated potassium channels, and its affinity for SK channels (IC(50) 4 microM) is superior to its affinity for muscarinic (IC(50) 114 microM) and neuronal nicotinic (IC(50) > or = 367 microM) receptors. Methyl-laudanosine may be a valuable pharmacological tool to investigate the role of SK channels in various experimental models. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Vabicaserin is {{a potent}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 C agonist that is cur-rently being {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} the psychotic symp-toms of schizophrenia. In this study, in vitro and in vivo metab-olism of vabicaserin was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, and the structures of the metabolites were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrome-try and NMR spectroscopy. Vabicaserin underwent three major metabolic pathways in vitro: NADPH-dependent hydroxylation, NADPH-independent imine formation, and carbamoyl glucuronida-tion. After a single oral dose, vabicaserin was extensively metab-olized in animals and humans, and its metabolites were mainly excreted via the urine in mice and rats. Along with the metabolites observed in vitro, secondary metabolism via oxidation and conju-gation of the primary metabolites generated from the above-mentioned three pathways yielded a number of additional metab-olites in vivo. Carbamoyl glucuronidation was the major metabolic pathway in humans but a minor pathway in rats. Although car-bamoyl glucuronidation was a major metabolic pathway in mice, dogs, and monkeys, oxidative metabolism was also extensive in these species. Hydroxylation occurred in all species, although dif-ferent <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> was apparent. The imine pathway also appeared to be common to several species, because vabicaserin imine was observed in humans and hydroxyl imine metabolites were observed in mice, rats, and dogs. A nitrone metabolite of vabicaserin was observed in dogs and humans but not in other species. In conclusion, the major metabolic pathways for vabi-caserin in humans and nonclinical safety species include car-bamoyl glucuronidation, hydroxylation, formation of an imine, and a nitrone...|$|E
40|$|Repeated, {{high-dose}} methamphetamine (METH) administrations cause persistent dopaminergic {{deficits in}} rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. In rats, this treatment also causes {{the formation of}} high-molecular mass (greater than approximately 120 kDa) dopamine transporter (DAT) -associated complexes, the loss of DAT monomer immunoreactivity, {{and a decrease in}} DAT function, as assessed in striatal synaptosomes prepared 24 h after METH treatment. The present study extends these findings by demonstrating the <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> of DAT complex formation and monomer loss because these changes in DAT immunoreactivity were not observed in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, DAT complex formation was not a consequence limited to METH treatment because it was also caused by intrastriatal administration of 6 -hydroxydopamine. Pretreatment with the D 2 receptor antagonist, eticlopride [S-(-) - 3 -chloro- 5 -ethyl-N-[(1 -ethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinyl) methyl]- 6 -hydroxy- 2 -methoxybenzamide hydrochloride], but not the D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 [R(+) - 7 -chloro- 8 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro- 1 H- 3 -benzazepine hydrochloride], attenuated METH-induced DAT complex formation. Eticlopride pretreatment also attenuated METH-induced DAT monomer loss and decreases in DAT function; however, the attenuation was much less pronounced than the effect on DAT complex formation. Finally, results also revealed a negative correlation between METH-induced DAT complex formation and DAT activity. Taken together, these data further elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the functional consequences of repeated administrations of METH on the DAT protein. Furthermore, these data suggest a multifaceted role for D 2 receptors in mediating METH-induced alterations of the DAT and its function...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} activation resulting from direct dopaminergic stimulation {{can be detected}} using auto-radiography, positron emission tomography (PET) or, potentially, fMRI techniques. To establish {{the validity of the}} latter possibility, we have performed a number of experiments. We measured the <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> of two different dopaminergic ligands: the dopamine release compound D-amphetamine and the dopamine transporter antagonist 2 beta-carbomethoxy- 3 beta-(4 -fluoropheny) tropane (CFT). Both compounds led to increased signal intensity in gradient echo images in regions of the brain with high dopamine receptor density (frontal cortex, striatum, cingulate cortex 3 ̆e 3 ̆e parietal cortex). Lesioning the animals with unilaterally administered 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) led to ablation of the phMRI response on the ipsilateral side; control measurements of rCBV and rCBF using bolus injections of Gd-DTPA showed that the baseline rCBV and rCBF values were intact on the lesioned side. The time course of the BOLD signal changes paralleled the changes observed by microdialysis measurements of dopamine release in the striatum for both amphetamine and CFT; peaking at 20 - 40 min after injection and returning to baseline at about 70 - 90 min. Signal changes were not correlated with either heart rate, blood pressure or pCO 2. Measurement of PET binding in the same animals showed an excellent correlation with the phMRI data when compared by either measurements of the number of pixels activated or percent signal change in a given region. The time course for the behavioral measurements of rotation in the 6 -OHDA lesioned animals correlated with the phMRI. These experiments demonstrate that phMRI will become a valuable, noninvasive tool for investigation of neurotransmitter activity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) improves motor symptoms in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, yet the mechanism of action remains unclear. Previous studies indicate that STN DBS increases regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in immediate downstream targets but does not reveal which brain regions may have functional changes associated with improved motor manifestations. We studied 48 patients with STN DBS who withheld medication overnight and underwent PET scans to measure rCBF responses to bilateral STN DBS. PET scans were performed with bilateral DBS OFF and ON in a counterbalanced order followed by clinical ratings of motor manifestations using Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale 3 (UPDRS 3). We investigated whether improvement in UPDRS 3 scores in rigidity, bradykinesia, postural stability and gait correlate with rCBF responses in a priori determined regions. These regions were selected based on a previous study showing significant STN DBS-induced rCBF change in the thalamus, midbrain and supplementary motor area (SMA). We also chose the pedunculopontine nucleus region (PPN) due to mounting evidence of its involvement in locomotion. In the current study, bilateral STN DBS improved rigidity (62 %), bradykinesia (44 %), gait (49 %) and postural stability (56 %) (paired t-tests: P < 0. 001). As expected, bilateral STN DBS also increased rCBF in the bilateral thalami, right midbrain, and decreased rCBF in the right premotor cortex (P < 0. 05, corrected). There were significant correlations between improvement of rigidity and decreased rCBF in the SMA (rs = – 0. 4, P < 0. 02) and between improvement in bradykinesia and increased rCBF in the thalamus (rs = 0. 31, P < 0. 05). In addition, improved postural reflexes correlated with decreased rCBF in the PPN (rs = – 0. 38, P < 0. 03). These modest correlations between selective motor manifestations and rCBF in specific regions suggest possible <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> for improvement of different motor signs of Parkinson's disease...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose]: F 15599, a novel 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 1 A {{receptor}} agonist with 1000 -fold selectivity for 5 -HT {{compared with other}} monoamine receptors, shows antidepressant and procognitive activity at very low doses in animal models. We examined the in vivo activity of F 15599 at somatodendritic autoreceptors and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A heteroreceptors. [Experimental approach]: In vivo single unit and local field potential recordings and microdialysis in the rat. [Key results]:  F 15599 increased the discharge rate of pyramidal neurones in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) from 0. 2 µg·kg− 1 i. v and reduced that of dorsal raphe 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic neurones at doses > 10 -fold higher (minimal effective dose 8. 2 µg·kg− 1 i. v.). Both effects were reversed by the 5 -HT 1 A antagonist (±) WAY 100635. F 15599 did not alter low frequency oscillations (∼ 1 Hz) in mPFC. In microdialysis studies, F 15599 increased dopamine output in mPFC (an effect dependent on the activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors) with an ED 50 of 30 µg·kg− 1 i. p., whereas it reduced hippocampal 5 -HT release (an effect dependent exclusively on 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptor activation) with an ED 50 of 240 µg·kg− 1 i. p. Likewise, application of F 15599 by reverse dialysis in mPFC increased dopamine output in a concentration-dependent manner. All neurochemical responses to F 15599 were prevented by administration of (±) WAY 100635. [Conclusions and implications]:  These results indicate that systemic administration of F 15599 preferentially activates postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in PFC rather than somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors. This <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> distinguishes F 15599 from previously developed 5 -HT 1 A {{receptor agonist}}s, which preferentially activate somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors, suggesting that F 15599 may be particularly useful {{in the treatment of}} depression and of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

40|$|The micro-architecture of the {{substantia nigra}} was studied in control cases of varying age and {{patients}} with parkinsonism. A single 7 p section stained with haematoxylin and eosin was examined {{at a specific}} level within the caudal nigra using strict criteria. The pars compacts was divided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, and each tier was further subdivided into 3 regions. In 36 control cases there was a linear fallout of pigmented neurons with advancing age in the pars compacta of the caudal substantia nigra {{at a rate of}} 4. 7 % per decade. Regionally, the lateral ventral tier was relatively spared (2. 1 % loss per decade) compared with the medial ventral tier (5. 4 %) and the dorsal tier (6. 9 %). In 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases of varying disease duration there was an exponential loss of pigmented neurons with a 45 % loss in the first decade. Regionally, the pattern was opposite to ageing. Loss was greatest in the lateral ventral tier (average loss 91 %) followed by the medial ventral tier (71 %) and the dorsal tier (56 %). The presymptomatic phase of PD from the onset of neuronal loss was estimated to be about 5 yrs. This phase is represented by incidental Lewy body cases: individuals who die without clinical signs of PD or dementia, but who are found to have Lewy bodies at post-mortem. In 7 cases cell loss was confined to the lateral ventral tier (average loss 52 %) congruent with the lateral ventral selectivity of symptomatic PD. It was calculated that at the onset of symptoms there was a 68 % cell loss in the lateral ventral tier and a 48 % loss in the caudal nigra as a whole. The <b>regional</b> <b>selectivity</b> of PD is relatively specific. In 15 cases of striatonigral degeneration the distribution of cell loss was similar, but the loss in the dorsal tier was greater than PD by 21 %. In 14 cases of Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) there was no predilection for the lateral ventral tier, but a tendency to involve the medial nigra and spare the lateral. These findings suggest that age-related attrition of pigmented nigra] cells is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD...|$|E
