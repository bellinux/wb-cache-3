25|$|To further complicate matters, it {{has been}} noted that Gene Roddenberry was {{something}} of a revisionist when it came to canon. People who worked with Roddenberry <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> used to handle canon not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point non-canon.|$|E

Kilala and Rei go {{to the world of}} The Little Mermaid. Unlike their trip to Snow White's world, however, they retain their true clothes, but are able to breathe underwater. Ariel, Flounder, Spot, Sebastian and Scuttle help Kilala find a sick Rei. While Kilala and Ariel set off to find white crown seaweed to cure Rei, he is later {{captured}} by Ursula who intends to marry him and become a Queen. Kilala sets off to find Ursula's lair. Ursula tells her that Rei is really a Prince and should marry a suitable bride. An injured Flounder tells Ariel of Kilala and Rei's situation; Ariel then attempts to make her way to Kilala, but Flounder collapses out of exhaustion. Ariel then remembers what she'd learned about love, and sang to encourage Kilala to fight further. with encouragement from Ariel's song, Kilala defeats Ursula with the Tiara- She questions Rei about his identity as a prince and he confirms that he is a Prince of somewhere he can't remember, but he is still himself. Ariel gives Kilala an aquamarine gemstone as token to their friendship, which turns {{out to be one of}} the magic gems to be acquired by the Tiara. Kilala's parents come home from Paradiso after their long absence, only to tell Kilala that the kingdom is under attack and they barely got out. This makes Rei <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is actually the Prince of Paradiso and questions why he couldn't remember something so important before. He gives Kilala the Tiara and promises to return for it soon. He leaves on a ship back to Paradiso.|$|E

500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers {{to him as}} only [...] "Smokey", which causes Pam to believe {{he is talking about}} Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears". Pam, however, is later able to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sang [...] "Tears of a Clown", and Jim references [...] "I Second That Emotion". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is [...] "not what Smokey would have… does want!" [...] During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular music is not all about [...] "Jason Mraz and The Beatles", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] and [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs.|$|E

500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had forgot all about it".|$|E
2500|$|By 1909, Henry's {{poor health}} {{had become a}} serious concern for his parents. He was very small for his age and was prone to get very {{aggressive}} colds.

2500|$|At a party held at Simmons' {{residence}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles {{to celebrate the}} success of The Robe, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, {{who at the time}} was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being [...] "rather full of himself. I seem to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never stopped talking, and I had given him the cold fish eye." [...] Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: [...] "I never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theodore Decker of the Columbus Dispatch, {{the daily}} {{newspaper}} in Columbus, Ohio, where Cornell {{was due to}} play his next show, noted that Ian Curtis, lead singer of the British post-punk band Joy Division, whom Cornell had said in a 1994 Rolling Stone interview was popular {{with the members of}} Soundgarden, took his life on May 18, 1980, exactly 37 years before Cornell and by the same method. Curtis, known for lyrics that, as Cornell's sometimes had, explored despair and depression, had become legendary as a result after his death, Decker recalled. However, Stephen Morris, one of Curtis's bandmates (who later became New Order) recalled Curtis not as the [...] "brooding rock deity" [...] Decker said he became posthumously but as [...] "an ordinary bloke just like you or me." [...] Decker recalled the other deaths of musicians who had risen from Seattle's grunge scene in the early 1990s and called on Cornell's fans to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> too, was a human being who might still be alive if he had gotten the help he needed.|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} I was {{learning}} it for the first time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
