5000|$|Although both {{pilots were}} based in Zürich and the CVR picks up Lutz's query to Loehrer about Loehrer's {{familiarity}} with [...] "the 28 approach", which Loehrer confirmed he had, Lutz put the plane into an overly-steep descent that brought flight 3597 to MDA far too soon. When Loehrer reported the plane reaching 100 feet above MDA, the CVR records Lutz asking Loehrer, [...] "Do we have ground contact?" [...] Loehrer hesitated before replying [...] "Yes". However, flight simulators programmed {{with the time}} of day, terrain, and weather Lutz was facing at that time allowed investigators to determine that the only ground Lutz or Loehrer {{could see was the}} ground of the hilly terrain over which the plane was flying. Upon reaching MDA of 2400 ft, Lutz declared that he had [...] "ground contact" [...] and would continue on, then deliberately descended the plane below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway, a major piloting error that ultimately led directly to the crash. The fact that Loehrer made no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude also directly contributed to the crash. Lutz made an additional error by not monitoring his Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) as he made his approach; the CVR recorded Lutz's running narrative on nearly every move he made in the cockpit, but did not record any readout of the DME after a check, verified by Loehrer, at [...] from runway 28. Moments before the crash, Lutz's running commentary indicated to investigators that Lutz must have thought he was at or near [...] from runway 28 because he said [...] "Someone said he saw the runway late here". Instead, Lutz was over [...] from the runway, and could not possibly have seen the runway due to the presence of a hill, below the MDA of 2400 ft, that would have obscured his view. It was into this hill that Flight 3597 eventually crashed. Just before the crash, the synthetic voice of the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) announced the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> <b>reading</b> 500 feet above ground. Immediately thereafter Lutz exclaimed [...] "*****, two miles he said, he sees the runway". A few seconds later Lutz said [...] "Two thousand" [...] and then one second later the synthetic voice gave the [...] "minimums" [...] GPWS message, which was triggered by the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> <b>reading</b> at 300 feet. Even though Lutz finally realized that his inability to see the runway meant he needed to initiate a missed approach maneuver (called a [...] "Go-around"), his call for the go-around came too late; the plane's engines were not able to spool up fast enough to generate sufficient thrust to climb above the hill that had been obstructing his view, and it crashed into the hilltop at 22:06 CET.|$|E
2500|$|While {{on final}} {{approach}} for landing, the aircraft was about 2,000ft (610m) above ground, when the left-hand (captain's) <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> suddenly changed from [...] to read [...] altitude, although the right-hand (co-pilot's) <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> functioned correctly. The voice recording {{showed that the}} crew was given an audible warning signal ("TOO LOW!, GEAR!") that indicated that the aircraft's landing gear should be down, as the aircraft was, according to the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter,</b> flying too low. Later, the safety board's preliminary report modified this analysis, indicating that the flight data recorder history of the captain's <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> showed 8191 feet (the maximum possible recorded) until the aircraft descended through 1950, then suddenly showed negative 8 feet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{are used}} in various applications such as civil and military surveillance, law enforcement, and support in natural disasters {{as well as in}} hazardous environments. Approaching and landing are necessary steps for all UAVs, indicating that <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> are needed. In this paper, a <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> based on an antenna array is proposed. Our solution allows some improvements over the traditional <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> such as more precise altitude estimation, ground imaging without the need of side looking radar, mapping the obstacles positions and detecting the ground inclination and topology. Another important contribution of this paper is a review of traditional <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> along with a performance comparison between the level-crossing detection and the digital signal processing frequency detection- which is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm.

5000|$|The <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> first {{showed up}} in the German Junkers Ju-87 [...] "Stuka" [...] dive bomber which was {{equipped}} with one for automatic pullouts in the dive bomb run which usually consisted of an 80-90 degree dive. The Stuka pilot would set the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> to 750m which was connected to the bomb release and automatic pull out. The <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> would drop the bombs and pull the Stuka out of the dive at the set altitude to a level flight. This was invented because the pilots would black out on the pull out, usually for 2 to 5 seconds.|$|R

5000|$|Investigators then analyse the {{contents}} of the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder. The BEA realized that before Flight 3275 impacted terrain, the GPWS warning didn't sound at all. When it was delivered, the aircraft was equipped with a GPWS computer. During the check flight conducted by a mixed Aérospatiale/ Si Fly crew, it was noted that the GPWS generated warning alarms during landing. The computer was therefore replaced. During the month of September, Si Fly ordered a GPWS computer from ATR after its old GPWS went faulty. Si Fly informed ATR that despite the replacement of the computer, the GPWS was still not working properly and the [...] "FAULT" [...] indication was still [...] "ON". Suspecting that the failure might originate in the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter,</b> SI Fly also requested that ATR send them a new <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter.</b> A <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> was sent to Si Fly on 8 October 1999. The faulty GPWS caught investigators attention. Simulations undertaken during the investigation both by the aircraft manufacturer and the equipment maker showed that the alarms should have been set off during the last thirty seconds of flight. Such alarms might have led the crew to react and avoid a collision with the high ground. Consequently, the aircraft was flying with an inoperative or disconnected GPWS, and the crew must have been aware of this situation.|$|R
