5|$|By 28 October 1850 {{the final}} section of the main line to Carlisle was {{completed}} by the GD, and trains began to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Carlisle; evidently the difficulty with the Caledonian Railway from Gretna southwards had been resolved.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1932 the District {{service from}} Acton Town to South Harrow was {{withdrawn}} {{and one in}} three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow, the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge. On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields, continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933. District trains continued to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Hounslow off-peak, with a shuttle from South Acton.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the contractors who had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who had ridden the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E

5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Nadzab.|$|E
25|$|Of Metra's 11 routes, {{four are}} {{operated}} under contract. The BNSF Line service is operated by BNSF Railway. The lines {{out of the}} Ogilvie Transportation Center (formerly North Western Station) are operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. Lines not contracted are operated by the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation (NIRC), Metra's operating subsidiary. Inbound trains on every line at all times <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> their Chicago terminus, however, many outbound trains do not <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> their respective lines' terminus (for example, most trains on the Union Pacific/Northwest Line do not <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Harvard; instead, terminating at Crystal Lake).|$|E
25|$|These failures, {{combined}} with Signalman Meakin forgetting {{the presence of}} the local train which was standing in clear view of his signalbox, allowed the acceptance of the southbound troop train and the clearing of the signals for it to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Gretna, thereby causing the collision (at 6.49).|$|E

25|$|On 12 December 2006 {{the club}} {{announced}} their first major sponsorship agreement with French chimney manufacturers Poujoulat, {{in what was}} reported as potentially a six-figure deal. As {{a result of the}} contract, which was agreed to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> May 2008, the team was renamed as Poujoulat Heat Guildford to incorporate the sponsor’s name.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Tri-Rail {{began to}} upgrade its grade {{crossings}} to include raised medians and/or four quadrant gates to prevent cars from driving around {{them in an}} attempt to beat trains. This decreases accidents and allows the cities they <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> petition for them not to use their whistle between 10p.m. and 6a.m. They also decreased headways to 20 minutes during rush hours.|$|E
25|$|Lidford {{was chosen}} as the {{terminus}} because from there a connection with the SDR's Tavistock branch line could give LSWR trains access to Plymouth via Tavistock. However it was only on 17 May 1876 that the connection was made and trains could <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Plymouth. This was a broad gauge line so, as at Crediton, a third rail was added to create a mixed gauge route.|$|E

25|$|Shuttle {{trains to}} Springfield, Massachusetts connect with some Northeast Regional trains; other Northeast Regionals <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Springfield from New York or vice versa. These through trains must change {{locomotives}} at New Haven, as the track north to Springfield is not electrified, unlike the Northeast Corridor. The locomotive change {{is from a}} Siemens ACS-64 in the electrified territory to a General Electric P42DC for the Springfield Line non-electrified territory, or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Garratts {{have several}} {{advantages}} when used on light and narrow gauge railways. They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or wyes. They {{do not need to be}} <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> terminals, increasing operational flexibility. Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and they can run over bridges or line sections that might not be able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|E
25|$|CERN {{originally}} planned that the LHC would <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of}} 2012, with a short break {{at the end of}} 2011 to allow for an increase in beam energy from 3.5 to 4TeV per beam. At the end of 2012 the LHC was planned to get shut down until around 2015 to allow upgrade to a planned beam energy of 7TeV per beam. In late 2012, in light of the July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the shutdown was postponed for some weeks into early 2013, to allow additional data to be obtained prior to shutdown.|$|E

25|$|The city is on Napier Hill and the {{surrounding}} Heretaunga Plains at the southeastern edge of Hawke Bay, a large semi-circular bay that dominates {{the east coast of}} New Zealand's North Island. The coastline of the city was substantially altered by a large earthquake in 1931. The topography puts Napier in danger from a tsunami, as the centre of the commercial city is near sea level – should the sea ever crest Marine Parade the sea would <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Ahuriri. Furthermore, by virtue of its pre 1931 existence, the bulk of Napier is susceptible to soil liquefaction, the risk classed as Very High for the main urban area excluding the hill.|$|E
25|$|The next year, Ince {{had another}} {{successful}} {{season with the}} nerazzurri, scoring 6 times in 24 matches in the championship – in which Inter finished third – and also playing his part in Inter's <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> the UEFA Cup Final. Ince scored {{in the third round}} second-leg match away to Boavista as Inter swept all before them before meeting Schalke 04 in the final. Ince didn't play in the away first-leg as Inter lost 1–0 but he returned to the line-up for the home match which the Italians won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Iván Zamorano. Penalties were again a heart breaker for Ince though, as Schalke won 4–1 in the resulting penalty shoot-out.|$|E
25|$|A {{single line}} {{link to the}} South Eastern Railway's Tunbridge Wells station was opened to {{passengers}} in 1876. The line from Uckfield was double tracked in 1894 and {{the completion of the}} Withyham spur between Ashurst and Birchden Junction enabled London services to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Uckfield or down the Cuckoo Line without reversing at Groombridge. However, little use was made until 1914. The spur completed what was called the Outer Circle line, which provided an alternative route between Brighton and London via Oxted. The line was also the only subsidiary cross-country double line in East Sussex and, as it did not figure in Southern Railway's electrification programme in the 1930s, it was the last steam-operated line in the area.|$|E

25|$|An LBSCR {{goods service}} first used the spur from about 1867, but the {{introduction}} of a passenger service was delayed until 1 February 1876. Even by 1894, only 5 passenger services and 1 goods train were using the spur in a down direction from the Central station. Usage did however increase when the Southern Railway took over the line following the grouping and in 1924, 9 down passenger services used it. By 1952, this had increased to 13, and in 1958, to 29 plus one goods service each way, which made the spur one of the busiest single-track sections anywhere in the country. Through-running on the Cuckoo Line had been possible since 5 April 1880 when the LBSCR extended the line from Hailsham to Eridge which enabled services to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> Tunbridge Wells West.|$|E
25|$|From {{before the}} merger of Daimler into the BSA group the core of Daimler's {{management}} was formed by chairman Edward Manville, works manager Percy Martin, and sales manager Ernest Instone, who left Daimler in 1921 to start auto dealer Stratton-Instone, and was responsible for Daimler sales in England and Wales thereafter. Instone died in 1932, Manville died in 1933, and Martin, who in January 1934 replaced Alexander Roger, Manville's replacement, as chairman, retired in 1935. In May 1936 Laurence Pomeroy was fired as managing director of Daimler with immediate effect. Daimler was not paying dividends and the 1936 BSA shareholders' meetings were stormy. Attempted solutions had included the Lanchester acquisition {{and the introduction of}} smaller cars, the lower-priced 10hp Lanchester and its matching but six-cylinder stable-mate the Daimler Fifteen (later DB17 and DB18) introduced in the early thirties. This particular product line as the Lanchester Fourteen and Daimler Conquest was to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> almost the very end.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR {{bought the}} {{steamboat}} Cleopatra from Cornelius Vanderbilt, then {{known for his}} ferry empire, to cover the Long Island Sound crossing, and began operating to Stonington, Connecticut on August 10. Vanderbilt {{was elected to the}} LIRR board of directors on November 26. The opening of the Cobble Hill Tunnel along the Brooklyn and Jamaica west of downtown Brooklyn on December 3, 1844 decreased the grade to the waterfront and allowed locomotives to <b>run</b> <b>through</b> <b>to</b> South Ferry, eliminating a horse car transfer. The LIRR began operating the Worcester and New Haven steamboats in 1845, and established a second route to Boston via steamboat to Allyn's Point and the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and Boston and Worcester Railroad. But competition from the Hartford and New Haven Railroad (completed 1844) and steamboats from New York caused the LIRR to sell the Worcester and Cleopatra to the N in July 1846, and the early 1847 completion of the Fall River Line cut into profits enough that the New Haven was sold to Jacob Vanderbilt, ending Boston express service.|$|E
