40|$|Multiplexing {{techniques}} {{are suffering from}} major problem known as multiple access interference (MAI). A rejection interference called successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed in optical {{code division multiple access}} (Optical CDMA), which has the potential to reduce the effect of MAI and therefore can increase the capacity of optical CDMA systems and improve its performance. The basic principle of SIC scheme is that, detection is carried out in multiple stages and during each stage, only the most reliable symbols are selected. In subsequent stages, the interference contributed by the already detected symbols will be removed. In this project we theoretically analyzed direct sequence (DS) optical CDMA system based on SIC scheme using pulse position modulation (PPM) signaling, considering the interference between the users, imperfection cancellation occurred during the cancellation process and <b>receiver</b> <b>noises.</b> In addition, balanced detection scheme known as spectral amplitude coding (SAC) is used to suppress the overlapping between the users and reduce the <b>receiver</b> <b>noises</b> effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{requirements}} for receiving antennas are less stringent, because the transmitter power is generally high to overcome atmospheric noise. Atmospheric noise and not <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> determines the receiver {{signal to noise}} ratio, so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used. Loop antennas are often used for reception.|$|E
50|$|The <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> {{temperature}} is calibrated {{at the start}} of every observing shift by measuring the difference in receiver response to ambient temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature loads. The loads are made of Eccosorb, a carbon-impregnated foam highly absorbent to microwaves and cone-shaped to prevent direct reflection of LO back to the feed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{theoretically}} analyse optical {{code division}} multiple access (OCDMA) system that based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) using pulse position modulation (PPM), considering the interference between the users, imperfection cancellation occurred during the cancellation process and <b>receiver</b> <b>noises.</b> Spectral amplitude coding (SAC) scheme is used to suppress the overlapping between the users and reduce the <b>receiver</b> <b>noises</b> effect. The theoretical analysis of the multiple access interference (MAI) -limited performance of this approach indicates the influence of the size of M-ary PPM on OCDMA system. The OCDMA system performance improves with increasing M-ary PPM. Therefore, {{it was found that the}} SIC/SAC-OCDMA system using PPM technique along with modified prime (MPR) codes used as signature sequence code offers significant improvement over the one without cancellation and it can support up to 103 users at the benchmarking value of bit error rate (BER) = 10 – 9 with prime number p = 11 while the system without cancellation scheme can support only up to 52 users...|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} this formula is that the overall noise figure of a radio receiver is primarily established by the noise figure of its first amplifying stage. Subsequent stages have a diminishing effect on signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason, the first stage amplifier in a receiver is often called the low-noise amplifier (LNA).

50|$|In {{the radar}} receiver, the {{returning}} echoes are typically {{received by the}} antenna, amplified, down-converted and then passed through detector circuitry that extracts the envelope of the signal (known as the video signal). This video signal {{is proportional to the}} power of the received echo and comprises the wanted echo signal and the unwanted power from internal <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> and external clutter and interference.|$|E

The arrays are cooled to 18K and use low-noise Indium Phosphide (InP) {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) preamplifiers designed at UMass to provide a characteristic <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> of 55K in the range 85-107 GHz, increasing to 90K at 116 GHz.|$|E

We compare the performances of W/T MPR code with and without hard-limiter and show that significant performance improvement {{can be achieved by}} using hard-limiters in the receivers. In broadcast channels, MAI is the dominant source of noise. Hence the performance analysis is carried out considering only MAI and other <b>receiver</b> <b>noises</b> are neglected...|$|R
50|$|According to {{the radio}} designer, intelligible speech can be {{detected}} 12 dB above the <b>receiver's</b> <b>noise</b> floor (noise and distortion). Regardless of how accurate this output power is regarding intelligible speech, having a standard output SINAD allows easy comparison between radio receiver input sensitivities. This 0.25 μV value is typical for VHF commercial radio, while 0.35 μV is probably more typical for UHF. In the real world, lower SINAD values (more noise) can still result in intelligible speech, but it is tiresome work {{to listen to a}} voice in that much noise.|$|R

This system ensured a dynamic range in excess of 120 dB.|$|E
50|$|The DASI was {{a compact}} {{interferometer}} {{made up of}} 13 small telescope elements in a pattern with three lines of symmetry. Each of the 13 telescopes had a 20 cm lensed corrugated horn, with a corrugated shroud to reduce crosstalk between the antennae. Each of the telescopes had a high-electron-mobility transistor (|HEMT) amplifier working at the frequencies 26-36 GHz (Ka band), cryogenically cooled to about 10K. The <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> temperatures ranged from 15K-26K at band centre, and 30K at the edges. The overall system temperature reached about 26K.|$|E
50|$|Noise {{levels are}} usually viewed in {{opposition}} to signal levels and so are often {{seen as part of}} a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Telecommunication systems strive to increase the ratio of signal level to noise level in order to effectively transmit data. In practice, if the transmitted signal falls below the level of the noise (often designated as the noise floor) in the system, data can no longer be decoded at the <b>receiver.</b> <b>Noise</b> in telecommunication systems is a product of both internal and external sources to the system.|$|E
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{examples in}} the sequel only treat the APA design based on the successive approximation (SA) without including comparison with the APA design under Algorithm 1 and the UPA scheme. Nevertheless, in all the instances, the SA-based design closely achieves {{the performance of the}} design in Algorithm 1 and outperforms the UPA scheme except in a symmetric case where both designs (APA and UPA) converge. In the symmetric case, the correlations, variances of the observation and the <b>receiver</b> <b>noises,</b> and the channel gains are same across all sensors.|$|R
50|$|In ELF <b>receivers</b> <b>noise</b> in {{the signal}} is {{dominated}} by the large atmospheric noise in the band; Even the tiny signal captured by a small, inefficient receiving antenna contains noise that greatly exceeds the small amount of noise generated in the receiver itself. (Which is actually the case for all frequencies below about 1,500 kHz.) Because the outside noise is what limits reception, very little power from the antenna is needed for the intercepted signal to overwhelm the internal noise, and hence small receive antennas can be used with no disadvantage.|$|R
50|$|For thermal noise, its {{spectral}} density {{is given by}} N0 = kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant in joules per kelvin, and T is the <b>receiver</b> system <b>noise</b> temperature in kelvins.|$|R
50|$|While Beverage antennas have {{excellent}} directivity, {{because they are}} close to lossy Earth, they do not produce absolute gain; their gain is typically from −20 to −10 dBi. This is rarely a problem, because the antenna is used at frequencies where there are high levels of atmospheric radio noise. At these frequencies the atmospheric noise, and not <b>receiver</b> <b>noise,</b> determines the signal-to-noise ratio, so an inefficient antenna can be used. The antenna is not used as a transmitting antenna, since {{a large portion of}} the drive power is wasted in the terminating resistor. The Beverage antenna is a good receiving antenna because it offers excellent directivity over a broad bandwidth, albeit with relatively large size.|$|E
50|$|While the {{background}} and <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> in the assumed data model {{can be thought of}} as emanating from a large number of independent noise sources, the same is usually not the case for the emitter signals. It therefore appears natural to model the noise as a stationary Gaussian white random process whereas the signal waveforms are deterministic (arbitrary) and unknown. According to the Deterministic ML the signals are considered as unknown, deterministic quantities that need to be estimated in conjunction with the direction of arrival. This is a natural model for digital communication applications where the signals are far from being normal random variables, and where estimation of the signal is of equal interest.|$|E
50|$|The LO {{signal is}} {{generated}} by a Gunn diode oscillator whose frequency is controlled via a phase-lock loop system by a computer-controlled frequency synthesizer. The SIS mixer and the FET first stage amplifier are on the liquid helium-cooled cold stage of a vacuum dewar; {{the rest of the}} electronics are room temperature. Typical <b>receiver</b> <b>noise</b> temperatures at 115.3 GHz are 65-70 K single sideband (SSB). Although the performance improves somewhat to 55 K SSB if the helium dewar is pumped to 2.7 K, it is not standard observing procedure, because the sky noise at 115 GHz dominates at this level of receiver performance. On the best dry, cold days the total system temperatures are less than 350 K SSB, referred to above the atmosphere.|$|E
