5|$|The <b>Roundtable</b> on Sustainable Biofuels is an {{international}} initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists {{who are interested in}} the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the <b>Roundtable</b> used meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the <b>Roundtable</b> on Sustainable Biofuels {{launched}} {{a set of}} comprehensive sustainability criteria - the “RSB Certification System.” Biofuels producers that meet to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights.|$|E

As many readers are aware, the Center for Hospitality Research (CHR) has been sponsoring industry <b>roundtables</b> since spring 2002. The CHR <b>roundtables</b> focus either on a specific discipline or an industry segment. For example, during the 2006 - 2007 academic year, the CHR will sponsor discipline <b>roundtables</b> in human resources, labor and employment law, and marketing.

5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held a televised <b>roundtable</b> dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E

50|$|The Joint Initiative’s {{recommendations}} were informed by input gathered at Regional Ocean Leadership <b>Roundtables</b> convened in the U.S. Arctic and East, West, and Gulf Coasts. At these <b>roundtables,</b> the Joint Initiative brought together more than 250 local, state, tribal, and national leaders representing diverse industry, government, and nonprofit interests to identify creative solutions to critical ocean and coastal issues. Input from these <b>roundtables</b> is {{also reflected in}} the Ocean Action Agenda's suite of narrative stories, which highlight {{the importance of the}} oceans and Great Lakes to the lives of all Americans.|$|R
5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel <b>Roundtable</b> convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E
5|$|Beilein {{married the}} former Kathleen Griffin in 1978. The Beileins have three sons (Patrick, {{who played for}} his father at WVU and is the current head {{basketball}} coach at Le Moyne College; Mark, a former football player at Richmond and WVU grad who currently works for Alro Steel; and Andrew, a Michigan grad who currently works for the Business <b>Roundtable</b> in Washington, D.C.) and a daughter (Seana Hendricks). Patrick, who was the 2002 Virginia Independent Schools Division I Player of the Year, had intended to play at Richmond with his father, and instead went to West Virginia when his father moved there. Patrick was a 2008–2009 season graduate assistant coach at University of Michigan. He has since held posts as assistant coach at Dartmouth, Director of Men's Basketball Operations at Bradley University, and head coach of West Virginia Wesleyan College before his current role at Le Moyne.|$|E

5|$|In February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he {{was signed}} to play the {{character}} in up to nine films. Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a <b>roundtable</b> discussion with David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes, and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March Rourke signed on. Later that same day Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially The Avengers. In April, Garry Shandling, Clark Gregg, and Kate Mara joined the cast.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg {{launched}} the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is {{a consortium of}} Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford. A $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation was used to establish the NYC Media Lab. Each year, the lab will host a range of <b>roundtable</b> discussions between {{the private sector and}} academic institutions. It will support research projects on topics of content format, next-generation search technologies, computer animation for film and gaming, emerging marketing techniques, and new devices development. The lab will also create a media research and development database. Columbia University will coordinate the long-term direction of the media lab as well as the involvement of its faculty and those of other universities.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The <b>Roundtable</b> Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E

Following the implementation of Peer-to-Patent, the USPTO started exploring how to further integrate citizens into the patent application review process. They invited experts to present at two <b>roundtables</b> on using citizen submissions in prior art. Presenters at the <b>roundtables</b> included experienced representatives from Peer-to-Patent, Ask Patents, Patexia, and Article One Partners.
