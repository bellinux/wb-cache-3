5|$|Although each race {{is unique}} in its composition, no <b>race</b> <b>has</b> an innate {{advantage}} over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.|$|E

5|$|The <b>race</b> <b>has</b> {{been won}} 42 times by Cambridge and 30 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading Oxford in {{cumulative}} wins since 1966. The reserves <b>race</b> <b>has</b> been won 25 times by Cambridge and 20 times by Oxford, with Cambridge leading in cumulative wins since {{the inception of}} the race. The 2017 race took place on Sunday 2 April at 16:35 British Summer Time, an hour before the men's race. Cambridge won {{for the first time in}} five years after Oxford caught a crab at the start. They set a record on the new course, beating the time first set on this course in 2015 by over a minute. The time was faster, in different conditions, than the Cambridge men's Blue Boat in 2016 and the Oxford men's in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{places where}} earlier races could be {{won or lost}} include Doullens Hill, Arras, Carvin and the Wattignies bend. Some sections of cobbles have deteriorated beyond the point of safety and repair or have been resurfaced and lost their significance. Other sections are excluded because {{the route of the}} <b>race</b> <b>has</b> moved east.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{has led to}} the {{development}} of specialised frames, wheels and tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result. Despite the esteem of the race, some cyclists dismiss it because of its difficult conditions. The <b>race</b> <b>has</b> also seen several controversies, with winners disqualified.|$|E

5|$|Renault's victory {{contributed to}} an {{increase}} in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> become known as the first Grand Prix. The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the following year, and the German automobile industry to organise the Kaiserpreis, the forerunner to the German Grand Prix, in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. albirictus) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This <b>race</b> <b>has</b> a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 European Grand Prix (formally {{known as}} the 2016 Formula 1 Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 19 June 2016 at the Baku City Circuit in Baku, Azerbaijan. The race was the eighth round of the 2016 season, and marked the twenty-third running of the European Grand Prix as a round of the Formula One World Championship. It {{was the first time}} that the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> been held at the circuit and the first time that a Grand Prix has been held in Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|The inaugural {{event was}} held in Brussels in 2000. <b>Races</b> <b>have</b> since been held across the globe, from South Africa to Australia. It didn't arrive in the United States until 2006 (St. Louis), by which time 35 <b>races</b> <b>had</b> taken place.|$|R
2500|$|In 1962, Coon {{published}} The Origin of Races, wherein {{he proposed}} a polygenist view, that human <b>races</b> <b>had</b> evolved separately from local varieties of Homo erectus. Dividing humans into five main races, and argued that each evolved in parallel but at different rates, so that some <b>races</b> <b>had</b> reached higher levels of evolution than others. He argued that the Caucasoid <b>race</b> <b>had</b> evolved 200,000 {{years prior to the}} [...] "Congoid race", and hence represented a higher evolutionary stage.|$|R
50|$|This <b>race</b> <b>had</b> 20 {{cautions}} for 132 laps. The 20 cautions at {{the time}} tied a record for most cautions with the 1989 spring event at Bristol. However, this <b>race</b> <b>had</b> an additional 34 laps run under caution compared to the 1989 event.|$|R
5|$|The 2016 Spanish Grand Prix (formally {{known as}} the Formula 1 Gran Premio de España Pirelli 2016) was a Formula One motor race held on 15 May 2016 at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Montmeló, Spain. The race was the fifth round of the 2016 season, and marked the forty-sixth running of the Spanish Grand Prix as a round of the Formula One World Championship. It was the twenty-sixth time that the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> been held at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The 37th Boat Race, {{an annual}} {{side-by-side}} rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames, {{took place on}} 22 March 1880 following a postponement two days earlier {{as a result of}} thick fog. It is the only {{time in the history of}} the event that the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> been rescheduled. Oxford won by a margin of three-and-three-quarter lengths in a time of 21 minutes 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of technology {{by the human}} <b>race</b> <b>has</b> allowed the greater exploitation {{of natural resources and}} has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood. Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.|$|E
50|$|No {{geographic}} <b>races</b> <b>have</b> been described.|$|R
60|$|The Pointer, the Retriever, Bulldog, and the Terrier differ very greatly, and {{yet there}} is every reason to believe that every one of these <b>races</b> <b>has</b> arisen from the same source,--that all the most {{important}} <b>races</b> <b>have</b> arisen by this selective breeding from accidental variation.|$|R
50|$|Motor <b>racing</b> <b>has</b> {{a strong}} history {{on the coast}} with <b>racing</b> <b>having</b> been held in the region since 1954, but {{consistently}} since the late 1960s with only a small break in the late 1980s as well as hosting the region's largest event, the Gold Coast 600.|$|R
5|$|The race {{is limited}} to 45,000 runners and only runners who finish within 6½ hours are officially timed. Those wishing to {{participate}} can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery. Although the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> limited registration, exceptions include elite runners and charity representatives. Increasingly, local (e.g., Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital), national (e.g., American Cancer Society) and global (e.g., Global Business Assist, Team World Vision) charities and humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event {{as a means of}} fund raising.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> not been run since.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms <b>race</b> <b>has</b> produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael and starring Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human <b>race</b> <b>has</b> achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.|$|E
5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, was {{a story in the}} January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white <b>race,</b> <b>has</b> suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E
5|$|The {{team did}} not have any rider {{highlighted}} as a favorite entering the Giro di Lombardia; pre-race analyses held Gilbert as the man to beat. Zaugg rode {{at the front of the}} race the entire day, riding off the front to occupy first position as the solo leader on the Villa Vergano climb. He then maintained his advantage on the alternating flat sections and remaining climbs (the Muro dell'Alpino and the finishing climb in Lecco), holding on for victory ahead of 's Dan Martin and 's Joaquim Rodríguez by 8 seconds. The victory was not only Zaugg's first monument classic win, or even his first single-day win, it was his first professional victory of any kind, coming at age 30. Post-race analysis compared Zaugg's triumph to some of the more notable upsets to which the <b>race</b> <b>has</b> played host in its history.|$|E
