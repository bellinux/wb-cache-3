Unknown at the time, his {{precision}} daylight attacks had succeeded, {{first in}} Japan's immediate and inefficient dispersion of its aircraft engine industry, {{and later in}} terms of actual destruction caused by the final raid under his command. A more immediate legacy of his command was his creation, {{in conjunction with the}} U.S. Navy, of an effective air-sea <b>rescue</b> <b>system</b> that saved half of all B-29 crews downed at sea in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The police {{school was}} {{established}} in 1920 and the Governor of Svalbard was created in 1925. To increase the police force's flexibility, the municipal funding was cut and replaced with state funding in 1937. That year also saw the first two specialty agencies were created, the Police Surveillance Agency (later the Police Security Service) and the Mobile Police Service. After a border agreement was reached between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1949, the Norwegian Border Commission was established the following year. The Criminal Investigation Service {{was established in}} 1959, and the search and <b>rescue</b> <b>system</b> with two joint coordination centers and sub-centers for each police district was created in 1970.|$|E
25|$|A {{rescue disk}} that is bootable, {{such as a}} CD or USB storage device, {{can be used to}} run {{antivirus}} software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A bootable antivirus disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed antivirus software. Examples of some of these bootable disks include the Avira AntiVir <b>Rescue</b> <b>System,</b> PCTools Alternate Operating System Scanner, and AVG Rescue CD. The AVG Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is bootable on newer computers.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{accident}} {{happened during the}} day and there were people present in the proximity of the track, the rescue units were notified about the situation almost instantly. The first rescue unit, which consisted of firefighters stationed in Studénka, arrived at {{the accident}} site only seven minutes after the alarm was issued. There were a total of 20 firefighter rescue units (altogether 100 firefighters and 40 firefighter engines) rescuing the passengers. Twenty ambulances together with helicopters transported the injured into all the nearest hospitals in Ostrava, Nový Jičín, Frýdek-Místek, Opava, Bílovec, Olomouc and Valašské Meziříčí. Thanks to cooperation within the Integrated <b>rescue</b> <b>system</b> (Integrovaný záchranný systém), all the injured were in the hospitals within two hours of the accident.|$|E
500|$|The {{sky hook}} used to rescue Bond {{at the end}} of the film was a <b>rescue</b> <b>system</b> used by the United States {{military}} at the time. At Thunderballs release, there was confusion as to whether a rebreather such as the one that appears in the film existed; most Bond gadgets, while implausible, often are based upon real technology. In the real world, a rebreather could not be so small, as it has no room for the breathing bag, while the alternative open-circuit scuba releases exhalation bubbles, which the film device does not. It was made with two CO2 bottles glued together and painted, with a small mouthpiece attached. For this reason, when the Royal Corps of Engineers asked Peter Lamont how long a man could use the device underwater, the answer was [...] "As long as you can hold your breath." ...|$|E

[...] Meyer and Nothdurft died in an avalanche on their descent of the Eiger's west face after completing the 14th ascent of the north face (they had left the injured Corti with all their provisions—including a small tent—and were trying to descend from the mountain and call rescue).
