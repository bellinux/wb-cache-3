40|$|Background: Aircrews {{are often}} exposed to high ambient sound levels, {{especially}} in military aviation. Since long-term exposure to such noise may cause hearing damage, selection of adequate hearing protective devices is crucial. Such devices also affect speech intelligibility. When speech intelligibility and hearing protection lead to conflicting requirements, a compromise must be reached. The selection of personal equipment for RNLAF Chinook aircrews {{is taken as}} an example of this process. Methods: Sound attenuation offered by aircrew helmets and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> was measured using a standardized method. Sound attenuation results were used to calculate sound exposure. Objective predictions of speech intelligibility were calculated using the Speech Transmission Index (STI) method. Subjective preference was investigated through a survey among 28 experienced aircrew members. Results: The use of <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> in addition to a (RNLAF standard) helmet may lead to a significant reduction of sound exposure. Using <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> that offer high sound attenuation, instead of using a less attenuating type, gives a little additional reduction of sound exposure, at the expense of a large reduction in speech intelligibility. Hence, it is better to use 'light' <b>ear</b> <b>plugs.</b> Better performance still is offered by Communications Earplugs, <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> featuring integrated miniature earphones. Results from the user preference survey correspond well with objective measurement results. Conclusions: In the case of the RNLAF Chinook, the best solution is using Communications EarPlugs in combination with a standard helmet. The Chinook case clearly illustrates that hearing protection and speech intelligibility should be treated as connected issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{following}} study is to evaluate immediate protective effect of <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> from noise morphologically and functionally. An 1 -month aged 29 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Subjects were divided into four groups as normal control(G 1), bilaterally plugged group (G 2), unilaterally plugged group (G 3) and noise control group (G 4) and later 3 groups were exposed to 110 sound pressure level white noise for 60 min. Immediately after noise exposure, audiologic tests were performed and cochlear morphology and expression levels of a-synuclein in the cochlea were investigated. There were no functional changes in G 2 and <b>plugged</b> <b>ears</b> of G 3 after noise exposure, whereas unplugged ears of G 3 and G 4 showed significant hearing loss.

5000|$|Measurements {{indicate}} {{that on a}} rifle, a muzzle brake adds 5 to 10 dB to the normal noise level perceived by the shooter, increasing total noise levels up to 160 dB(A) ± 3 dB. [...] Painful discomfort occurs at approximately 120 to 125 dB(A), with some references claiming 133 dB(A) for the threshold of pain. Active ear muffs are available with electronic noise cancellation that can reduce direct path ear canal noise by approximately 17-33 dB, depending on the low, medium, or high frequency at which attenuation is measured. Passive <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> vary in their measured attenuation, ranging from 20 dB to 30 dB, depending on whether they are properly used, and if low pass mechanical filters are also being used. Using both ear muffs (whether passive or active) and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> simultaneously results in maximum protection, but the efficacy of such combined protection relative to preventing permanent ear damage is inconclusive, with evidence indicating that a combined noise reduction ratio (NRR) of only 36 dB (C-weighted) is the maximum possible using ear muffs and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> simultaneously, equating to only a 36 - 7 = 29 dB(A) protection. Some high-end, passive, custom-molded earplugs also have a mechanical filter inserted {{into the center of}} the earmolded plug, with a small opening facing to the outside; this design permits being able to hear range commands at a gun range, while still having full rating impulse noise protection. Such custom molded earplugs with low pass filter and mechanical valve typically have a +85 dB(A) mechanical clamp, in addition to having a lowpass filter response, thereby providing typically 30-31 dB attenuation to loud impulse noises, with only a 21 dB reduction under low noise conditions across the human voice audible frequency range (300-4000 Hz) (thereby providing low attenuation between shots being fired), to permit hearing range commands. Similar functions are also available in standardized <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> that are not custom molded. [...] But, relative to a noise level of 160 dB(A), this means that even using ear muffs and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> simultaneously cannot protect a shooter against permanent ear damage when using a muzzle brake, through leaving a shooter exposed to noise levels of approximately 131 dB(A) that is 11 dB above the point where permanent ear damage occurs.|$|R
