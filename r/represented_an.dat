5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre {{should be considered}} an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E

5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation.

5|$|During the Second World War, Britain had {{a nuclear}} weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943. Many of Britain's top {{scientists}} participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology. In July 1954, Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E

5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> existential threat. It also {{signified}} a threat to Brazilian hegemony across its southern borders. A successful Argentine bid to incorporate Paraguay and Uruguay into a reconstituted Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (and control of the Platine river network consequently passing into entirely hostile hands) would have threatened to cut communication between the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro. With river transportation denied, the alternative land routes would require months of travel instead of days. Nor was Brazil keen to share a direct border with Argentina, fearing an increased vulnerability to an invasion by Rosas.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E
5|$|Hadropithecus stenognathus is {{classified}} as the sole member of the genus Hadropithecus and belongs to the family Archaeolemuridae. This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs. The species was formally described in 1899 from a mandible (lower jaw) found at Andrahomana cave in southeastern Madagascar by paleontologist Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau, who thought it <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> ape. A year later, Lorenz von Liburnau also described Pithecodon sikorae based on photographs of a skull, which upon further review {{turned out to be}} a juvenile version of Hadropithecus stenognathus. In a publication from 1902, he declared that Hadrophithecus stenognathus was not an ape, but a lemur. Over 100 years later, the rarity of its skeletal remains has made this species one of the least understood species of subfossil lemur.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired {{in part by the}} retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation <b>represented</b> <b>an</b> integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
