5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific <b>reply</b> clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry {{is similar to the}} Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific. The evolution of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may have been facilitated by constraints on song evolution in duetting communication systems in which <b>reply</b> signals are recognizable only by their precise timing in relation to the male song (<< 100 ms <b>reply</b> latency).|$|E

3000|$|We now compare <b>replies</b> and retweets between parties. First, we {{analyze the}} <b>replies</b> among the {{clusters}} of the retweet network. An interaction matrix A {{is presented in}} Fig.  12 where, now, an entry A_i,j {{is the number of}} <b>replies</b> from users from cluster i^rt to users from cluster j^rt. Although at first sight the vast majority of <b>replies</b> occurs in the main diagonal, like in Fig.  4, it is also evident that users are more likely to interact with users from other parties by <b>replying</b> than by retweeting them. Moreover, we observe behavioral differences between two types of parties. On the one hand, clusters of parties that advocate for a Catalan self-determination referendum ([...] BeC -m ^rt, [...] BeC -p ^rt, [...] CiU ^rt, [...] CUP ^rt, [...] ERC ^rt) exhibit a notable amount of inter-party <b>replies.</b> On the other hand, parties against the referendum ([...] PSC ^rt, [...] Cs ^rt, [...] PP ^rt) show a lower predisposition to dialogue with other parties and, therefore, most of their <b>replies</b> are within their own party.|$|R

Including formal references increases the probability of a message being retweeted but drops its chance of being <b>replied.</b> This hints to a more professional use for retweets while <b>replies</b> tend to have a personal connotation.

5|$|Vermigli {{published}} {{an account of}} his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise {{was able to put}} forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His Defense Against Gardiner was in <b>reply</b> to Stephen Gardiner's 1552 and 1554 Confutatio Cavillationum, itself a <b>reply</b> to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 folio pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.|$|E
