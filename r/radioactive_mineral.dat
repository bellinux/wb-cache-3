500|$|In 1923, a {{year before}} Walter Law's death, the Law family leased the lodge to Chauncey Depew Steele for 20 years. Under Steele's management, the lodge reached its prominence. The lodge also was opened to {{a wider variety of}} clientele, but {{continued}} to be known as a resort for the wealthy and famous. A [...] 18-hole golf course was completed in 1923, designed by Devereux Emmet. In May 1925, The New York Times reported that the Briarcliff Lodge installed the first artificial spa; using <b>radioactive</b> <b>mineral</b> torbernite to affect the water, believed to counter ailments associated with old age. United States Senators Chauncey Depew, James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr., and Royal S. Copeland were to each place a bag containing the minerals into the lodge's swimming pool. In June of that year, the newspaper mentioned in its report of an upcoming Briarcliff Lodge performance that the swimming pool was popular in the summer heat and that [...] "the cool spring radioactive water gave considerable relief to several hundred guests".|$|E

50|$|Tin lodes {{have been}} prospected in the mountain. Tin ore was {{discovered}} in July 1902 by W.C.J.Bartels, but attempts to explore the mountains proved unsuccessful as the engine set up at the beach, near what is now Tin City, was defective. The mountain has placer concentrates of <b>radioactive</b> <b>minerals</b> of monazite, xenotine, and zircon. The concentrates have 0.9 percent equivalent uranium (averaging about 0.03 percent equivalent uranium) attributed to thorium in the monazite content.

40|$|Singkep Island {{is part of}} Southeast Asia tin belt, {{which is}} one of the lithologies, {{composed}} of granite Muncung. Existence of granite allows formed deposits of <b>radioactive</b> <b>minerals</b> that prospect of the uranium and thorium. This research goal is to identify <b>radioactive</b> <b>minerals</b> occurrences on granit Muncung in the initial stage for prospect assessment of uranium and thorium in Singkep Island. The Methodologies are granite sampling, petrography analysis of Muncung granite samples, uranium and thorium content analysis and grain size analysis of pan concentrate samples. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>minerals</b> in Muncung granite are monazite and zircon, while in pan concentrate they are monazite, zircon, and xenotime. The percentage of monazite, zircon, and xenotime in the pan concentrate are 1. 1 – 59. 53 %, 0. 68 – 55. 07 %, and 0. 3 – 3. 54 % respectively. The uranium and thorium content in the pan concentrate are 30 – 1, 346 ppm and 557 – 13, 200 ppm respectively.

5000|$|As a <b>radioactive</b> <b>mineral,</b> {{torbernite}} {{has some}} limited significance as a uranium ore. Its vibrant green color and well-developed distinctive crystals (size: mm {{to a few}} cm) make it a sought-after collector's mineral, as well. However, torbernite, like other hydrated minerals, can easily suffer from loss of water molecules. This loss {{of water from the}} mineral leads to an alteration of torbernite specimens into its pseudomorph, meta-torbernite. Some collector's websites assert that any torbernite specimen more than a few years old should be considered fully transitioned to meta-torbernite. However, it likely depends on the temperature and relative humidity of ambient air in which specimens are stored.|$|E
