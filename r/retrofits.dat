30|$|In the {{evaluation}} of the payback time, for each <b>retrofit</b> scenario, State incentives should be considered. Although the building is owned by the Municipality of Bologna, reference is made to the Italian State incentives delivered to private citizens, as recommended by the HERB consortium. The <b>retrofit</b> interventions are considered in the following sequence: thermal insulation of vertical and horizontal walls (<b>Retrofit</b> 1); <b>Retrofit</b> 1 [*]+[*]replacement of windows (<b>Retrofit</b> 2); <b>Retrofit</b> 2 [*]+[*]replacement of the heating and DHW plant (<b>Retrofit</b> 3); <b>Retrofit</b> 3 [*]+[*]LED lighting (<b>Retrofit</b> 4); <b>Retrofit</b> 4 [*]+[*]PV system (<b>Retrofit</b> 5). In this sequence, each additive cost receives a State contribution equal to 65  % of the cost. The LED lighting and the PV system receive this contribution because they are parts of a general <b>retrofit</b> plan which yields an annual use of primary energy lower than the limit prescribed by the Government for the applicability of the 65  % contribution. The State contribution is given in the form of tax reduction in 10 equal amounts, during a period of 10  years. Since vanishing interest and inflation rates are assumed, the total State contribution is considered as a cost reduction available at the first year.|$|R

The aim of this thesis was to examine the influence of house <b>retrofit</b> on energy efficiency and thermal comfort, using house model simulation and calculation. This study gives a holistic house <b>retrofit</b> approach in thermal comfort improvement and energy conservation. Three house <b>retrofit</b> categories were defined by household energy breakdown: Space Heating <b>Retrofit,</b> Hot Water System <b>Retrofit</b> and Appliances <b>Retrofit.</b> This study started with an investigation of New Zealand existing house stock. A typical house model was defined by the summarized common physical characteristics. This house model was used for <b>retrofit</b> testing. For the building space heating <b>retrofit</b> study, a series of thermal simulations was completed with different <b>retrofit</b> options. Thermal simulation results were compared both in thermal comfort and space heating energy requirement. It was discovered that the optimum level full insulation <b>retrofit</b> significantly reduced space heating energy requirement and also improved thermal comfort. <b>Retrofit</b> solutions for water heating, lighting and appliances were compared by cost and energy saving. Cost effectiveness cross comparison for all of the <b>retrofit</b> solutions was carried out. Retrofitting for space heating system and hot water system can be considered for long term cost effectiveness. Appliances and lighting <b>retrofit</b> have a higher efficacy than other <b>retrofit</b> options in terms of energy saving and cost benefit cycle. These findings are used to provide suggestions for retrofitting of existing houses...|$|R
40|$|Heat Pinch Analysis <b>retrofit</b> {{projects}} are typically performed by evaluating and maximising the heat recovery potentials within the individual process units. Once the potential improvements {{from the individual}} units have been assessed, the Total Site (TS) Heat Integration analysis is performed. Such approach may steer designers away from the promising <b>retrofit</b> opportunities and to lead towards suboptimal heat exchanger networks (HEN). This paper presents an effective <b>retrofit</b> framework for a TS system to determine the most cost-effective <b>retrofit</b> options and maximise the potential savings. Instead of performing the typical unit-wise process <b>retrofit,</b> the strategy {{is to determine the}} baseline total site consumption and benchmark targets, and to identify <b>retrofit</b> options from the TS context. This TS <b>retrofit</b> framework has been tested on a case study involving a petrochemical plant comprising of multiple process sections. The results of the analysis show that significant energy savings can be realised when both direct and indirect heat recovery <b>retrofit</b> options are evaluated. Further energy savings can be achieved via the Plus-Minus Principle that helps pinpoint the correct locations of heat surpluses and deficits and lead to the appropriate TS <b>retrofit</b> solution. As a conclusion, energy <b>retrofit</b> projects should be approached from the TS context, followed by the unit-wise <b>retrofit</b> (i. e., <b>retrofit</b> of the individual process sections) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{summary of}} the current {{research}} towards the development and validation of a counter-intuitive seismic <b>retrofit</b> strategy for non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames, termed as selective weakening (SW) <b>retrofit,</b> is herein presented. The SW <b>retrofit</b> is conceived with the aim for wide-implementation, economical, and noninvasive structural <b>retrofit</b> solution for non-ductile (pre- 1970 s) RC frame structures. Contrary to the misconception that seismic <b>retrofit</b> must involved strengthening (force-based approach) SW <b>retrofit</b> relies upon targeted weakening of structural elements {{in order to achieve}} a ductile failure mechanism, thus explicitly enforcing capacity design philosophy within a displacement-based <b>retrofit</b> strategy. In this research, the SW <b>retrofit</b> is implemented to RC frames and more specifically to exterior beam-column (b-c) joints. The bottom longitudinal reinforcements of the beam are cut at the interface with the column and/or external horizontal pre-stressing is applied to the joint. A more desirable inelastic mechanism can be attained within the b-c connection, leading to improved global seismic performance for the RC frame. Experimental validations of the SW <b>retrofit</b> solution of exterior b-c joints are summarized to complement the conceptual development of the SW <b>retrofit.</b> Insights from quasi-static tests on nine 2 / 3 -scaled exterior b-c joint sub-assemblies (with and without <b>retrofit)</b> are discussed in respect to different retrofitting and as-built parameters. Lastly, a simple hand-calculation <b>retrofit</b> design procedure for a SW <b>retrofit</b> on b-c joints is presented. The results demonstrate the viability of such a simple but structurally efficient seismic rehabilitation strategy...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} performance-based multiobjective {{optimization}} seismic <b>retrofit</b> method for steel moment-resisting frames. The brittle joints of pre-Northridge steel moment-resisting frames are <b>retrofitted</b> to achieve ductility; the method involves determining {{the position and}} number of connections to be <b>retrofitted.</b> The optimal solution is determined by applying the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), which acts as a multiobjective seismic <b>retrofit</b> optimization technique. As objective functions, the initial cost for the connection <b>retrofit</b> and lifetime seismic damage cost were selected, and a seismic performance level below the 5 % interstory drift ratio was employed as a constraint condition. The proposed method {{was applied to the}} SAC benchmark three- and nine-story buildings, and several Pareto solutions were obtained.

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct.

Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar <b>retrofits,</b> joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E
