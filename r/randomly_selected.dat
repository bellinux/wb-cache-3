5|$|Final Fantasy VIII also {{introduced}} interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break range from <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the resulting attack's potency.|$|E
5|$|Inglenook Sidings is {{an award-winning}} model railway train {{shunting}} puzzle created by Alan Wright for the Manchester Model Railway Society's 1978 show, {{based on the}} former Kilham Sidings on the Alnwick and Cornhill Railway.

5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E

5|$|Brawl allows {{players to}} play against distant opponents via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Online {{multiplayer}} games can be played either with registered friends or with <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> participants. Additionally, players can converse with up to four phrases that are preset by the player, which appear as speech bubbles when activated. These names and phrases are not displayed in random-player matches. The Spectator mode allows players to watch matches being played between other players, and bet on the outcome using coins earned within the game. The winner of the match earns a jackpot of coins.|$|E
5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key {{difference}} between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E
5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Mario Kart DS is {{a racing}} game, {{in which the}} player races in a kart against other racers as one of eight characters, each with three karts to choose from. While racing or battling, the Nintendo DS's top screen offers a third-person {{perspective}} of the player's kart, while the bottom touchscreen shows the race's current standings, items carried by each racer, and {{a map of the}} course. The bottom screen can be toggled to show either an overview of the entire course, or a bird's-eye view of the players kart and the immediate vicinity, including nearby racers, course hazards, item boxes, and incoming attacks. Each course features item boxes that the player can drive through to receive a <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> item, which the player can use to gain an advantage over other racers. Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow them down, while other items can be used to speed up the player's own kart to pass other racers more easily.|$|E

5|$|Regarding battle, Golden Sun games contain both random monster encounters, {{featuring}} <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> enemies, and compulsory battles involving set enemies, which {{advance the}} story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought {{up where the}} player's party and enemy party face-off on opposing sides. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo-3D effect. Players can attack enemies directly {{using a variety of}} weapons and offensive Psynergy spells, or by summoning Djinn, powerful other-worldly entities that enhance an attached character's hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinns can be set to standby, where players forfeit stat enhancements in order to unleash a powerful one-time attack where the player summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 3DS version {{features}} stereoscopic 3D graphics with optional cel-shaded outlines to {{make the}} characters more visible. The game also features two exclusive modes; Smash Run and StreetSmash. Smash Run, based on the City Trial mode from Kirby Air Ride, has players navigate an open environment, fighting computer-controlled enemies to earn stat-increasing power-ups, before facing {{each other in a}} <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> match, such as vertical or horizontal races against each other or battles with various special rules. StreetSmash is a StreetPass-based game in which players control a disc on a top-down board and attempt to knock their opponents out of the arena. The 3DS version supports the additional controls featured on the New Nintendo 3DS, such as using the C-Stick to trigger Smash Attacks, but is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro peripheral because of hardware limitations.|$|E
5|$|When players {{create and}} upload their own custom maps to the Wi-Fi Connection, these maps {{can be tested}} and given {{approval}} ratings by other players from around the world. Players can download <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> maps from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, or can choose maps based on their approval ratings. In order to upload a map, the player must win it once, and rate it based on its difficulty. The maximum size for uploadable maps is 10x10 tiles, and the player can only upload one at a time; if the player uploads another map, then the original one is replaced. Maps can have any dimensions between 30x30 and 5x5 tiles, and the game is able to store up to 50 custom maps.|$|E

Out of the most diverse 25 countries according to this index, 18 (72%) are African. This includes 12 countries for which Greenberg's diversity index exceeds 0.9, meaning that a pair of <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> people will have less than 10% chance of having the same mother tongue. However, the primary language of government, political debate, academic discourse, and administration is often {{the language of the}} former colonial powers; English, French, or Portuguese.|$|E
