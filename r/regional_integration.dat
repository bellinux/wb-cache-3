25|$|All middle powers display {{foreign policy}} {{behaviour}} that stabilises and legitimises the global order, typically through multilateral and cooperative initiatives. However, emerging and traditional middle powers {{can be distinguished}} {{in terms of their}} mutually-influencing constitutive and behavioural differences. Constitutively, traditional middle powers are wealthy, stable, egalitarian, social democratic and not regionally influential. Behaviourally, they exhibit a weak and ambivalent regional orientation, constructing identities distinct from powerful states in their regions and offer appeasing concessions to pressures for global reform. Emerging middle powers by contrast are semi-peripheral, materially inegalitarian and recently democratised states that demonstrate much regional influence and self-association. Behaviourally, they opt for reformist and not radical global change, exhibit a strong regional orientation favouring <b>regional</b> <b>integration</b> but seek also to construct identities distinct from those of the weak states in their region.|$|E
40|$|Africa {{has a high}} {{concentration}} of sub-regional economic organisations, multilateral arrangements and institutions promoting the goals of integration. Yet, the continent has remained the least integrated of the world’s major regions. Africa has remained slow in its development trajectory and harbours most of the least developed countries of the world. A large percentage of the African populace is mired in poverty while the sub-continent continues to be marginalised in global affairs. The obvious reality is that Africa is yet to benefit fully from the gains of <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration</b> and that the economic transformation of the African continent as a whole – one of the main objectives often declared in establishing <b>regional</b> economic <b>integration</b> schemes – is yet to be realised.
