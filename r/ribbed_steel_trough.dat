It builds a whole variable space model and studies the performance prediction of cold rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars based on the 5 -in & 1 -out RBF network and the performance prediction of cold rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars based on the 5 -in & 2 -out RBF network. The results show that this method can reliably predict the mechanical performance of cold rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars, and the predictive effect of the 5 -in & 1 -out RBF network model based on whole variable space is superior to the 5 -in & 2 -out RBF network model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{calibration}} of default pullout capacity {{models for}} smooth and <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> strip reinforcement, used in reinforced soil walls in Japan, {{was carried out}} {{more than two decades}} ago and was based on a small number of physical tests available at that time. The writers have collected and organized a much larger database of more than 600 laboratory pullout box and in situ pullout tests from among the Japanese literature. The new database is a useful reference for design engineers to match project-specific soils to previous pullout tests and to check the accuracy of the current lower-bound design curves proposed in the late 70 s and 80 s. Today, only the ribbed-type steel reinforcement strips are used. The new data show that a three-parameter exponential function better captures the trend in pullout data for <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> reinforcement than the current bi-linear models adopted from European practice. The formulations also have the advantage of being smoothly continuous with depth. Parameter values are determined for default pullout models {{that can be used in}} load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and for the current lower-bound (factor of safety) allowable stress design (ASD). The current PWRC model and a newly proposed model for <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> strip reinforcement, that include the soil coefficient of uniformity (Uc) in their formulations, are shown to be no more accurate than the simpler default models without this term...|$|R
50|$|The Gairloch Bridge {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} features that were innovative at the time. For the decking, Brady used 33 foot (10m) lengths of <b>steel</b> <b>trough</b> plate, 12 inches (30 cm) deep, riveted together and securely bolted down to the concrete string-courses. The troughs were then filled with tarred metal. The curbs and posts were of hardwood. Brady argued that this design had important advantages in flood conditions due to its greater weight and because the <b>steel</b> <b>troughs</b> eliminated the need for girders, the bridge offered less resistance to the flow of flood waters. This design option was more costly than a bridge using the more conventional timber decking and superstructure, but Brady argued that the maintenance cost of his design would be less. The Gairloch Bridge is the only known road bridge of this design in Queensland.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign on the cyclic behavior of smooth steel bars, used as internal reinforcement of existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures; the stress-strain relationship is analyzed for different values of L/D ratio, where L is the stirrup spacing and D is the longitudinal bar diameter. Most of the experimental tests concerned smooth bars with L/D ratios ranging between 5 and 100. The analysis of the test results is complemented by some comparisons of the curves obtained by experimental tests on smooth steel bars with those obtained by experimental tests on <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars. The theoretical predictions obtained by existing models available in the literature on the cyclic behavior of <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars are then discussed. Our review of these formulations underlines their range of applicability as well as their potential to predict the damage and buckling that occur for different L/D ratios of the smooth steel bars...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} hot rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bar after remained-heat-treatment process readily corrodes and rusts on store and {{transportation}} process due to falling {{off of the}} surface of its oxide layer in the steel production. By studying different cooling intensity having what effect on rebar structure, mechanical property and the thickness and component of surface oxide layer, this paper analyses the influence factor of strengthening mechanism and anti-corrosion on the surface oxide layer of hot rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>steel</b> bars (HRB). The result indicates {{that there is a}} certain extent improvement on the bar’s yield strength and strength of extension after remained heat treatment, and that this change in large size bar is more distinct than which in small size’s. The most distinct strengthening effect happens in a temperature on cooling table about 720 ˚C. Above 820 ˚C —the temperature on cooling table, all metallographic structure consist of ferrite and pearlite (F+P); under 725 ˚C, the sclerotic structure like bainite appears. With the temperature on cooling table arising, surface oxide layer thickens. In low temperature on cooling table, the sample integrates with matrix comparatively closely and has relatively better anti-corrode property...|$|R
