Blake, in his edition of the Liber, calls that and <b>related</b> <b>works</b> the Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium. Another related work is {{contained}} in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the Libellus of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a challeng-ing task of automatic <b>related</b> <b>work</b> gener-ation. Given multiple reference papers as input, the task aims {{to generate a}} <b>related</b> <b>work</b> section for a target paper. The gen-erated <b>related</b> <b>work</b> section {{can be used as}} a draft for the author to complete his or her final <b>related</b> <b>work</b> section. We propose our Automatic <b>Related</b> <b>Work</b> Generation system called ARWG to ad-dress this task. It first exploits a PLSA model to split the sentence set of the giv-en papers into different topic-biased parts, and then applies regression models to learn the importance of the sentences. At last it employs an optimization frame-work to generate the <b>related</b> <b>work</b> section. Our evaluation results on a test set of 150 target papers along with their reference papers show that our proposed ARWG system can generate <b>related</b> <b>work</b> sec-tions with better quality. A user study is also performed to show ARWG can achieve an improvement over generic multi-document summarization baselines...|$|R

5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely <b>related</b> <b>works,</b> because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} <b>related</b> <b>works,</b> served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was {{to spend the rest of}} his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the Daode jing and the Zhuangzi, few Taoist texts have enjoyed an exegetical tradition as voluminous and diversified as the Cantong qi. More than three dozen traditional commentaries are extant, written between ca. 700 and the final years of the Qing dynasty (Pregadio 2012:21-76).

25|$|Cubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 {{painting}} Les Demoiselles d'Avignon {{has often}} been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 Houses at L’Estaque (and <b>related</b> <b>works)</b> prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists {{took place at the}} Salon des Indépendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'Salle 41'; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso or Braque were exhibited.|$|E
25|$|Perón's {{government}} is remembered for its record social investments. He introduced a Ministry of Health to the cabinet; its first head, the neurologist Ramón Carrillo, oversaw {{the completion of}} over 4,200 health care facilities. <b>Related</b> <b>works</b> included construction of more than 1,000 kindergartens and over 8,000 schools, including several hundred technological, nursing and teachers' schools, among an array of other public investments. The new Minister of Public Works, General Juan Pistarini, oversaw the construction of 650,000 new, public sector homes, {{as well as of}} the international airport, one of the largest in the world at the time. The reactivation of the dormant National Mortgage Bank spurred private-sector housing development: averaging over 8 units per 1,000 inhabitants (150,000 a year), the pace was, at the time, at par with that of the United States and one of the highest rates of residential construction in the world.|$|E
