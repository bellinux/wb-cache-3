It is found that the peak ageing time is 23 h and does not vary up to 75 mm <b>round</b> <b>bar.</b> It increases to 25 h for the 120 mm <b>round</b> <b>bar.</b> The yield and tensile strength of the alloy {{are found to be}} in the range of 288 – 304 MPa and 410 – 428 MPa for the peak ageing condition.

Although a near linear relation is found to exist between the strength/hardness and the electrical conductivity values for the selected heat treatment parameters (solution temperature: 535 °C, ageing temperature: 191 °C and the peak ageing time: 23 h), the slope of the curve is different for different <b>round</b> <b>bars.</b> Microstructure characterization studies show the precipitate coarsening with increasing ageing time.

This thesis explores four main geometries of metallic crimped and metallic crossbar type reinforcement constructed with both, smooth steel and # 4 rebar steel. Metal <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen because, compared to metallic rectangular strip reinforcements, there is less surface area in contact with the soil which will then reduce the amount of corrosion loses. Throughout testing, it was found that crimped metal <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> was able to produce the required pullout resistance but created too much extensibility (the amount of length the crimps straightened).

Better mechanical properties of wire rod, <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles can be achieved due to large plastic deformation by the three-roll process. Asymmetric rolling is a novel technique characterised by a kinematic asymmetry linked to the difference in peripheral speed of the rolls, able to introduce additional shear strains through the bar thickness. In order to achieve this, asymmetrical three-roll rolling process was investigated to better control the deformation compared to the conventional three-roll rolling process in a stand with two three-roll calibers located very close to each other. Simulation of round-triangle-triangle pass rolling was performed. FEM simulations were carried out with using software DEFORM 3 D. The influence of the friction coefficient and speed asymmetry on the shear strain and material flow was discussed. The results of simulation can be used to optimize the asymmetric three-roll rolling process to improve the mechanical properties of wire rod, <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles...|$|R
