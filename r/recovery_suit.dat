50|$|The Matrix {{from the}} Pocket Universe was a protoplasmic {{life-form}} {{and had a}} malleable genome, so she could assume any humanoid form of similar mass. Her primary power was telekinesis which she could use to move objects with her mind and enhance her strength, physical durability, and speed to superhuman levels. By levitating herself, she could fly at supersonic speeds. She could cloak herself (becoming both invisible and inaudible, even to Superman's super hearing). She could also focus her psychokinesis into devastating force blasts. She could even use her psi-power to rearrange the molecular structure of fabrics, and alter clothing and costumes with her thoughts (an ability that enabled her to change her clothing when she changed shape, and turn a Kryptonian <b>recovery</b> <b>suit</b> into a new costume for Superman). However, she lost her shapeshifting powers and cloaking after her merger with Linda Danvers, as she now possessed the psychological boundaries of a human woman, having defined herself as Linda and Supergirl to give herself an 'alpha and omega'.|$|E
40|$|In 1993, the Indian {{government}} introduced {{debt recovery}} tribunals {{to speed up}} the resolution of debt recovery claims larger than a threshold. This paper exploits the staggered introduction of tribunals across states and the link between overdues and claim size to implement a differences-in-differences strategy on project loan data. It finds that the tribunals reduced delinquency for the average loan by 28 percent. They also lowered the interest rates charged on larger loans, holding constant borrower quality. This suggests that the speedier processing of debt <b>recovery</b> <b>suits</b> can lower the cost of credit. (JEL G 21, K 41, O 16, O 17) ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the Recovery Tradeoff Study were as follows: (1) {{to determine whether a}} land or water <b>recovery</b> best <b>suits</b> RRS system requirements; (2) what type of terminal recovery system is best suited for the RRS; and (3) what are the recovery access timelines after system landing. Based on the trade parameters and evaluation criteria used in this study, the land-landing configuration has an advantage over the water-landing configuration. It is recommended that a land-landing configuration be developed assuming WSMR as the landing site. It is also recommended that natural orbits be used for low inclination missions and any orbit adjustments for landing site targeting be performed {{at the end of the}} mission. Near-integer orbits should be used for high inclination missions and allow orbital decay to precess the ground track over the landing site range...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of logs, the command log, is being {{employed}} to replace the traditional data log (e. g., ARIES log) in the in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuples are updated, a command log only tracks the transactions being executed, thereby effectively reducing {{the size of the}} log and improving the performance. Command logging on the other hand increases the cost of recovery, because all the transactions in the log after the last checkpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper, we first extend the command logging technique to a distributed environment, where all the nodes can perform recovery in parallel. We then propose an adaptive logging approach by combining data logging and command logging. The percentage of data logging versus command logging becomes an optimization between the performance of transaction processing and <b>recovery</b> to <b>suit</b> different OLTP applications. Our experimental study compares the performance of our proposed adaptive logging, ARIES-style data logging and command logging on top of H-Store. The results show that adaptive logging can achieve a 10 x boost for recovery and a transaction throughput that is comparable to that of command logging. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} synchronization procedure {{is essential to}} a mobile set in order to calibrate its reference oscillator. In TDD Low Chip Rate (LCR) UMTS system after the frequency scan procedure, which aims to find the carrier frequency, an error as great as 20 kHz is expected [1]. The requested maximum frequency offset between the local oscillator and the Node B oscillator is 200 Hz (0. 1 ppm). The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a frequency <b>recovery</b> algorithm <b>suited</b> for the TDDLc, a system and to verify if the requested precision of 0. 1 ppm is reachable with the proposed frame format [2]. Many data aided frequency estimators are proposed in literature [3] [4]. In this paper the best suitable estimator for TDDLcR, described in [5], is fitted to the TDDcR system and an original non linear closed loop approach, which improves performance, is proposed. The performance results show that a combination of an open loop estimation with a closed loop configuration, exploiting two different training sequences, assure a final accuracy of 0. 1 ppm, even in the worst en- vironment conditions. The modified non linear recursire algorithm, introduced in the closed loop configuration, is a promising approach to increase accuracy and to reduce convergence time...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} if a relationship exists among the magnitude and rate of airway rewarming, and the severity of bronchial obstruction in thermally induced asthma, we had seven subjects perform three- to four-point stimulus response curves with isocapnic hyperventilation of frigid air with and without pretreatment with inhaled norepinephrine. The latter was employed to alter the heat supplied to the airway walls by producing vasoconstriction. 1 -s forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) was measured before and 5 min after the cessation of each bout of hyperpnea and before and after norepinephrine. On a separate day, the subjects repeated the above challenges while the temperatures of the airstream in the intrathoracic airways were measured. Prenorepinephrine, FEV 1 progressively decreased in a stimulus response fashion as ventilation rose, while norepinephrine shifted this curve to the right. As the level of ventilation increased, {{the size of the}} temperature difference between the cooling of hyperpnea and the rewarming of <b>recovery</b> followed <b>suit,</b> and their magnitude was linearly related to the severity of bronchial narrowing. Reducing the mucosal blood supply of the airways with norepinephrine limited rewarming and attenuated the obstructive response. These data demonstrate that the airway narrowing that develops following hyperpnea and the magnitude of the thermal differences are related, and that alterations in blood supply directly affect bronchial heat flux and influence obstruction...|$|R
40|$|In {{burst-mode}} {{data transmission}} used in GSM and IS 136, rapid {{acquisition of the}} symbol timing and the carrier phase from the observation of a short signal-segment is essential. Feedforward timing <b>recovery</b> is well <b>suited</b> for such transmissions due to its rapid acquisition characteristics. For personal mobile communications where low complexity and low power are the major requirements, it is desirable to sample the signal at the lowest possible rate {{and to have the}} synchronizer be as simple as possible. In this paper we propose a synchronizer for initial timing and carrier-phase estimation using preambles. The synchronizer needs just two samples per symbol period and it exhibits good performance, even for signals employing small excess bandwidth. These estimations can be obtained directly from the burst detector output. We also show that the synchronizer can be implemented very efficiently...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{delineated}} {{explanation of the}} range of recovery approaches currently informing mental health interventions today. Four organizing domains of recovery are proposed: (1) Traditional Recovery; (2) Addictions Recovery; (3) New Recovery; and (4) Mutual Recovery. One of the challenges of providing mental health services efficiently is to consider which method of <b>recovery</b> is most <b>suited</b> to the needs of different service users. By comparing and organizing different recovery modalities, it is possible to consider the best fit between client and modality. For example, there is a necessary demarcation between clients who are amenable to recovery, and those who are harder to engage. We need to think about recovery in terms of the difference between ‘tender’ and ‘tough’ recovery approaches. A meta-recovery framework is proposed here as a basis for continuing discussions about the different types of recovery operational in the field of mental health today...|$|R
40|$|Most courts hold that, {{by agreeing}} to have an illegal abortion, a woman forfeits her right to recover for {{injuries}} tortuously inflicted during that abortion.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of end user devices {{at the edge of}} the network, along with their ever increasing computing capacity, as well as the advances in Data Center technologies, paved the way for the generation of Internet of Things (IoT). Several IoT services have been deployed leveraging Cloud Computing and, more recently, Fog Computing. In order to enable efficient control of cloud and fog premises, Fog-to-Cloud (F 2 C) has been recently proposed as a distributed architecture for coordinated management of both fog and cloud resources. Certainly, many challenges remain unsolved in combined Fog-to-Cloud systems, mostly driven by the dynamicity and volatility imposed by edge devices, such as the recovery of failures {{at the edge of the}} network. Indeed, possible failures in computing commodities may be prohibitive for the achievement of the envisioned performance in F 2 C systems. In this work, we assess proactive and reactive strategies for failure recovery of network elements by modelling them as a Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP) and study the impact of each one on several aspects such as service allocation time, recovery delay and computing resources load. The obtained results show the effect each strategy brings, thus concluding with some analysis on the <b>recovery</b> strategy best <b>suiting</b> distinct IoT scenarios.

40|$|Next Generation Life Support (NGLS) is one {{of several}} {{technology}} development projects sponsored by NASA s Game Changing Development Program. The NGLS Project is developing life support technologies (including water <b>recovery</b> and space <b>suit</b> life support technologies) needed for humans to live and work productively in space. NGLS has three project tasks: Variable Oxygen Regulator (VOR), Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) swing bed, and Alternative Water Processor (AWP). The RCA swing bed and VOR tasks are directed at key technology needs for the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) for an Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit, with focus on test article development and integrated testing in an Advanced PLSS in cooperation with the Advanced Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) Project. An RCA swing-bed provides integrated carbon dioxide removal and humidity control that can be regenerated in real time during an EVA. The VOR technology will significantly increase the number of pressure settings available to the space suit. Current space suit pressure regulators are limited to only two settings whereas the adjustability of the advanced regulator will be nearly continuous. The AWP effort, based on natural biological processes and membrane-based secondary treatment, will result {{in the development of a}} system capable of recycling wastewater from sources expected in future exploration missions, including hygiene and laundry water.

The disease is characterized primarily by a meta-bolic error that prevents phenylalanine in the body from being converted to tyrosine. As the amount of phenylalanine increases, the amino acid is deaminated to phenylpyruvic acid (PPA), the blood concentration and urinary excretion of which become excessive. Determination of PPA is one usefultechniquefordifferentiatingbetween phenyl-ketonuriaand hyperphenylalaninemia. In most previous reports (1 - 4) PPA has been determined in urine,most commonly by a colon-metric method involvingferricchloride. Although the ferric chloride test has been used most often as a qualitativemethod, a quantitativeadaption has been describedby Saiferand Harris (3). The ferric chloridemethod, however, lacksspecificity. Paper chromatographic and photometric methods de-pending on the reaction with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-hydrazine have alsobeen used, but again primarily forqualitativedeterminations(2). Owing to the large variation in the urinary con-centration of PPA, failure to detect PPA in random urine samples does not rule out the possibility o...|$|R
