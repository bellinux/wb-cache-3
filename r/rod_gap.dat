40|$|Graduation date: 1973 An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of flow channel geometry on fully developed turbulent flow in "clean" rod bundle flow channels. This information was sought to obtain {{a better understanding of}} crossflow mixing between rod bundle subchannels. The experiments were performed in water with a Reynolds number range from 50, 000 to 200, 000. The experimental flow models considered pitch-to-diameter ratios of 125 and 1. 125. Axial components of velocity, turbulence intensity and Eulerian autocorrelation function were the primary measurements. The autocorrelation function provided an indication of the dominant frequency of turbulence and an estimate of the longitudinal macroscale by using Taylor's hypothesis. A limited amount of lateral component turbulence intensity data was also obtained. The experimental results show that <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> spacing (pitch-to-diameter ratio) is the most significant geometric parameter affecting the flow structure. Decreasing the <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> spacing increased the turbulence intensity, longitudinal macroscale, and the dominant frequency of turbulence. These turbulence parameters were found to be rather insensitive to Reynolds number. The turbulence parameters within a <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> were found to be insensitive to the shape of adjacent subchannels and only slightly affected by the amount of lateral freedom allowed by the various size flow models. The results indicate that macroscopic flow processes exist adjacent to the <b>rod</b> <b>gap.</b> This includes secondary flows and increased scale and frequency of flow pulsations when the <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> spacing is reduced. When interpreted in terms of crossflow mixing, the results are consistent with present crossflow mixing correlations...|$|E

For a rod pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 107 four Reynolds numbers in the range 22. 6 x 103 to 207. 6 x 103 were investigated. The experimental technique which involved a rotatable inclined hot-wire anemometer probe allowed the measurement of secondary flow components {{of the order of}} 1 per cent of the local velocity. No evidence was found for secondary flows in the open <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> area. The highly anisotropic nature of the turbulence particularly for the interconnecting <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> region was shown by the level of the azimuthal turbulent shear stress. The mean velocity profiles were generally consistent with the logarithmic region of the universal velocity profile using the Patel values for the profile constants.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} process from pellet to coolant {{is one of}} the important issues in nuclear reactor. In this regard, the fuel to clad gap and its physical and chemical properties are effective factors on {{heat transfer}} in nuclear fuel rod discussion. So, the energy distribution function of electrons with an energy about 0. 5 MeV in fuel <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> in Busherhr’s VVER- 1000 nuclear reactor was investigated in this paper. Also, the effect of fission fragments such as Krypton, Bromine, Xenon, Rubidium and Cesium on the electron energy distribution function as well as the heat conduction via electrons in the fuel <b>rod</b> <b>gap</b> have been studied. For this purpose, the Fokker- Planck equation governing the stochastic behavior of electrons in absorbing gap element has been applied in order to obtain the energy distribution function of electrons. This equation was solved via Runge-Kutta numerical method. On the other hand, the electron energy distribution function was determined by using Monte Carlo GEANT 4 code. It was concluded that these fission fragments have virtually insignificant effect on energy distribution of electrons and therefore, on thermal conductivity via electrons in the fuel to clad gap. It is worth noting that this result is consistent with the results of other experiments. Also, it is shown that electron relaxation in gap leads to decrease in thermal conductivity via electron...|$|E

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston <b>rod</b> <b>gap,</b> which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|E

The temperature of the arc space and the variation of the arc temperature with time are measured. The temperature is measured by spectrographic and velocity of sound techniques. The temperature at current zero is 5000 degrees Kelvin. The temperature is 720 degrees K. 77 milliseconds after current zero and 415 degrees K. 196 milliseconds after current zero. The temperature is correlated to the dielectric strength during the recovery period. During the recovery period the arc space is at atmospheric pressure. The gas density is reduced due to the high temperatures existing in the arc space. Evidence is given that the low gas density is reduced due to the high temperatures existing in the arc space. Evidence is given that the low gas density is the major factor causing the reduced dielectric strength. Residual ions in the arc space also contribute to reducing the dielectric strength. A criterion for recovery breakdown is given including the effect of the residual ions.

40|$|The use of {{time domain}} {{reflectometry}} (TDR) to determine water content (θv) from the measurement of the apparent dielectric constant (Ka) or the square root of the apparent dielectric constant (Ka 0. 5) in highly saline environments has been limited due to the dampening effect that electrical conductivity (EC) has on the TDR signal. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the use of a three-rod TDR probe with a polyolefin coating on the center-conducting rod (CCRC probe) to simultaneously measure θv and EC in saline conditions where standard, non-coated TDR probes (NC probe) are ineffective. The application of a 0. 00053 m thick polyolefin coating on the center-conducting rod of a CS 605 TDR probe increased the capability of the probe to measure θv at EC levels as high as 1. 06 S m- 1 compared to 0. 132 S m- 1 for a NC CS 605 probe. The CCRC probe was found to be incapable of determining any difference in EC levels. A 0. 01 m long section or “gap” {{at the center of the}} polyolefin coating on the center conducting <b>rod</b> (<b>GAP</b> probe) was cut from the polyolefin coating to expose a section of the stainless steel center-conducting rod to allow direct contact with the material being sampled. The GAP probe was found to be capable of measuring θv and EC at EC levels as high as 0. 558 S m- 1. Using a water-air immersion method, a comparison between the NC probe and the CCRC and GAP probes was undertaken. The correlation between θv vs. Ka 0. 5 was found to be linear for all three probes with the slope (m) of the regressed equation for the NC probe (m = 7. 71) being approximately twice that of the CCRC probe (m = 4. 25) and the GAP probe (m = 4. 36). The intercept values were equivalent for all three probes. The linearity between θv vs. Ka 0. 5 for the NC and CCRC probes using the water-air immersion method was also observed when the probes were used to measure Ka 0. 5 of different sand-water mixtures. The slope of regressed equation for the NC probe in the sand-water iv mixtures (m = 7. 69) was equivalent to the water-air immersion slope for the NC probe, however the intercept values for the sand-water mixtures was lower than the intercept values for the water-air immersion method. Similarly, the slope of the CCRC probe in the sand-water mixtures (m = 5. 00) was equivalent to the CCRC probe water-air immersion slope. Calculated Ka 0. 5 values using a waterair dielectric-mixing model (WAMM) were equivalent to measured Ka 0. 5 values for the NC probe. The water air immersion method was found to provide a suitable methodology for TDR research, however a more definitive test of the coated probe response in a series of soils with a range of homogenous water contents should be completed to ascertain the reliability of the water-air immersion method. The straightforward relationship between the inverse of TDR measured impedance (ZL - 1) and EC provided an effective calibration method for both the NC and GAP probes. The use of the Giese- Tiemann method to establish a calibration curve for EC measurement was limited to a maximum EC level of 0. 132 S m- 1 for the NC probe. The use of the cell constant method was considered to be unacceptable as a means of developing a calibration curve due to the fact that the cell constant K was not a constant value. Ka 0. 5 values for the CCRC and GAP were consistently less than Ka 0. 5 values for the NC probe at all qv levels except θv = 0. 000 m 3 m- 3 or 100 % air. The difference in Ka 0. 5 (DKa 0. 5) between the NC probe and the CCRC and GAP probes was seen to increase with increasing water content. Similarly, a measurable effect was found between the TDR waveforms for the NC probe when the probe head was surrounded completely by air when compared to the TDR waveforms for the NC probe when the probe head was completely surrounded by water. Modeled electrostatic fields for the NC and CCRC CS 605 TDR probes displayed a decrease in the electric potential and electric field intensity in the region outside of the polyolefin coating of the CCRC probe compared to the NC probe. The decrease v in potential and electric field intensity became greater when the dielectric constant of the material surrounding the CCRC probe increased. The use of a polyolefin coating on the center-conducting rod with a small section of the coating removed at the midsection of rod provides an effective means of extending the application of TDR θv and EC measurement in saline environments where standard TDR probes cannot be used...|$|E

The application of sinusoidal stimuli {{over a wide range}} of temporal frequencies allowed us to characterize the band-pass filtering properties of the rod network. We found that the electrical coupling of all neighbouring rods exhibited reciprocal and symmetrical conductivities. On average, the junctional conductance between paired rods was 500 pS and the coupling coefficient (the ratio of voltage responses of the follower cell to those of the driver cell), or K-value, was 0. 07. Our experimental results also demonstrated that the rod network behaved like a band-pass filter with a peak frequency of about 2 – 5 Hz. However, the gap junctions between adjacent rods exhibited linearity and voltage independency within the physiological range of <b>rods.</b> These <b>gap</b> junctions did not contribute to the filtering mechanisms of the rod network.

Research as well as preliminary simulation and experimentation point to a critical radius of approximately 300 – 350 mm.

The plane-wave-expansion (PWE) method {{is applied to}} the theoretical derivation of secular equations of the two polarization modes: a transverse polarization mode and a mixed (longitudinal-transverse) polarization mode. And the band structures of the two modes for both the case of piezoelectric rods embedded in a polymer matrix and the case of polymer rods embedded in a piezoelectric matrix are calculated for two different cross-sections of the rods, i. e., circular and square, considering the practical fabrication of phononic crystals. We reveal the existence of several very large complete band gaps in a material of practical interest such as PZT rods reinforced polythene composite. The effects of shapes and filling fraction of the <b>rods</b> on band <b>gaps</b> are discussed in detail. The existence of these gaps in relation to the physical parameters of the constituent materials involved is studied. Understanding the band structures of piezoelectric phononic crystals can give some information for improvements in the design of acoustic transducers...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{coupling}} via gap junctions is {{an abundant}} {{phenomenon in the}} mammalian retina and occurs in all major cell types. Gap junction channels are assembled from different connexin subunits, and the connexin composition of the channel confers specific properties to the electrical synapse. In the mouse retina, gap junctions were demonstrated between intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells but the underlying connexin remained undetermined. In the primary <b>rod</b> pathway, <b>gap</b> junctions play a crucial role, coupling AII amacrine cells among {{each other and to}} ON cone bipolar cells. Although it has long been known that connexin 36 and connexin 45 are necessary for the proper functioning of this most sensitive rod pathway, differences between homocellular AII/AII gap junctions and AII/ON bipolar cell gap junctions suggested the presence of an additional connexin in AII amacrine cells. Here, we used a connexin 30. 2 -lacZ mouse line to study the expression of connexin 30. 2 in the retina. We show that connexin 30. 2 is expressed in intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells and AII amacrine cells. Moreover, we tested whether connexin 30. 2 and connexin 36 – both expressed in AII amacrine cells – are able to interact with each other and are deposited in the same gap junctional plaques. Using newly generated anti-connexin 30. 2 antibodies, we show in HeLa cells that both connexins are indeed able to interact and may form heteromeric channels: both connexins were co-immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HeLa cells and connexin 30. 2 gap junction plaques became significantly larger when co-expressed with connexin 36. These data suggest that connexin 36 is able to form heteromeric gap junctions with another connexin. We hypothesize that co-expression of connexin 30. 2 and connexin 36 may endow AII amacrine cells with the means to differentially regulate its electrical coupling to different synaptic partners...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) for light water nuclear power reactors {{was the subject}} of lengthy, controversial and technically complex hearings conducted by the AEC over the two years from 1971 through 1973. An independent, objective review and assessment of the technical issues associated with ECCS effectiveness was conducted in a study performed at the Environmental Quality Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. The review was based upon the testimonies and supporting technical documentation of the principal participants in the hearings: the AEC, utilities, reactor manufacturers, and intervenors. From the review, the critical technical parameters influencing ECCS performance, which were at issue, are identified. Of fifteen parameters cited by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safety in the hearings as being of unproved conservatism, essentially all are reviewed in detail, including, for example, the initial stored fuel energy, fuel <b>rod</b> gas <b>gap</b> conductance, fluid flow rates through broken pipes, metal-water reaction energy release and fuel rod embrittlement, reflood/core-spray heat transfer, and reflooding rates, as well as the adequacy of ECCS analytical models and numerical methods.,The relative influence of uncertainties in the performance criteria associated with these parameters is assessed. Based upon the relative importance of these parameters, alternative responses to resolution of the ECCS problem are analyzed. The importance of the core reflooding rate in resolving the technical issues of the problem is emphasized. The conservatism of the proposed criteria (current and past) is reviewed. Recommendations are made for improvements in criteria conservatism, especially in the establishment of minimum reflood heat transfer rates (or alternatively, reflooding rates). Several new and/or accelerated research programs and additional large scale testing programs are also recommended. Suggestions are also made for areas in which design improvements would help to achieve greater ECCS reliability...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} of high voltage equipment focuses increasingly on a {{shift away from}} SF 6 as a quenching and isolation medium. SF 6 is has a detrimental effect on the atmosphere's greenhouse potential. Bans or regulations regarding SF 6 may well be imposed on the industry in the future. In order to replace SF 6 with air as insulation, {{more research is needed}} to achieve compact and efficient designs. The goal of this master thesis has been to investigate the effect of barriers on the withstand voltage in rod-plane gaps, with atmospheric air, subjected to positive high voltage impulses. The high voltage electrode was a rod with a spherical tip and a diameter of 7 mm. The barriers used as insulation were made out of Lexan polycarbonate plates and measured 1 mm times 600 mm times 600 mm. The 50 %breakdown voltage, the standard deviation and the withstand voltage have been determined using the up- and down-method. The barriers were tested in several configurations, changing both the horizontal and vertical placement of the barrier in the rod-plane gap. In addition to physical experiments, these configurations have been investigated in terms of electric background eld calculations in COMSOL,as well as streamer inception voltage calculations in MATLAB. The results show an increase in the withstand voltage of up to 28 % for the configuration with the largest barrier protrusion. The optimal barrier position has been found to be close to the high voltage rod. However, a relative decrease in the withstand voltage is observed when the rod is touching the barrier. This can be explained by a strong tangential eld allowing the streamer to propagate along the surface of the barrier. For a small barrier, protruding 0 mm from the tip of the rod, the withstand voltage is lower than that of a barrier-less <b>rod</b> plane <b>gap</b> when the barrier touches the rod. A sharp increase of above 10 % in the withstand voltage is shown in a barrier with a 0 mm overlap, by simply moving the barrier 10 mm closer to the high voltage rod. This can to some degree be explained by applying electric potential to the barriers in the background eld distributions. It has been shown that the withstand voltage can be predicted to some extent with a very simple formula for the congurations with the largest barrier protrusions. A method of predicting withstand voltage based on streamer inception calculation in several steps, with electric eld distribution calculations has been suggested...|$|R
30|$|A novel MINE structure, {{which has}} the {{combined}} features of the nanorod dimer and nanoring, is proposed and fabricated, and its plasmonic behaviors are investigated numerically and experimentally. Two resonance peaks are identified as the symmetric and anti-symmetric modes according to the symmetries of the charge distributions on the nanoring and nanorod dimer in MINE. The symmetric mode is preferred because its charge distribution leads to a stronger near field with a concentrated distribution around the gap. In addition, the optical properties of the MINE structure highly depend on the structural geometry. The near-field intensity can be greatly enhanced by adjusting the <b>rod</b> width and <b>gap</b> distance, promoting the lightning-rod effect and plasmon coupling. The extinction ability can be raised by enlarging the outer radius because more charges are supported by the larger structural size. Based on the strong and localized near field {{at the center of}} nanorod dimer, our studies show that adopting an auxiliary nanoring surrounding the nanorod dimer can further enhance its near field. Compared to individual nanoring and nanorod dimer, our proposed MINE structure can dramatically boost the local near-field intensity because excess charges can be induced by the ring-shaped nanostructure and the rod-shaped nanostructure can function as a bridge to pull these excess charges from the ring to the rods, thereby inducing stronger plasmon coupling between the rods and resulting considerably local near-field enhancement. Hence, this MINE structure, which has a significantly enhanced and localized near field, has great potential for applications such as improving single-molecule detection and exploring biochemistry, including molecular bonding and chemical reactions. Our studies provide illuminating insight into complex systems and guide the design of an optimal MINE structure. Moreover, we expect that this nanostructure can serve as a building block for various applications such as nanomedicine, biochemistry, single-emitter fluorescence, vibrational spectroscopy, and optical tweezers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{behavior}} of heat and mass transfer during hydrogen generation {{in the core of}} the boiling water reactor (BWR). The core of the BWR is a system highly heterogeneous where the transport processes are complex. The core is considered as an average channel of the fuel assembly, which consists of arrays of in-line fuel rod. This study considers diffusion and reaction due to generation of hydrogen during severe accident in a nuclear power plant with reactor type BWR. The temperature distribution in the nuclear fuel is obtained with a normal diffusion model, whereas that of the distribution of the hydrogen concentration is obtained with a time-fractional telegraph equation (TFTE). The TFTE allows consider the anomalous diffusion processes (non-Fickian effects), which govern the transport in heterogeneous systems. The numerical experiments were performance in an averaging channel that represents a core reactor with the fuel <b>rod</b> with its <b>gap</b> and cladding and cooling steam, in order to establish the importance of the effects of hydrogen diffusion in a severe accident scenario. The initial conditions of this scenario correspond to 100 % of rated power, with scram of the reactor, and without cooling flow. The temperature of the fuel is incremented due to decay heat, and due to lack of cooling the fuel temperature increases, which eventually causes fuel cladding oxidation and hydrogen generation. The hydrogen concentration results in a reaction due to oxidation for different values of fractional coefficient, at t= 0 and short times were obtained. The physical meaning is discussed when the fractional coefficient tends to a value of 1 and when it tends to a value of 0. 5, i. e., within the limits of validity of the fractional model proposed. According to the results obtained the hydrogen concentration is inversely proportional to the fractional coefficient. These results are relevant for decision making in terms of risk analysis in nuclear power plant with BWR...|$|R
40|$|To enhance fuel {{safety and}} to achieve a power uprating, a new concept PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) fuel, which is called a dual cooled fuel rod, has been studied since 2007. Although there are some {{challenging}} problems about each mechanical component, fuel rod supporting structures are especially dealt within this paper. In the dual-cooled annular fuel rod, an inner flow passage {{as well as an}} outer one is used not only to enhance the fuel safety but to achieve a power uprating through the decreasing fuel center temperature and increasing the heat transfer area between fuel and coolant. As a result, the diameter of dual-cooled fuel rods becomes 1. 6 times bigger than a conventional solid fuel <b>rod</b> and the <b>gap</b> between the annular fuel and the spacer grid’s straps is narrowed. This is a current key issue of fuel rod supports. To accommodate the narrowed gap, spacer grids, such as the cantilever type, hemi-sphere type, circular insertion type, etc., were suggested. For some of these configurations, patents have been applied. The grid springs in a spacer grid play the role of holding the fuel rods in an appropriate position and preventing fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation. In the case of the dual cooled fuel rod, the total mass is increased. So, the stiffness of a grid spring has to be increased more than that of a conventional grid spring. However, if the stiffnesses of springs are increased too much, fuel rods can bend due to the prohibition of their axial slip. So, it is necessary to design an appropriate stiffness. In this paper, the minimum spring force to prevent dual-cooled fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation is calculated. The spring characteristics of a cantilever type and a hemi-sphere type are predicted. A finite element analysis is carried out by using the commercial code ABAQUS. The analysis results are verified by experiments. Finally, it is checked whether the property of the suggested springs satisfies the minimum required spring force. Based on the obtained results, a kind of spacer grid candidate for dual cooled fuel rods, i. e. a spacer grid with hybrid supports is suggested...|$|R
