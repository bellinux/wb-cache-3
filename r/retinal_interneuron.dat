In the retina, neurons of numerous individual subtypes form regular arrays called mosaics: {{they are less likely to}} be near neighbors of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in “exclusion zones ” that separate them 1 - 4. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements 2. Remarkably, mosaics are independent of each other: while a neuron of one subtype is unlikely to be adjacent to another of the same subtype, there is no restriction on its spatial relationship to neighboring neurons of other subtypes 5. This independence has led to the hypothesis that molecular cues expressed by specific subtypes pattern mosaics by mediating homotypic (within-subtype) short-range repulsive interactions 1, 4 - 9.

LRP 5 loss-of-function mutations cause incomplete development of retinal vessel network in humans as well as in mice. To understand the underlying mechanism for how LRP 5 mutations lead to retinal vascular abnormalities, we have determined the retinal cell types that express LRP 5 and investigated specific molecular and cellular functions that may be regulated by LRP 5 signaling in the retina. We characterized the development of retinal vasculature in LRP 5 mutant mice using specific retinal cell makers and a GFP transgene expressed in retinal endothelial cells. Our data revealed that retinal vascular endothelial cells predominantly formed cell clusters in the inner-plexiform layer of LRP 5 mutant retina rather than sprouting out or migrating into deeper layers to form normal vascular network in the retina. The IRES-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) report gene under the control of the endogenous LRP 5 promoter was highly expressed in Müller cells and was also weakly detected in endothelial cells of the retinal surface vasculature. Moreover, the LRP 5 mutant mice had a reduction of a Müller cell-specific glutamine transporter, Slc 38 a 5, and showed a decrease in b-wave amplitude of electroretinogram. LRP 5 is not only essential for vascular endothelial cells to sprout, migrate and/or anastomose in the deeper plexus during retinal vasculature development but is also important for the functions of Müller cells and <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons.</b> Müller cells may utilize LRP 5 -mediated signaling pathway to regulate vascular development in deeper layers and to maintain the function of <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons...</b>|$|R

One example, studied for {{over the last four}} decades, is the detection of motion direction in ‘direction selective' neurons. Recently, the starburst amacrine cell, one type of <b>retinal</b> <b>interneuron,</b> has emerged as an essential player in the computation of direction selectivity. In this study the mechanisms underlying the computation of direction selective calcium signals in starburst cell dendrites were investigated using whole-cell electrical recordings and two-photon calcium imaging. Analysis of the somatic electrical responses to visual stimulation and pharmacological agents indicated that the directional signal (i) is not computed presynaptically to starburst cells or by inhibitory network interactions. It is thus computed via a cell-intrinsic mechanism, which (ii) depends upon the differential, i. e. direction selective, activation of voltage-gated channels. Optically measuring dendritic calcium signals as a function of somatic voltage suggests (iii) a difference in resting membrane potential between the starburst cell's soma and its distal dendrites. In conclusion, it is proposed that the mechanism underlying direction selectivity in starburst cell dendrites relies on intrinsic properties of the cell, particularly on the interaction of spatio-temporally structured synaptic inputs with voltage-gated channels, and their differential activation due to a somato-dendritic difference in membrane potential...|$|E

Early in development, spontaneous retinal activity in the no b-wave (nob) mouse is indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice, and eye-specific segregation proceeds normally. But, around eye-opening, spontaneous and visually evoked activity in nob retinas become abnormal, coincident with a failure to preserve precise eye-specific territories.

In the present study we analyzed the expression of calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivities in the chameleon retina, and compared their distribution with those found in the retinas of other vertebrate species. CB immunoreactivity is dense in photoreceptors, horizontal and some lower amacrine cells. The most intense immunoreactivity was observed for calretinin; CR-ir amacrine cells are distributed throughout the inner nuclear, inner plexiform, and ganglion cell layers of the retina. Horizontal cells also display immunoreactivity to CR. A few <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons</b> are weakly PV-ir. Double-labeling shows that all PV-ir or CB-ir cells, except the photoreceptors, are also strongly CR-ir. The distributions of these calcium-binding proteins in the chameleon retina share similarities with those observed in mammalian and avian retinas. In addition, the widespread distribution and co-localization of CB and CR reinforces the idea that these proteins play a general role in buffering the intracellular calcium levels in retinal cells. Furthermore, CB- and CR-immunoreactivities have enabled us to identify for the first time axon-bearing horizontal cells in the peripheral retina of the chameleon, very similar to those described in mammals...|$|R

Within {{an hour after the}} optic nerve is injured, Zn²⁺ increases several-fold in retinal amacrine cell processes and continues to rise over the first day, then transfers slowly to RGCs via vesicular release.

Intravitreal injection of Zn²⁺ chelators enables many RGCs to survive for months after nerve injury and regenerate axons, and enhances the prosurvival and regenerative effects of deleting the gene for phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten). Importantly, the therapeutic window for Zn²⁺ chelation extends for several days after nerve injury. These results show that retinal Zn²⁺ dysregulation is a major factor limiting the survival and regenerative capacity of injured RGCs, and point to Zn²⁺ chelation as a strategy to promote long-term RGC protection and enhance axon regeneration...|$|R

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) can be injected near the optic tract to block incoming retinal activity in addition to the outgoing activity of lateral geniculate neurons. Intraocular injections of epibatidine, a cholinergic agonist, can be used to block spontaneous firing in half of all retinal ganglion cells and cause uncorrelated firing in the remaining half. Effects of the pharmacological agents on retinal ganglion cell activity are observed using either MEA or calcium imaging.Immunotoxins can be used to target starburst amacrine cells. Starburst amacrine cells are <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons</b> responsible for cholinergic retinal waves. The third method is to use knockout mice with altered spontaneous firing patterns. The most common line of mouse for this method is the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta-2 subunit knockout (β2-nAChR-KO). β2-nAChR-KO mice have been observed to have reduced eye-specific retinotopic refinement similar to epitbatidine injection as well as no correlated waves, as observed with calcium imaging and MEA recording.|$|R

BiSl cells appear to be coupled together around the time of birth, but, over the next 10 days, BiSl cells decouple from each other, leading to the mature pattern in which only one subtype is coupled.

Recently it was demonstrated that starburst amacrine cells, a unique class of neurons that secretes both GABA and acetylcholine, spontaneously depolarize. Networks comprised of spontaneously active starburst cells initiate correlated bursts of action potentials that propagate across the developing retina with a periodicity on the order minutes. To determine whether other <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons</b> have similar "pacemaking" properties, we have utilized cultures of dissociated neurons from the rat retina. In the presence of antagonists for fast neurotransmitter receptors, distinct populations of neurons exhibited spontaneous, uncorrelated increases in intracellular calcium concentration. These increases in intracellular calcium concentration were sensitive to tetrodotoxin, indicating they are mediated by spontaneous membrane depolarizations. By combining immunofluorescence and calcium imaging, we found that 44 % of spontaneously active neurons were GABAergic and included starburst amacrine cells. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings {{in the absence of}} antagonists for fast neurotransmitters revealed that after 7 days in culture, individual retinal neurons receive bursts of GABA-A receptor mediated synaptic input with a periodicity similar to that measured in spontaneously active GABAergic neurons. Low concentrations of GABA-A receptor antagonists did not alter the inter-burst interval despite significant reduction of post-synaptic current amplitude, indicating that pacemaker activity of GABAergic neurons was not influenced by network interactions.

Using patch-clamp recordings in the whole-mount neonatal rabbit retina, this study reports that the displaced starburst amacrine cell, a unique cholinergic interneuron in the ganglion cell layer of the retina, undergoes rhythmic bursts of membrane depolarization with a frequency and duration similar to those of spontaneous retinal waves. Simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from pairs of neighboring starburst and ganglion cells show that the rhythmic activity in starburst cells is closely correlated with that in ganglion cells, and that the excitation in both cell types is most likely driven by synaptic input. However, in contrast to ganglion cells, displaced starburst cells usually do not generate spontaneous somatic action potentials. Instead, they seem to use subthreshold potentials (at least at the soma) to mediate the rhythmic excitation.

The axon-bearing and axon-less HC subpopulations molecularly defined by Lim 1 and Isl 1, are born consecutively on embryonic day (E) 3 – 4 and E 4 – 5, respectively, and exhibit temporally distinguishable periods of migration. Their relative numbers are not adjusted by apoptosis. A sharp decrease of high endogenous levels of the activin-inhibitor follistatin at E 3 coincides with the appearance of the Lim 1 positive cells. Extending the follistatin exposure of the HC retinal progenitor cells by injection of follistatin at E 3 increased the number of both Lim 1 - and Isl 1 positive HCs when analysed at E 9. Conclusion The results imply that the axon-bearing and axon-less HC subgroups are defined early and are generated consecutively from a retinal progenitor cell population that is sensitive to the inhibitory action of follistatin. The results are consistent with a model wherein added follistatin causes HC-generating progenitors to proliferate beyond the normal period of HC generation, thus producing extra HCs of both types that migrate to the HC layer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 in the survival of adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Methods: Conditional alleles of Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 were generated (Pou 4 f 1 loxP and Pou 4 f 2 loxP respectively) {{for the removal of}} Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 in adult retinas. A tamoxifen-inducible Cre was used to delete Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 in adult mice and retinal sections and flat mounts were subjected to immunohistochemistry to confirm the deletion of both alleles and to quantify the changes in the number of RGCs and other retinal neurons. To determine the effect of loss of Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 on RGC survival after axonal injury, controlled optic nerve crush (CONC) was performed and RGC death was assessed. Results: Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 were ablated two weeks after tamoxifen treatment. <b>Retinal</b> <b>interneurons</b> and Müller glial cells are not affected by the ablation of Pou 4 f 1 or Pou 4 f 2 or both. Although the deletion of both Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 slightly delays the death of RGCs at 3 days post-CONC in adult mice, it does not affect the cell death progress afterwards. Moreoever, deletion of Pou 4 f 1 or Pou 4 f 2 or both has no impact on the long-term viability of RGCs at up to 6 months post-tamoxifen treatment. Conclusion: Pou 4 f 1 and Pou 4 f 2 are involved in the acute response to damage to RGCs but are dispensable for the long-term survival of adult RGC in mice...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaic arrays (PVA) {{implanted}} {{into the}} subretinal space {{of patients with}} retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are designed to electrically stimulate the remaining inner retinal circuitry in response to incident light, thereby recreating a visual signal when photoreceptor function declines or is lost. Preservation of inner retinal circuitry {{is critical to the}} fidelity of this transmitted signal to ganglion cells and beyond to higher visual targets. Post-implantation loss of <b>retinal</b> <b>interneurons</b> or excessive glial scarring could diminish and/or eliminate PVA-evoked signal transmission. As such, assessing the morphology of the inner retina in RP animal models with subretinal PVAs is an important step in defining biocompatibility and predicting success of signal transmission. In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively compare inner retinal morphology after the implantation of a PVA in two RP models: the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) or transgenic S 334 ter-line 3 (S 334 ter- 3) rhodopsin mutant rat. Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices. In the S 334 ter- 3 rat, we implanted devices at 6 - 12 weeks of age and again, inner retinal morphology was generally preserved with either PVA design 16 - 26 weeks post-implantation. Specifically, the length of rod bipolar cells and numbers of cholinergic amacrine cells were maintained along with their characteristic inner plexiform lamination patterns. Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site. Our results indicate that subretinally implanted PVAs are well-tolerated in rodent RP models and that the inner retinal circuitry is preserved, consistent with our published results showing implant-evoked signal transmission...|$|R
