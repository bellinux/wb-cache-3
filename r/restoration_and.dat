5|$|Many governments now {{prohibit}} {{removal of}} coral from reefs, and inform coastal residents about reef protection and ecology.

5|$|The all African American 332d Fighter Group {{originally}} flew 15,550 sorties as bomber escorts in the Mustang; {{eventually the}} Airmen, who were originally shunned {{in the white}} military, acquired the right to fly combat missions. In 1970, the Commemorative Air Force acquired an original P-51 to include in their educational program. In 1980, Don Hinz {{took charge of the}} aircraft's <b>restoration,</b> <b>and</b> developed the idea of the Red Tail Project, named for the distinctive red paint on the Airmen's aircraft. Originally conceived as a restoration project, Red Tail evolved into an education program. Although the P-51 was restored, mechanical failure caused a crash and the death of the pilot, a retired U.S. Navy commander; the Tuskegee Airmen endorsed and encouraged the aircraft's second <b>restoration,</b> <b>and</b> the newly restored P-51C made its debut at AirVenture 2009 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The memorial's {{location}} {{on a busy}} street corner has caused it to deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent clean-up and restoration projects. The first involved a clean-up of the granite base, while the second involved more extensive <b>restoration,</b> <b>and</b> was completed in April, 2007 at a cost of $90,000.|$|E
5|$|While the {{overriding}} {{atmosphere of the}} interior and exterior of the palace is of the 18th century, the palace itself is not.

The Blu-ray was initially only released as an expensive gift set with a booklet, a luggage tag and other assorted gift-type items.

5|$|A major {{breakthrough}} came in 1984, when English Heritage and the National Heritage Memorial Fund granted a million pounds towards the restoration, with smaller sums from Woodspring District Council and other funding bodies. The trust, {{which had been}} formed by the preservation society, also obtained a 99-year lease. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for <b>restoration,</b> <b>and</b> reconstructed in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive <b>restoration</b> <b>and</b> refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan <b>restoration</b> <b>and</b> the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} as a water supply for agriculture, most of the channel {{remained}} in water, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its <b>restoration,</b> <b>and</b> two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration will require a new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the <b>restoration</b> <b>and</b> to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out {{under the supervision of the}} Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment.
