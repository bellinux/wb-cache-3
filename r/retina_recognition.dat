Fingerprint and iris are generally considered to allow more accurate biometric recognition than the face, but the face is more easily used in surveillance scenarios where fingerprint and iris capture are not feasible. However, the face by itself is not yet as accurate and flexible as desired for this scenario due to expression changes, source of illumination, make-up, etc. Besides these limitations, ear images can be acquired in a similar manner to face images.

40|$|AbstractThe {{recognition}} {{accuracy of}} a single biometric authentication system is often much reduced due to the environment, user mode and physiological defects. So a multimodal biometric approach for identity verification using two competent traits, iris and retina is proposed. This multimodal approach diminishes the drawback of single biometric system and improves the performance of an authentication system. Iris and Retina biometric recognition offers a highly reliable solution to person authentication. Iris recognition system is composed of segmentation, normalization, feature encoding and matching. Instead of using the entire iris code, only the bits that are consistent in the iris code called the Best bits are considered in the feature matching process. This reduces the computational time and storage requirements of iris code. To enhance the performance of recognition, the iris recognition process is applied to left and right irises separately and the corresponding distance scores are generated for each iris of a person. These scores are combined using the weighted sum fusion rule which further increases the recognition rate. In order to provide liveness verification for our authentication system, we also employed retinal blood vessel pattern recognition. This ensures the presence of only alive persons eliminating the possible spoofing attack. It is composed of segmentation, enhancement, feature encoding and matching. The scores from iris and <b>retina</b> <b>recognition</b> are then combined using weighted sum fusion rule, which further increases the recognition rate. To validate our approach, experiments were conducted on the iris and retina images obtained from CASIA and VARIA datasets respectively. A multimodal biometric database was constructed and then 1500 inter, intra image comparisons were made using the two datasets. The experimental results reveal that our multimodal biometric authentication system is much more reliable and precise than the single biometric approaches...|$|E

GAO considered a number of leading and emerging biometric technologies that could potentially be used for securing the nations borders. The seven leading biometric technologies include facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, hand geometry, iris recognition, <b>retina</b> <b>recognition,</b> signature recognition, and speaker recognition. To evaluate the effectiveness of biometrics in border control, {{it is important to recognize}} that the use of biometric technology would be but one component of the decision to support systems that determine who is allowed to enter the United States and who is not.

Before any decision is made to implement biometrics in a border control system, the benefits of the system must be weighed against its costs. The purpose of any biometrics initiative is to prevent the entry of travelers who are inadmissible to the United States. The costs of biometric border control system will not be trivial.

40|$|Abstract — A {{biometric}} system provides automatic identification {{of an individual}} based on a unique feature or characteristic possessed by the individual. Unlike other biometric such as fingerprints and face recognition, the distinct aspect of iris comes from randomly distributed features. Iris recognition {{is regarded as the}} most reliable and accurate biometric identification system available. This paper provides the review of related work in the iris recognition. A general framework of the iris recognition system is proposed and finally {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the iris recognition technology are analyzed. It is commonly accepted that users of a {{biometric system}} may have differing degrees of accuracy within the system. Some people may have trouble authenticating, while others may be particularly vulnerable to impersonation. The estimation results reveal, as expected, that a wide variety of factors affect security transit times including the number of enplaning seats (reflecting flight schedules), weather conditions, day of week, as well as obvious variables such as traveler volume and the number of open security lanes.
