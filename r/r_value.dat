50|$|Batt fiberglass, {{blown in}} cellulose, or an {{insulated}} sawdust mixture are also insulators in cordwood walls. Rob Roy {{has found that}} a mixture of only vermiculite and sawdust, soaked in water overnight, results in an <b>R</b> <b>value</b> of 2.1- 2.5 per in. In a 16” wall this translates to an <b>R</b> <b>value</b> of 11-16. The use of cellulose (with an <b>R</b> <b>value</b> up to 3.7 per in.) can equalize the overall <b>R</b> <b>value</b> {{to that of a}} 2 x 6 stud frame with fiberglas insulation. Other materials like polystyrene or packaging peanuts have been economically used, and provide a purposeful use of recycled materials. A wall consisting of merely cordwood and mortar does not usually provide sufficient insulation for comfortable living in snowy regions, unless it is of the highly insulative Throughwall type.|$|E

40|$|Ellenberg's {{indicator}} {{values have}} been suggested as useful method of estimating site conditions using plants. We examined whether Ellenberg's <b>R</b> <b>values</b> are suitable for indicating soil reaction and if calibration to physical pH measurements can improve bioindication in oligotrophic and mesotrophic submontane broad-leaved forests in Slovakia. Vegetation releves and pH-H 2 O and pH-CaCl 2 soil reaction were recorded for this purpose. Ellenberg's <b>R</b> <b>values</b> (R_e) were compared to Jurko's indicator values (R_j) {{and a set of}} species <b>R</b> <b>values</b> and tolerances (T), which were calibrated with physical pH data using the weighted averaging (R_w, T_w) and Huisman-Olff-Fresco modeling (R_h, T_h). Original R_e values were then recalibrated with measured pH data to establish new, adjusted set of scores (R_c, T_c) at Ellenberg's scale. The Re values are significantly correlated with the other <b>R</b> <b>values,</b> and they demonstrate similar frequency distribution to R_j and R_w values for the studied species pool. The frequency distribution becomes similar across all the <b>R</b> <b>values</b> when indifferent species were excluded. The performance of all the indicator values in terms of bioindication was tested. Releve means of the <b>R</b> <b>values</b> were regressed on the field pH measurements. The performance of bioindication varied from 36 % to 49 % of the explained variance for pH-CaCl 2, with the R e and <b>R</b> c <b>values</b> yielding 46 % and 49 % respectively. The bioindication slightly improved for all calibrated methods (R_w, R_h and R_c) when species were weighed inversely with their tolerances - the performance varied from 42 % to 51 %, and the <b>R</b> c <b>values</b> performed most effectively. We concluded that Ellenberg's <b>R</b> <b>values</b> represent a powerful system for bioindicating soil acidity when compared to the other alternatives, with pH-CaCl 2 showing better results than pH-H 2 O. Recalibration of Ellenberg's values to the measured data improved the indicator system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity in a 504 km 2 river basin in Eastern Pyrenees and assess its uncertainties. The study area is topographically complex and is dominated by Mediterranean climate with intense rains during summer. Available rainfall dataset includes 14 years spanning from 1991 to 2004 at daily resolution from seven weather stations and sub-hourly from one station. Daily <b>R</b> <b>values</b> were calculated from sub-hourly data, and then by using the relationship between daily <b>R</b> <b>values</b> and precipitation, the <b>R</b> <b>values</b> for weather stations having only daily rainfall resolution were calculated. The error propagation by using such upscaling approach was analyzed. The studied sources of uncertainty of R factor at annual scale were: the use of the relationship between daily <b>R</b> <b>values</b> and precipitation, the temporal averaging of <b>R</b> <b>values</b> and spatial variation.

The simulation revealed an <b>R</b> <b>value</b> of 20.5 for the sample cordwood wall. Compare this to the basic 2 x 4 wooden stud wall, and 2 x 6 foam insulated and sheathed wall with R values of 15.8 and 25.7, respectively. Cordwood walls are not the best natural insulators but can be built to thermal efficient standards. The <b>R</b> <b>value</b> of a cordwood wall {{is directly related to}} its ratio of wood to mortar and insulation medium. However, <b>R</b> <b>value</b> in cordwood construction is not as significant as it is in stick-frame building due to the high thermal mass which increases a significantly higher [...] "effective R-value.” Builders tailor their design and ratios to the existing climate.|$|E
50|$|EPS is {{the most}} common of the foams used and has an R-value (thermal resistance) of about 4 K·m2/W per 25 mm {{thickness}}, which would give the 3.5 in of foam in a 4.5 in panel an <b>R</b> <b>value</b> of 13.8 (caution: extrapolating R-values over thickness may be imprecise due to non-linear thermal properties of most materials). This at face value appears to be comparable to an R-13 batt of fiberglass, but because in a standard stick frame house there is significantly more wall containing low <b>R</b> <b>value</b> wood that acts as a cold bridge, the thermal performance of the R-13.8 SIP wall will be considerably better.|$|E

40|$|The 3 He/ 4 He = R {{ratio was}} studied in {{underground}} fluids from 104 sites from the Baikal Rift Zone, BRZ, and adjacent areas in Russia and Mongolia. The <b>R</b> <b>values</b> vary from 1. 0 ×E- 8, typical of crustal radiogenic He, up to 1. 1 ×E- 5 {{just below the}} MORB characteristics. The repeated sampling of some sites and the comparison between the data for superficial springs and productive boreholes have shown no significant R variation in time or in depth. The lowest <b>R</b> <b>values</b> belong to CH 4 -rich gases. The more diverse <b>R</b> <b>values</b> were measured in N 2 - and CO 2 - rich fluids, and the latter show the highest R. Judging from N 2 /Aratm ratio, N 2 -rich gases are of atmospheric origin. The fN 2 /fNe ratio value in CO 2 - rich fluids indicates the excess (non-atmospheric) nitrogen. The comparison of the <b>R</b> <b>values</b> with He concentrations and predominate components of a fluid gas phase shows that this phase is formed under the effect of solubility-controlled fractionation in gas–water system and a gain/loss of chemically active gases within the crust. The distribution of <b>R</b> <b>values</b> across the BRZ strike indicates a discharge of heat-mass flux from the mantle not only inside the BRZ but also far to the east. Inside the BRZ, the range of <b>R</b> <b>values</b> is widest: from 4. 9 ×E- 8 to 1. 1 ×E- 5. These variations are regular: <b>R</b> <b>values</b> diminish along the BRZ strike in both directions from the Tunka Basin considered as a center of rifting. The decrease is accompanied by some decay of heat flow density and shows a reduction of heat-mass flux from the mantle in peripheral segments of the rift zone.

30|$|Rdislocations/normal {{cell wall}} from all SOIs were then {{averaged}} {{to obtain a}} single R reflecting the whole set of SOIs. This way of calculating R was chosen against the alternative sequence of first averaging all the emissions over the whole set of SOIs before rationing and then averaging the values obtained from 3 ROIs. This latter procedure assumes no differential modulation of emission intensity due to absorption and scattering across the cell wall, an assumption we could not make. The standard deviation of the <b>R</b> <b>values</b> thus reflects not only the inherent heterogeneity within a fiber and the measurement error, but also the result of error propagation incurred during the multistep calculation described above.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Currently, {{there is}} {{significant}} ongoing research into the temporal and spatial variability of marine radiocarbon reservoir effects (MREs) through quantification of <b>R</b> <b>values.</b> In turn, MRE studies often use large changes in <b>R</b> <b>values</b> as proxies for changes in ocean circulation. <b>R</b> <b>values</b> are published {{in a variety of}} formats with variations in how the errors on these values are calculated, making it difficult to identify trends or to compare values, unless the method of calculating the R is explicitly described or all of the data are made available in the publication. This paper demonstrates the large range in <b>R</b> <b>values</b> (+ 34 to – 122) that can be obtained from a single, secure archaeological context when using the multiple paired sample approach, {{despite the fact that the}} terrestrial entities were of statistically indistinguishable 14 C ages, as were the marine sam-ples. This demonstrates the inherent variability in the R calculations themselves and we propose that, together with calcu-lation of mean R, the distribution of <b>R</b> <b>values</b> should be displayed, e. g. as histograms in order to illustrate the full data range. This spread is only apparent when employing a multiple paired sample approach as the uncertainty derived on a single pair of samples, taking account only of the errors on the individual 14 C ages, will never truly represent the overall variability in R that results from the intrinsic variability in the population of 14 C ages in samples that might have been used. Conse-quently, <b>R</b> <b>values</b> and the associated uncertainty calculated from single pairs should be treated with some caution.

5000|$|Four {{values that}} {{represent}} clot formation {{are determined by}} this test: the reaction time (<b>R</b> <b>value),</b> the K value, the angle and the maximum amplitude (MA). The <b>R</b> <b>value</b> represents the time until the first evidence of a clot is detected. The K value is the time {{from the end of}} R until the clot reaches 20mm and this represents the speed of clot formation. The angle is the tangent of the curve made as the K is reached and offers similar information to K. The MA is a reflection of clot strength. A mathematical formula determined by the manufacturer can be used to determine a Coagulation Index (CI) (or overall assessment of coagulability) which takes into account the relative contribution of each of these 4 values into 1 equation.The G-value is a log-derivation of the MA and is meant to also represent the clot strength using dynes/sec as its units. There are some studies which suggest that an elevated G-value is associated with a hypercoagulable state and therefore increases the risk for venous thromboembolic disease. However, there are no studies dosing of prophylactic heparin products based on the G-value. TEG also measures clot lysis which is reported as both the estimated percent lysis (EPL) and the percentage of clot which has actually lysed after 30 minutes (LY 30,%). Although a normal EPL can be as high as 15% and a normal LY 30 can be has high as 8%, some studies in the trauma population suggest that a LY30 greater than 3% is associated with risk of hemorrhage.|$|E
