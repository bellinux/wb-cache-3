40|$|A {{review of}} {{predictive}} {{methods used to}} determine the frictional drag on a rough surface is presented. These methods utilize a wide range of roughness scales, including <b>roughness</b> <b>height,</b> pitch, density, and shape parameters. Most of these scales were developed for regular roughness, limiting their applicability to predict the drag for many engineering flows. A new correlation is proposed to estimate the frictional drag for a surface covered with three-dimensional, irregular roughness in the fully rough regime. The correlation relies solely on a measurement of the surface roughness profile and builds on previous work utilizing moments of the surface statistics. A relationship is given for the equivalent sandgrain <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> {{as a function of the}} root-mean-square <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> and the skewness of the roughness probability density function. Boundary layer similarity scaling then allows the overall frictional drag coefficient to be determined as a function of the ratio of the equivalent sandgrain <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> to length of the surface.

Under hydrodynamic stresses, the retention of spore settlements in features larger than 5  μm decreased as topography features increased in scale or distance apart. Spores also tended to 'lean’ on nearby substrate features to increase its area of contact and reduce the effort required {{to adhere to the}} substrate [15]. This behaviour also explains the spores reduced preference to settle on smooth surfaces and the tendency of spores to lean on each other for support if there is no other choice but to settle (Figure  1 B) [14]. This is demonstrated in investigations where topographies with average <b>roughness</b> <b>heights</b> (Rz) that ranged from 20 - 50  μm retained more spore settlements than similar topographies with <b>roughness</b> <b>heights</b> from 50 - 100  μm [17, 20, 33].

40|$|Annular seals are devices, {{which are}} used in turboMachinery systems to reduce the flow leakage, and to provide better dynamic {{stability}} to the system. Leakage flow can strongly affect cooling quality, heating balance, and efficiency of a turboMachinery system. Due {{to the fact that}} annular seals can significantly reduce the flow leakage, and provide the most cost-effective way of enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency, understanding of the flow characteristics through the annular seal configurations is an important subject. Seals are classified in two main groups, which are contacting, and non-contacting seals. Straight annular and convergent seal configurations are characterized as non-contacting seals, and they are widely used in rotating turbocMachinery systems. The flow kinetic energy obtained from the flow pressure is dissipated by the effects of shear stresses along the free shear layers. In addition, viscosity of the flow has an impact on the dissipation rate of the flow kinetic energy.

Seventeen industrially relevant rough surfaces with a wide variation in surface topography are considered. Various studies are conducted to understand the ﬂow physics {{and the relationship between}} key ﬂow parameters and surface topography. Studies at low values of friction Reynolds number, Reτ, for a single surface, show that the ﬂow is laminar up to Reτ = 89 and begins to develop quasi-periodic ﬂuctuations at Reτ = 89. 5. Fluctuations in the three velocity components continue to grow until Reτ = 91, and the ﬂow is turbulent for Reτ ≥ 92. Transition depends on the surface topography as some roughness peaks trigger ﬂuctuations before others. For all the surfaces, mean and turbulent ﬂow statistics are computed at Reτ = 180, for which the ﬂow is fully turbulent but transitionally rough. All surfaces are scaled to the same physical <b>roughness</b> <b>height.</b> Nevertheless, a wide range of roughness function, ∆U+, values is obtained, indicating that it depends not only on the <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> but also on the detailed roughness topography. Other mean and turbulence ﬂow statistics also vary considerably depending on the surface topography. Next, based on the simulation results database at Reτ = 180, a newly formulated method, that determines which surface topographical properties are important and how new properties can be added to an empirical model, is tested. Optimised models with several roughness parameters are systematically developed for ∆U+ and proﬁle peak turbulent kinetic energy. In determining ∆U+, besides the known parameters of solidity and skewness, it is shown that the streamwise correlation length and rms <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> are also signiﬁcant.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the bulk aerodynamic method for estimating surface fluxes {{of heat and}} moisture using the surface radiative temperature. The surface radiative temperature is often the only available surface temperature from field measurements. Models typically predict heat fluxes from the surface radiative temperature computed from the surface energy balance. In this study, the corresponding radiometric exchange coefficient and radiometric <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> are computed from tower- and low-level aircraft data taken during four different field programs. The data analysis shows that the radiometric exchange coefficient does not increase with increasing instability. This is because the radiometric exchange coefficient must compensate for the large vertical temperature difference resulting from use of the surface radiative temperature. The data analysis and scaling arguments indicate that the radiometric exchange coefficient for heat in the bulk aerodynamic formulation {{is closely related to}} θ*/Δθ for both stable and unstable conditions, where Δθ is the difference between the surface radiative temperature and the air temperature and θ* is the negative of the heat flux divided by the surface friction velocity. Application of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory with surface radiative temperature also reduces to a relatively circular internal relationship between the radiometric <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> and θ*/Δθ. This <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> is flow dependent and not systematically related to the <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> for momentum. As an additional complication, the observed radiometric exchange coefficient for heat depends on the relationship between the measured surface radiative temperature and the microscale distribution of surface radiative temperature in the footprint of the heat flux measurement.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to establish a wind farm in the windy areas due to the increased use of renewable energies. Sistan region is one of the windy regions in Iran but due to the dust in the wind of this area and adhesion property of this particles to the wind turbine blade, smoothness of the blade surface is somewhat lost which affects its aerodynamic performance. In this paper, the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blade was numerically investigated considering the <b>roughness</b> <b>height</b> due to the sticking dust particles in the wind, change of the attack angle, and <b>roughness</b> <b>height.</b> It compared with the experimental results and the range of the optimum attack angle was proposed for turbine in the Sistan region...|$|R
