5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a trisonic wind tunnel to determine the load distribution over the external tank and solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters</b> of the space shuttle launch configuration. The external tank was sting-supported and the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters</b> and orbiter were mounted directly on the external tank. The external tank was, instrumented with 152 pressure orifices and the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters</b> contained 78 orifices. The pressure data were obtained for various combinations of the three geometric components as the gap size between the external tank and the solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters,</b> angle of attack, and angle of sideslip were varied.

50|$|On 29 March 2010, workers {{attached}} ET-136 to its solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters.</b> A crane {{lifted the}} ET into high bay No. 1 inside the VAB. The day-long process was completed around 18:00 EDT, as the tank was bolted to Atlantiss twin solid <b>rocket</b> <b>boosters.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|STS-8 was {{the eighth}} NASA Space Shuttle mission {{and the third}} flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger. It {{launched}} on August 30, 1983 and landed on September 5, conducting the first night launch and night landing of the Space Shuttle program. It also carried the first African-American astronaut, Guion Bluford. The mission successfully achieved all of its planned research objectives, but was marred by the subsequent discovery that a solid-fuel <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> had almost malfunctioned catastrophically during the launch.|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} <b>rocket</b> <b>booster.</b> This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E

25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster</b> (SRB). Compared with the Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster,</b> which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster</b> were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster</b> nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage ground test, the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E
25|$|The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) (Delta 9240) {{is similar}} to the Medium, but uses two Alliant-built 1.5-m (60-in) {{diameter}} solid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM-60s) strap-on boosters to increase payload capacity to 6,150kg to GTO.|$|E

25|$|The weight {{reduction}} {{from the}} SWT {{was accomplished by}} eliminating portions of stringers (structural stiffeners running {{the length of the}} hydrogen tank), using fewer stiffener rings and by modifying major frames in the hydrogen tank. Also, significant portions of the tank were milled differently so as to reduce thickness, and the weight of the ET's aft solid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> attachments was reduced by using a stronger, yet lighter and less expensive titanium alloy.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 Lockheed Martin {{produced}} an Advanced Transportation System Studies (ATSS) {{report for the}} Marshall Space Flight Center. A section of the ATSS report describes several possible vehicles much like the Ares I design, with liquid rocket second stages stacked above segmented solid <b>rocket</b> <b>booster</b> (SRB) first stages. The variants that were considered included both the J-2S engines and Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) for the second stage. The variants also assumed use of the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) as a first stage, but the ASRM was cancelled in 1993 due to significant cost overruns.|$|E
25|$|While {{the system}} was {{developed}} within the original cost and time estimates given to President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability {{by the time of}} the February 2003 Columbia accident proved to be much worse than originally anticipated. A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending on the Shuttle for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster</b> were to fail; and the fragility of the Shuttle's thermal protection system.|$|E
25|$|The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident—also {{known as}} the Rogers Commission—was formed to {{investigate}} the disaster. It determined that the accident was due to a failure of rubber O-rings made by Morton-Thiokol that provided a pressure seal in the aft field joint of the shuttle's right Solid <b>Rocket</b> <b>Booster.</b> The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors that included the low temperature {{on the day of}} launch. The Commission found that O-ring resiliency is directly related to temperature and due to the low temperature at launch—36 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees lower than the next coldest previous launch—it was probable the O-rings had not provided a proper seal.|$|E
