On inhalation, the diver only {{breathes}} from the outer counterlung - return flow from the inner bellows is blocked by a non-return valve. The inner bellows also connects to another non-return valve opening to the outside environment, and thus the gas from the inner bellows is dumped from the circuit in a fixed proportion of the volume of the inhaled breath. If the counterlung volume is reduced sufficiently for the <b>rigid</b> <b>cover</b> to activate the feed gas demand valve, gas will be added until the diver finishes that inhalation.|$|E

40|$|We propose qubits {{based on}} shallow donor {{electron}} spins in germanium structures with phononic gap. We consider a phononic crystal formed by periodic holes in Ge plate or a <b>rigid</b> <b>cover</b> / Ge layer / rigid substrate structure with gaps approximately a few GHz. The spin relaxation is suppressed dramatically, if the Zeeman frequency omegaZ {{is in the}} phononic gap, but an effective coupling between the spins of remote donors via exchange of virtual phonons remains essential. If omegaZ approaches to a gap edge in these structures, a long-range (limited by detuning of omegaZ) resonant exchange interaction takes place. We estimate that ratio of the exchange integral to the longitudinal relaxation rate exceeds 10 (exp 5) and lateral scale of resonant exchange 0. 1 mm. The exchange contribution can be verified under microwave pumping through oscillations of spin echo signal or through the differential absorption measurements. Efficient manipulation of spins due to the Rabi oscillations opens a new way for quantum information applications...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{worldwide}} increase in the use of retractable roofs for stadia. This increase has been based on the flexibility and better economic performance offered by venues featuring retractable roofs compared to those with traditional fixed roofs. With this increased interest an evolution in retractable roof systems has followed. This dissertation is concerned with the development of concepts for retractable roof systems. A review is carried out to establish the current state-of-the-art of retractable roof design. A second review of deployable structures is used to identify a suitable retractable structure for further development. The structure chosen is formed by a two-dimensional ring of pantographic bar elements interconnected through simple revolute hinges. A concept for retractable roofs is then proposed by covering the bar elements with <b>rigid</b> <b>cover</b> plates. To prevent the cover plates from inhibiting the motion of the structure a theorem governing the shape of these plate elements is developed through a geometrical study of the retractable mechanism. Applying the theorem it is found that retractable structures of any plan shape can be formed from plate elements only. To prove the concept a 1. 3 meter diameter model is designed and built. To increase the structural efficiency of the proposed retractable roof concept it is investigated if the original plan shape can be adapted to a spherical surface. The investigation reveals that {{it is not possible to}} adapt the mechanism but the shape of the <b>rigid</b> <b>cover</b> plates can be adapted to a spherical surface. Three novel retractable mechanisms are then developed to allow opening and closing of a structure formed by such spherical plate elements. Two mechanisms are based on a spherical motion for the plate elements. It is shown that the spherical structure can be opened and closed by simply rotating the individual plates about fixed points. Hence a simple structure is proposed where each plate is rotated individually in a synchronous motion. To eliminate the need for mechanical synchronisation of the motion, a mechanism based on a reciprocal arrangement of the plates is developed. The plate elements are interconnected through sliding connections allowing them mutually to support each other, hence forming a self-supporting structure in which the motion of all plates is synchronised. To simplify the structure further, an investigation into whether the plate elements can be interconnected solely through simple revolute joints is carried out. This is not found to be possible for a spherical motion. However, a spatial mechanism is developed in which the plate elements are interconnected through bars and spherical joints. Geometrical optimisation of the motion path and connection points is used to eliminate the internal strains that occur in the initial design of this structure so a single degree-of-freedom mechanism is obtained. The research presented in this dissertation has hence led to the development of a series of novel concepts for retractable roof systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVortex {{breakdown}} {{and transition}} to time-dependent regimes are investigated in a cylinder (H/R = 4) with a rotating disk and a free-surface. The {{aim of this}} study is to show how, by changing upstream conditions it is possible to alter on the flow, particularly the vortex breakdown process. The understanding of such effects on vortex breakdown is very useful in the development of a control strategy in order to intensify or remove the phenomenon. The flow dynamics are explored through numerical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations based on high-order spectral approximations. The use of a flat, stress-free model for the air/water interface is shown to be entirely satisfactory at least for moderate Reynolds numbers. A particular interest of these results is to show how the bubble related to the vortex breakdown becomes attached to the free-surface and grows in diameter as the Reynolds number is increased, Re ⩾ 2900. Such a phenomenon removes the cylindrical vortex core upstream of the breakdown which is usually included in classical theories based on idealized models of vortex flows. The flow is shown to be unstable to three-dimensional perturbations for sufficiently large rotation rates. The bifurcated state takes the form of a k = 3 rotating wave at Re = 3000. The existence of the free-surface promotes the onset of periodicity, with a critical Reynolds number about 15 % lower than in the case with a <b>rigid</b> <b>cover.</b> Moreover, the successive bifurcations occur over a much shorter range of Reynolds numbers and lead rapidly to a multi-frequency regime with more than five different frequencies. In the unsteady regime, the vortex breakdown is characterized by an elongated, asymmetric recirculation zone, attached to the free-surface and precessing around the axis of the container. By increasing the rotation, the circular stagnation line on the free-surface takes a more irregular form and starts to move around the axis of the cylinder in the same sense as the rotating disk. Finally, our results show that the vertical boundary layer controls both the vortex breakdown process and the transition to unsteadiness...|$|E

Os pequis foram lavados em água corrente e sanificados antes e após a retirada da casca em solução de hipoclorito de sódio 200 mg. L- 1 e 100 mg. L- 1, por 15 e 5 minutos, respectivamente. Os pequis foram acondicionados em embalagem rígida de polipropileno (PP), da seguinte forma: coberta com tampa do mesmo polímero; envolta com filme de policloreto de vinila (PVC) 0, 014 mm; selada passiva e ativamente (3, 2 % O 2 + 9, 2 % CO 2) e (7, 7 % O 2 + 3, 9 % CO 2) com filme de polietileno (PE) + PP 0, 060 mm. Conclui-se que as embalagens rígidas seladas passiva e ativamente com filme de PE + PP 0, 060 mm não são recomendadas para acondicionar pequi minimamente processado, em razão do nível de O 2 estar próximo a 0 %, no terceiro dia de armazenamento, o que compromete a sua qualidade. As embalagens rígidas de polipropileno com tampa do mesmo polímero e as envoltas com filme de PVC são as mais indicadas para pequi minimamente processado, visto que não propiciam condições de anaerobiose e nem alteraram expressivamente suas características físicas, físico-químicas e químicas, resultando em uma vida útil de 12 dias de armazenamento a 5 ± 1 ºC e UR 90 ± 5 %.

Peki fruit were washed with stream water and sanitized with sodium hypochlorite 200 and 100 mg. L- 1, for 15 and 5 minutes, before and after peeling, respectively. Peki fruit were packed into rigid propylene package (PP) : with <b>rigid</b> <b>cover</b> of same polymer; covered with polyvinyl chloride film (PVC) 0, 014 mm; passive and actively (3, 2 % O 2 + 9, 2 % CO 2) and (7, 7 % O 2 + 3, 9 % CO 2) sealed with polyethylene (PE) + PP film 0, 060 mm. One concluded that rigid packages sealed passive and actively with film of PE + PP 0, 060 mm are not recommended to fresh-cut peki fruit condition, due to the fact of the level of O 2 to be next to 0 % in the third day of storage, what compromises its quality. The rigid packages of polypropylene with cover of same polymer and those covered with PVC film are the most suitable to fresh-cut peki fruit, since they do not promote anaerobiosis conditions and do not change expressively their physical, physical-chemical and chemical characteristics during 12 days of storage at 5 ± 1 ºC and RH 90 ± 5 %...|$|E
