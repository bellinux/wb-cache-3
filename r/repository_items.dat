40|$|This paper {{describes}} two tools- {{a digital}} portfolio generator and {{a guided tour}} generator- designed to facilitate the dissemination of digital cultural repositories. These tools {{address the needs of}} three types of users: specialists, interested in recovering all documents pertaining to a given work of art, theme or fact; academic users, attracted by educational uses of the repository; and casual visitors, interested in “cultural sightseeing”. A digital portfolio is a subset of the repository, containing only items of interest to the user, and maintaining the meaningful organization of the full repository. A guided tour establishes a predetermined navigation path over a set of <b>repository</b> <b>items,</b> and consists of a set of Web pages that tell the users a story or that guide him through a tour or virtual exhibit. Underlying these tools is a set of relatively simple, core computing technologies that, when used appropriately, can support useful metaphors for museum applications on the Web. In addition, these tools allow non-expert (in computing) users, responsible for cultural repositories, to quickly generate and disseminate material of interest to their target audience in the Web. Finally, by automating the repetitive portion of the task, they reduce the cost of developing and deploying these applications. 1...|$|E
