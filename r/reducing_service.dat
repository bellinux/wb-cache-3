5000|$|Historically much {{interest}} has focussed on the incentives on the regulated firm to enhance efficiency - that is, incentives {{to reduce its}} expenditure while maintaining a given {{quantity and quality of}} output. In principle, the building block model can be designed so as to yield either very low-powered incentives to minimise expenditure (which is sometimes known as cost-of-service or rate-of-return regulation) or very high-powered incentives. The building block model can be implemented {{in such a way as}} to yield very high-powered incentives to reduce expenditure by (a) setting the operating and capital expenditure inputs in the building block model on the basis of forecasts which are independent of the regulated firm's own actions, and (b) not [...] "clawing back" [...] any over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period. However, very high-powered incentives create their own problems - they create strong incentives on the firm to cut expenditure or defer capital expenditure - even at the expense of <b>reducing</b> <b>service</b> quality. In addition, high powered incentives expose the regulated firm to higher levels of risk and give rise to strong incentives to lobby the regulator for a higher target level of revenue. Economic theory does not support the use of very high-powered incentives and, in practice, almost all practical regulatory regimes tend to involve medium-powered incentives.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{integrated}} network management framework for inter-domain outbound traffic engineering. The framework {{consists of three}} functional blocks (monitoring, optimization and implementation) to make the outbound traffic engineering adaptive to network condition changes such as inter-domain traffic demand variation, inter-domain routing changes and link failures. The objective {{is to keep the}} inter-domain link utilization balanced under any of these changes while <b>reducing</b> <b>service</b> disruptions and reconfiguration overheads. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better load balancing with less service disruptions and re-configuration overheads in comparison to alternative approaches. ...|$|E

Classical models of supplier-induced demand predict that medical providers will supply fewer services if they face increasing prices. We test this prediction based on a reform of hospital financing in Germany. Uniquely, this reform changed the overall level of reimbursement - with increasing prices for some hospitals and decreasing prices for others - without affecting the relative prices for different types of patients. Based on administrative data, we find that hospitals do indeed react to increasing prices by <b>reducing</b> <b>service</b> supply...|$|E
