40|$|This paper {{considers}} broadband {{signal transmission}} via high-voltage/broadband over power lines (HV/BPL) channels associated with overhead power transmission. To determine the end-to-end channel characteristics of various overhead HV/BPL multiconductor transmission line (MTL) configurations, the chain scattering matrix or T-Matrix (TM) method is adopted. The overhead HV/BPL transmission channel is investigated {{with regard to}} its spectral behavior, its end-to-end signal attenuation, and phase response. It is found that the above features depend critically on the frequency, the coupling scheme applied, the physical properties of the cables used, the MTL configuration, {{and the type of}} branches existing along the end-to-end BPL signal propagation. Unlike the older models that underestimate the broadband transmission potential of overhead HV lines significantly, the results demonstrate that the overhead HV grid is a potentially excellent communications medium, offering low loss characteristics over a 100 km <b>repeater</b> <b>span</b> well beyond 100 MHz and guarantees the imminent coexistence of low-voltage (LV), medium-voltage (MV), and HV BPL systems towards a unified transmission/distribution smart grid (SG) power grid...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{extends the}} {{existing}} transmission and capacity analysis {{in order to}} investigate the broadband potential of overhead high-voltage/broadband over power lines (HV/BPL) connections where a single repeater is additively deployed between their existing transmitting and receiving ends (overhead HV/BPL connections with two-hop repeater system). The contribution {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, the broadband performance of various overhead HV/BPL connections with two-hop repeater system has been studied with regard to their cumulative capacity. The analysis and relevant simulations validate the potentially excellent communications medium of overhead HV/BPL channels over a 25 km <b>repeater</b> <b>span</b> well beyond 88 MHz in terms of cumulative capacity. In addition, through the deployment of two-hop repeater systems, apart from the upsurge of cumulative capacity, overhead HV/BPL connections become more adaptive to different capacity requirements. Second, it is found that overhead HV/BPL network capacity performance depends drastically on factors such as the overhead HV grid topology and the noise characteristics. Through the deployment of two-hop repeater systems, capacity losses due to existing aggravated overhead HV/BPL topologies and high noise environments are significantly reduced. Third, the numerical results reveal the importance of considering as suitable mitigation technique the deployment of overhead HV/BPL connections with twohop repeater system. Except for the low-cost and quick technology upgrade of existing overhead HV/BPL networks, this mitigatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} broadband {{signal transmission}} and statistical performance properties of high-voltage/broadband over power lines (HV/BPL) channels associated with overhead power transmission. The overhead HV/BPL transmission channel is investigated {{with regard to}} its spectral behavior, its end-to-end signal attenuation, and its statistical performance metrics. It is found that the above features depend critically on the frequency, the overhead HV power grid type (150 [*]kV, 275 [*]kV, or 400 [*]kV and single- or double-circuit), the coupling scheme applied, the physical properties of the cables used, the MTL configuration, {{and the type of}} branches existing along the end-to-end BPL signal propagation. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, the significant broadband transmission potential of overhead HV lines is revealed. The results demonstrate that, regardless of overhead HV power grid type, the overhead HV grid is a potentially excellent communications medium, offering low-loss characteristics, flat-fading features, and low multipath dispersion over a 25 [*]km <b>repeater</b> <b>span</b> well beyond 100 [*]MHz. Second, regarding the statistical properties of various overhead HV/BPL transmission channels, two fundamental correlations of several wireline systems, for example, coaxial cables and xDSL, are also validated in the case of overhead HV/BPL transmission channels, namely, (i) end-to-end channel attenuation in relation with root-mean-square delay spread (RMS-DS) and (ii) coherence bandwidth (CB) in relation with RMS-DS. Third, fitting the numerical results and other field trial measurements, two regression distributions suitable for each fundamental correlation are proposed...|$|E
