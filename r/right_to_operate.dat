5|$|Local {{resident}} William Windham {{had been}} sub-tutor to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, {{and was the}} former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to George II. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the ferry until 1798. Windham sub-let the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the ferry to local resident Henry Holland. With the ferry unable to serve {{the demands of the}} area, in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 William Champion, and Lord Dysart, {{operators}} {{of the nearby}} Twickenham Ferry, took legal action against Hammerton to remove his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the ferry. Although Hammerton won the initial case, the judgement was reversed on appeal. Following considerable public interest in the case, a public subscription raised the funds for Hammerton {{to take the case}} to the House of Lords, who ruled in his favour on 23 July 1915.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil war}} {{ended with the}} Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which {{provided}} that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. In {{the last year of}} Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> a mint in the town of Newark, granted in perpetuity. But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln, and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of Banbury in 1154.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry II, and the {{accession}} of Richard as king, the monks of Christ Church Priory petitioned Richard to intercede in the long-running dispute {{between them and the}} archbishop. In November 1189, Richard and the whole court, including the Queen Mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, travelled to Canterbury in an attempt to end the controversy before the papacy become involved. Richard finally settled the dispute by persuading Baldwin to abandon his church-building project and to dismiss Norreys. Soon after this, Richard left England and Baldwin declared {{that he was going to}} found the proposed church at Lambeth, and then join Richard on crusade. Both Richard and Baldwin agreed to appoint Norreys to Evesham Abbey, as the previous abbot of Evesham, Adam of Evesham, had recently died. This appointment eventually led, after Baldwin's death, to the Case of Evesham. In August 1189 Baldwin objected to the marriage of Prince John, later King John, to Isabel of Gloucester, on the grounds of consanguinity. John promised to obtain a papal dispensation, but never did so. Baldwin laid John's lands under interdict, but it was lifted by a papal legate who declared the marriage legal. Richard also restored to the archbishops of Canterbury the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> a mint, staffed by three moneyers.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{discovery}} proved complicated, environmentally sensitive and economically challenging. The planning and review process took from 1986 to 1990, {{and set a}} new standard for community participation and consultation. Two companies, Shell and Husky, competed for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the field. The public hearing into the development forced the corporations {{to compete for the}} right to develop the resource on new terms.|$|E
25|$|The 1990 {{constitution}} recognized Nepal as a multi-ethnic and multilingual country. It {{also said}} that each community shall have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> schools up to the primary level in its own mother tongue. However, the government's responsibility was not stated and communities had to open such schools on their own. In 1991, Jagat Sundar Bwane Kuthi, the first Nepal Bhasa-medium school, opened in Kathmandu with the efforts of volunteers {{and the support of}} domestic and foreign donors.|$|E

25|$|Ownership {{and rights}} to the ferry were hotly contested between the 1820s and 1866. These {{conflicts}} were not settled until 1866 when the Millersburg Ferry was licensed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. Joseph Kramer, son of David Kramer, was granted by the Act of March 21, 1866 P.L. 358, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the ferry at his own expense.

The new contract began in July 2015 and runs until 2034.|$|E
25|$|Ball's use of {{replacement}} workers {{to keep the}} railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the FEC took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, installed various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs. Most of the nation's other railroads did not match these achievements for several years; some still had not as of 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{commuter}} ferry {{is not a}} new idea. Tradition has it that Native Americans regularly {{crossed the}} Hudson River at the point between what is now Beacon and Newburgh, long before Europeans arrived in America. In 1743, an “official” ferry was established when Alexander Colden received a royal charter from King George II to carry passengers and goods for profit. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> ferries between Beacon and Newburgh was bestowed upon the Ramsdell family by the heirs of Alexander Colden. They ran the ferry through the Steamboat Era until 1956 when NYSBA took over ferry services.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne's cable tram {{system has}} {{its origins in}} the MTOC, started by Francis Boardman Clapp in 1877, {{with a view to}} operate a Melbourne tram system.

Although some lines were originally intended to be horse trams, and the MTOC did operate three horse tram lines on the edges of the system, the core of the system was built as cable trams.|$|E
25|$|The desavazhi had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> kalaris, {{which were}} {{military}} training schools that all young Nair {{men from the}} age of 12 were expected to attend.

The function of these schools became less significant practically following the introduction of the Arms Act by the British, which limited the right of Nairs to carry arms; however, they continued to exist and provided some training to those Nair men who did not attend English schools. This training became evident at village festivals, during which a martial review would take place.|$|E
