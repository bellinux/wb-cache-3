5|$|By 1912, the {{community}} of nuns had outgrown their convent in Chicago, and relocated to the new Convent of the Sacred Heart in Lisle.

5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E

5|$|Imperator totius orientis (commander-in-chief of {{the entire}} East): only the Augustan History claims that Odaenathus was conferred with this title; the same source also claims that he was made an Augustus (co-emperor) {{following}} his defeat of the Persians. Both claims are dismissed by scholars. Odaenathus {{seems to have been}} acclaimed as Imperator by his troops which is a salutation <b>reserved</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Roman emperor; this acclamation might explain the erroneous reports of the Augustan History.|$|E

5|$|In {{a number}} of older books, the MiG I-211 is called the MiG-5.

The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort fighter. Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine. This name was reused shortly afterwards for the first Mikoyan-Gurevich jet fighter.|$|E
