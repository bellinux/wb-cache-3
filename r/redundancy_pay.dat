[...] Localised strikes occurred at Kinneil Colliery in Scotland and Lewis Merthyr Colliery in Wales. [...] The industry's Select Committee heard that 36,040 of the 39,685 redundancies between 1973 and 1982 were of men aged 55 and over, and <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> was increased substantially in 1981 and 1983.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brothers}} started {{recording and}} sending demos to record companies in 1983 (using a Portastudio bought with £300 {{given to them}} by their father from <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> after he lost his factory job), and by early 1984 they had recruited bass player Douglas Hart and teenage drummer Murray Dalglish. Early influences included The Velvet Underground, The Stooges, and The Shangri-Las, William stating in 1985, [...] "We all love The Shangri-Las, and one day we're going to make Shangri-Las records." [...] Jim mentioned his liking for Pink Floyd, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Monkees and Muddy Waters. Early demos displayed a similarity to the Ramones, prompting the brothers to add another element to their sound; in William's words: [...] "That's why we started using noise and feedback. We want to make records that sound different." [...] They began playing live in Spring 1984. In the early days Jim Reid's guitar would be left out of tune, while Dalglish's drum kit was limited to two drums, and Hart's bass guitar only had three strings, down to two by 1985; in Hart's words [...] "that's the two I use, I mean what's the fucking point spending money on another two?

40|$|Recent {{enhancements}} {{in process}} development enable the fabrication of three dimensional stacked ICs (3 D-SICs) such as memories based on Wafer-to-Wafer (W 2 W) stacking. One {{of the major}} challenges facing W 2 W stacking is the low compound yield. This paper investigates compound yield improvement for W 2 W stacked memories using layer redundancy and compares it to wafer matching. First, an analytical model is provided to prove the added value of layer redundancy. Second, the impact of such a scheme on the manufacturing cost is evaluated. Third, these two parts are integrated to analyze the trade-off between yield improvement and its associated cost; the realized yield improvement is also compared to yield gain obtained when using wafer matching. The simulation results show that for higher stack sizes layer redundancy realizes a significant yield improvement as compared to wafer matching, even at lower cost. For example, for a stack size of six stacked layers and a die yield of 85 %, a relative yield improvement of 118. 79 % is obtained with two redundant layers, while this is 14. 03 % only with wafer matching. The additional cost due to <b>redundancy</b> <b>pays</b> off; the cost of producing a good 3 D stacked memory chip reduces with 37. 68 % when using layer redundancy and only with 12. 48 % when using wafer matching. Moreover, {{the results show that}} the benefits of layer redundancy become extremely significant for lower die yields. Finally, layer redundancy and wafer matching are integrated to obtain further cost reduction...|$|R
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the notice period, <b>redundancy</b> <b>pay</b> increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{association}} rule mining. It is well-known that naive miners end up often providing far too {{large amounts of}} mined associations to result actually useful in practice. Many proposals exist for selecting appropriate association rules, trying to measure their interest in various ways; most of these approaches are statistical in nature, or share their main traits with statistical notions. Alternatively, some existing notions of redundancy among association rules allow for a logical-style characterization and lead to irredundant bases (axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size. Here we follow up on a study of closure-based redundancy, which, in practice, leads to smaller bases than simpler alternative forms of redundancy, with the proviso that, in principle, {{they need to be}} complemented with an implicational basis. One can push the intuition of redundancy further and gain a perspective of the interest of association rules in terms of their “novelty ” with respect to other rules. An irredundant rule is so because its confidence is higher than {{what the rest of the}} rules would suggest; then, one can ask: how much higher? Among several variants, a recently proposed parameter, the confidence boost, succeeds in measuring a notion of novelty along these lines so that it fits better the needs of practical applications. However, that notion is based on plain redundancy, of relatively limited practical usefulness. Here we extend the confidence boost to closure-based <b>redundancy,</b> <b>paying</b> a small theoretical price to obtain several advantages in practical applications. We describe a rule-mining system implementing this contribution. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{debates on}} {{pensions}} and retirement age, {{little attention has}} been paid to the relation between increased effective retirement age and the health of the older population. This article focuses on Britain at a crucial point in the past, when the reconstruction that followed recession in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s used previously accumulated pension and <b>redundancy</b> funds to <b>pay</b> off workers and make labor markets "flexible. " Using secondary data analysis of surveys of the same nationally representative sample in 1984 and 1991, the author argues that, while early retirement and retirement at age 60 (women) and 65 (men) took many able-bodied people out of the labor force, every increase in retirement age would have faced diminishing returns. Moreover, unemployment and exit from the labor market were accompanied in most cases by a perceived decline in well-being. The findings suggest that retirement should be tapered, not abrupt. Finally, there was pronounced inequality in the aging process that would have led to a situation in which a uniform policy on later retirement deepened the disadvantage of those least able to fend for themselves. Accordingly, the present U. K. government should positively discriminate in favor of the disadvantaged at retirement by reinforcing the state pension...|$|R
