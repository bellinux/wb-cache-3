Developed from 1999 onwards by the French studio Lexis Numérique, Missing Since January was launched by Ubisoft in Europe in October 2003 and by Dreamcatcher in the US in January 2004. In Missing Since January, using the internet, the player must attempt to decode a mysterious CD ROM broadcast by the police in order to find two missing people abducted by a serial killer. More than a hundred sites were created for this purpose. By and large, as the player advances in the enquiry, they are contacted by different characters that send emails. The follow-up, which appeared in 2006 under the title Evidence: The Last Ritual ("In Memoriam 2, The Last Ritual" [...] in Europe) also allowed players to receive text messages and to speak on the phone with certain characters in the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Software {{agents have}} been one of the most active {{research}} areas in the last decade. As a result, new agent technologies and concepts are emerging. Mobile agent technology has been used in <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>environments,</b> such as on-line auctions, supply chain, information gatherings, etc. In most situations, mobile agents must be created and carefully crafted to work together almost from scratch. We believe that this is quite inefficient for application developers and users, and hence propose a system for generating and coordinating agents based on the notion of agent missions. The prototype system is called eHermes and its architecture and components are discussed in the paper. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Union has set {{different}} {{targets to}} overcome the sustainability problems, but to reach these targets sustainable technologies are needed. To develop these sustainable technologies, living labs can be a valuable addition to the innovation process because at these sustainable technology living labs, sustainable technologies can be tested in a <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>environment.</b> However, {{the problem is that}} local regulations are blocking the realization of these sustainable technology living labs. First, because it is unclear what sustainable technology living labs are. Second, the regulations are not suitable to create a location with experimental technologies where visitors can interact with these technologies. Therefore the research question addressed in this research is: To what extend do the regulations of the province and municipality have to change in order to realize sustainable technology living labs? To analyze this problem, the path creation theory was used as a theoretical frame to guide the research. The Green Village, a sustainable technology living lab which has to be realized at the campus of the Technical University of Delft, was used in this research as a case study to find out what a sustainable technology living lab is and how regulations are influencing this realization process. The realization of the Green Village was analyzed with a qualitative case study research design, including a literature review and semi-structured expert interviews to collect data. From the results in this research can be concluded that a sustainable technology living lab is a continuously changing site where collaborating organizations can present, demonstrate and test their researched and future technologies in a <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>environment.</b> At this <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>environment</b> users can actively contribute to the innovation process of these technologies in order to accelerate the diffusion of sustainable technologies to create a sustainable future.

40|$|Abstract - Socially assistive robots (SARs) {{must be able}} to {{interpret}} non-verbal communication from a human. A person’s gaze direction informs the observer where the visual attention is directed to. Therefore it is useful if a robot can interpret the gaze direction, so that it can assess whether a person is looking at it or some object in the environment. Gazing is a combination of head and eye movement, but detecting eye orientation from a distance is difficult in <b>real</b> <b>life</b> <b>environments.</b> Instead a robot can measure the head pose and infer the gaze direction. In this paper, we show that both the yaw and pitch of a human’s gaze can be inferred from the measured yaw and pitch of the human’s head pose with simple linear equations...|$|R
