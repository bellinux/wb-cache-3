The high-pressure water would be applied [...] "to a variety of other useful purposes, to which the same has never before been so applied." [...] Major components of the system were a <b>ring</b> <b>main,</b> into which a number of pumping stations would pump the water, with pressure being regulated by several air vessels or loaded pistons.
