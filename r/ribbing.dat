5|$|Madonna premiered {{the song}} at a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden {{to raise money}} for medical {{research}} for AIDS. She dedicated the song to the memory of her friend, artist Martin Burgoyne. Madonna has since performed the song on three of her world tours. In 1987, during the Who's That Girl World Tour, she performed the song standing motionless in a single spotlight, wearing a black ensemble with tassels, golden tips and <b>ribbing,</b> designed by Marlene Stewart. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E
5|$|There {{was limited}} {{interference}} from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included {{the addition of}} a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel <b>ribbing.</b> These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted a reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in batches of {{anywhere}} between 20 and 100. Eggs are yellow and slightly elongated and tall and display shallow transverse <b>ribbing.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Rib</b> tips are short, meaty {{sections}} of <b>rib</b> {{attached to the}} lower end of the spare <b>ribs,</b> between the <b>ribs</b> and the sternum. Unlike back <b>ribs</b> or spare <b>ribs,</b> the structure of the <b>rib</b> is provided by dense costal cartilage, not bone. <b>Rib</b> tips are cut away from the spare <b>ribs</b> when preparing St. Louis style spare <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Short <b>ribs,</b> by definition, are not {{the entire}} length of <b>rib.</b> When the <b>rib</b> bone is cut into a 3 to 6 in length, left as a section of meat (a [...] "plate") {{containing}} three or four <b>ribs</b> or cut into individual <b>ribs</b> with meat attached, the short <b>rib</b> is known as an [...] "English cut". They may also be known as barbecue <b>ribs,</b> braising <b>ribs,</b> or fancy cut <b>ribs.</b> A section of short <b>ribs</b> from the plate (<b>ribs</b> six through eight, with their intercostal muscle) is known as a [...] "short plate". <b>Rib</b> short <b>ribs</b> are almost always sold as a plate.|$|R
50|$|The terms true {{and false}} <b>rib</b> {{describe}} <b>rib</b> pairs that are {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase true <b>rib</b> (costae verae), or fixed <b>rib,</b> refers to the first seven, or vertebrosternal, <b>rib</b> pairs. The phrase false <b>rib</b> (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral <b>ribs</b> refers to the eighth-to-twelfth pairs of <b>ribs.</b> The eighth-to-tenth pairs of <b>ribs</b> connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages of the <b>ribs</b> above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|R

25|$|The {{king was}} carried {{back to his}} quarters, and the exits of the Opera were sealed. Anckarström was arrested the {{following}} morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until informed that Horn and <b>Ribbing</b> had also been arrested and had confessed in full.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>ribs.</b> Form-ribs, plate-type <b>ribs,</b> truss <b>ribs,</b> closed-ribs, forged <b>ribs</b> and milled <b>ribs,</b> where form-ribs are used for light to medium loading and milled <b>ribs</b> offer the {{greatest}} strength.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the carcass}} is {{cut across the}} bone to create strips of meat with {{multiple}} <b>rib</b> bones, the short <b>rib</b> {{is known as a}} [...] "flanken cut." [...] These may also be known as crosscut <b>ribs,</b> Eastern European-style <b>ribs,</b> Hawaiian-style <b>ribs,</b> Jewish <b>ribs,</b> Korean-style <b>ribs,</b> or [...] "kosher ribs". Flanken-cut short <b>ribs</b> incorporate at least two <b>rib</b> bones, and are often no more than 1 to 2 in thick.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standing}} <b>rib</b> roast, {{also known}} as prime <b>rib,</b> is a cut of beef from the primal <b>rib,</b> one of the nine primal cuts of beef.

25|$|Blame {{ranges from}} humorous <b>ribbing</b> of friends to merciless attacks on outsiders. Among ancient {{literary}} theorists, iambic verse {{came to be}} regarded as lower than lyric poetry, partly because iambic meter was thought to be the simplest of verse forms, and the nearest to common speech, but also because of its undignified content.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2009 at 18:03:10 EDT, {{the launch}} was finally successful. Upon {{reviewing}} the launch video footage, imagery analysts noted {{eight or nine}} instances of foam shedding from the External Tank. The pictures of the external tank taken when jettisoning showed loss of foam in the intertank <b>ribbing.</b> The chairman of the Mission Management Team was not concerned and felt that the Space Shuttle would be cleared for re-entry on its return voyage—which {{it was a few}} days later.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans <b>ribbing</b> conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E
40|$|Haploid {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae with {{mutations}} {{in two different}} <b>rib</b> genes were constructed.

25|$|In January 1567, Erik's page Gustaf <b>Ribbing,</b> who {{had been}} sentenced to death for desertion, under torture accused Svante Sture, Per Brahe, Gustaf Olsson Stenbock and Sten Erikson of sabotaging Erik's {{marriage}} plans. Svante Sture and Sten Erikson had to sign a document acknowledging that they had plotted against the king's marriage, {{and that they would}} not {{stand in the way of}} Erik's future marriage plans, even if this meant the king's marriage to his non-noble mistress Karin Månsdotter. While Persson continued to collect evidence against Erik's perceived and real opponents, Erik summoned a riksdag in Uppsala in May 1567 to settle the quarrels.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prolific}} glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in Cologne on the river Rhine in Germany by late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and terracotta base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption {{and the application of}} mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers. Besides, blown flagons and blown jars decorated with <b>ribbing,</b> as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops. Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example bottles with a handle, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at Poetovio and Celeia in Slovenia.|$|E
25|$|Decoration {{for these}} first stone domes was {{initially}} the same external <b>ribbing</b> as earlier brick domes, and such brick domes {{would continue to}} be built throughout the Mamluk period, but more elaborate patterns of carving were introduced through the beginning of the sixteenth century. Early stones domes were plastered externally when not cut precisely enough, but improvements in technique over time would make this unnecessary. Spiral ribs were developed in the 1370s and zigzag patterns were common both {{by the end of the}} fourteenth century and again at the end of the fifteenth century. In the fifteenth century, interlaced star and floral designs were used in a tiled pattern. The uniqueness of a pattern on a mausoleum dome helped to associate that dome with the individual buried there.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rib</b> roast (or bone-in {{pork loin}} <b>rib</b> roast, bone-in loin <b>rib</b> roast, center cut <b>rib</b> roast, prime <b>rib</b> of pork, {{standing}} <b>rib</b> roast) {{is a whole}} pork loin with the back <b>ribs</b> attached. They can be up to 2 ft long and 6 in thick. They are sold whole or in sections.|$|R
5000|$|In general, human <b>ribs</b> {{increase}} in length from <b>ribs</b> 1 through 7 and decrease in length again through <b>rib</b> 12.

40|$|An earlier {{model for}} the study of <b>rib</b> cage {{mechanics}} was modified so that <b>rib</b> deformity in scoliosis could be better represented. The rigid <b>ribs</b> of that model were replaced by five-segment deformable rits. Literature data on cadaver <b>rib</b> mechanical behavior were used to assign stiffnesses to the new individual model <b>ribs</b> so that experimental and model <b>rib</b> deflections agreed. Shear and tension/compression stiffnesses had little effect on individual <b>rib</b> deformation, but bending stiffnesses had a major effect. Level-to-level differences in mechanical behavior could be explained almost exclusively by level to level differences in the <b>rib</b> shape. The model <b>ribs</b> were then assembled into a whole <b>rib</b> cage. Computer simulations of whole <b>rib</b> cage behaviors, both in vivo and in vitro, showed a reasonable agreement with the measured behaviors. The model was used to study <b>rib</b> cage mechanics in two scolioses, one with a 43 [deg] and the other with a 70 [deg] Cobb angle. Scoliotic <b>rib</b> cage deformities were quantified by parameters measuring the <b>rib</b> cage lateral offset, <b>rib</b> cage axial rotation, <b>rib</b> cage volume and <b>rib</b> distortion. <b>Rib</b> distortion was quantified both in best-fit and simulated computer tomography (CT) scan planes. Model <b>rib</b> distortion was much smaller in best-fit planes than in CT planes. The total <b>rib</b> cage volume changed little {{in the presence of the}} scolioses, but it became asymmetrically distributed...|$|R
25|$|In the 3rd century, Imperial mausoleums {{began to}} be built as domed rotundas, rather than as tumulus {{structures}} or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late third and early fourth centuries. In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due {{to changes in the}} way domes were constructed, including advances in centering techniques and the use of brick <b>ribbing.</b> The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. Baptisteries {{began to be}} built in the manner of domed mausoleums during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, many American {{retailers}} considered {{video games}} a passing fad, and greatly reduced sales of such products, or stopped them entirely. To avoid {{the stigma of}} video game consoles, Nintendo marketed the AVS as a full home computer, with an included keyboard, cassette data recorder, and a BASIC interpreter software cartridge. The BASIC interpreter would later be sold together with a keyboard as the Family BASIC package, and the cassette deck for data storage would later be released as the Famicom Data Recorder. The AVS also included a variety of computer-style input devices: gamepads, a handheld joystick, a musical keyboard, and the Zapper light gun. The AVS Zapper is hinged, allowing it to straighten out into a wand form, or bend into a gun form. The AVS uses a wireless infrared interface for all its components, including keyboard, cassette deck, and controllers. Most of the peripherals for the Advanced Video System are {{on display at the}} Nintendo World Store. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic grey monochrome design, with the top and bottom portions in different shades, a stripe with black and <b>ribbing</b> along the top, and minor red accents. The AVS also features a boxier design than the Famicom: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint. The front of the main unit features a compartment for storing the wireless controllers out of sight. Its software carries the Nintendo Seal of Quality to communicate the company's approval.|$|E

For the perforated <b>ribs,</b> the slit height is 20 % of the <b>rib</b> height, and the open-area ratio is 16 %. We discuss the flow in terms of mean velocity, streamlines, vorticity, turbulence intensity, and Reynolds shear stress. We find that the recirculation bubbles after the perforated <b>ribs</b> are significantly smaller than those after the solid <b>ribs.</b> The reattachment length after perforated <b>ribs</b> is smaller by about 45 % compared with the solid <b>ribs.</b> In addition, the Reynolds shear stresses around the perforated <b>ribs</b> are significantly smaller than in the solid <b>rib</b> case, leading to a reduction of the pressure loss in the perforated <b>rib</b> case...|$|R

500|$|The whorls of {{the shell}} of species of Amphidromus are {{moderately}} convex and, {{with only a few}} exceptions, are smooth or have a faint sculpture of growth lines. However, a sculpture of moderately heavy oblique radial ribs has appeared at least four separate times in the genus, [...] and {{can be seen in the}} following species: Amphidromus costifer Smith from Binh Dinh Province in Vietnam; A. begini Morlet from Cambodia; A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri from Celebes; and the A. palaceus-A. winteri complex from Java and Sumatra. Correlated with the <b>ribbing</b> is a light, monochrome coloration, and a thin shell with a large aperture and a flaring lip.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} <b>rib</b> {{geometric parameters}} of individual <b>ribs</b> of 14 modern human subjects (7 males and 7 females) {{in comparison to}} the reconstructed <b>ribs</b> of the Kebara 2 skeleton which was taken from the reconstruction of a Neandertal thorax by Sawyer & Maley (2005). Three-dimensional (3 D) models were segmented from CT scans and each <b>rib</b> vertex cloud was placed into a local coordinate system defined from the <b>rib</b> principal axes. <b>Rib</b> clouds were then analysed using best fitting ellipses of the external contours of the cross-section areas. The centroid of each ellipse was then used to measure the centroidal pathway between each slice (<b>rib</b> midline). Curvature of the <b>ribs</b> was measured from the mid-line of the <b>ribs</b> as the sum of angles between successive centroids in adjacent cross sections. Distinct common patterns were noted in all <b>rib</b> geometric parameters for modern humans. The Kebara 2 reconstructed <b>ribs</b> also followed the same patterns.
