40|$|An otherwise-healthy, active 83 -year-old Nigerian man {{developed}} reversible central cord myelopathy from a mild fall {{on a level}} surface. Cervical spine {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) revealed C 5, 6, and 7 block vertebrae and <b>marked</b> <b>disc</b> extrusions only at the immediately adjoining upper and lower non-fused segments of the cervical spine. There was no spinal canal stenosis otherwise. We think that the unique presentation of this case of Klippel-Feil syndrome further supports the impression that following fusion (congenital or acquired) of one segment of the spinal column, hypermobility of the non-fused adjoining segments may strongly predispose to more disc extrusions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The framed little 2 -discs operad is {{homotopy}} {{equivalent to}} a cyclic operad. We show that the derived modular envelope of this cyclic operad (i. e., the modular operad freely generated in a homotopy invariant sense) is homotopy equivalent to the modular operad made from classifying spaces of diffeomorphism groups of 3 -dimensional handlebodies with <b>marked</b> <b>discs</b> on their boundaries. A modification of the argument provides a new and elementary proof of K. Costello’s theorem that the derived modular envelope of the associative operad is homotopy equivalent to the “open string ” modular operad made from moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with marked intervals on the boundary. Our technique also recovers a theorem of C. Braun that the derived modular envelope of the cyclic operad that describes associative algebras with involution is homotopy equivalent to the modular operad made from moduli spaces of unoriented Klein surfaces with open string gluing. 1...|$|R

50|$|A nocturnal {{will have}} an outer <b>disc</b> <b>marked</b> with the months of the year, and an inner <b>disc</b> <b>marked</b> with hours (and perhaps half hours, or quarter hours on the largest instruments) as well as {{locations}} for one or more reference stars. It will also have a pointer rotating on the same axis as the discs, sometimes extended beyond the rim. The axis, or pivot point, must be such that a star can be sighted through it; usually a hollow rivet is used. Since the instrument is used at night, markings may be exaggerated or raised. Often the inner disc has a diagram of the necessary constellations and stars, to aid in locating them.|$|R

40|$|International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, IIH-MSP 2017. Matsue, Japan, 12 - 15 August 2017. We {{propose a}} {{watermarking}} method using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features that have both scale and rotation in-variance, and evaluate our method {{in accordance with}} the information hiding criteria (IHC) ver. 5. It is dened as evaluation criteria against several possible attacks; these attacks are JPEG compression and geometric attacks, e. g., scaling, rotation, and clipping. In our method, we use local feature regions located around the SIFT features that are robust against scaling and rotation. The regions are normalized in size and selected as marked regions. Watermarks are embedded in the marked regions. We also introduce two error-correction techniques: weighted majority voting (WMV) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. When a stego-image is attacked by scaling or rotation, the image is spatially distorted. WMV and LDPC code can correct errors of extracted watermarks in the distorted stego-image. On the other hand, {{it is not easy to}} detect <b>rotated</b> <b>marked</b> regions. Therefore, the correct orientation is searched for by brute force. We evaluated the proposed method in accordance with IHC ver. 5. Our method can achieve robustness against scaling and rotation attacks in the highest tolerance category...|$|R
