5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, <b>rapid</b> <b>fattening</b> and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E
40|$|Thirty West African Dwarf goat {{kids were}} raised on low plane of {{nutrition}} from 5 days old to 52 weeks of age. They were serially slaughtered at 2, 8, 12, 24 and 52 weeks old to study changes in liveweight {{and the development}} of lean muscle, bone and fat. Lean muscle and fat expressed as the percentage of empty body weight (E. B. W.) increased from 32. 5 % and 3. 5 % at 2 weeks to 42. 0 % and 9. 4 % at 52 weeks respectively. These increases at 52 weeks old represented about 544. 9 % and 1093. 3 % over their respective weights at 2 weeks old. The bone tissue increased to about 307. 3 % at 52 weeks old over its weight at 2 weeks of age, but decreased from 15. 4 % E. B. W. at 2 weeks to 10. 9 % E. B. W. at 52 weeks of age. Lean muscle was consistently the largest carcass tissue from 2 weeks to 52 weeks of age followed by the bone tissue, while fat was the least. Female goat kids entered the <b>rapid</b> <b>fattening</b> phase at about 38 weeks of age (6. 9 kg liveweight), but the males did not enter the <b>rapid</b> <b>fattening</b> phase, even at 52 weeks of age (11. 8 kg. liveweight) ...|$|E
40|$|Thirty West African Dwarf goat {{kids were}} raised on good diets intensively from 5 days to 52 weeks of age. Six animals (3 males and 3 females) were {{serially}} slaughtered at 2, 8, 12, 24 and 52 weeks of age to study changes in live weight {{and the development}} of lean muscle, bone and fat. Lean muscle and fat expressed as the percentage of empty body weight (E. B. W) increased from 31. 8 % and 3. 8 % at 2 weeks to 43. 2 % and 14. 2 % at 52 weeks respectively. These increases at 52 weeks of age were about 673. 2 % and 2090. 8 % over their respective weights at 2 weeks of age. The bone tissue also increased to about 220. 7 % at 52 weeks over the weight at 2 weeks of age, but decreased from 17. 4 % E. B. W. at 2 weeks to 9. 8 % E. B. W at 52 weeks of age. At 2 weeks of age, muscle was the largest tissue, followed by bone, while fat was the least. The bone grew at a low impetus rate, muscle at intermediate rate and fat at high impetus rate so that at 52 weeks of age fat become the second largest tissue and bone the least. Male goat kids entered the <b>rapid</b> <b>fattening</b> phase later in life (about 43 weeks of age) and at heavier live weight (about 12 kg live weight) than the female goat kid (about 28 weeks of age and 9 kg live weight respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology of}} #Colossoma macropomum$ is {{studied in the}} Trinidad region (Mamore Basin, Bolivia) {{and the results are}} {{compared}} with those from other basins. Almost unexploited in Bolivia, #C. macropomum$ stocks are already in regression in central Amazonia. It inhabits flood-plain and is indifferent to the two main water types, white waters originally from the Andes and black waters formed in "pampas". It is oustandingly resistant to hypoxia through the development of lower lip extensions often observed in numerous adults. During high waters, #C. macropomum$ are scattered into the flooded areas; they gather together in the lakes when the water recedes and finally reach the Mamore river. At low water, they migrate upstream for reproduction which takes place {{in the last quarter of}} the year near the Securé riverbanks. In the breeding season, males remain at the spawning places while, after spawning, females move to recently flooded areas. The length at sexual maturity is 62 cm for females and 60 cm for males. There is a clear condition cycle composed of <b>rapid</b> <b>fattening</b> during high waters followed by a long thinning down beginning at fall and lasting till the middle of next flood. These results on feeding agree with those obtained in central Amazonia : intense feeding period on fruits and seeds falling from the trees during high waters followed by a long fast, total for adults, partial for youngs. This cycle is registered on otolith (asteriscus) sections by alternating broad opaque zones and hyaline rings well stained by toluidin blue. These marks were useful to age most fishes with a good accuracy and to study the growth. The growth is fast and similar in both sexes until sexual maturity, which occurs between 7 and 10 years. Adult male growth is slightly slower than that of female; the difference between the two average maximal lengths is only 2 cm (74 cm for females, 72 cm for males). #Colossoma macropomum$ can live a very long time, at least 40 years (maximum, 65 years). Growth curve shows a pattern characteristic of inexploited stocks. (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|E
