40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>recainam</b> (WY- 42, 362), {{a new class}} IC {{antiarrhythmic}} drug, on ventricular defibrillation was evaluated with use of implanted superior vena cava and left ventricular patch electrodes in 17 normal dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. The energy required for a 50 % probability of successful defibrillation (E 50) {{was used as the}} index of ventricular defibrillation threshold. The dogs were classified into three groups: a saline group (n = 6), a low dose <b>recainam</b> group (n = 6) and a high dose <b>recainam</b> group (n = 5). The low dose infusion involved an intravenous loading dose of 3. 75 mg/kg body weight over 20 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0. 0375 mg/kg per min. The high dose infusion was double those rates. The low dose <b>recainam</b> infusion produced a plasma <b>recainam</b> concentration of 3. 1 ± 0. 3 μg/ml and significantly increased QRS duration by 11. 3 ± 3 % during sinus rhythm. The high dose <b>recainam</b> infusion produced a plasma concentration of 7. 7 ± 0. 9 μg/ml and significantly increased QRS duration by 27 ± 7 % in sinus rhythm. <b>Recainam</b> did not change ventricular effective refractory period or sinus cycle length. The mean change in E 50 between control and infusion periods was 1 ± 5 % in the saline group (8. 5 ± 1. 4 versus 8. 6 ± 1. 6 joules); 42 ± 11 % in the low dose <b>recainam</b> group (8. 1 ± 1. 0 versus 11. 3 ± 1. 3 joules) and 92 ± 17 % in the high dose <b>recainam</b> group (11. 2 ± 2. 1 versus 20. 5 ± 2. 5 joules). The changes in E 50 in the two <b>recainam</b> groups were significantly different from those in the saline group and from each other (p < 0. 05). It is concluded that <b>recainam</b> elevates the energy required for ventricular defibrillation in a dose-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|<b>Recainam</b> is an investigational {{antiarrhythmic}} drug {{recently introduced}} into clinical testing. It is a phenylalkyl urea derivative {{that produces a}} concentrationdependent decrease in membrane responsiveness and maximal upstroke velocity. 1 The reduction in maximal upstroke velocity displays use-dependence, 1 similar to the class 1 A drugs. However, unlike class 1 A drugs, but similar to class 1 B agents, <b>recainam</b> does not prolong action potential duration. 1 Other studies demonstrated that <b>recainam</b> slows conduction with minimal effect on ventricular refractoriness, 2 effects consistent with a class 1 C antiarrhythmic action. Thus, these preliminary investigations suggested that <b>recainam</b> possesses a unique electrophysiologic profile with properties {{of each of the}} 3 class 1 subclasses. Other preclinical studies have demonstrated recainam's efficacy in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias in the postinfarction dog model 3 and initial clinical studies have demonstrated that it is highly effective in suppressing ventricular premature complexes. 4 - 6 However, no studies to date have reported the electrophysiologic effects of <b>recainam</b> in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Such is the purpose of this report...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{efficacy and}} safety of intravenous <b>recainam,</b> a newly synthesized compound displaying potent class I antiarrhythmic activity, were tested in 10 hospitalized patients with frequent (> 30 /h) complex ventricular ectopic beats. There were seven men and three women of average age 57 years (range 21 to 74); five had ischemic heart disease, three had cardiomyopathy and two had valvular heart disease. <b>Recainam</b> was given as a 3. 0 mg/kg per 40 min loading infusion followed by a 0. 9 mg/kg per h maintenance infusion over a 24 hour observation period. Arrhythmia response was assessed both {{in the short term}} (comparing 2 hours before and 1 hour after drug loading) and in the long term (comparing 48 hours before drug loading and 23 hours of maintenance infusion). The median frequency of total premature ventricular complexes decreased in the short term by 99. 6 % (from 392. 5 to 1. 5 /h, p < 0. 005) and in the long term by 99. 7 % (from 435 to 1. 3 /h, p < 0. 01). Repetitive beats were suppressed by a median of 100 % both in the short term (p < 0. 006) and during 24 hour infusion (from 80. 9 to 0 /h, p < 0. 003). More than 90 % suppression of repetitive beats occurred in all 10 patients (100 %) and more than 90 % suppression of total arrhythmias occurred in 9 patients (90 %) during the maintenance period. Electrocardiographic PR and QRS intervals increased by 19 % (p < 0. 001) and 24 % (p < 0. 003), respectively, during therapy, but the JTc interval decreased (p < 0. 001). Plasma <b>recainam</b> concentrations averaged 5. 2 ± 0. 9 μg/ml after loading and 3. 0 ± 0. 5 μg/ml during maintenance therapy. No adverse symptoms occurred. In summary, <b>recainam</b> is a promising, highly efficacious and well tolerated agent when administered intravenously for short-term and maintenance suppression of complex ventricular arrhythmias. The efficacy of oral and intravenous <b>recainam</b> for arrhythmia management deserves further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecainam (Wy 42, 362) {{is a new}} {{antiarrhythmic}} agent undergoing clinical evaluation, but its electrophysiologic effects in cardiac muscle are poorly defined. With microelectrode techniques, its profile in isolated preparations of dog and rabbit hearts was determined using drug concentrations of 10 to 300 μM. <b>Recainam</b> induced a concentration and frequency-dependent decrease in the maximal rate of rise of ihe phase 0 of the action potential (Vmax), action potential amplitude and overshoot potential, {{with little or no}} change in the effective refractory period except in Purkinje fibers, in which it was markedly reduced. At a 300 μMconcentration, Vmaxwas reduced 51 % (p < 0. 001) in ventricular muscle and 44 % (p < 0. 001) in atrial muscle, with no change in action potential duration or effective refractory period. At the same drug concentration in Purkinje fibers, Vmaxwas decreased by 41 % (p < 0. 01), action potential duration at 90 % repolarization by 36 % (p < 0. 01) and effective refractory period by 34 % (p < 0. 01). <b>Recainam</b> had no significant effect on the sinoatrial node, but it depressed phase 4 depolarization in isoproterenol-induced automaticity in Purkinje fibers. The drug had no effect on slow channel potentials induced by high concentrations of potassium and isoproterenol. The data indicate that the electrophysiologic profile of <b>recainam</b> in isolated cardiac muscle is consistent with the overall effects of class IC agents without having an effect on the slow calcium channel. Its major action is to depress Vmax, with little effect on refractoriness. As in the case of other class IC compounds, the differential effects of <b>recainam</b> on the action potential duration in ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers may predispose to the drug's proarrhythmic actions by accentuating heterogeneity in refractoriness in the heart...|$|E
