40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for characterization of nuclear fuel, both from an operator and authority point of view, motivates {{the development of}} new experimental and, preferable, non-destructive methods. In this thesis, some methods based on nuclear spectroscopic techniques are presented. Various parameters of irradiated fuel are shown to be determined with high accuracy and confidence by utilizing gamma-ray scanning, tomography and passive neutron assay. Specifically, fuel parameters relevant for a secure storage of spent nuclear fuel in a long-term repository, such as e. g. burnup and decay heat, are shown to be determined with adequate accuracy. The techniques developed are expected to be implemented in the planned <b>encapsulation</b> <b>facility</b> in Sweden. Also, a device for tomographic measurements of the spatial distribution of thermal power in nuclear fuel assemblies has been built, tested and evaluated. The device utilizes single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to reconstruct the gamma-ray source distribution within a fuel assembly. The device is expected to be an important tool for validating reactor core simulators regarding new fuel designs. For safeguards purposes, two experimental methods for verifying the integrity, i. e. the possible loss of fissile material from a nuclear fuel assembly, are presented. Verification of integrity is shown to be possible on an individual fuel rod level...|$|R

40|$|RadBall{trademark} {{is a novel}} {{technology}} that can locate and quantify unknown radioactive hazards within contaminated areas, hot cells, and gloveboxes. The device consists of a colander-like outer tungsten collimator that houses a radiation-sensitive polymer semi-sphere. The collimator {{has a number of}} small holes with tungsten inserts; as a result, specific areas of the polymer are exposed to radiation becoming increasingly more opaque in proportion to the absorbed dose. The polymer semi-sphere is imaged in an optical computed tomography scanner that produces a high resolution 3 D map of optical attenuation coefficients. A subsequent analysis of the optical attenuation data using a reverse ray tracing or backprojection technique provides information on the spatial distribution of gamma-ray sources in a given area forming a 3 D characterization of the area of interest. RadBall{trademark} was originally designed for dry deployments and several tests, completed at Savannah River National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, substantiate its modeled capabilities.

This description includes waste characteristics, waste types, locations, and associated hazards. The goal to be met by the Transition Phase preclosure activities is to place the TSD unit into a safe and environmentally secure condition for the long-term Surveillance and Maintenance (S&M) Phase of the facility decommissioning process. This preclosure work plan has been prepared in accordance with Section 8. 0 of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (Tri-Party Agreement) (Ecology et al. 1996). The preclosure work plan is one of three critical Transition Phase documents, the other two being: B Plant End Points Document (WHC-SD-WM-TPP- 054) and B Plant S&M plan. These documents are prepared by the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and its contractors with the involvement of Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology).

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new expressive theory of types for the higher-order p-calculus which significantly improves our previous work presented in [65] {{by the use of}} channel dependent/existential types. New dependent types control dynamic change of process accessibility via channel passing, while existential types guarantee safe scope-extrusion in higher-order process passing. This solves an open issue in [65], leading to significant enlargement of original typability and offering a general basis for analysing and verifying higher-order mobile computation. This paper establishes a basic theory of dependent and existential types for the higher-order p- calculus, and coherently integrates the resulting formalism with the linear/affine typing disciplines as well as state, concurrency and distribution [6, 27, 63, 66], which allow precise embedding of major language constructs in the calculus. The type discipline can guarantee unique accessibility of resources, termination of migrating code, a response property from a <b>remote</b> server and <b>encapsulation</b> of higher-order code by hidden names. The technical development in this paper gives a firm basis for the applications discussed in its sequels. Part II presents uniform type-based static analyses of two basic security concerns for higher-order mobility, secrecy for data confidentiality and access controls for authorised resources. Part III uses this framework for developing and justifying a type discipline for a simple multi-threaded class-based language with distributed code mobility which enforces secrecy and safe access controls...|$|R
