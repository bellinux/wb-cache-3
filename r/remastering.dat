5|$|On July 29, 2003, I Want You was reissued by Motown as a two-disc {{expanded}} edition release, featuring 24-bit digital <b>remastering</b> of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously unissued material, and a 24-page booklet, which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as comprehensive essays by writers including David Ritz.|$|E
5|$|The film soundtrack {{has since}} been {{released}} by other companies in different configurations (including complete score releases). The highly regarded master tapes were however damaged during a 1990s <b>remastering,</b> so none of the subsequent re-releases {{are considered to be}} as fine-sounding as the original LP release.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, 2001, Let's Get It On was reissued by Motown as a two-disc deluxe edition release, {{featuring}} 24-bit digital <b>remastering</b> of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously unissued material and a 24-page booklet which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as essays from Gaye biographers David Ritz and Ben Edmonds.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>remastered</b> {{version of}} Full Throttle, titled Full Throttle <b>Remastered,</b> was {{developed}} by Schafer's Double Fine Productions for release on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. The <b>remastered</b> was announced on December 5, 2015, and was released on April 18, 2017.

25|$|Please Please Me was <b>remastered</b> and re-released on CD in stereo, {{along with}} all the other {{original}} UK studio albums, on 9 September 2009. The 2009 <b>remasters</b> replaced the 1987 <b>remasters.</b> A <b>remastered</b> mono CD was also available as part of The Beatles in Mono box set.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, a <b>remastered</b> {{edition of}} the album was released, {{featuring}} <b>remastered</b> tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Three different formats of the <b>remaster</b> were made available.|$|R
5|$|A major {{complication}} in <b>remastering</b> {{the original}} work was having {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E
5|$|Brown Sugar was re-released as a two-disc deluxe edition on August 25, 2017, by Virgin and Universal Music Enterprises. The reissue {{featured}} <b>remastering</b> by Russell Elevado, a 20-page booklet essayed by Nelson George, and 21 additional songs. The bonus material included instrumentals, {{a cappella}} versions, and remixes by CJ Mackintosh, Dallas Austin, King Tech, Erick Sermon, and Incognito; {{seven of the}} 21 additional songs had never been released before commercially, while the others were previously available only on vinyl.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the <b>remastering</b> of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E

5|$|In April 1992, {{following}} {{the success of}} Nirvana's second album Nevermind, Sub Pop released a remastered version of Bleach on LP, CD and cassette, adding two extra tracks. Geffen Records handled the international release. The CD version was packaged in a cardboard foldout case that included a bonus booklet filled with photos of the band from 1987–1990. For the 20th anniversary of the album, Sub Pop released on November 3, 2009 a deluxe reissue of Bleach featuring a March 2009 <b>remastering</b> from the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at Portland, Oregon's Pine Street Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, {{featuring}} such extras as a <b>remastering</b> and remix of {{the entire}} album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its concert of September 20, 1992 at Magnuson Park in Seattle. It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog {{that led up to}} the band's 20th anniversary in 2011. A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty was also planned to coincide with the anniversary. In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} was {{released}} on VHS on June 18, 1996, through Manga Entertainment, and on DVD on March 31, 1998, by Anchor Bay Entertainment. Manga Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on November 24, 2009; this version contains the original film and the <b>remastering,</b> but omits the audio commentary and face-to-face interview with Oshii, which are listed on its box. Manga Entertainment and Anchor Bay Entertainment re-released the film on Blu-ray with a brand new HD film print on September 23, 2014. The release was met with criticism for its poorly-translated English subtitles and lack of special features.|$|E

5|$|Iron Maiden {{returned}} to the studio to record Virtual XI, released in 1998. The album's chart scores were the band's lowest to date, including the UK where it peaked at No.16 failing to score one million worldwide sales {{for the first time}} in Iron Maiden's history. At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in <b>remastering</b> the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album {{was to have been}} a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital <b>remastering</b> onto compact disc could produce a high-quality product that was comparable with official studio releases.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the <b>remastering</b> team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{recordings}} compiled for Coltrane for Lovers initially received {{criticism for}} Coltrane's stylistic move from complex jazz compositions {{of the free}} jazz form to a simplistic formula of ballads and blues. Following the initial controversy, the album's recordings gained a legacy as one of Coltrane's most popular recordings and significant in the genre of romantic jazz. The tracks were compiled by producer Richard Seidel and <b>remastering</b> engineer was Allan Tucker at Foothill Digital, New York City.|$|E
5|$|Through this <b>remastering</b> project, each studio {{album was}} reissued on CD and vinyl {{and was also}} {{available}} in a Deluxe Edition, which contained a bonus disc of previously unheard material (Coda's Deluxe Edition would include two bonus discs).

5|$|Modern Warfare Remastered builds {{upon the}} {{original}} by featuring extensive graphical and rendering enhancements, lighting upgrades, updated animations, <b>remastering</b> original sound effects {{as well as}} adding new, and offers numerous small improvements while retaining the original core gameplay. Extras such as new multiplayer content and additional achievements and cheats are also included. The game received positive reviews from critics, who lauded the improved graphics, sound, and range of amendments from the original game, {{to the point that}} some found it more akin to a remake. Criticism focused on its dated narrative and AI, with split opinions given to aspects that were seen as both dated and refreshingly simplistic. Activision also generated controversy for not initially releasing Remastered as a standalone game, among other criticized business decisions centered around additional content.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, the {{surviving}} members have sporadically collaborated {{and participated in}} one-off reunions, the most successful being the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums.
