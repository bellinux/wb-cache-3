40|$|Design {{options for}} {{decreasing}} the susceptibility of integrated circuits to Single Event Upset (SEU) {{fall into two}} categories: (1) increasing the critical charge to cause an upset at a particular node, and (2) employing redundancy to mask or correct errors. With decreasing device sizes on an Integrated Circuit (IC), the amount of charge required to represent a logic state has steadily <b>reduced.</b> Critical <b>charge</b> <b>methods</b> such as increasing drive strength or increasing {{the time required to}} change state as in capacitive or resistive hardening or delay based approaches extract a steadily increasing penalty as a percentage of device resources and performance. Dual redundancy is commonly assumed only to provide error detection with Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) required for correction, but less well known methods employ dual redundancy to achieve full error correction by voting two inputs with a prior state to resolve ambiguity. This requires special circuits such as the Whitaker latch [1], or the guard-gate [2] which some of us have called a Transition AND Gate (TAG) [3]. A 2 -input guard gate is shown in Figure 1. It is similar to a Muller Completion Element [4] and relies on capacitance at node "out" to retain the prior state when inputs disagree, while eliminating any output buffer which would be susceptible to radiation strikes. This paper experimentally compares delay based and dual rail flip-flop designs wherein both types of circuits employ guard-gates to optimize layout and performance, and draws conclusions about design criteria and suitability of each option. In both cases a design goal is protection against Single Event Transients (SET) in combinational logic as well as SEU in the storage elements. For the delay based design, it is also a goal to allow asynchronous clear or preset inputs on the storage elements, which are often not available in radiation tolerant designs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes the {{adaptive}} PI gain control to regulate sinusoidal ripple current (SRC) in battery charger systems. The SRC <b>charge</b> <b>method</b> is suited for fast and efficient charging. Y. D Lee (2015) propose that SRC <b>charge</b> <b>method</b> can <b>reduce</b> the <b>charging</b> time, decrease the charging temperature {{and improve the}} charging efficiency by applying optimal frequency to charge the battery. In order to determine optimal frequency for charging, the swept frequency is required in SRC <b>charge</b> <b>method.</b> Therefore, in order to perform SRC charge approach, the battery charger systems have {{to be capable of}} handling swept frequency input and regulating high frequency ripple current. However, the conventional designed charger {{would not be able to}} satisfy the aforementioned requirements because the control bandwidth of a fixed PI control gains is not designed for SRC but for a constant current profile. Therefore, the fixed PI gain control is limited to regulate the wide range frequency of ripple current. The solution to the aforementioned issue is to apply {{the adaptive}} PI gain control based on Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) so that it can regulate variable frequency of charging ripple current. The proposed approach shows that MRAC is the suitable solution for SRC charging because it is easily equipped into the conventional PI controller of a digital signal processor without any adjustments to the hardware design. As a result, there is no attenuation and phase delay under variable ripple frequencies condition (1 ~ 600 Hz). The performance of current control is compared with conventional fixed PI gain and the proposed adaptive variable gain. The proposed method is verified with simulation and experimental results...|$|R

5000|$|The Type 38 spitzer {{version of}} the 6.5×50mm {{cartridge}} remained unchanged until after {{the adoption of the}} Type 11 light machine gun in 1922. The Type 11 was initially meant to fire standard Type 38 rifle ball ammunition by means of ordinary five-shot Type 38 stripper clips. Subsequent use indicated that the higher pressures generated by the standard rifle ammunition caused parts wear and breakage in machine guns. It was thus decided to <b>reduce</b> the powder <b>charge</b> of the Type 11's 6.5 mm ammunition to overcome the problem. This <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> 6.5 mm ammunition can be identified by a letter [...] "G" [...] in a circle stamped {{on the outside of the}} ammunition packaging which stands for the first letter of genso - the Japanese word for [...] "reduced."

The advantage of the <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> ammunition to the sniper was it aided in his concealment as the <b>reduced</b> <b>charge</b> rounds produced less muzzle flash than standard rounds and thus did not give away the sniper's position.|$|R
