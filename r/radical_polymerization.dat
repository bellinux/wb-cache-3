40|$|This lecture {{will first}} discuss the {{transfer}} of the concepts of quisi-equivalence, self-control and adaptability from the field of structural biology to the field of self-assembly. Subsequently it will demonstrate with recent examples from our laboratory that self-control is responsible for all supramolecular polymerizations and for least selected examples of covalent <b>polymerization</b> including living <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations.</b> Selected examples of self-controlled supramolecular polymerizations such as the supramolecular polymerization of dendritic dipeptides and living <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations</b> such as SET-LRP will be discussed in detail...|$|R
25|$|RAFT {{is a type}} {{of living}} {{polymerization}} involving a conventional <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> which is mediated by a RAFT agent. Monomers must be capable of <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b> There are a number of steps in a RAFT polymerization: initiation, pre-equilbrium, re-initiation, main equilibrium, propagation and termination.|$|E
25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b> It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> techniques, others being atom transfer <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} can {{be performed}} by adding a chosen quantity of an appropriate RAFT agent to a conventional free <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b> Usually the same monomers, initiators, solvents and temperatures can be used.|$|E
40|$|Acrylates and {{methacrylate}} polymers {{are widely used}} {{in a variety of}} applications such as coatings, adhesives, and synthetic rubbers. In a continuous effort to increase the understanding and control over the <b>radical</b> (co) <b>polymerizations</b> of acrylate monomers the kinetic parameters, such as the propagation and termination rate constants, need to be determined. In particular, the propagation rate coefficients of the family of acrylate monomers have been a topic of intense scientific study over the last 10 years or so. In the last decade an almost full understanding of the complicated aspects of acrylate <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations</b> has been established. It is the purpose of this essay to give a short historic account of the developments in this understanding of acrylate <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to combustion, many polymerization reactions involve free radicals. As a result, many plastics, enamels, and other polymers are formed through <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b> For instance, drying oils and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking by oxygen from the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes {{react in}} many {{addition}} reactions, which occur by {{opening up the}} double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of electrophilic addition. Examples are hydrohalogenation, halogenation, halohydrin formation, oxymercuration, hydroboration, dichlorocarbene addition, Simmons–Smith reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, epoxidation, <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> and hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|In {{photochemical}} reactions, {{atoms and}} molecules absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state.

25|$|The addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} process was first {{reported in the}} early 1970s. However, the technique was irreversible, so the transfer reagents {{could not be used}} to control <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> at this time. For the first few years addition-fragmentation {{chain transfer}} was used to help synthesize end-functionalized polymers.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization can be {{performed}} in large range of solvents (including water), within a wide temperature range, high functional group tolerance and absence metals for polymerization. As of 2014, the range of commercially available RAFT agents covers close to all the monomer classes that can undergo <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} living <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> techniques, RAFT allows chain {{extension}} of a polymer of one monomer {{with a second}} type of polymer to yield a block copolymer. In such a polymerisation, there is the additional challenge that the RAFT agent for the first monomer must also be suitable for the second monomer, making block copolymerisation of monomers of highly disparate character challenging.|$|E
5000|$|IUPAC also {{recognizes the}} {{alternative}} name, ‘controlled reversible-deactivation radical polymerization’ as acceptable, [...] "provided the controlled context is specified, {{which in this}} instance comprises molecular mass and molecular mass distribution." [...] These types of <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations</b> are not necessarily ‘living’ polymerizations, since chain termination reactions are not precluded".|$|R
50|$|Free <b>radical</b> {{addition}} <b>polymerization</b> of ethylene {{must take}} place at high temperatures and pressures, approximately 300 °C and 2000 atm. While most other free <b>radical</b> <b>polymerizations</b> do not require such extreme temperatures and pressures, they do tend to lack control. One effect of this lack of control is {{a high degree of}} branching. Also, as termination occurs randomly, when two chains collide, it is impossible to control the length of individual chains. A newer method of polymerization similar to free radical, but allowing more control involves the Ziegler-Natta catalyst, especially with respect to polymer branching.|$|R

25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization.</b> Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> sites.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} {{today is}} mainly {{carried out by}} thiocarbonylthio chain transfer agents. It was first reported by Rizzardo et al. in 1998. RAFT {{is one of the}} most versatile methods of controlled <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> because it is tolerant of a very wide range of functionality in the monomer and solvent, including aqueous solutions. RAFT polymerization has also been effectively carried out over a wide temperature range.|$|E
25|$|This {{limitation}} can {{be overcome}} by polymerizing directly on the surface. This process {{is referred to as}} grafting from, or surface-initiated polymerization (SIP). As the name suggests, the initiator molecules must be immobilized on the solid surface. Like other polymerization methods, SIP can be tailored to follow radical, anionic, or cationic mechanisms and can be controlled utilizing reversible addition transfer polymerization (RAFT), atom transfer <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> (ATRP), or nitroxide-mediated techniques.|$|E

25|$|Amber is {{heterogeneous}} in composition, but {{consists of}} several resinous bodies {{more or less}} soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with an insoluble bituminous substance. Amber is a macromolecule by free <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene. These labdanes are diterpenes (C20H32) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{a rather}} stable {{molecule}} that polymerizes only upon contact with catalysts. The conversion is highly exothermic. Coordination polymerization is the most pervasive technology, which means that metal chlorides or metal oxides are used. The most common catalysts consist of titanium(III) chloride, the so-called Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Another common catalyst is the Phillips catalyst, prepared by depositing chromium(VI) oxide on silica. Polyethylene can be produced through <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization,</b> but this route has only limited utility and typically requires high-pressure apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{contains}} many {{species such as}} ions, free radicals and electrons, so {{it is important to}} look at what contributes to the polymerization process most. The first suggested process by Westwood et al. was that of a cationic polymerization, since in a direct current system polymerization occurs mainly on the cathode. However, more investigation has led to the belief that the mechanism is more of a <b>radical</b> <b>polymerization</b> process, since radicals tend to be trapped in the films, and termination can be overcome by reinitiation of oligomers. Other kinetic studies also appear to support this theory.|$|E
