Khai <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> common origins of the pair and promised Phan that he would lobby Governor-General Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan and other French officials for an amnesty in return for Phan's surrender. Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy.|$|E

In contrast, hate is discussed with verbs of reason and thought ("I think I know.../To say...").|$|R

5|$|Allen <b>recalled</b> <b>The</b> Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and {{required}} each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, lending to his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> transition to the NHL requiring a change in his style of play to incorporate more physicality and abrasiveness. Prior to making the NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E
5|$|Harvey had {{his best}} {{first-class}} season in 195051, scoring 490 runs at 37.69, including his maiden first-class century against a full-strength New South Wales team with several Test bowlers. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, {{and did not}} play a single first-class match in 195253. <b>Recalled</b> <b>the</b> following season, he overcame a slow start to score two centuries later in the summer to end with 421 runs at 38.27 for the summer. After a poor season, Harvey was dropped late in the 195556 season.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, {{when he heard a}} baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|In late July and August 1914, Habsburg {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the III Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian navy, {{under the command of}} Captain Miklós Horthy. The battleship, along with her sister ships {{and the rest of the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, were mobilized to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German battlecruisers were stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey. After the Germans successfully escaped the strait, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was <b>recalled.</b> <b>The</b> fleet had advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Nadia Kaabi-Linke {{was born}} in Tunis in 1978. She is of Russian-Ukrainian and Tunisian heritage, her father a sports {{academic}} and her mother a chemist. Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kiev and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2013, Morris was {{reassigned to}} the Los Angeles D-Fenders. He {{played for the}} D-Fenders on March 9, scoring 21 points and adding 6 rebounds, 2 assists and a steal. He was {{recalled}} on March 9, 2013. On April 3, 2013, the Lakers {{sent him to the}} D-Fenders once again. He was <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> next day. On April 26 in the 2013 NBA Playoffs against the San Antonio Spurs, with Bryant, Nash, Blake and Meeks sidelined, Morris had his best day as a pro, tallying 24 points and 6 assists in a starting role.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force a recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather than face recall. Because she resigned, the Democrats were able to appoint a replacement; {{if she had been}} <b>recalled,</b> <b>the</b> Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate.|$|E

5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cult films in the careers of Balachander and Shobana. In an interview with Rediff.com in April 1997, Chiranjeevi stated that he opted to act in Rudraveena for an image makeover. He added that despite its failure, the film made him happy as it had inspired many villages in Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure as the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Chiranjeevi's Eye & Blood Bank (CEBB) in June 2006 and expressed his appreciation for the initiative; the actor <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> day when he ruled out the climax of Rudraveena ever happening in real life.|$|E

5|$|The {{dress code}} of the British headbangers {{reflected}} the newly found cohesion of the movement and <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> look of 1960s rockers and American bikers. The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches. Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers. Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time. This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.|$|E
5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E

Barkas <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his {{vanishing}} tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
