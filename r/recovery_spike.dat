40|$|Abstract. Two-photon calcium imaging is an {{emerging}} experimental technique {{that enables the}} study of information processing within neural circuits in vivo. While the spatial resolution of this technique permits the calcium activity of individual cells {{within the field of}} view to be monitored, inferring the precise times at which a neuron emits a spike is challenging because spikes are hidden within noisy observations of the neuron’s calcium activity. To tackle this problem, we introduce the use of sparse approximation methods for recovering spikes from the time-varying calcium activity of neurons. We derive sufficient conditions for exact <b>recovery</b> of <b>spikes</b> with respect to (i) the decay rate of the spike-evoked calcium event and (ii) the maximum firing rate of the cell under test. We find—both in theory and in practice—that standard sparse recovery methods are not sufficient to recover spikes from noisy calcium signals when the firing rate of the cell is high, suggesting that in order to guarantee exact <b>recovery</b> of <b>spike</b> times, additional constraints must be incorporated into the recovery procedure. Hence, we introduce an iterative framework for structured sparse approximation that is capable of achieving superior performance over standard sparse recovery methods by taking into account knowledge that spikes are non-negative and also separated in time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on simulated calcium signals in various amounts of additive Gaussian noise and under different degrees of model mismatch. Key words: Two-photon calcium imaging, structured sparse approximation, <b>spike</b> <b>recovery,</b> exact support recovery, coherent dictionaries...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} the Continuous Basis Pursuit (C-BP) method for sparse super-resolution. The C-BP has been recently proposed by Ekanadham, Tranchina and Simoncelli as a refined discretization scheme for the <b>recovery</b> of <b>spikes</b> in inverse problems regularization. One of the most well known discretization scheme, the Basis Pursuit (BP, also known as Lasso) makes use of a finite dimensional l 1 norm on a grid. In contrast, the C-BP uses a linear interpolation of the spikes positions to enable the <b>recovery</b> of <b>spikes</b> between grid points. When the sought-after solution is constrained to be positive, a remarkable feature of this approach is that it retains the convexity of the initial l 1 problem. The present paper shows how the C-BP is able to recover the spikes locations with sub-grid accuracy in the favorable case. We also prove that this regime generally breaks when the grid is too thin, and we describe precisely the artifacts that appear: each spike is approximated by a pair of Dirac masses. We show numerical illustrations of these phenomena, and evaluate numerically the validity of the technical assumptions of our analysis...|$|R

Since salt from these deposits is frequently used for road de-icing in the northern United States, elevated Ag concentrations in salt represent a potential source of Ag to {{the areas in which}} de-icing is performed. In this paper we describe the methodology used to determine the concentration of Ag in salt stored for road application in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Road salt was dissolved in ultrapure water and analyzed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry.

Matrix effects were corrected due to the matrix removal efficiency of the Turboflow column and sufficient types of internal isotope standards that were used. The established method showed a good linearity (r(2) > 0. 99), rapid processing time (20 min per sample), satisfactory <b>recoveries</b> (matrix <b>spiked</b> <b>recoveries</b> range from 84. 6 % to 114 %) and precision (intra-day and inter-day RSDs ranged from 1. 5 % to 9. 2 % and from 1. 1 % to 7. 0 %, respectively). The limits of detection (LODs) of the 21 analyzed PFASs were between 0. 008 and 0. 19 ngmL(- 1). The LODs of short- and long-chain PFASs, such as PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxDA, and PFODA, were 0. 008, 0. 022, 0. 15 and 0. 19 ngmL(- 1), respectively; the <b>spiked</b> <b>recoveries</b> of these PFASs were 101, 105, 87. 1, and 85. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|While spike {{trains are}} {{obviously}} not band-limited, {{the theory of}} super-resolution tells us that perfect <b>recovery</b> of unknown <b>spike</b> locations and weights from low-pass Fourier transform measurements is possible provided that the minimum spacing, Δ, between spikes is not too small. Specifically, for a measurement cutoff frequency of f_c, Donoho [2] showed that exact recovery is possible if the spikes (on R) lie on a lattice and Δ > 1 /f_c, but does not specify a corresponding recovery method. Candès and Fernandez-Granda [3, 4] provide a convex programming method for the <b>recovery</b> of periodic <b>spike</b> trains (i. e., spike trains on the torus T), which succeeds provably if Δ > 2 /f_c and f_c ≥ 128 or if Δ > 1. 26 /f_c and f_c ≥ 10 ^ 3, and does not need the spikes within the fundamental period to lie on a lattice. In this paper, we develop a theory of super-resolution from short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements. Specifically, we present a recovery method similar in spirit {{to the one in}} [3] for pure Fourier measurements. For a STFT Gaussian window function of width σ = 1 /(4 f_c) this method succeeds provably if Δ > 1 /f_c, without restrictions on f_c.

Methods: We evaluated recovery/linearity, imprecision/repeatability and relative accuracy vs. comparison methods for glucose [coupled hexokinase glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (HK/G 6 PD) assay] and lactate (lactate dehydrogenase assay) in ICU patient samples with two cassette-based BGAs [RP 500 (Siemens) and ABL 90 (Radiometer) ] and with the ABL 800 BGA. Results: <b>Recovery</b> of <b>spiked</b> glucose up to 348 mg/dL (19. 3 mmol/L) was complete for all BGAs. Repeatability of ABL 800 and ABL 90 was comparable with the comparison method (about 1 %), but higher for RP 500 (about 2. 4 %). All BGAs were in agreement with the comparison method, with all glucose measurements falling within preset 10 % criteria suggested by Karon. <b>Recovery</b> of <b>spiked</b> lactate (up to 25 mmol/L) was incomplete at all levels.

Results Endogenous eotaxin was undetectable in DTE-processed samples, {{with a mean of}} only 30 % (SD, 13 %) <b>spike</b> <b>recovery.</b> DTE had no effect on the immunoassay capture antibody but dramatically reduced the detection of recombinant eotaxin. Removal of DTE from sputum before immunoassay did not improve detection, although it restored the recovery of a subsequent eotaxin spike. In contrast, PBS-processed sputum resulted in an eotaxin <b>spike</b> <b>recovery</b> of 101 % (SD, 20 %). Addition of protease inhibitors or high-speed centrifugation had no effect on eotaxin detection. By using this optimized protocol, eotaxin levels in PBS-processed sputum samples were found to be significantly increased in asthmatic sputum (P<. 05). Conclusion Measurement of eotaxin by means of immunoassay is adversely affected by DTE, possibly through irreversible denaturation of epitopes, which makes eotaxin undetectable by using the immunoassay antibody. Sputum samples should be processed into PBS for assessment of eotaxin, which is present at increased levels in asthmatic sputum. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} a citrate-buffered version of QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method for {{determination}} of 14 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) residues in tamarind peel, fruit and commercial pulp was optimized using gas chromatography (GC) coupled with electron-capture detector (ECD) and confirmation by GC tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS). Five procedures were tested {{based on the}} original QuEChERS method. The best one was achieved with increased time in ultrasonic bath. For the extract clean-up, primary secondary amine (PSA), octadecyl-bonded silica (C 18) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) were used as sorbents for tamarind fruit and commercial pulp and for peel was also added graphitized carbon black (GCB). The samples mass was optimized according to the best recoveries (1. 0 g for peel and fruit; 0. 5 g for pulp). The method results showed the matrix-matched calibration curve linearity was r 2 > 0. 99 for all target analytes in all samples. The overall average <b>recoveries</b> (<b>spiked</b> at 20, 40 and 60 μg kg− 1) have been considered satisfactory presenting values between 70 and 115 % with RSD of 2 – 15 % (n = 3) for all analytes, {{with the exception of}} HCB (in peel sample). The ranges of limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for OCPs were for peel (LOD: 8. 0 – 21 μg kg− 1; LOQ: 27 – 98 μg kg− 1); for fruit (LOD: 4 – 10 μg kg− 1; LOQ: 15 – 49 μg kg− 1) and for commercial pulp (LOD: 2 – 5 μg kg− 1; LOQ: 7 – 27 μg kg− 1). The method was successfully applied in tamarind samples being considered a rapid, sensitive and reliable procedure...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the determination of inorganic (InHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in solubilized tissues with continuous-flow (flow injection) cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. Kidney, liver, and brain tissues were spiked with MeHg and InHg and solubillzed at an elevated temperature in a solution containing 90 gJL NaOH, 2 g/L L-cysteine, and 4 g/L NaCI. Total mercury determination was achieved by continuous-flow cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry using an inlet system containing a flow through photo-oxidation reactor and sodium borohydride as the mercury reductant. InHg was selectively determined {{in the presence of}} MeHg with this method when using stannous chloride as the reductant. MeHg concentrations were computed as the difference between the values obtained from the two analyses. <b>Recoveries</b> for <b>spiked</b> tissues were abov...|$|R
40|$|An isocratic reversed-phase {{high-pressure}} liquid chromatographic {{method for}} {{the determination of}} six components of the teicoplanin complex in biological fluid was developed. By using fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization with fluorescamine, the assay is specific and highly sensitive, with reproducibility studies yielding coefficients of variation ranging from 1. 5 to 8. 5 % (at 5 to 80 micrograms/ml). Response was linear from 2. 5 to 80 micrograms/ml (r = 0. 999); the <b>recovery</b> from <b>spiked</b> human serum was 76 %. An external quality control was performed to compare this high-pressure liquid chromatographic method (H) with a standard microbiological assay (M); no significant deviation from slope = 1 and intercept = 0 was found by regression analysis (H = 1. 03 M - 0. 45; n = 15) ...|$|R
