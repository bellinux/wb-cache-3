50|$|Wedderburn airport has {{a single}} runway, 17/35 {{measuring}} approximately 950 m long. The strip has been progressively upgraded using funding from club members and regular users of the airport and was sealed to full length in 2008. There is currently no night lighting available, limiting the airport to daytime visual flight rules operation only. As Wedderburn caters mostly to small <b>recreational</b> and general <b>aviation</b> category aircraft, the current facilities are limited to use by aircraft not exceeding 4000 kg maximum takeoff weight.|$|R
40|$|General {{aviation}} commonly {{refers to}} that part of the aviation industry that engages in activity other than scheduled commercial airline activity. This may include charter operators, aeromedical operators, agricultural aviation businesses, aviation-based fire-fighting services, training and aerial work such as aerial photography and surveying. It also includes private, business, <b>recreational</b> and sports <b>aviation</b> activity and supporting businesses such as maintenance providers.

50|$|Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome is {{suitable}} for operations by <b>recreational</b> and general <b>aviation</b> category aircraft. It has also been used to support flood relief and firefighting operations. There are several private hangars in use on the airfield, {{as well as an}} original Bellman hangar, although this structure is out of use, in poor condition and awaiting restoration. A second Bellman hangar is on an isolated area of the former tarmac, now part of the surrounding industrial estate functions as a works depot for the Richmond Valley Council, although this has been substantially modified and was moved to the site from its original location at Coffs Harbour.|$|R

40|$|Automotive Resources, Inc. (ARI) has {{developed}} a new device for igniting fuel in engines-the SmartPlug. TM SmartPlug is a self-contained ignition system that may be retrofitted to existing spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines. The SmartPlug needs as little as six watts of power for warm-up, and requires no electricity at all when the engine is running. Unlike traditional spark plugs, once the SmartPlug ignites the engine, and the engine heats up, the power supply for the plug is no longer necessary. In the utility industry, SmartPlugs {{can be used in}} tractors, portable generators, compressors, and pumps. In addition to general-purpose applications, such as lawn mowers and chainsaws, SmartPlugs can also be used in the <b>recreational,</b> marine, <b>aviation,</b> and automotive industries. Unlike traditional ignition systems, the SmartPlug system requires no distributor, coil points, or moving parts. SmartPlugs are non-fouling, with a faster and cleaner burn than traditional spark plugs. They prevent detonation and are not sensitive to moisture, allowing them to be used on a variety of engines. Other advantages include no electrical noise, no high voltage, exceptionally high altitude capabilities, and better cold-start statistics than those of standard spark ignition systems. Future applications for the SmartPlug are being evaluated by manufacturers in the snowmobile industry...|$|R
2500|$|Agreement on {{the future}} of the airport would take several years. The joint {{committee}} struck to examine the future of the airport was split. While the Government of Metro Toronto (Metro), the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada proposed to add STOL scheduled airlines to the facility, this was opposed by the City of Toronto. The City of Toronto members of the committee studied measures to close the airport and use the site for housing, parks or recreation. Local Liberal Member of Parliament Bob Kaplan, who represented the riding in North York where the Government of Canada-owned de Havilland factory was located, was championing the idea of the island airport as the base for a network of airports serving STOL planes. Several board members of the THC, including its chairman, former Toronto councillor Karl Jaffary, were opposed to the continuation of the island airport, which forced the THC to sell land to pay for the annual deficit. A 1976 Toronto Board of Trade poll of its members found that 93% of respondents favoured the retention of the airport, and 75% of respondents favoured the expansion of the airport facilitate STOL usage. The study found that <b>recreational</b> and civil <b>aviation</b> was the most supported option, although starting STOL service was [...] "an opportunity that should be utilized." ...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{caused by}} {{birds in the}} agricultural, horticultural, <b>recreational</b> and the <b>aviation</b> {{industries}} are escalating world wide as man develops environments that are attractive to birds. Chemical repellents, bird scarers, and exclusion netting {{are being used to}} keep birds away by taste, fright and containment. Habitat management using grasses with selected endophytes may be a new tool for minimizing bird nuisance problems in these industries. Canada geese (Branta Canadensis) were offered selected ryegrass/endophyte Neotyphodium lolli seed and herbage {{to examine the effects of}} known endophyte alkaloids on their feeding behavior in 2000 - 2001. Forty geese were captured annually, contained in fenced areas by wing clipping and fed entophyte-free herbage and seed for a 3 -week period prior to starting any treatments. In a choice 60;cafeteria 61; and no choice feeding trial, geese consumed 30 % less herbage containing the selected endophyte than the endophyte-free ryegrass herbage. In a seed feeding trial, the geese did not discriminate on first exposure between the endophyte-free seed and that containing the selected endophytes. However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback. The authors suggest continued research into this area will be of benefit in producing a living deterrent to birds by habitat modification. Learned-behavior response has been well documented in the past as the way forward. Farming grass/endophyte associations may add to mankind’s armory of bird-control methodology...|$|R
