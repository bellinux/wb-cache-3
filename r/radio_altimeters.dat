50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>Altimeters,</b> {{with both}} audio and visual {{decision}} height warning, would be fitted to all helicopters operating offshore {{as a matter}} of urgency.|$|E
50|$|Very similar {{frequency}} swept waveforms {{are used}} in frequency modulated continuous wave radars to measure range (distance); an unmodulated continuous wave Doppler radar can only measure range-rate (relative velocity {{along the line of}} sight). FM-CW radars are very widely used as <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> in aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|While {{on final}} {{approach}} for landing, the aircraft was about 2,000ft (610m) above ground, when the left-hand (captain's) <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> suddenly changed from [...] to read [...] altitude, although the right-hand (co-pilot's) <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> functioned correctly. The voice recording {{showed that the}} crew was given an audible warning signal ("TOO LOW!, GEAR!") that indicated that the aircraft's landing gear should be down, as the aircraft was, according to the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter,</b> flying too low. Later, the safety board's preliminary report modified this analysis, indicating that the flight data recorder history of the captain's <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> showed 8191 feet (the maximum possible recorded) until the aircraft descended through 1950, then suddenly showed negative 8 feet.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> first {{showed up}} in the German Junkers Ju-87 [...] "Stuka" [...] dive bomber which was {{equipped}} with one for automatic pullouts in the dive bomb run which usually consisted of an 80-90 degree dive. The Stuka pilot would set the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> to 750m which was connected to the bomb release and automatic pull out. The <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> would drop the bombs and pull the Stuka out of the dive at the set altitude to a level flight. This was invented because the pilots would black out on the pull out, usually for 2 to 5 seconds.|$|R

50|$|As of 2010, all {{commercial}} radar altimeters use linear {{frequency modulation}} - continuous wave (LFM-CW or FM-CW).As of 2010, about 25,000 {{aircraft in the}} US {{have at least one}} radio altimeter.That includes all commercial transport and all business aircraft licensed to fly for hire, which are required to have at least 2 <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> per aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|From an {{avionics}} safety perspective, a CAT IIIc landing is the [...] "worst-case scenario" [...] {{for safety}} analysis because {{a failure of}} the automatic systems from flare through the roll-out could easily result in a [...] "hard over" [...] (where a control surface deflects fully in one direction.) This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason Autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive). One way of accomplishing this is to have [...] "three of everything." [...] Three ILS receivers, three <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters,</b> three flight control computers, and three ways of controlling the flight surfaces. The three flight control computers all work in parallel and are in constant cross communications, comparing their inputs (ILS receivers and <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters)</b> with those of the other two flight control computers. If there is a difference in inputs, then a computer can [...] "vote out" [...] the deviant input and will notify the other computers that [...] "RA1 is faulty." [...] If the outputs don't match, a computer can declare itself as faulty and, if possible, take itself off line.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{avionics}} {{include a}} Polyot-1 automatic {{flight control system}} (a [...] "super autopilot," [...] able to be programmed with a set route which it can fly without human intervention but under constant flight crew monitoring; ICAO Cat. 1 approaches standard, Cat. 2 optional), Doppler navigational radar replaced by triplex INSS (Inertial Navigation System Sets) on Il-62M after 1978 and by GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation sets on many aircraft after 1991, triple VHF and HF flightdeck radios, automatic direction finders, Soviet and Western instrument landing system receivers, vertical omnidirectional radio range and radio beacon receivers, duplex <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters,</b> automatic radio transponders, a full ICAO-standard navigation lights fit, cabin tannoy and intercom systems. Soviet/Russian and Warsaw Pact sovereign examples are additionally fitted with triplex [...] "Odd Rods" [...] (NATO code name) IFF (identification friend or foe) air defence transponders identifiable by three closely spaced short aerials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{are used}} in various applications such as civil and military surveillance, law enforcement, and support in natural disasters {{as well as in}} hazardous environments. Approaching and landing are necessary steps for all UAVs, indicating that <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> are needed. In this paper, a radio altimeter based on an antenna array is proposed. Our solution allows some improvements over the traditional radio altimeter such as more precise altitude estimation, ground imaging without the need of side looking radar, mapping the obstacles positions and detecting the ground inclination and topology. Another important contribution of this paper is a review of traditional <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> along with a performance comparison between the level-crossing detection and the digital signal processing frequency detection- which is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm.

This type of altimeter provides {{the distance between}} the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter.</b> However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.|$|R

40|$|For pilots the {{importance}} of knowing their height (distance above the ground) cannot be minimized. An error in determining height can easily prove fatal. Commercial and military aircraft usually have <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> to determine their height. These units cost in the thousands of dollars, are a structural part of the aircraft, and require FAA approval. However, <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> are generally not available to private pilots or small aircraft because of their excessive cost. Important advances {{have occurred in the}} last two decades that have made it possible to construct portable devices that can calculate an aircraft’s height. These advancements are the Global Positioning System (GPS), powerful microcontrollers, programmable flash memory, and color LCD displays. Using this technology along with publicly available digital elevation data it is possible to build an inexpensive, accurate embedded device that can calculate height and other flight parameters. Such a device is not dependent upon FAA approval and can be used in any aircraft...|$|E
40|$|We give {{a review}} of surface wind-speed {{retrieval}} algorithms using satellite radio-altimeter data and analyze the efficiency of these algorithms. The data processing by new <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> (JASON and ENVISAT) showed that the two-parameter algorithm developed for the satellite “Topex A” effectively operates with the data of the new <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> and exceeds in accuracy the conventional algorithm by 5 – 10 %. We discuss two main reasons for the wind-speed retrieval errors: (i) ambiguous relationship between the wind speed and the backscattering cross section and (ii) regional features of the wave climate formation. Within {{the framework of a}} two-parameter algorithm, we propose a new approach for the wind-speed retrieval problem, in which two-mode structures (wind waves and a swell) are taken into account. The data processing confirmed that the new approach allows one to reduce the error related to regional features of the wave climate formation by another 5 – 7 %...|$|E

Such a change in the number ofmodulated pulses within a certain altitude interval, however, is not so simple and is adeterminant issue in defining the precision of the radio altimeter. Being knowledgeable ofthis law in a wider context enables us to enter into discussion on the possibilities of furtherincreasing the precision of measuring low altitudes.

The proposed antenna is designed on RT duroid substrate with dielectric constant of 2. 2 and fed with 50 ohms microstrip line.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{remotely}} piloted vehicles (RPV's) are currently being flown from fixed base control centers, kinesthetic and real world peripheral vision cues are absent. The absence of these cues complicates the piloting task, particularly during the final approach and landing phase of a mission. The pilot's task is futher complicated by errors in the displayed altitude information. To determine the influence of these errors on pilot performance during the final approach and landing phase of a mission, an experiment was conducted in which pilot subjects were asked to fly a fixed base simulation of a Piper PA- 30 aircraft, using degraded altitude information. For this experiment, the chevron component of the display configuration was driven by a radio altimeter. Four altimeters were used, each with a different error characteristic, but within the range specified for the Sperry series of <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters.</b> Results indicate that for range of errors considered, there is no significant difference in landing performance that can be attributed to errors in altitude information...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{complete}} design and analysis of a new integrated balanced transmitter operated at 4 GHz using microstrip technology. It comprises a 4 GHz two-port negative resistance oscillator and a microstrip-patch antenna resonated at 4 GHz. Three different modules are designed and analyzed. The first one used a Lange coupler as a power splitter while the second and third used a one (two) -section branch coupler. The components of the three modules are designed using full-scale computer simulation program named with MSDES, performed by the author, which fully takes into account all the discontinuities included in the microstrip lines, while the modules are analyzed and optimized using APLAC V 7. 61 software. The design methodologies of the two-port negative resistance oscillator and microstrip patch antenna are introduced and explained. The analyses of the designed modules show a better efficiency and good performance. The modules give a transmit-antenna gain of 15. 7 dB with antenna beam widths 91. 7 ◦ and 18. 2 ◦ in E-and H-planes, respectively. The complete schematic diagrams of the transmitter modules are drawn. These modules can be used in satellite communications, Doppler and other radars, active and semi-active seekers, <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters,</b> missile technology, weapon fuzing, manpack equipments, remote sensing, feed elements in complex antennas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{microstrip}} {{array antenna}} {{based on the}} meta-material zeroth-order resonator (ZOR) is presented in this paper. Considering both zeroth-order resonance and the array theory, a resonant array antenna has been designed and fabricated which has small dimensions both in length and width {{as well as an}} acceptable gain. Since the resonant frequency of the zeroth-order resonator is independent of the physical length of the resonator and determined only by LC values loaded in the resonator, therefore, antenna size can be reduced arbitrarily with no changes in the operation frequency and due to the array structure antenna gain can be enhanced. Additional benefit of the ZOR antennas is lower ohmic losses as compared to the other small antennas and hence the efficiency of the antenna is higher. The discrepancy between simulation and measurement determined by fabricating some of the simulated design and comparison between the results, has been taken into account for designing the final array. A small-sized two-elements ZOR array antenna with 50 % reduction in size as compared to the conventional array with a acceptable gain and broad radiation pattern is tested at 4. 25 GHz. The proposed antenna has application in <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters.</b> The commercial softwares such as CST and HFSS were utilized for design and analysis of the structure. 1...|$|E
40|$|This note {{proposes a}} series of {{exercises}} concerning the assurance of safety-related systems involving E/E/PE components using the principles of IEC 61508. The exercises have been commented by others in a mailing-list format. References to those comments in the mailing list archive are given. I don't consider {{that any of the}} questions posed have yet been answered adequately. The Situation Suppose my customer has a large area of ground for critical infrastructure, say a square kilometer, which she wishes to maintain under constant surveillance with video and infrared sensing. The spatial geometry of the area with its structures is complex enough that fixed-base surveillance is impractical; also she judges that potential attackers could too easily survey and selectively disable ground-based sensing. She has decided for aerial surveillance and obtained the necessary airspace restriction, airspace over her domain, extending a further half kilometer beyond the boundary in each direction, in which flight is prohibited, except for her surveillance devices, under 2, 500 ft altitude. This infrastructure lies in a built-up area (it didn't when it was originally built, but the city has grown up around it) and includes containers holding dangerous bioactive substances that must not be released into the atmosphere. She has bought aircraft which were originally personal transports but have been modified as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a variant of the proven-in-use automated flight systems (AFS) of the Boeing 737, the world's most highly-flown jet airliner, with of course the flight parameters adjusted for the rather smaller, slower surveillance vehicle. The autothrottle of this airliner has a mode called RETARD, into which it passes when the aircraft is to flare on landing. In RETARD mode, the autothrottle closes the throttles to idle. Its sensors are <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters</b> (also known as radar altimeters), RAs. The Boeing 737 slaves the autothrottle to just one RA, but since RAs are not sufficiently reliable, three are included in the drone and a 2 oo 3 voting module has been added to the autothrottle software. This modification is similar to what some safety experts suggested after the Turkish Airline...|$|E
