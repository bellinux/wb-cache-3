50|$|On June 9, 1985, a 30 in hot <b>reheat</b> <b>line,</b> under 600 {{pounds per}} square inch of pressure, burst open. The <b>reheat</b> <b>line</b> cycles steam back through the boiler stack after it has {{expanded}} through the high pressure (HP) turbine and before it reached the low pressure (LP) turbine. A 1,000-degree steam cloud blew down a door leading to the control room of the station, fatally scalding six workers: Michael Bowman, John Dolan, Ernest Hernandez, Terry Leroy, Danny Norman and Howard Turner. Ten others were injured. The station was out of service for six months while all the steam piping was replaced.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the steam oxidation kinetics of boiler steels is required for creep rupture based remaining life assessment of high temperature components. This has significant industrial importance, {{particularly in the case}} of boiler tubing in thermal power stations. Although the oxidation behaviour of traditionally employed steels is quite well understood, there is significantly less known about the more advanced boiler alloys designed to meet the creep strength requirements of higher operating temperatures and pressures utilised in modern plants with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This research was carried out to improve {{understanding of the}} oxidation kinetics of these steels through direct comparison against traditional alloys using a novel approach designed to facilitate reliable laboratory based steam oxidation testing. Materials investigated represent both traditional and advanced variants from several of the major boiler alloy classes, including a 2. 25 % Cr ferritic steel (T 23), 9 % Cr martensitic steels (T 9, T 91, T 92), 18 - 25 % Cr austenitic stainless steels (347 H, 347 HFG, Super 304 H, HR 3 C) and an alumina-forming austenitic steel (AFA: Fe- 25 % Ni- 14 % Cr- 3. 5 % Al- 2. 5 % Nb). Alloys were subjected to long term high temperature oxidation at two specifically developed test facilities that represent considerably different approaches for studying steam oxidation. A simulated steam environment consisting of 50 % water vapour in argon carrier gas was generated in the first experimental setup, where oxidation exposures were performed at atmospheric pressure for up to 7, 510 h in the temperature range of 650 to 760 °C for all alloys. The second setup utilised pressurised steam from the hot <b>reheat</b> <b>line</b> at Loy Yang B Power Station (Victoria, Australia). Alloys were exposed to oxidation in plant steam at 4. 2 MPa for up to 12, 170 h at metal temperatures ranging from 540 °C for T 23 to 810 °C for AFA. Oxide scales were assessed using optical microscopy, non-destructive ultrasonic testing, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS and mass-change measurements. Correlations describing oxide growth kinetics were determined for T 23, each of the 9 % Cr alloys and both Grade 347 stainless steel variants investigated in the study. In each case the growth rates well represented by parabolic kinetics. Distinct differences in steam oxidation resistance were observed between traditional and advanced alloys. This lends support to the argument that oxidation kinetics used for life assessment should be determined for individual alloys, rather than applied across an entire class of boiler steels. The oxide scale morphologies and growth rates observed for alloys in 50 % H₂O/Ar and plant steam were generally consistent. The exception to this was more ready breakdown of the protective Cr₂O₃ layer developed on austenitic steels and one of the 9 % Cr alloys (T 92) in plant steam, which was attributed to the higher steam pressure and moisture content. The thin and irregular oxide scales that developed on austenitic alloys could not be measured by ultrasonic thickness testing and were better suited to mass based assessment of oxide scale growth. The findings are promising for future studies involving the two steam oxidation laboratories, however further testing of additional alloy batches is required to validate the correlations for accurate life assessment...|$|E

30|$|One {{of them is}} an {{application}} of the aforementioned backpressure turbine or extraction-backpressure turbine fed with outlet steam from the high-pressure turbine from the cold <b>reheat</b> steam <b>line.</b> The outlet steam together with the driving turbine bleeds (if any) would condense in low-pressure regenerative exchangers. Owing {{to the fact that}} outlet steam also gives up heat in the regenerative system, the extraction-backpressure turbine does not require a costly system of the condenser and cooling water which usually is the case with the condensing turbine driving the main feed pump.|$|R
30|$|Yet, another {{solution}} {{is the use}} of a backpressure turbine working in parallel with the intermediate-pressure turbine. The driving turbine is fed with steam from a hot <b>reheat</b> steam <b>line.</b> Outlet steam from the turbine is in turn introduced into the inlet of the low-pressure turbine. Such a configuration limits the problem of too little steam fed to the low-pressure turbine at low loads of the unit. What can be a problem, however, are the high parameters of the inlet steam (identical to those at the inlet to the intermediate-pressure turbine), which is related to the use of expensive construction materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of seamed fossil {{high energy piping}} {{has become a major}} safety and O&M issue again with eight recent failures of seam-welded piping since 1992. These include failure of six superheat link piping segments, two of them catastrophic, and the failures of two long-seamed bends in hot <b>reheat</b> <b>lines.</b> Advanced methods of inspecting piping welds with ultrasonic techniques, such as Time Of Flight Diffraction and Focused/Phased Arrays, is pushing back the envelop of detection to earlier stages of creep damage. But these are still very expensive and involve considerable logistics planning and downtime to perform. EPRI has sponsored development activities since 1986 to mature the utilization of a real-time online evaluation method for seam-welded piping: Acoustic Emission (AE) Guidelines were published in 1995, and over 90 full-scale tests have been performed from 1996 - 2003 to develop a database and correlate results with other established evaluation methods. Tests to date have shown high sensitivity to early stage creep damage, which is evidenced by development of cavities (cavitation) around nonmetallic inclusions and carbides in the grain boundaries of the weld heat affected zone and fusion zone. Successful double-blind testing with advanced ultrasonsic inspection methods, and additional confirmation with advanced cryo-cracking metallography, have proven both the reliability and sensitivity of the AE technique. The economics of the method are highly favorable. Only small areas of insulation need to be removed every 4. 6 - 6. 1 m (15 - 20 ft) to weld “waveguides” to the piping surface. These form a linear location array along the length of piping, providing global coverage of the piping system. Testing is performed online with normal peak loading and load cycling. No outage schedule is required to perform the AE examination. The ASTM E 07. 04 Subcommittee on Acoustic Emission is currently developing a standard based on the EPRI testing database...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the calculations for different configurations of a 900 MW power unit for advanced 700 / 720 °C ultra-supercritical steam parameters {{with a single}} and double steam reheat. The use of such high parameters, especially the reheated steam temperature, involves thermodynamic and material problems related to high temperature differences in the feed water heaters. In relation to this, a concept of the modification of the feed water heaters system by using an auxiliary extraction-backpressure turbine fed with steam from the cold <b>reheat</b> steam <b>line</b> is presented. The steam from the bleeds and the turbine outlet is directed to regenerative heaters fed in the classical system from the intermediate pressure turbine, which reduces the temperature differences in these exchangers and simplifies the main turbine IP part structure...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the boiler}} design activities, {{potential}} cost savings {{were identified by}} considering shortening the main and <b>reheat</b> steam <b>lines</b> using two novel arrangements. Firstly, a twin tower or inverse two-pass boiler design was considered, in which firing {{takes place in a}} first tower, with the hot combustion gases moving down and across to a second tower. The final super-heater and re-heater are arranged {{at the bottom of the}} second tower with outlet headers located close to the turbine. The arrangement minimizes the thermal movement between boiler and steam lines providing a significant reduction in the length of steam piping to 25 m and 30 m for each string of 400 MW reference plant. As an alternative arrangement, a horizontal boiler concept, designed with the outlet headers on top of the boiler was considered. The low height boiler design arrangement resulted in a similar shortening of the steam lines to around 35 m to 40 m for each string of a 400 MW reference plant.|$|R
40|$|Many ways is {{possible}} to improve the compressor efficiency, like to reduce the mechanical losses through valve or bearing which represents from 20 % to 30 % of total electric consumption power on the compressor. Another ways is to decrease the pressure drop through the compression circuit of the compressor, which can reduce the temperature variation through the compressor…etc. In our case of study, we will {{be interested in the}} heat transfer and pressure drop through the suction circuit. In this paper, we present the challenge done on the heat transfer reduction through the suction line of the CAJ 4519 Z compressor, in reducing from 10 °C to 20 °C the flow temperature through the suction line and, thus improve the cooling capacity in increasing density of the flow. Indeed, according to the mechanical conception of the compressor, the suction line, the fresh part of the flow, is in contact with the discharge line, the hot part of the flow, at the cylinder head part. Thus, thermal conduction phenomena at this level heat up the fresh flow of the suction line therefore decrease the density of the flow which impacts on the global cooling capacity of the compressor. In this case of study, the cylinder head is on cast iron material, and separates the suction line (fresh flow at 64 °C) with the discharge line (hot flow at 115 °C) by a thickness wall of 0. 8 cm. Consequently, the fresh flow of suction <b>line</b> <b>reheats</b> by the conductivity and loses between 10 °C and 20 °C according to the operating condition. To reduce the conductivity phenomenon on the cylinder head, a judicious choice of material is done according to the Ashby methodology based on the conductivity coefficient, and a new concept of cylinder head is done. Before, testing the new concept of the cylinder head, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation allows understanding the improvement through the standard and new cylinder head concept, and allows defining the position of the sensor. The laboratory test result confirms the simulation results. Thus, thanks to the thermal characteristic of the material and re design the cylinder head part, we can reduce the temperature and improve by 2 % (average value) the cooling capacity of the compressor...|$|R
