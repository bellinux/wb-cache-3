40|$|The sandy soils of the Buckner {{series in}} Muscatine and Louisa Counties are used mainly for {{vegetable}} crops. Yields of sweet potatoes, muskmelons and watermelons are good in favorable seasons. Sandy soils suitable for sweet potato production {{are present in}} other parts of Iowa, but those north of Muscatine County are too far north for maximum production. Muskmelons and watermelons can be grown farther north, but the greatest area of commercial production in Iowa is in Muscatine and Louisa Counties. There are about 6, 700 acres of Buckner coarse sand in Muscatine County. This soil dries out rapidly, and irrigation by either furrow or overhead <b>rotary</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system is a common practice with commercial growers in this district. There are several thousand acres of fine sands and sandy loams, in addition to the Buckner coarse sand, in Muscatine, Louisa, Lee and adjacent counties. These soils are also well suited for sweet potato and melon production...|$|E
40|$|The Kufra {{region of}} south eastern Libya {{comprises}} an area about 850 km south to north, and some 500 km wide rising to 450 m above sea level. Rainfall {{is low and}} agriculture depends on irrigation. Most {{of the population of}} Kufra are private farmers who use flood irrigation from shallow wells (19 - 60 m), but there are co-operatives of farmers that have shared the cost of deeper wells (120 - 150 m) and sprinkler irrigation. The Kufra Agricultural Project (KAP) state farm is made up of 100 circles (farms) each having its own deep well (220 â€“ 352 m) and <b>rotary</b> <b>sprinkler.</b> The experimental work was conducted in three phases. An initial study was made of soil profiles and irrigation water on 4 private and 4 state farms. An inter laboratory study compared results in the KAP and Glasgow University (GU) laboratories. The third phase was a survey of top soils, irrigation water, crop yield and questionnaires for a much larger number of farms. Chapter 3 describes the comparison between chemical analysis results of 33 soils in the KAP and GU laboratories. There was a good level of agreement between the two laboratories. The high correlation coefficients indicate a high level of precision in both laboratories. However there were systematic differences between the two laboratories, results for EC, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and Cl- were 2...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{micro-irrigation}} systems. Many of the components are {{the same for all}} of these types of systems. Most systems typically include filters, pipes, valves, and tubing. The main difference is in the type of emission device that is used to deliver the water to the plants. Drip irrigation utilizes drip emitters that deliver water at very low rates. The typical range is 0.2 to 4.0 gallons per hour. In some systems, the emitters are installed manually {{on the outside of the}} tubing and placed where needed. Other systems might use integral dripperline or drip tape with the emitters already installed at a predetermined spacing. Micro-sprinklers, which can include fixed stream sprays and rotating spinners typically deliver water at a higher rate, such as 10 to 25 gallons per hour and will cover a larger area than drip emitters. These are more typically used in tree orchards where the plants are larger.The goal is to distribute water slowly in small volumes and target it to plants' root zones with less runoff or overspray than landscape and garden conventional spray and <b>rotary</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> The low volume allows the water to penetrate and be absorbed into slow-percolation soils, such as clay, minimizing water runoff.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separate}} Sino-Malian joint venture, N-SUKALA, {{was agreed}} in June 2009 between CLETC and the Malian government. Of the 8.8 billion franc CFA equity (13.4 million Euro), 60 percent {{is held by}} CLETC with the remainder held by the Malian state. The company is developing 20,000 ha of land near to the Dougabougou complex that had not previously been irrigated. At {{the time of the}} agreement the land was occupied by a number of villages. [...] The construction of a new sugar cane processing plant and refinery with a capacity of 6,000 tonnes a day, expandable to 8,000 tonnes was begun at the end of July 2009. The new sugar cane farm will be irrigated using several hundred <b>rotary</b> centre pivot <b>sprinkler</b> systems. The complex is expected to produce around 100,000 tonnes of sugar and 9.6 million tonnes of ethanol each year.|$|R
40|$|The SLC Regional Landfill in Virginia MN {{currently}} {{consists of}} 27 acres of lined landfill. It {{has been in}} operation since November 15, 1993, and has disposed of approximately 1, 510, 000 cubic yards of waste (MSW, Industrial, Demolition and Asbestos) and daily/intermediate/final cover through December 31, 2009. Leachate from the landfill is collected and stored in two HDPE-lined ponds. The leachate is aerated and then land applied through a network of 21 fixed head <b>rotary</b> gun type <b>sprinkler</b> nozzles, to a 22. 25 acre spray field site of predominately reed canary grass. The landfill spray field is operated under MPCA SDS permit # SW 405. Nitrogen, as a constituent of concern (COC) is monitored along with other COCs in the leachate ponds, and in monitoring wells at the landfill boundaries. In 2008, {{as a condition of}} permit, a nitrogen management plan was written and submitted to the agency. This nitrogen management plan is referenced in current SDS permit. In 2010, in an effort to further implement the nitrogen plan for the facility and fulfill MPCA permit requirements, a research / demonstration was conducted. This project was done in coordination with the MPCA under MN rule 7035. 0400. During this project, an internal nitrogen monitoring plan for the landfill leachate ponds was developed and implemented. Available literature and known processes for nitrogen treatment were reviewed. Following the review, in pond suspended growt...|$|R
