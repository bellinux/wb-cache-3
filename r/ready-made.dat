5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of <b>ready-made</b> antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E
5|$|The Corporation {{stipulated that}} several {{manufacturing}} industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It {{did not seek}} to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms {{to build their own}} premises or rent <b>ready-made</b> buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.|$|E
40|$|Even though {{designers}} seldom {{talk about}} <b>ready-mades,</b> they {{use them in}} a variety of ways in design. This paper describes several uses of <b>ready-mades</b> in empathic design, which aims to gain an internalized understanding of the people they design for. Specifically, the paper looks at three uses: <b>ready-mades</b> as research instruments in taken-for-granted experience with haptic qualities of materials in everyday life; <b>ready-mades</b> as instruments for capturing the spirit of a community for design; and <b>ready-mades</b> as instruments for carrying this spirit into product development. Each example is illustrated with a case study. At the end of the paper, we discuss these cases and the usefulness of an art world concept in understanding design research...|$|R

By that afternoon No. 4 Commando controlled the town.|$|E
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as <b>ready-made</b> panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E

5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found <b>ready-made</b> at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore <b>ready-made</b> masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, the Bells {{had moved}} to Brisbane, where John was Queensland manager for Airlines of Australia Ltd, having left the RAAF in 1929. Mary became leader of forty or so members of the Women's National Emergency Legion Air Wing who had volunteered to assist with {{aircraft}} maintenance during times of war. Determining that their objectives would not be met in their existing organisation, on 17July they formed a new paramilitary group, the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander. She soon expanded the WATC into a national organisation, with Commandants leading each state's chapter, and herself as Australian Commandant. Bell wrote to Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams, with whom she was acquainted via her husband and through aviation circles, advocating {{the establishment of a}} women's branch of the RAAF similar to the RAF's Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Among other things, she pointed out that female volunteers such as hers were already supporting the Air Force in driving, nursing and clerical duties. The WATC was one of several women's voluntary organisations whose members were keen to support the military, arguing that their personnel provided a <b>ready-made</b> pool of skilled staff for auxiliary services, saving the government time and money training unskilled labour.|$|E

50|$|However, {{as an art}} form, {{found objects}} tend to include the artist's output—at the very least an idea about it, i.e. the artist's {{designation}} of the object as art—which is nearly always reinforced with a title. There is usually some degree of modification of the found object, although not always {{to the extent that}} it cannot be recognized, as is the case with <b>ready-mades.</b> Recent critical theory, however, would argue that the mere designation and relocation of any object, <b>ready-mades</b> included, constitutes a modification of the object because it changes our perception of its utility, its lifespan, or its status.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell <b>ready-made</b> hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought <b>ready-made</b> from spice merchants.|$|E
