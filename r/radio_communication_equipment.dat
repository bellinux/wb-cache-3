25|$|Energy {{harvesting}} devices converting ambient {{energy into}} electrical energy have attracted {{much interest in}} both the military and commercial sectors. Some systems convert motion, {{such as that of}} ocean waves, into electricity to be used by oceanographic monitoring sensors for autonomous operation. Future applications may include high power output devices (or arrays of such devices) deployed at remote locations to serve as reliable power stations for large systems. Another application is in wearable electronics, where energy harvesting devices can power or recharge cellphones, mobile computers, <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> etc. All of these devices must be sufficiently robust to endure long-term exposure to hostile environments and have a broad range of dynamic sensitivity to exploit the entire spectrum of wave motions.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{the park}} was {{expanded}} twice, adding the second section in 1964 and the third section ten years later. Since then, the {{focus has been on}} the maintenance of the area. By 1998, the paths of the park, especially in the first section, were saturated with over 3,000 peddlers with few regulations or norms. In 2005, the first section of {{the park was}} closed for renovations, effectively evicting all vendors from the area. When it reopened months later, permits for selling were strictly limited and police began to crackdown vendors in the park. However, some vendors continue to operate illegally and exchange information on the police's steps with <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment.</b> At the entrances to the park, where the vendor restrictions are not in place, some vendors sometimes block the entrances and cover signs so that visitors a forced to pass through their stands.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2011, the {{struggle}} between the Metros and the Rojos intensified when the Mexican authorities found the body of César Dávila García inside an abandoned house in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Inside the abandoned house, the corpse of El Comandante Gama, Dávila García's code name, had been shot with a 9 mm pistol. According to the Mexican authorities, {{the man was a}} top financial operator in the Gulf Cartel and a close associate of the former drug lord Antonio Cárdenas Guillén. After the drug lord's death, Dávila García became the regional drug baron of the coastal city of Tampico, Tamaulipas before moving back to Matamoros. Neither faction in the Gulf Cartel claimed responsibility for his death, but Mexican intelligence sources indicated that Dávila García was killed by the Metros. The assassination also happened a day after the Mexican Navy dismantled a network of the Gulf Cartel in three municipalities across Tamaulipas, where 35 cartel members were arrested. Ricardo Salazar Pequeño, the regional boss of the cartel in Ciudad Miguel Alemán, along with the cartel's accountant Gabriela Gómez Robles, were apprehended. In addition, several firearms, drug loads, and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> were confiscated.|$|E

2500|$|To protect {{telecommunication}} lines, transient suppression {{devices such}} as 3 mil carbon blocks (IEEE C62.32), ultra-low capacitance varistors, and avalanche diodes are used. [...] For higher frequencies, such as <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> a gas discharge tube (GDT) may be utilized. A typical surge protector power strip is built using MOVs. Low-cost versions may use only one varistor, from the hot (live, active) to the neutral conductor. A better protector contains at least three varistors; one across {{each of the three}} pairs of conductors. In the United States, a power strip protector should have an Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1449 3rd edition approval so that catastrophic MOV failure does not create a fire hazard.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1942, {{after the}} 1941 German {{attack on the}} Soviet Union had failed, Schellenberg {{conceived}} and implemented a large-scale spy operation designed to penetrate into the Soviet Union, an initiative known as Operation Zeppelin (Unternehmen Zeppelin). Using anti-Communists selected from the many thousands of POWs captured by the Germans, he soon had anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 potential candidates in training, who were accordingly indoctrinated. Only between 2,000 and 3,000 completed the training and {{as little as a}} few hundred of them ever were committed to the operation due to insufficient numbers of aircraft and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment.</b> What started as a large-scale effort by Schellenberg, quickly became a precision one with very limited success.

2500|$|On November 18, 2015, federal {{authorities}} arrested Iván Cazarín Molina (alias [...] "El Tanque") in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga for his alleged {{involvement in the}} helicopter attack. At the building where he was arrested, authorities confiscated four assault rifles, three handguns, a package of cocaine, four vehicles, and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment.</b> According to PF chief Enrique Francisco Galindo Ceballos (...) , El Tanque was a high-ranking leader of the CJNG and reported directly to El Mencho as the group's second-in-command following the arrest of El Mencho's son Rubén Oseguera González (alias [...] "El Menchito"). The PF also suspected that his center of operations was in Guadalajara, where he used money laundering proceeds to further his criminal activities. They believed he was also responsible for drug trafficking, conducting extortions to businesses, leading oil theft rings, and homicides in Jalisco and Veracruz. Prior to his arrest, the PF carried out several covert operations for 6 months and eventually {{found their way to}} El Tanque's inner circle, where they discovered that he frequented a location that the CJNG used as one of its centers of operations and recreation spot. The police highlighted that no single shot was fired in the operation, partly {{due to the fact that}} El Tanque and his three accomplices were drinking alcohol and were not prepared to defend themselves when the police raided the building.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{helicopter}} attack, the PF and military personnel cordoned {{the area and}} conducted a thorough search of the premises. They initially discovered four abandoned vehicles that they suspected were owned by the perpetrators. In the vehicles, investigators discovered military uniforms with the insignias [...] "CJNG Special Forces High Command" [...] with five embedded stars. No immediate arrests were made. The Army seized several weapons from the CJNG, including 15 assault rifles, 6 handguns, 2 RPG launchers, 2 LAW rocket launchers, 10 rocket launcher missiles, 5 hand grenades, 92 chargers for multiple weapons, and 3,800 cartridges of different weapon calibers. Several of these weapons were illegal for civilians in Mexico because they were of exclusive use for the Mexican Armed Forces. Authorities also seized <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> several bullet-proof vests, and nine vehicles. One of the vehicles was equipped with tools to carry a RPG launcher. Investigators handed these items over to the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency. In addition to notifying the press of the seized items, they also stated that they were planning {{to carry out a}} homage to honor their comrades who were killed in {{the helicopter}} attack.

50|$|By {{the morning}} of August 15, 1947, the {{nationalist}} Reorganized 100th Brigade and the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade in the north was finally detected by the communist agents. The communist party secretary of Heshui (合水) County, Li Ke (李科), the first high ranking communist who received the information, immediately went to the communist headquarters at Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian 九岘) Town to inform his comrades that the enemy they faced was not just merely the nationalist Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment, but the entire nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. This important piece of intelligence shocked the communist command, which immediately changed the plan from the original ambush to blocking actions to cover an emergency retreat, because the communists were well aware that the enemy enjoyed absolute technical superiority and the communists themselves did not have absolute numerical superiority either. Though the communists attempted to disengage, it was simply impossible. The terrain favored the nationalist cavalry and limited the speed of communist withdraw. The same terrain also prevented the communist runners from reaching the units {{in the field in}} time {{due to the lack of}} <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipments</b> on the communist side. When the communist units in the field had received the order to retreat, they were already in contact with the enemy, so blocking actions had to be fought. The communist commander Wang Shitai (王世泰) had to redeploy his units by assigning the 2nd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade to hold the Nine Steep Hills (Jiu Xian 九岘) Town, the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade was deployed on the slope of mountain to the west of the town, the communist 6th Cavalry Division was deployed to the valley to the west of Peach Tree Village (Tao Shu Zhuang, 桃树庄), and the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade originally planned to be deployed behind the enemy lines to encircle the enemy became the reserve.|$|R
