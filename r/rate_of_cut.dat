40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six optimization models {{which are}} developed and solved in two stages {{in order to}} integrate tolerancing and machining parameters decisions. One model is developed in the first stage. The first-stage model is related to a design problem and provides better part tolerance {{to be used in}} the second stage to incorporate tool adjustment decisions into the optimization of machining parameters. Five models are developed in the second stage and are divided into single-machine and multi-machine turning operation problems. For single-machine turning operations, three models are formulated. The first is a single-product multi-pass model considering pass selection for determining optimum cutting speed, feed <b>rate,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> dimension deviation and number of passes. The second is a single-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs to find optimum cutting speed, feed <b>rate,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> dimension deviation and batch size. The third is a multi-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs for selection of optimum cutting speed, feed <b>rate,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> dimension deviations and production cycle time. For multi-machine turning operations, two models are formulated. One is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing total cost for determining optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed <b>rate,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. The second is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing cycle time which, once solved, will give optimum workload assignment, cutting speed, feed <b>rate,</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. A solution method and illustrative examples are given to test the feasibility of the developed optimization models. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{sediment}} {{taken from}} the bank {{during the process of}} bank erosion is deposited on the opposing side of the channel fueling the process called point bar deposition. The helicoidal flow also plays a role in this process by acting as a cross channel component that moves the sediment to the other side. The processes of point bar deposition and bank erosion are intertwined and in most cases the erosion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> banks is equal to the deposition rate of point bars. In addition, point bars act as topographic obstructions once formed that further drive flow into the opposite bank, creating a positive feedback loop.

40|$|Objectives: To {{measure in}} vitro the {{direction}} and force of applied loads applied by clinicians when using both a conventional slow surgical handpiece (CH) and an ultrasonic chisel (USC) for cutting bone. Study design: Five clinicians were asked to cut bovine bone using either an USC or a CH. The bone was placed on a force measurement system that could measure both longitudinal and downward loads. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> was calculated over a fixed time-period {{and the depth of}} cut measured using a penetratometer. Results: The magnitude of the longitudinal forces generated varied between 1. 48 and 3. 22 N (USC) and 0. 04 and 4. 56 N (CH). The CH had a pulling force directed towards the operator. Both instruments produced a similar range of downward forces although there was intra- and inter-operator variability. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> varied in a similar manner, however, the CH produced a significantly greater depth of cut (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The force measurement system demonstrated differences in the way clinicians used the USC and CH instruments to cut bone. Of the two cutting methods investigated, the rotary bur is more efficient than the ultrasonic chisel. An ultrasonic chisel does cut bone in a different manner from a conventional bur and clinicians may require training before using it clinically. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mycorrhizal plants were grown in flat perspex chambers (20 x 6 cm(2)) and root growth {{was restricted to}} the upper portion of each chamber enabling mycelial translocation to be studied over distances of up to 15 cm. P- 32 was supplied, either directly to distal parts of the extending mycelium, or to single, cut mycelial strands in feeding dishes. Two-dimensional patterns of activity were accumulated as scans with a lateral resolution of 5 mm and a longitudinal resolution of 3 - 4 mm. No distinct translocation front could be detected but patterns of accumulation of label in the mycorrhizal roots were not consistent with movement by simple diffusion. Activity in translocating hyphae became visible only after the activity in mycorrhizal root lips had been visible for a few days. In all cases there was a lag period of 20 - 50 hours before P- 32 could be detected in mycorrhizal root tips. Pre-feeding with unlabelled phosphate {{had no effect on}} this lag period. This implies continuous translocation of phosphate at low concentrations and a lag period due to the time needed for detectable levels of phosphate to accumulate in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the minimum velocity of phosphate movement in the hyphae would be 7. 5 mm/h, if the first molecules of P- 32 arriving at the roots could be detected and the transport distance is 15 cm. Accumulation of phosphate to the roots was fairly constant, but not linear. The phosphorus uptake rate by intact mycelial margins was nearly four orders of magnitude higher than the uptake <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> mycorrhizal strands. The results indicate that the fine, foraging hyphae are better suited for nutrient uptake than mycelial strands and that phosphorus translocation in the hyphae occurs by active translocation of small amounts rather than by mass flow...|$|E
