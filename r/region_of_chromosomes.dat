30|$|Promoter hypermethylation is {{believed}} to block protein expression, and epigenetic control can touch over a large <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in a coordinated manner [23, 24]. Promoters for tumor suppressor genes WWOX and Fhit are frequently hypermethylated and silenced in metastatic cancers [25, 26]. Alternatively, tumor suppressors are inactivated due to gene mutation, fragmentation, or interchromosomal recombination at the later cancer progression and metastasis stages. Nonetheless, expression of tumor suppressor WWOX is increased {{during the early stages}} of cancer initiation and growth, and is then dramatically reduced at the late stages of differentiation in skin cancer both in humans and mice [3, 10].

40|$|International audienceThe {{emergence}} of new molecular biology techniques has provided cytogenetics with tools which allow for the elucidation of questions that classical cytogenetics could not answer. Therefore, the present work standardizes a microdissection protocol for cytogenetic studies in bees.

For this study, the centromeric <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in the stingless bee Tetragonisca fiebrigi was used for probe synthesis. The results demonstrated that the methodology used was efficient, presenting markings in the centromeric regions of several chromosomes.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new resource for targeted insertional mutagenesis in Arabidopsis using a maize (Zea mays) Activator/Dissociation (Ds) two-element system.

Because Ds elements preferentially transpose to nearby genomic sites, {{they can be used}} in targeted mutagenesis of linked genes. To efficiently target all genes throughout the genome, we generated a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the Ds launch pad construct, identified lines containing single Ds launch pad inserts, and mapped the positions of Ds launch pads in 89 lines. The integration sites of the Ds launch pads were relatively evenly distributed on all five chromosomes, except for a <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> 2 and 4 and the centromeric regions.

40|$|Aneuploidy, the {{unbalanced}} {{number of}} chromosomes in a cell, {{is considered a}} prevalent form of genetic instability and is largely acknowledged as a condition implicated in tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations like DNA hypomethylation have been correlated with cancer initiation/progression. Furthermore, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests the involvement of epigenome-wide disruption as a cause of global DNA hypomethylation in aneuploidy generation. Here, we report that the DNA hypomethylating drug 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (DAC), affects the correct ploidy of nearly diploid HCT- 116 human cells by altering the methylation pattern of the chromosomes. Specifically, we show that a DACinduced reduction of 5 -Methyl Cytosine at the pericentromeric <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> correlates with aneuploidy and mitotic defects. Our results suggest that DNA hypomethylation leads to aneuploidy by altering the DNA methylation landscape at the centromere that is necessary to ensure proper chromosomes segregation by recruiting the proteins necessary to build up a functional kinetochore...|$|E

Here, the data on the primary and higher order structure and organization of satellite DNAs from ten different tenebrionid species are presented, as well as on mutational processes effecting their evolution. Using these data, we have tried to determine conserved structural elements within satellites which can be important for maintaining the heterochromatin structure and compactness. Such analyses could help to define the structural components of the chromosome responsible for some heterochromatic functions, like chromosome pairing, centromere function and sister chromatid adhesion...|$|E
30|$|What is {{the ancient}} centromeric DNA of mammals? The {{question}} remains unanswered {{in most cases}} because of considerably diverse centromeric DNA among species from lower to higher organisms and uncompleted sequencing of the centromeric/pericentromeric regions. Additionally, the centromeric <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in most mammals is usually too small to dissect the chromosome localization of centromeric and pericentromeric DNA by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) study. The centromeric/pericentromeric region of the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis; barking deer) chromosome X[*]+[*] 3 is known to be exceptionally huge and compound in nature (Brinkley et al. [1984]) and may be composed of many different satellite DNA families (including functional centromeric and non-functional centromeric satellite DNAs as well as new and old satellite DNAs). Indeed, cervid satellite I (an old cervid satellite DNA) (Lee et al. [1994]; Lin et al. [1991]), cervid satellite II (a functional centromeric satellite DNA) (Vafa et al. [1999]; Li et al.

40|$|During mitosis, all {{chromosomes}} must {{attach to}} microtubules of the mitotic spindle to ensure correct chromosome segregation. Microtubule attachment occurs at specialized structures at the centromeric <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> called kinetochores. These kinetochores can generate microtubule attachments through capture of centrosome-derived microtubules, but in addition, they can generate microtubules themselves, which are subsequently integrated with centrosome-derived microtubules {{to form the}} mitotic spindle. Here, we have performed a large scale RNAi screen and identify cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) as a novel regulator of microtubule generation at kinetochores/chromatin. This function of GAK requires its C-terminal J-domain, which is essential for clathrin recycling from endocytic vesicles. Consistently, cells lacking GAK show strongly reduced levels of clathrin on the mitotic spindle, and reduction of clathrin levels also inhibits microtubule generation at kinetochores/chromosomes. Finally, we present evidence that association of clathrin with the spindle is promoted by a signal coming from the chromosomes. These results identify a role for GAK and clathrin in microtubule outgrowth from kinetochores/chromosomes and suggest that GAK acts through clathrin to control microtubule outgrowth around chromosomes...|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetochore}} is assembled during mitotic and meiotic {{divisions within}} the centromeric <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> It is composed of more than eighty different proteins. Spc 105 (also designated as Spc 7, KNL- 1 or Blinkin in different eukaryotes) is a comparatively large kinetochore protein, which can bind to the Mis 12 /MIND and Ndc 80 complexes and to the spindle assembly checkpoint components Bub 1 and BubR 1. Our genetic characterization of Drosophila Spc 105 shows that a truncated version lacking the rapidly evolving, repetitive central third still provides all essential functions. Moreover, in comparison with Cenp-C that has previously been observed to extend from the inner to the outer kinetochore region, full-length Spc 105 is positioned further out and is not similarly extended along the spindle axis. Thus, our results indicate that Spc 105 forms neither an extended link connecting inner Cenp-A chromatin with outer kinetochore regions nor a scaffold constraining kinetochore subcomplexes and spindle assembly checkpoint components together into a geometrically rigid supercomplex. Spc 105 seems to provide a platform within the outer kinetochore allowing independent assembly of various kinetochore components...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel human centromere-associated protein by preparing monoclonal antibodies against a fraction of HeLa chromosome scaffold proteins enriched for centromere/kinetochore components. One monoclonal antibody (mAb 177) specifically stains the centromere region of mitotic human chromosomes and binds to a novel, approximately 250 - 300 kd chromosome scaffold associated protein named CENP-E. In cells progressing through {{different parts of the}} cell cycle, the localization of CENP-E differed markedly from that observed for the previously identified centromere proteins CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C and CENP-D. In contrast to these antigens, no mAb 177 staining is detected during interphase, and staining first appears at the centromere <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during prometaphase. This association with chromosomes remains throughout metaphase but is redistributed to the midplate at or just after the onset of anaphase. By telophase, the staining is localized exclusively to the midbody. Microinjection of the mAb 177 into metaphase cells blocks or significantly delays progression into anaphase, although the morphology of the spindle and the configuration of the metaphase chromosomes appear normal in these metaphase arrested cells. This demonstrates that CENP-E function is required for the transition from metaphase to anaphase...|$|E

MLL 3 is expressed in peripheral blood, placenta, pancreas, testes, and foetal thymus and is weakly expressed in heart, brain, lung, liver, and kidney. It encodes a predicted protein of 4911 amino acids containing two plant homeo domains (PHD), an ATPase alpha beta signature, a high mobility group, a SET (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax) and two FY (phenylalanine tyrosine) -rich domains. The amino acid sequence of the SET domain was used to obtain a phylogenetic tree of human MLL genes and their homologues in different species. MLL 3 {{is closely related to}} human MLL 2, Fugu mll 2, a Caenorhabditis elegans predicted protein, and Drosophila trithorax-related protein. Interestingly, PHD and SET domains are frequently found in proteins encoded by genes that are rearranged in different haematological malignancies and MLL 3 maps to 7 q 36, a chromosome region that is frequently deleted in myeloid disorders.
