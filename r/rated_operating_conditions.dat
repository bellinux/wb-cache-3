Both effects are studied in CFD studies throughout literature, as lately by Castellani et al. Conversely, the specific investigations of single unsteady events as (large) longitudinal transient gusts are rare. Thus, the performed work presents a procedure, implemented in the CFD-solver THETA, to propagate longitudinal transient gusts through a flow field. In a first attempt, the gust is modelled in a cosines shape that strikes the generic NREL 5 MW wind turbine at <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and lasts about 6 seconds. Thereafter, the capability to simulate the aforementioned wind turbine under an extreme operating gust, following the international standard IEC 61400 - 13 definition, is presented. The smooth cosines curve is interrupted by the 3 /rev characteristic which is caused by respecting the tower during modelling. Moreover, the moderate gust speeds of ± 0. 5 m/s lead to noticeable changes in rotor torque. The flow states on the rotor blade before the gust strike and at maximal gust velocity are compared. An increased blade loading is detectable in the pressure coefficients which are displayed as contour plots.

Design metrics requirements like low cost, small size, high power factor, low {{percentage of total}} harmonic distortion etc. requires the power electronic systems to operate at high frequencies and at high power density. Failures of power converters are attributed largely by aging of power MOSFETs at high switching frequencies. Therefore, real time in-circuit prognostic of MOSFET {{needs to be done}} before their selection for power system design. Accelerated aging tests are performed in different circuits to determine the wear out failure of critical components based on their parametric degradation.

Employing compressible Large Eddy Simulations (LES), their generation mechanisms are exposed. Toward low mass-flow <b>rate</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> flow reversal over the blade tips (generated {{by the back}} pressure) causes an inflection point of the inlet flow profile. There, a shear-layer induces vortical structures circulating at the compressor inlet. Traces of these flow structures are observed until far downstream in the radial diffuser. The tip leakage flow exhibits angular momentum imparted by the impeller, which deteriorates the incidence angles at the blade tips through an over imposed swirling component to the incoming flow. We show that the impeller is incapable to maintain constant efficiency at surge <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> due to the extreme alteration of the incidence angle. This induces unsteady flow momentum transfer downstream, which is reflected as compression wave at the compressor outlet traveling toward the impeller.

The useful energy consumed by the pumps is less than what they demand due to inefficiency caused by a number of reasons including the mismatch between the <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and their actual operating conditions.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Reluctance {{synchronous}} Machines (RSM's) {{have become}} a viable alternative for alternating current (ac) drives since electronic drives have improved. These electronic drives make use of static switching devices to control the speed and torque of ac machines. The output waveforms of these devices contain numerous harmonics which can have harmful effects {{on some of the}} machine's performance parameters. Performance parameters of the RSM include torque, torque ripple, power, power factor and efficiency which are essential for the machine designer as well as the user. Poor efficiency of the RSM is mainly due to the copper losses of the stator windings and core losses in the stator iron. The core losses primarily consist of hysteresis- and eddy-current losses as well as additional losses which are due to domain wall rotation and pinning. Unlike the Induction Machine (JM), the RSM has no copper losses in the rotor, which reduces the operating temperature of the machine considerably. This thesis will focus on the influence non sinusoidal currents have on the performance parameters of a RSM. The machine will be subjected to ideal harmonics created by a six pulse drive which are theoretically predicted based on the operation of a six pulse drive. The machine will also be subjected to published data which are measured data for a more practical approach. These two cases will be compared to <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

The performance of the modified supercharger was investigated in a variable-component supercharger test rig and compared with that of the standard supercharger with an 8 -vaned diffuser. A separate evaluation of the component efficiencies and a study of the flow characteristics of the modified supercharger was made possible by internal diffuser instrumentation. At the volume flow required by the engine for <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> the modified supercharger increased the over-all adiabatic efficiency 0. 05 and the over-all pressure coefficient 0. 035. Furthermore, the capacity of the engine-stage supercharger was increased by replacing the standard 8 -vaned diffuser with the vaneless diffuser. The peak over-all adiabatic efficiency for the modified supercharger, however, was 0. 05 to 0. 07 lower than that of the standard unit over the range of tip speeds investigated. The improved performance of the modified supercharger at rated engine operating conditions resulted from a shift of the point of peak adiabatic efficiency and pressure coefficient of the standard supercharger to a higher flow. The energy loss through the vaneless diffuser was found to be small. Because of the restricted diffuser diameter, however, diffusion was inadequate, which resulted in a relatively small static-pressure rise through the diffuser, high diffuser-exit velocities, and excessive collector-case losses...|$|E

Overestimation of temperature results in spurious alerts {{that lead to}} unnecessary triggering of thermal control mechanisms, e.g., DVFS (Long et al. 2008; Memik et al. 2008).

In addition, allocating arbitrarily large number of sensors employed by the monitoring infrastructure, constructing the sensor networks will also pose a challenge (Long et al. 2008). An ideal goal is to monitor the highest temperatures on a microprocessor with allocating a minimum number of thermal sensors.

40|$|Nowadays, in average, {{one third}} of the fuel energy {{consumed}} by an engine is wasted throughout the exhaust gases. The recovery of this amount of energy would enable a reduction of the fuel consumption. One solution is to integrate an exhaust heat recovery system based on a Rankine cycle. The first and most crucial step in the design is the definition of its architecture, the definition of the <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and the sizing of the different components whilst considering the heat recovery over customer driving cycles. This paper presents a steady-state model of a steam Rankine cycle built by interconnecting sub-models of the heat exchangers, the pump and the expander. All the models were developed under EES (Engineering Equation Solver) environment. The models of heat exchanger are developed using the ε-NTU method. A heat exchanger is subdivided into three zones, each of them being characterized by both the exhaust gases and water side pressure drop as well as heat transfer coefficient. The evaluation of the two-phase zone pressure drop and heat transfer with respect to the vapour quality was carried out. The model of rotary piston expander describes the evolution of the fluid through the device and was split into three global steps: pressure drop across the supply port, isentropic and expansion at constant volume, internal and external heat transfers. The overall simulation model is finally used to predict the performance of the heat recovery system as the operating conditions and geometrical characteristics of each component are modified. An optimal sizing of the system is proposed and the underlying methodology is discussed. The analysis of the results pointed out that the levels of high/low pressure and the amount of superheat are the main parameters that impact the performance of the cycle and the sizing of the components.

40|$|Purpose– To {{provide a}} new and simple inverse rotor time {{constant}} identification method {{which can be used}} to update an indirect rotor field oriented controlled (IRFOC) induction motor algorithm. Design/methodology/approach– Two different equations are used to estimate the rotor flux in the stator reference frame. One of the equations {{is a function of the}} rotor time constant, rotor angular velocity and the stator currents. The other equation is a function of measured stator currents and voltages. The equation that uses the voltage and the current signals of the stator serves as reference model, however, the other equation works as an adjustable model with respect to the variation of the rotor time constant. Voltage signals used in the reference model equation are obtained from the measured DC bus voltage and the inverter gating signals. The proposed scheme is verified using a MATLAB/SIMULINK model for two different motors and experimentally using a DSP development tool (MCK 243) supplied by Technosoft S. A. Findings– The proposed estimator was able to successfully track the actual value of the inverse rotor time constant for different load torque and speed operating conditions. Increased oscillations in the estimated inverse rotor time constant appeared at lower speeds (below 10 per cent of rated speed) due to drift in a PI regulator (used at the estimator side), which was tuned under <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and using parameters nominal values. Research limitations/implications– This estimation scheme is limited when near zero speed operation is demanded; otherwise it gives a simple and practical solution. A suggested way out of this, is to provide a self‐tuning controller that can automatically adjust even for zero speed operation, or to automatically disconnect the estimator and take the most updated value as long as the operating speed is below a predetermined value. Originality/value– This paper presented a new inverse rotor time constant estimator for an IRFOC induction motor application and in conjunction rotor flux was estimated without voltage phase sensors...|$|E

Consequently, this research proposed an online learning Artificial Neural Network Efficiency Optimization (ANNEO) controller with the aim to generate an adaptive flux level to optimize the efficiency of any different operating points, especially at low speed and low torque condition. ANNEO is implemented with an online learning second order Levernberg-Marquardt algorithm. The proposed controller uses the input power of the drive system as the objective function and minimizes it. In order to further improve the system dynamic response, an Artificial Neural Network speed controller (ANNSC) of DTC is included. In ANNSC, the back propagation algorithm is employed. The goal of this research is to achieve the efficiency optimization of DTC induction motor drives system while preserve the superior speed performance of IM application over a wide speed range.

40|$|The main {{target of}} this thesis {{is the study}} of coupled {{transfer}} and reaction phenomena that take place in Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filters. The study is based on measurements and simulation tools of the transient behavior of particulate filters and oxidation catalysts, which have been developed by Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics. The examination of catalyzed filters begins with their filtration efficiency and pressure drop behavior during the loading conditions. The new semi-empirical mathematical model of filtration efficiency simulation is presented for first time, and validated against various <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The presence of washcoat loading increases the filtration efficiency and the pressure drop, due to the decrease of the filter’s porosity. At high flow rate conditions and large mean pore size substrate the amount of soot collected in the wall is larger, affecting the passive regeneration behavior of the filter. The Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter (CDPF) and the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) were examined on their gaseous oxidation performance of diesel exhaust. At steady - state and high flow <b>rate</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> the CDPF is more effective at the HC oxidation performance. At transient conditions the DOC is more effective to the gaseous oxidation performance. The study which follows examines the low-temperature passive regeneration behavior of catalyzed filters. At 330 °C the systems with DOC upstream are more effective during regeneration, due to the increased NO 2 concentration, which acts directly on the soot layer. At 400 °C the regeneration is based on the NO 2 diffusion phenomena. The study of high temperature - active regeneration performance follows. If the filter soot loading is controlled at levels below a carefully selected threshold, e. g. in the range of 8 g/l, via the regeneration control system, then the single CDPF system and the DOC+CDPF one exhibit comparable efficiencies and maximum temperatures, during the active regeneration with post injection. The study is completed with the evaluation of a zoned catalyzed filter, with axial zones of different activity. A catalyzed filter with larger precious metal loading at its front part is examined experimentally and computationally. The CDPF with the larger amount of Pt at its front part can replace the uniform coated one, with a great advantage at the cost. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber at the NACA Lewis laboratory {{to determine the effect}} of a revision of the <b>rated</b> engine <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and modifications to the afterburner fue 1 system, flameholder, and shell cooling on the augmented performance of the J 71 -A- 2 (x- 29) turbo jet engine operating at altitude. The afterburner modifications were made by the manufacturer to improve the endurance at sea-level, high-pressure conditions and to reduce the afterburner shell temperatures. The engine <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of <b>rated</b> rotational speed and turbine-outlet gas temperature were increased. Data were obtained at conditions simulating flight at a Mach number of 0. 9 and at altitudes from 40, 000 to 60, 000 feet. The afterburner modifications caused a reduction in afterburner combustion efficiency. The increase in rated engine speed and turbine-outlet temperature coupled with the afterburner modifications resulted in the over-all thrust of the engine and afterburner being unchanged at a given afterburner equivalence ratio, while the specific fuel consumption was increased slightly. A moderate shift in the range of equivalence ratios over which the afterburner would operate was encountered, but the maximum operable altitude remained unaltered. The afterburner-shell temperatures were also slightly reduced because of the modifications to the afterburner...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{serves as}} a notice of construction (NOC), pursuant {{to the requirements of}} Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 246 - 247 - 060, and as a request for approval to construct, pursuant to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 61. 07, portable exhausters for use on single-shell tanks (SSTs) during salt well pumping. Table 1 - 1 lists 18 SSTs covered by this NOC. This NOC also addresses other activities that are performed in support of salt well pumping but do not require the application of a portable exhauster. Specifically this NOC analyzes the following three activities that have the potential for emissions. (1) Salt well pumping (i. e., the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) under nominal tank <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Nominal tank <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> include existing passive breathing rates. (2) Salt well pumping (the actual transferring of waste from one tank to another) with use of a portable exhauster. (3) Use of a water lance on the waste to facilitate salt well screen and salt well jet pump installation into the waste. This activity is to be performed under nominal (existing passive breathing <b>rates)</b> tank <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The use of portable exhausters represents a cost savings because one portable exhauster can be moved back and forth between SSTs as schedules for salt well pumping dictate. A portable exhauster also could be used to simultaneously exhaust more than one SST during salt well pumping...|$|R
