40|$|In a free-space optical {{communication}} system, the mitigation of transient outages through {{the incorporation of}} error-control methods is of particular concern, the outages being caused by scintillation fades and obscurants. The focus of this innovative technology {{is the development of}} a data relay system for a reliable high-data-rate free-spacebased optical-transport network. The data relay boards will establish the link, maintain synchronous connection, group the data into frames, and provide for automatic retransmission (ARQ) of lost or erred frames. A certain Quality of Service (QoS) can then be ensured, compatible with the required data rate. The protocol to be used by the data relay system is based on the draft CCSDS standard data-link protocol Proximity- 1, selected by orbiters to multiple lander assets in the Mars network, for example. In addition to providing data-link protocol capabilities for the free-space optical link and buffering the data, the data relay system will interface directly with user applications over Gigabit Ethernet and/or with highspeed storage resources via Fibre Channel. The hardware implementation is built on a network-processor-based architecture. This technology combines the power of a hardware switch capable of data switching and packet routing at Gbps rates, with the flexibility of a software- driven processor that can host highly adaptive and reconfigurable protocols used, for example, in wireless local-area networks (LANs).

The system {{is based on a}} single-board computer with custom software and hardware to monitor and control the cryogenic operation of the system. The system provides local display and control, and can be operated remotely via a Web interface. The system controller is based on a commercial single-board computer with onboard data acquisition capability. The commercial hardware includes a microprocessor, an LCD (liquid crystal display), seven LED (light emitting diode) displays, a seven-key keypad, an Ethernet interface, 40 digital I/O (input/output) ports, 11 A/D (analog to digital) inputs, four D/A (digital to analog) outputs, and an external <b>relay</b> <b>board</b> to control the high-current devices. The temperature sensors used are commercial silicon diode devices that provide a non-linear voltage output proportional to temperature. The devices are excited with a 10 -microamp bias current. The system is capable of monitoring and displaying three temperatures. The vacuum sensors are commercial thermistor devices. The output of the sensors is a non-linear voltage proportional to vacuum pressure in the 1 -Torr to 1 -millitorr range. Two sensors are used. One measures the vacuum pressure in the cryocooler and the other the pressure at the input to the vacuum pump. The helium pressure sensor is a commercial device that provides a linear voltage output from 1 to 5 volts, corresponding to a gas pressure from 0 to 3. 5 MPa (approx. = 500 psig). Control of the vacuum process is accomplished with a commercial electrically operated solenoid valve. A commercial motor starter is used to control the input power of the compressor. The warm-up heaters are commercial power resistors sized to provide the appropriate power for the thermal mass of the particular system, and typically provide 50 watts of heat. There are four basic operating modes. "Cool " mode commands the system to cool to normal operating temperature. "Heat " mode is used to warm the device to a set temperature near room temperature.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{produced}} to detail {{the research and}} development of a medical and home automation project, known herein as RapidARM. RapidARM is primarily a health monitoring and alert system that autonomously calls for help if a user suffers with a cardiac emergency. The service continuously monitors the users heart rate activity through a smart watch application, and a smart phone application performs actions based on these readings when compared with heart rate parameters set by the user on initial setup. The service also functions as a smart-home hub in which a user can interact with common electrical devices in their home without the need to do so manually. This includes controlling lighting, television, radio and heating. The service also automatically unlocks the users’ front door {{in the event of an}} emergency. The mobile application UI provides functions to instantly launch a call to the emergency services or to a selected contact, while also displaying an overview of the most recent heart rate activity to the user. The system has been designed to automatically call the emergency services when it detects heart rate conditions that are deemed outside of the acceptable parameters, allowing a brief period for the user to interrupt the call. The heart rate parameters are configurable, based on the individual health requirements of the user, as advised by their doctor. User data is used to create an audio file that is saved to their device, and in the event of a trigger, this file is played to the emergency services when an automatic call is evoked. During an emergency trigger, the phone will display the users’ identification details and medical history while also unlocking their front door. RapidARM is built using an android mobile device, an Android Wear smart-watch, a RaspberryPi development board, and the Firebase API to provide authenticated user accounts and profile data, as well as saving a record of all events triggered within the system. This database exists in the cloud and can be accessed through the mobile application or through a web browser. An instance of the database is also stored within the mobile application itself for use when a network connection is not available. Events and data changes within the system occur in real-time, and a Raspberry Pi device and 8 -channel <b>relay</b> <b>board</b> are used to receive control messages from the cloud and to interact with the users’ home based these control messages. Valuable contributions to the project were made by Professor. Richard Costello and Dr. Abir Alsaid including forming baseline figures for upper and lower safe heart rates, and in gauging the benefits of such a system with patients. Surveys completed by the contributors have been attached in the appendix. Through research into the possible user base for the system conducted using data from the Census report 2011, It was identified that over 900 ’ 000 people above the age of 65 currently live alone in Ireland. Also highlighted in the research was the number of disabled people living in Ireland, at over 590 ’ 000 in the same 2011 report. Throughout testing, the system has been shown to address the problem consistently and reliably, providing a history of heart activity for the user to examine in the form of an events list, graphs and charts of data gathered from the smart-watch. Feedback was received on possible improvements during the usability testing and the results of this are contained in this document. RapidARM has been shown to provide a lifeline to the user who would otherwise be incapable of calling for assistance. Research has been conducted into viable alternative options within the space and these have been evaluated to identify possible strengths, weaknesses or opportunities for the RapidARM project...|$|E
