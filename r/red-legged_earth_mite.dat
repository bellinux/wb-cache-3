40|$|Abstract. <b>Earth</b> <b>mites</b> are {{a complex}} of related species {{introduced}} into Australia {{in the early part}} of last century that cause economic damage to crops, especially canola, and to pastures. A general method of chemical control aimed at interrupting the life cycle at the most effective stage, by spraying in the spring before the mites enter diapause, has recently been adopted for controlling <b>earth</b> <b>mites,</b> particularly the redlegged <b>earth</b> <b>mite</b> Halotydeus destructor (Tucker). Here we use paired-paddock treatments and field enclosures to test the effectiveness of this method on pest populations of H. destructor as well as on other pests over two seasons at multiple pasture sites in Victoria. Halotydeus destructor numbers at the start of the winter growing season were suppressed by up to 85 %, but this control level was not sustained. The numbers of H. destructor and other pests were similar to or higher than those in the unsprayed areas by spring. Spring spraying is, therefore, a useful means of suppressing H. destructor in early autumn, but its effects disappear relatively quickly over time in Victoria. This strategy also has little impact on the control of the blue oat mite Penthaleus major (Duges) and other phytophagous invertebrate pests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The redlegged <b>earth</b> <b>mite,</b> Halotydeus destructor, {{continues}} to be an intractable pest causing damage to most crop and pasture species in southernAustralia. H. destructor feed on all stages of plants, but particularly damage seedlings in autumn. Research has aimed to develop new controls based on {{a better understanding of the}} biology and ecology of this pest. Chemicals remain the key tool to controlH. destructor, despite the recent appearance of resistance to synthetic pyrethroids. A control package, Timerite, has been developed bywhich a singlewell-timed spray in spring can preventH. destructor from developing diapause eggs. Field trials show this strategy provides effective control of H. destructor the following autumn, andprotects plant seedlings, althoughmite populations buildup againduringwinter. Non-chemical control strategies include grazing, the use of tolerant plants such as cereals, resistant legume cultivars and avoiding rotations where favourable host plants are available in theyear beforegrowing susceptible crops suchas canola. Natural enemies canassist inmite control, and their numbers can be enhanced by methods including increasing landscape features like shelterbelts. Interspecific competition can occur between H. destructor and other pest mites, but the extent to which these interactions influence the structure of pest communities under different management regimes remains to be investigated...|$|R
25|$|Acarines live in {{practically}} every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods {{in the soil}} organic matter and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predaceous and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others are detritivores that help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are plant feeders and may damage crops. Damage to crops {{is perhaps the most}} costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives (Tetranychoidea), <b>earth</b> <b>mites</b> (Penthaleidae), thread-footed mites (Tarsonemidae) and the gall and rust mites (Eriophyoidea). Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsial pox. A well-known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by the respiratory disease. The use of predatory mites (e.g. Phytoseiidae) in pest control and herbivorous mites that attack weeds is also important. An unquantified, but major positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.|$|R

40|$|The {{invasion}} pathways of pest arthropods can {{be traced}} using genetic tools to {{develop an understanding of}} the processes that have shaped successful invasions and to inform both pest management and conservation strategies in their non-native and native ranges, respectively. The redlegged <b>earth</b> <b>mite,</b> Halotydeus destructor, is a major economic pest in Australia, successfully establishing and spreading after arrival from South Africa more than 100 years ago. Halotydeus destructor has recently expanded its range and evolved resistance to numerous pesticides in Australia, raising questions around its origin and spread. Location: South Africa and Australia. Methods: We sampled H. destructor populations in South Africa and Australia and developed a microsatellite marker library. We then examined genetic variation using mtDNA and microsatellite markers across both native and invasive ranges to determine endemic genetic diversity within South Africa, identify the likely origin of invasive populations and test genetic divergence across Australia. Results: The data show that H. destructor comprises a cryptic species complex in South Africa, with putative climatic/host plant associations that may correspond to regional variation. A lineage similar to that found near Cape Town has spread throughout Western and eastern Australia, where populations remain genetically similar. Main conclusions: Tracing the invasion pathway of this economically important pest revealed cryptic lineages in South Africa which points to the need for a taxonomic revision. The absence of significant genetic structure across the wide invasive range of H. destructor within Australia has implications for the development (and spread) of pesticide resistance and also points to recent local adaptation in physiological traits...|$|R
40|$|Background Pesticide {{application}} {{is the dominant}} control method for arthropod pests in broad-acre arable systems. In Australia, organophosphate pesticides are often applied either prophylactically, or reactively, including at higher concentrations, to control crop establishment pests such as false wireworms and <b>earth</b> <b>mite</b> species. Organophosphates are reported to be disruptive to beneficial species, such as natural enemies, but {{this has not been}} widely assessed in Australian systems. Neither has the risk that secondary outbreaks may occur if the natural enemy community composition or function is altered. Methods We examine the abundance of ground-dwelling invertebrate communities in an arable field over successive seasons under rotation; barley, two years of wheat, then canola. Two organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and methidathion) were initially applied at recommended rates. After no discernible impact on target pest species, the rate for chlorpyrifos was doubled to elicit a definitive response to a level used at establishment when seedling damage is observed. Invertebrates were sampled using pitfalls and refuge traps throughout the experiments. We applied measures of community diversity, principal response curves and multiple generalised linear modelling techniques to understand the changes in pest and natural enemy communities. Results There was large variability due to seasonality and crop type. Nevertheless, both pest (e. g., mites and aphids) and natural enemy (e. g., predatory beetles) invertebrate communities were significantly affected by application of organophosphates. When the rate of chlorpyrifos was increased there was a {{reduction in the number of}} beetles that predate on slug populations. Slugs displayed opposite trends to many of the other target pests, and actually increased in numbers under the higher rates of chlorpyrifos in comparison to the other treatments. Slug numbers in the final rotation of canola resulted in significant yield loss regardless of pesticide application. Discussion Organophosphates are a cost-effective tool to control emergent pests in broad-acre arable systems in Australia. We found risks associated with prophylactic application in fields under rotation between different crop types and significant changes to the community of pests and natural enemy. Disrupting key predators reduced effective suppression of other pests, such as slugs, and may lead to secondary outbreaks when rotating with susceptible crops such as canola. Such non-target impacts are rarely documented when studies focus on single-species, rather than community assessments. This study represents a single demonstration of how pesticide application can lead to secondary outbreaks and reinforces the need for studies that include a longer temporal component to understand this process further...|$|R
40|$|During March 1993, 130 {{direct seeding}} sites were studied in Gippsland, Corangamite and the Wimmera {{to try and}} {{determine}} the major factors influencing seedling establishment by direct seeding techniques. Thirty one variables believed to influence establishment were considered. A series of backwards regression procedures were used to identify statistically significant variables. Rainfall patterns during, and after seeding were unusual in all districts. Spring rainfall was between 20 and 100 per cent above the average, except on the Gippsland Plains were the majority of sites received 20. 7 per cent below the spring average. During the summer months all areas studied received between 42 and 161 per cent above the average. These rainfall patterns influenced {{all aspects of the}} direct seeding projects. As rainfall increased prior to sowing, seedling numbers generally decreased, apparently due to the effects of waterlogging. This was evident on the Basalt and Gippsland Plains and in the Wimmera. The opposite occurred in the higher rainfall areas, and it is suspected that rainfall alone could not account for this trend and that other, unknown factors, possibly soil conditions and temperature may have been involved. On the Gippsland Plains, sites sown early with adequate moisture performed better than sites sown later, when moisture stress was believed to have reduced seedling numbers. For all other areas, seedling numbers increased as the sowing date was delayed, the exact reason is unknown, but later sowing dates generally coincided with higher soil temperatures, less rain and suspected higher evaporation rates and therefore fewer cases of waterlogging. It was concluded that the climate had an over-riding influence on all direct seeding projects. This effect was also influenced by the soil texture. Sites sown on sandy soils in the Wimmera performed well (1. 28 seedlings per metre), but not on the Gippsland Plains (0. 4 seedlings per metre) where soil moisture was believed to be a limiting factor. Generally, sites sown on loam and clay loam soils were associated with a high number of seedlings (an average of 1. 23 seedling per metre). Heavier soils performed poorly (an average of 0. 45 seedlings per metre). Other important factors highlighted by the study were: - Waterlogging was believed to be highly detrimental for establishment. This was most evident in the Wimmera, where waterlogged sites were associated with a twelve fold decline in seedling numbers (1. 41 to 0. 12 seedlings per metre on waterlogged sites). Waterlogging predominantly occurred on clay soils; - Cracking soils showed a similar trend. Sites on cracking soils had approximately half the number of seedlings than sites on non-cracking soils, (0. 55 and 1. 20 seedlings per metre respectively). This effect was again greatest in the Wimmera, but also evident on the Gippsland Plains. The above average rainfall on the Basalt Plains may have allowed the seedlings to develop a strong root system before the soils dried and cracked, and was not a factor in this area. - Weed cover at the time of sowing was suspected of favourably altering the micro-climate of the seed/seedling. Sites where a cover of weeds was present at the time of sowing had approximately three times as many seedlings present than sites were no weeds were present at the time of sowing (1. 47 and 0. 59 seedlings per metre respectively). The exact state of the weed cover or how the micro-climate was altered is unknown, except that a herbicide had been applied to the weeds prior to sowing. - Redlegged <b>earth</b> <b>mite</b> were present on 61. 5 per cent of the sites studied, and these sites had 90. 8 per cent fewer seedlings than sites where redlegged <b>earth</b> <b>mite</b> was not reported. The influence of this pest was particularly evident in the Hills region. It is suspected that irreversible damage had been done to the seedlings soon after emergence and that the majority of farmers failed to recognise this. Treatment for the pest was thought to have been applied too late, except on the Gippsland Plains. - Two and three pre-sowing applications of herbicide significantly increased seedling numbers apparently due to longer and more effective weed control than one or no herbicide applications prior to sowing. The use of residual herbicides did not influence seedling numbers, but it is suspected that the climatic patterns influenced this; and - The history of the paddock was important in influencing seedling establishment. The exact reason is unknown, but the fact that seedlings will establish readily on site previously grazed, with a history of fertiliser application may be important. Unimproved and cropping land did not perform so well and it is suspected that neglect, poor soil structure and chemical contamination of the soil are possible reasons for this. This study largely supports the work of other researchers in this area, but also highlights other important considerations often neglected.

40|$|Northern fowl mites (Ornithonyssus sylviarum) are {{the most}} common and {{economically}} important ectoparasites in US laying hen flocks. Mites are permanent ectoparasites and cause damage to birds via blood feeding. Once in a flock, they can be very difficult to eradicate from a property. Mite control has traditionally relied on chemical sprays directed at high pressure underneath the birds and into the vent region where mites live; these applications are most effective when birds are held in battery cages. However in recent years animal welfare concerns and consumer demand has affected how laying hens are housed. The transition to furnished-cage or cage-free production systems will require novel control techniques to achieve ectoparasite control. I investigated possibilities for ectoparasite control that would be effective in alternative poultry housing. 	Breeding for parasite resistance is an attractive control method. Chickens develop resistance to the northern fowl mite (NFM) and this is under at least some genetic control. I tested whether the haplotype conferring NFM resistance had any effect on chicken resting metabolism (energy expenditure), physiology, or economic performance. Bird haplotype did not affect hen metabolism or production parameters. NFM infestations negatively affected economic performance. 	Dustboxes have been shown to effectively decrease mite populations in cage-free flock when insecticidal dusts are used in combination with sand. I tested whether dustboxes with sand and diatomaceous <b>earth</b> could keep <b>mites</b> below economic thresholds before mite levels became damaging. When dustboxes were present in a flock, mite levels were on average kept below economic threshold regardless of percent of the flock that dustbathed. 	Sulfur dust is effective for NFM control in very low doses, though it is not universally approved for organic use. I tested whether sulfur deployed in a dust bag would be effective in caged (non-organic) flocks and if the placement of the bag affected efficacy. Hanging dust bags offered the best NFM control. 	Backyard chicken flocks are a growing trend in this country, and nothing is currently know about ectoparasite diversity on these birds. I surveyed 100 birds on 20 properties in southern California. Greater diversity was found on backyard flocks than on commercial birds...|$|R
