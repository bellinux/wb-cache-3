40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BHRF 1 open {{reading frame}} is abundantly {{expressed}} early in the lytic replication cycle. BHRF 1 is also transiently expressed in some latently infected cell lines {{in the absence of}} expression of other lytic cycle proteins. BHRF 1 shares distant, but significant, colinear primary amino acid sequence homology to Bc 12, a cellular gene strongly implicated in the evolution of follicular lymphoma. The experiments reported here used a molecular genetic approach to examine the role of BHRF 1 in EBV infection. Isogenic EBV recombinants having either wild-type BHRF 1 or a null mutation due to a translational stop signal in place of the 24 th BHRF 1 codon were used to infect primary B lymphocytes. The BHRF 1 mutant recombinants did not differ from the wild type in their ability to infect and transform the growth of primary B lymphocytes, to replicate in the resultant lymphoblastoid cell lines, or to initiate a second <b>round</b> of <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> transformation. Deletion of the entire BHRF 1 {{open reading frame}} did not destroy the ability of the mutant virus to maintain cell growth transformation.

40|$|Background: The {{cellular}} and inflammatory {{responses in}} airway epithelial cells in cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is being investigated}} {{in the study of}} CF pathophysiology. Human rhinovirus (HRV) is an important trigger of exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (CF). Either <b>cell</b> lines or <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures can be used to study the response of CF epithelial cells in vitro. The use of cell models has an advantage over <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models, as <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are difficult to obtain. However, uncertainty exists about how accurately the inflammatory response of cell models reflect that of <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> cultures. Aims: 	 To investigate if cell models have similar cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV compared to <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and to determine which of the cell models assessed closely resembles <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> models. Methods: This investigation compared the cellular and inflammatory responses to HRV in healthy and CF immortalized and telomere shortened epithelial cell models to the responses found in their <b>primary</b> <b>cell</b> counterparts. Cytopathic effect, susceptibility to HRV 1 B, viability, apoptotic response and inflammatory cytokine production (IL- 8 and IL- 6) were determined under basal conditions and after HRV 1 B infection. Results: Similarities were found between the <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and cell models when investigating the cytopathic effect (CPE). Furthermore, HRV 1 B had a comparable effect on the viability among the <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> NuLi- 1 ’s and CuFi- 1 ’s. However, when the susceptibility to HRV 1 B was compared it showed that except for the BEAS 2 B-s, all of the cell models had a minimal response compared to the <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, both the generated CF airway epithelial cell models expressed a lower apoptotic response and appeared to have lower cytokine productions (IL- 8 and IL- 6) in response to HRV 1 B. Conclusion: Generated cell models differ in their cellular and inflammatory responses compared to that of their primary counterparts. Furthermore this study demonstrated that the telomere shortened cell models reflected more truly the cellular and inflammatory response of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to HRV 1 B infection compared to immortalised cell models. ...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{lines are}} often used in place of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> to study {{biological}} processes.

40|$|Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear {{structures}} that {{are thought to}} have diverse functions, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. The phosphorylation status of coilin, the CB marker protein, might impact CB formation. We hypothesize that <b>primary</b> <b>cells,</b> which lack CBs, contain different phosphoisoforms of coilin compared with that found in transformed cells, which have CBs. Localization, self-association and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on coilin phosphomutants all suggest this modification impacts the function of coilin and may thus contribute towards CB formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that coilin is hyperphosphorylated in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> compared with transformed cells. mRNA levels of the nuclear phosphatase PPM 1 G are significantly reduced in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> and expression of PPM 1 G in <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> induces CBs. Additionally, PPM 1 G can dephosphorylate coilin in vitro. Surprisingly, however, expression of green fluorescent protein alone is sufficient to form CBs in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, our data support a model whereby coilin is the target of an uncharacterized signal transduction cascade that responds to the increased transcription and snRNP demands found in transformed cells...|$|R

40|$|Background: The MAPK/ERK 1 / 2 serine kinases are primary {{mediators}} of the Ras mitogenic signaling pathway. Phosphorylation by MEK activates MAPK/ERK in the cytoplasm, and phospho-ERK {{is thought}} to enter the nucleus readily to modulate transcription. Principal Findings: Here, however, we observe that in primary cultures of breast and ovarian epithelial cells, phosphorylation and activation of ERK 1 / 2 are disassociated from nuclear translocalization and transcription of downstream targets, such as c-Fos, suggesting that nuclear translocation is limited in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Accordingly, in import assays in vitro, <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> showed a lower import activity for ERK 1 / 2 than cancer cells, in which activated MAPK readily translocated into the nucleus and activated c-Fos expression. <b>Primary</b> <b>cells</b> express lower levels of nuclear pore complex proteins and the nuclear transport factors, importin B 1 and importin 7, which may explain the limiting ERK 1 / 2 import found in <b>primary</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, reduction in expression of nucleoporin 153 by siRNA targeting reduced ERK 1 / 2 nuclear activity in cancer cells.

The formation of biofilms is initiated by single <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> colonizing surfaces from the bulk liquid. The next steps from <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> towards the first cell clusters as the initial step of biofilm formation remain relatively poorly studied. Clonal growth and random migration of <b>primary</b> <b>cells</b> are traditionally considered {{as the dominant}} processes leading to organized microcolonies in laboratory grown monocultures.

The deviation from uniform randomness increased with colonisation — {{despite the absence of}} cell reproduction — and was even more pronounced when the flow of water above biofilms was multidirectional and shear stress elevated. We propose a simple mechanistic model that captures interactions, such as cell-to-cell signalling or chemical surface conditioning, to simulate the observed distribution patterns. Model predictions match empirical observations reasonably well, highlighting the role of biotic interactions even already during very early biofilm formation despite few and distant cells.

The frequent and precisely regular spacing of GlcA substitutions every six xylosyl residues along the backbone is also unlike that previously observed in secondary cell wall xylan.
