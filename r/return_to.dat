50|$|The laws of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{scale are}} {{a set of}} three interrelated and {{sequential}} laws:Law of Increasing <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,Law of Constant <b>Returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale,and Law of Diminishing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> Scale.If output increases by that same proportional change as all inputs change then there are constant <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (CRS). If output increases by less than that proportional change in inputs, there are decreasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (DRS). If output increases by more than the proportional change in inputs, there are increasing <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale (IRS). A firm's production function could exhibit different types of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> scale in different ranges of output. Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in private marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education between wage-employees and the self-employed in Uganda, using the Mincerian framework with pooled regression models. We use a two-wave household panel to estimate homogenous and heterogeneous private <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education for both worker types. The study finds similar marginal <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> an additional year of schooling for both worker types. Further, the study finds the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> educational qualifications are convex for wage-employees and concave for the self-employed. With regard <b>to</b> heterogeneous <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, we employ quantile regression models and find <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education decreasing with quantile for both worker types...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{have shown}} that <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> {{employer}} tenure in Indonesia are {{higher than in the}} USA and other developed countries. By contrast, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience are lower in Indonesia than in developed countries. Furthermore, in Indonesia, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer tenure are larger than <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience, and our estimates of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> employer tenure are unaffected when we account for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> other types of human capital, such as occupation and industry-specific human capital. As in many developing countries, informality is quite prevalent in Indonesia. We test for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> sector-specific human capital and find that only formality offers positive returns. Overall, we conclude that employer tenure and formal sector tenure are the main sources of wage growth in Indonesia, with general labor market experience playing a smaller but significant role.|$|R
40|$|Under {{socialism}} {{workers had}} their wages {{set by the}} central planners [...] In my thesis I use panel data from SHARLIFE questionnaire in order <b>to</b> analyze how <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> East German human capital variables changed after the reunification in 1990. I also compare these <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> West German <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital variables. Before 1990 the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience and education were lower in East Germany than in West Germany. After the reunification East German <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience obtained before 1990 and to education decreased. I find a significant decrease of <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> high educated workers who spent in the East German educational system 15 and more years. East German <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> both human capital variables are smaller than West German ones before the reunification and the difference is more pronounced after the reunification...|$|R
