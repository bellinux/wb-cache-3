5|$|Central Basingstoke has two further {{shopping}} areas: The Malls and the Top of Town. The Malls {{area had}} declined since {{the opening of}} Festival Place and the closure of its Allders department store, though still home to several major retailers. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group {{in partnership with the}} Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for <b>redevelopment</b> The <b>redevelopment</b> of The Malls started in late 2010, and the shopping centre was given a major facelift. The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed, to protect the centre from bad weather, but still allow natural light and air in. The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed. A new gateway entrance to The Malls links it to the rail station. The <b>redevelopment</b> was completed {{in the last quarter of}} 2011. The <b>redevelopment</b> work has been carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive {{allocated}} £138million for a {{major programme}} of stadium <b>redevelopment</b> throughout Northern Ireland, with £28million allocated to the <b>redevelopment</b> of Windsor Park. In June 2012, further details of the stadium's <b>redevelopment</b> were released. The plan was to redevelop Windsor Park into an 18,000 all-seater stadium {{with a series of}} phased works originally intended to begin in the middle of 2013. The <b>redevelopment</b> would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the <b>redevelopment</b> was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31million to complete the project. The <b>redevelopment</b> finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium <b>redevelopment</b> had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the <b>redevelopment,</b> it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E

50|$|The Mall {{went through}} huge <b>redevelopments</b> in early 2007. Alongside the Mall, a large car park was built and was {{opened to the}} public on 12 February 2007. Stage one of the <b>redevelopments</b> opened on 6 September 2007; the opening was planned for 30 October 2007, but then got pushed to the 31st. The <b>redevelopments</b> {{upgraded}} the Mall's total retail floor space from 6,000m² to over 23,000m², making it the fourth-largest shopping centre in the Illawarra, after competitors Wollongong Central, Stockland Shellharbour and Westfield Warrawong.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant <b>redevelopment</b> was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing <b>redevelopment.</b> The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a <b>redevelopment</b> of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and <b>redevelopment</b> of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, {{planning}} permission for the <b>redevelopment</b> was granted. The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the <b>redevelopment.</b> The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium <b>redevelopment.</b> In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the <b>redevelopment</b> to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010 Manchester City Council {{announced}} that it was in discussion with a developer to renovate the building and bring it back into use. In August 2013 the council received a planning application from the Church Converts (Manchester) to repair the building and convert it into apartments; the application was granted in February 2014. The <b>redevelopment</b> by CZero Developments consists of 73 private apartments in both the chapel and the Sunday school, with the <b>redevelopment</b> due to be completed by Summer 2017. The building was used for student accommodation from September 2017, with a gym, cinema room, study areas and a lounge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, {{then the}} {{governing}} {{institution of the}} District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, {{the first in the}} capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia <b>Redevelopment</b> Act, which established the District of Columbia <b>Redevelopment</b> Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur <b>redevelopment</b> in the capital. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the <b>redevelopment</b> ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods, but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s.|$|E
