50|$|Pebble {{circuits}} {{are a very}} advandageous {{location for}} the application of sensor-based ore sorters. Usually it is hard waste recirculating and limiting the total mill capacity. In addition, the tonnage is significantly lower in comparison to the total <b>run-of-mine</b> stream, the size range is applicable and usually uniform and the particles' surfaces are clean. High impact on total mill capacity is reported in the literature.|$|E
50|$|The coal {{delivered}} {{from the}} mine that {{reports to the}} coal preparation plant is called <b>run-of-mine,</b> or ROM, coal. This is the raw material for the CPP, and consists of coal, rocks, middlings, minerals and contamination. Contamination is usually introduced by the mining process and may include machine parts, used consumables and parts of ground engaging tools. ROM coal can have a large variability of moisture and maximum particle size.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-based sorting can {{be applied}} to {{separate}} the coarse fraction of the <b>run-of-mine</b> material according to its characteristics. Possible separation criteria are grade, mineralogy, grade and grindability amongst others. Treating different ore types separately results either in an optimised cash flow in the sense, that revenue ist shifted to an earlier point in time, or increased overall recovery which translates to higher productivity and thus revenue. If two separate plant lines are installed, the increased productivity must compensate for the overall higher capital expenditure and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|Hand-counting is a {{cheap and}} easy to conduct method to {{estimate}} the liberation characteristics of a bulk sample wither originating from <b>run-of-mine</b> material, a waste dump or for example exploration trenching. Analysis of particles in the size range 10-100mm has been conducted on a total sample mass of 10 tonnes. By visual inspection of trained personnel, a classification of each particle into different bins (e.g. lithology, grade) is possible and the distribution is determined by weighing each bin. A trained professional can quickly estimate the efficiency of a specific detection and process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting knowing the sensor response of the mineralogy of ore in question and other process efficiency parameters.|$|E
50|$|The Marigold {{has been}} in {{continuous}} operation since 1988. The mine is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, United States on the Battle Mountain-Eureka trend. SSR Mining completed the acquisition of Marigold on April 4, 2014 and published a technical report in November 2014. Marigold is a large <b>run-of-mine</b> heap leach operation with several open pits, waste rock stockpiles, leach pads, a carbon absorption facility, and a carbon processing and gold refining facility. Currently the mine utilizes a fleet of 290-tonne haul trucks and three loading units. Based on the Marigold mine five-year outlook announced on September 15, 2016, for the period to 2021, the mine is expected to produce on average approximately 220,000 ounces of gold per year. The gold doré bars produced at the mine are shipped to a third party refinery.|$|E
50|$|The Morupule Colliery is a {{coal mine}} located in Palapye, Botswana, and owned and {{operated}} by Debswana, a partnership between the government of Botswana and De Beers. Founded in 1973 to supply the Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd copper and nickel mine, operations have expanded considerably since then to supply regional power plants and industries, especially the nearby Morupule Power Station. A small wash plant, with a production capability of 120 tonnes per hour, was commissioned in January 2008 to supply a higher quality coal to local and regional consumers. This project was supported by the Botswana government as a means of stimulating the local economy, producing a less polluting form of coal than the <b>run-of-mine</b> coal, and to provide an alternative to the unsustainable use of wood for cooking and heating.|$|E
50|$|Blue Coal's Huber Breaker was a {{landmark}} {{located in the}} borough of Ashley, Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, USA. The breaker was built in 1939 to replace the Maxwell Breaker which was located at the colliery. <b>Run-of-mine</b> coal arriving at the breaker was washed and cleaned to remove impurities, principally slate. It was crushed and screened to specific sizes desired by customers. Considered an ultra-modern plant when constructed, it used Menzies Cones to separate coal from waste. The breaker was operated by the Blue Coal Corporation, {{a subsidiary of the}} Glen Alden Coal Company. It processed 7,000 tons of Anthracite coal per day. The final product was sprayed with a blue dye and sold as “Blue Coal.” Railcars were loaded underneath the breaker and shipped to markets. The long decline of the anthracite industry after World War II caused Blue Coal to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 1976.|$|E
50|$|Sensor-based {{ore sorting}} is financially {{especially}} attractive for low grade or marginal ore or waste dump material. This described scenario describes that waste dump material or marginal ore is sorted {{and added to}} the <b>run-of-mine</b> production. The needed capacity for the sensor-based ore sorting step is less in this case such as the costs involved. Requirement is that two crude material streams are fed in parallel, requiring two crushing stations. Alternatively, marginal and high grade ore can be buffered on an intermediate stockpile and dispatched in an alternating operation. The latter option has the disadvantage that the planned production time, the loading, of the sensor-based ore sorter is low, unless a significant intermediate stockpile or bunker is installed.Treating the marginal ore separately has the advantage that less equipment is needed since the processed material stream is lower, but it has the disadvantage that {{the potential of the}} technology is not unfolded for the higher grade material, where sensor-based sorting would also add benefit.|$|E
5000|$|The mined ore {{is usually}} crushed into small chunks and heaped on an {{impermeable}} plastic and/or clay lined leach pad {{where it can}} be irrigated with a leach solution to dissolve the valuable metals. While sprinklers are occasionally used for irrigation, more often operations use drip irrigation to minimize evaporation, provide more uniform distribution of the leach solution, and avoid damaging the exposed mineral. The solution then percolates through the heap and leaches both the target and other minerals. This process, called the [...] "leach cycle," [...] generally takes from one or two months for simple oxide ores (e.g., most gold ores) to two years (for nickel laterite ores). The leach solution containing the dissolved minerals is then collected, treated in a process plant to recover the target mineral and in some cases precipitate other minerals, and then recycled to the heap after reagent levels are adjusted. Ultimate recovery of the target mineral can range from 30% of contained (<b>run-of-mine</b> dump leaching sulfide copper ores) to over 90% for the easiest to leach ores (some oxide gold ores).|$|E

30|$|China’s {{energy supply}} is heavily reliant on coal and this {{situation}} {{will last for}} decades to come. Now, China is the largest coal producer and consumer in the world. In 2012, China’s coal production is up to 3.66 billion tons and coal consumption accounts for 68.4  % of its energy consumption. Thus, {{in order to improve}} energy efficiency and ensure the security of energy supply, China must increase the beneficiation ratio of <b>run-of-mine</b> coal. In 2013, the Chinese government released its toughest plan so far to combat air pollution, Air Pollution Prevention Plan of Action, in an effort to ease mounting public concern over air quality. In this plan, it is clearly pointed out that the beneficiation ratio of <b>run-of-mine</b> coal will be improved to more than 70  % till 2017 and apparently, a lot of continued efforts must be made to achieve this goal.|$|E

40|$|Coal {{preparation}} {{is widely regarded}} as a cost effective method for reducing the amounts of potentially hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPPs) that occur as trace elements in the <b>run-of-mine</b> coals. Unfortunately, many existing coal preparation plants are inefficient in removing trace elements because of poor circuit design and inadequate liberation of coal and mineral matter. These problems are often difficult to correct in the absence of characterization data regarding the mineralogical association and washability of trace elements in <b>run-of-mine</b> coals. Therefore, the first step in removing the trace elements through coal {{preparation is}} to characterize the modes of association for trace elements in a coal seam. The purpose of this project was to link the occurrence of specific trace elements to the mineralogy and washability characteristics of different eastern U. S. coal seams. Detailed characterization studies were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with automated image analysis (AIA) to establish the association between different trace elements and the various components contained in coal.
