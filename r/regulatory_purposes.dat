40|$|In European Communities-Measures Affecting Asbestos and Asbestos-Containing Products (EC-Asbestos) the Appellate Body {{has told}} us that (1) in {{interpreting}} Article 111 : 4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), we must take explicit account of the policy in Article 111 : 1 that measures should not be applied 2 ̆ 2 so as to afford protection to domestic production 2 ̆ 2 [hereafter just 2 ̆ 2 so as to afford protection 2 ̆ 2]. In Chile [...] Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages (Chile [...] Alcohol) the Appellate Body {{has told us}} that (2) in deciding whether a measure is applied 2 ̆ 2 so as to afford protection 2 ̆ 2, we must consider 2 ̆ 2 the purposes or objectives of a Member 2 ̆ 7 s legislature and government as a whole 2 ̆ 2 -in other words, the <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> of the measure. Chile [...] Alcohol was decided under Article 111 : 2, but it involves the very same 2 ̆ 2 so as to afford protection 2 ̆ 2 that EC-Asbestos says we look to in interpreting Article 111 : 4. It follows from (1) and (2) that in interpreting Article 111 : 4, we must consider the <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> of the measure under review. Q. E. D. That is the doctrinal argument for the relevance of <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> under Article 111 : 4. In the ten years since United States-Measures Affecting Alcoholic and Malt Beverages (US-Malt Beverages), we have come full circle on this issue. Although I think the Appellate Body {{is now on the}} right track, their double about-face on the relevance of purpose illustrates the instability of doctrine-and the Appellate Body has not yet explicitly drawn the conclusion that their holdings in EC-Asbestos and Chile [...] Alcohol entail. I shall therefore argue from the text of the Agreement itself that we must consider <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> in applying Article 111 : 4. Indeed, I shall argue for a slightly narrower proposition-that the ordinary meaning of 2 ̆ 2 like products 2 ̆ 2 in the context of Article 111 : 4 directs us to consider <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> in the course of deciding when products are 2 ̆ 2 like 2 ̆ 2. It may not be obvious that this is a narrower proposition. But it is, since someone might argue that even though <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> must be considered under Article 111 : 4, it is not properly considered as part of the 2 ̆ 2 like products 2 ̆ 2 inquiry. Rather, the 2 ̆ 2 like products 2 ̆ 2 inquiry should focus on 2 ̆ 2 competitive relationship 2 ̆ 2, which is one element of the general inquiry into 2 ̆ 2 so as to afford protection 2 ̆ 2, while <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> should be considered only in connection with a different aspect of Article 111 : 4, the question whether foreign goods are accorded 2 ̆ 2 less favourable treatment 2 ̆ 2 than domestic goods. There is one puzzling paragraph in the EC-Asbestos report that might suggest precisely this. To my mind, it is much more natural, and more in line with the ordinary meaning of the words of Article 111 : 4, to consider <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> as an aspect of 2 ̆ 2 like products 2 ̆ 2. But in arguing for that, I do not mean to exclude the possibility of considering <b>regulatory</b> <b>purpose</b> under the rubric of 2 ̆ 2 less favourable treatment 2 ̆ 2 as well...|$|R

25|$|The first {{significant}} bank credit card sale came to market in 1986 {{with a private}} placement of $50 million of outstanding bank card loans. This transaction demonstrated to investors that, if the yields were high enough, loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market. Sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and <b>regulatory</b> <b>purposes</b> (easing balance sheet and capital constraints), {{while at the same}} time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees. After the success of this initial transaction, investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral, and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows.|$|E

2500|$|The enriched motifs {{have been}} {{proposed}} to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are [...] "optimal designs" [...] for certain <b>regulatory</b> <b>purposes.</b> For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of E. coli contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon galETK, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The feed-forward loop in the arabinose utilization systems of E.coli delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of Xenopus, the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, {{in the level of}} β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.|$|E

To investigate this role further, the spatial and temporal expression profiles of the bldA-regulated and unregulated genes within a Streptomyces colony were examined using modified genes for the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as an expression-tag. A comparative study, based on computer-assisted quantitative analysis of the GFP fluorescence, revealed {{that the presence of}} TTA codons in gfp results in a temporal delay of translation and, consequently, changed the spatial pattern of the GFP expression within a colony, especially during early differentiation. The delay of GFP expression was undetectable at 60 h post-inoculation. These results provide the first extensive evidence that the bldA does indeed play a significant regulatory role during colony differentiation...|$|R
