Under British rule prior to 1962 the regions were functional administrative units and were called provinces, headed by a Provincial Commissioner.

50|$|As the {{technology}} matured, most large printer installations were drum printers, {{a type of}} impact printer which could print an entire line of text at once {{through the use of}} a high speed rotary printing drum. It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no <b>reports</b> of friction-related <b>printer</b> fires.|$|R

Jim was taken into custody and sent to jail in Texarkana where he would die from tuberculosis on October 5, 1888. On December 15, 1888, Burrow and S.C. Brock, aka Joe Jackson, robbed an Illinois Central express train at Duck Hill, Mississippi; when the conductor reported the robbery in progress, two passengers-Chester Hughes with a Winchester rifle and John Wilkenson with a revolver-rushed to the express car where Burrow was. In his posthumous confession, Burrow claimed to have killed Hughes, who in falling knocked the pistol out of Wilkinson's hand.|$|R

It has been <b>reported</b> that monochrome <b>printers</b> and copiers from major manufacturers also include the markings.

40|$|Toxic neuropathies {{generally}} {{result in}} length dependent axonal neuropathy {{with the exception}} of diphtheria and a few toxic neuropathies. In spite of occurrence of diphtheria in India there is paucity of published reports on diphtheritic neuropathy. Arsenic neuropathy commonly occurs in Bengal and Bangladesh because of ground water contamination whereas in Punjab it is due to contamination of opium. Lead neuropathy is rare and has been reported in battery workers and silver refining workers. It produces motor neuropathy resulting in foot drop and wrist drop. Organophosphates are used as pesticides, industrial chemicals and food adulterant. Certain organophosphates such as triorthocresyl phosphate used for or oil adulteration inhibit neurotoxic esterase and result in a delayed type of axonal neuropathy. Alcohol related neuropathy is a controversial issue whether it is due to alcohol related toxicity or due to nutritional deficiencies. Indian studies have revealed that neuropathy occurs both in alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis. Hexane neuropathy is <b>reported</b> in screen <b>printers</b> and these cases highlight the need for better preventive and occupational measures. Iatrogenic toxic neuropathies have been reported with cisplatin and vincristine. Because of geographical, occupational and health related conditions toxic neuropathies {{are likely to be more}} common than reported and greater awareness is needed...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, much effort {{had been placed}} to {{integrate}} optoelectronic and electronic devices. Silicon on lattice engineered substrate (SOLES) had been developed for such purpose. As SOLES technology mature, a technological analysis is important so as to evaluate its potentials. In this report, a technological assessment will {{be done on the}} SOLES technology. This technology will be evaluated technologically and economically. The IP landscape in which SOLES would be applied is also looked into so as to ensure {{that there would be no}} infringement of intellectual properties. It has been concluded in this <b>report</b> that LED <b>printer</b> market would be a good introduction application for SOLES. A fabless company model is suggested as the start-up approach. A simple cost model had been done in this report. Cost of fabrication is expected to be reduced by 13 % by changing current fabrication process to SOLES process. On the final note, if SOLES could capture a market share in the world market of 0. 1 % to 1 %, the expected profit was projected to be about USD$ 1. 32 M over the next five years, with an expected sales of about 210 thousand unit, averaging about USD$ 264 K per annum. by Man Yin Leung.

40|$|Abstract A lung {{function}} information system (LFIS) {{was developed for}} the data analysis of pulmonary function tests at different locations. This system {{was connected to the}} hospital information system (HIS) for the retrieval of patient data and the storage of the {{lung function}} variables of patients to generate follow-up reports and to support financial and administrative management. The application programs were developed {{in such a way that}} high flexibility was obtained with respect to the patient-computer-technician interaction. The sampled data are stored on a disc to correct earlier decisions, perform recalculations and reanalyse the data for research purposes. When the measurements performed on a patient are authorized, the sampled data are deleted, except for when they are needed for future research. A distributed computer system was chosen to combine the benefits of a centralized system with those of several stand-alone systems. The main tasks of the central unit are to store collected data and computer programs, generate a final lung function <b>report</b> on laser <b>printer</b> and provide a connection to the HIS. In the satellite computers, which are located close to the lung function equipment, the signals and raw data are processed. Furthermore, the satellite computers were in use for program development and several research projects, and for the offline data processing of the lung function measurements from two other hospitals by means of a modem connection. The LFIS improved the quantity and quality of data acquisition. It resulted in an increased capacity of about 50...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Background. Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} due to acrylates {{present in the}} workplace is a disease frequently <b>reported</b> among dentists, <b>printers,</b> and fiberglass workers. Recently, {{the number of cases}} of contact allergic dermatitis among beauticians specialized in sculpting artificial nails has increased. Objective. Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic {{contact dermatitis}} due to acrylates in beauticians and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods. This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting artificial nails over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results. In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 beauticians and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32. 2 years, and 26. 7 % had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients — 2 beauticians and 1 client — presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7 / 15, 46. 7 %), 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %), and methyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %). Conclusions. Acrylate monomers used for sculpting artificial nails are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention...|$|R
