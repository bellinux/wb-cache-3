5000|$|The Voyetra-8 is a 19" [...] {{rack-mountable}} device, 3 rack units high at the face. Most {{units are}} bowed {{at the top}} and so cannot be placed below other rack mounted equipment more than a few inches deep. It is approximately 16 inches deep in the rack, and weighs around 78 lbs. Rear mounted plugs and a large heat sink make at least 4" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>clearance</b> advisable.|$|E
50|$|First and foremost, the F1 {{required}} extensive modification to its bodywork {{in order}} to gain as much aerodynamic downforce as possible. Although it retained the same carbon fibre monocoque as the road car, the entire exterior of the car was purpose built. A much longer nose and tail, as well as a wider rear wing, were designed {{in order to}} maximize the amount of aerodynamic downforce, while the wheel arches were widened in order to allow for the maximum amount of grip from the tyres allowed by the rules. Ground clearance was also changed to 70 mm front and rear, rather than the 60 mm front and 80 mm <b>rear</b> <b>clearance</b> of the 1996-spec car.|$|E

50|$|The Roadeo {{consisted}} of drivers safely driving a 40-foot (12.19-metre) bus through an obstacle course. At {{the end of}} the course, the bus had to be navigated through a row of barrels with only inches to spare before coming to a complete stop {{as close as possible to}} the finish line. The entire course was timed, and a time limit applied to the completion of each obstacle. Obstacles included simulated passenger stops, left dual turn, right <b>rear</b> dual <b>clearance,</b> offset street, right hand reverse, diminishing clearance and judgement stops.|$|R
50|$|Underbody vortex {{generators}} work {{to reduce}} air pressure beneath the car thereby increasing overall downforce. A larger rear diffuser works to increase the velocity of air exiting the underbody to further lower air pressure, in conjunction with active aerodynamic variable flaps that both reduce drag and increase downforce as controlled by a microprocessor. The increased size of the diffuser over the previous 458 requires the twin exhausts of the 488 to be positioned higher in the <b>rear</b> bumper for <b>clearance.</b>|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{classification}} {{has become}} a very important subject of study because of its importance in autonomous navigation, surveillance and traffic analysis. Classification of vehicles from the rear view is challenging because all the vehicles have subtle appearance differences from the rear view, changing illumination conditions, presence of shadows and real-time considerations. While numerous approaches have been introduced for this purpose, no specific study has been conducted to provide a robust and complete video-based vehicle classification system based on the rear view where the camera’s field of view is directly behind the vehicle. In this paper we present a multi-class vehicle classification system which classifies a vehicle into one of four possible classes Sedan, Minivan, SUV and Pickup truck when seen from its rear view. For a given geometric setup of the camera we use a feature set of Visual <b>Rear</b> Ground <b>Clearance,</b> height of the vehicle and perpendicular distance between {{the bottom of the}} license plate and bottom of the rear bumper for classifying the vehicle. Results are shown on large data-sets of freeway videos...|$|R
50|$|The MG P-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1934 to 1936. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, crossflow engine, used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the J-type Midget of 1932 to 1934, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was a strengthened and slightly longer version of that used in the J-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles. Steering was initially by a Marles Weller and later a Bishop Cam system. The two-seat car had a wheelbase of 87 inches (2210 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two seaters, but streamlined Airline coupé bodies were also made. The P-type was also available as a four-seater, a car that suffered from a lack of power and poor <b>rear</b> ground <b>clearance.</b> Whereas J, K and L-type MGs differentiated between versions with the use of numbers, with 1 indicating a four-seater (i.e., J1) and 2 a two-seater (i.e., J2), {{this was not the case}} with the P-type (or its six-cylinder sister, the N-type Magnette), and there is no clue to the type in the name.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of lactation number and months on milk yield, somatic cell count (SCC) and udder measurements in Holstein cows. In the study, 30 first lactation and 49 second lactation, totally 79 Holstein cows housing in a farm located in Nigde province (Turkey) were used. Somatic cell count and udder measurements were determined at each visit of the farm per months, while lactation milk yield of each animal was calculated using Test Interval Method. It was observed that the effect of lactation number on lactation milk yield (P< 0. 01) and SCC (P< 0. 05) was increased significantly. The effect of lactation number on udder measurements was significant (P< 0. 01) except front teat length (FTD). Influence of lactation months on milk yield and SCC was increased and statistically significant (P< 0. 01). The effect of lactation months on distance between front teats (DFT), distance between rear teats (DRT), front teat diameter (FTD), rear teat diameter (RTD) was significant (P< 0. 01). A negative correlation was found between SCC and milk yield, front teat clearance from ground (FTC) and <b>rear</b> teat <b>clearance</b> from ground (RTC). On the other hand, a positive correlation was also evident between RTD and distance between front and rear teats. Furthermore, there were positive correlation between milk yield and DFT, DFR, DRT, and FTD, whereas a negative correlation was observed between milk yield and FTC. In conclusion, cows in second lactation showed importantly increased milk yield and SCC as compared to cows in first lactation, whereas FTC and RTC decreased and other udder measurements increased...|$|R
2500|$|In December 1951, OKB-153 {{initiated}} {{the design of}} a twin-engined assault transport aircraft, designated DT-5/8 (Desahntno-Trahnsportnyy [...] – assault transport aircraft), to be powered by two Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engines, and fitted with a large rear cargo door to allow vehicles to be driven straight into the hold. On 11 December 1953, the Soviet Council of Ministers issued directive No.2922-1251 to the Antonov OKB, requiring them to build a twin-turboprop transport aircraft derived from the DT-5/8. Bearing the in-house designation Izdeliye P the resulting aircraft followed state-of-the-art practice with a high wing carrying two propeller engines, atop a rectangular-section fuselage, tricycle undercarriage with main gear units housed in pods {{on either side of the}} fuselage, and an upswept <b>rear</b> fuselage providing <b>clearance</b> of the tail unit for loading and unloading. After State acceptance trials, production was not recommended due to poor spin characteristics, directional stability and control issues, nosewheel shimmy, poor controllability when landing in crosswinds above 6m/s (12 kt) and also phugoid oscillations in all three axes which were difficult to control and made piloting the prototype tiring. As well as the aerodynamic faults, the TV-2 engines proved difficult to start with unstable gas dynamics at altitudes above 6,000 m (19,700ft).|$|R
