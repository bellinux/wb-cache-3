25|$|The first tractor biplane used {{a wooden}} {{fuselage}} {{with a small}} seat on top. The wings were covered with a Goodyear <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Latex rubber {{is used in}} {{many types}} of clothing. Rubber has {{traditionally}} been used in protective clothing, including gas masks and Wellington boots. Rubber is now generally being replaced in these application by plastics. Mackintoshes have traditionally been made from <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1885 Messrs E G Browne and J C Margetson {{acquired}} a <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth</b> mill, known as Avon Mill, {{on the banks}} of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke. The owners of the mill had been timber merchants, but had later diversified into the production of rubber goods.|$|E
50|$|By the 1880s, lens front mounted {{accessory}} shutter {{boxes were}} available, containing a <b>rubberized</b> silk <b>cloth</b> curtain (also called a blind) {{with one or}} more width slit cutouts wound around two parallel drums and using springs to pull a slit from one drum to the other. These shutters offered a wide range of shutter speeds by adjusting the spring tension and selecting a slit width.|$|R
50|$|It uses a {{horizontal}} travel, <b>rubberized</b> silk <b>cloth</b> {{focal plane shutter}} with a speed range of 1/1000 second to 1 second, along with Bulb and a flash X-sync of 1/60 second. It is 91.4 millimetres tall, 143 mm wide, and 48 mm deep, and weighs 620 grams. The body was finished in black leather with chrome trim only, although early production Pentax K1000 SE bodies had brown leather with chrome trim.|$|R
50|$|The 18-ton organ {{underwent}} $15,000 in {{repairs to}} its bellows in 2008, with the sheep skin seams {{being replaced by}} <b>rubberized</b> bellows <b>cloth.</b> The repairs were undertaken by Maritime Pipe Organ Builders Ltd. of Moncton, New Brunswick. The tubular chimes in the Swell Organ, now disconnected, were donated in about 1929 by the Ladyâ€™s Aid group of the Church. They were activated by an electro-pneumatic action and were dis-connected from the wind supply during repairs to the bellows.|$|R
50|$|Discontinued {{after the}} Civil War, the U.S. Army again issued ponchos of {{waterproof}} rubberized canvas to its forces during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Two years later, both the Army and the Marines {{were forced to}} issue waterproof <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth</b> ponchos with high neck collars during the Philippine-American War in 1900. With the entry of the United States into World War I, both doughboys and Marines in France wore the poncho; it was preferred over the raincoat {{for its ability to}} keep both the wearer and his pack dry, as well as serving as a roof for a makeshift shelter.|$|E
5000|$|A sauna suit is {{a garment}} made from {{waterproof}} fabric {{designed to make}} the wearer sweat profusely. A sauna suit is sometimes called a [...] "rubber suit" [...] because the early types were made of rubber or <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth.</b> Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated nylon cloth. The construction is typically {{in the style of}} a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants. The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment. In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the life}} of the V Series, Hasselblad {{incrementally}} updated the cameras. The 500 C gave way to the 500 C/M, the 503 CX and 503 CXi, the 501 C and 501 CM, and finally the 503 CW as the basic manual. The SWC was replaced by the SWC/M, the 903 SWC, and finally by the 905 SWC. The 500 EL's replacements included the 500 EL/M, 500 ELX, 553 ELX, and the 555 ELD. First introduced in the 500 ELX, TTL/OTF (through the lens/off the film) flash metering was also a feature of the 503 CX, which was replaced by the 503 CXi and finally the 503 CW.Alongside these 500-series cameras, a series of focal plane shutter cameras was introduced. They marked the return to Victor Hasselblad's original desire to have a small camera with fast shutter speeds (1/2000 s) and fast lenses. This 2000-series started with the 2000 FC, and progressed to the 2000 FC/M, 2000 FCW and 2003 FCW. Though much of the 20 years between the discontinuation of the 1000 F and the introduction of the 2000 FC was spent designing an improved focal plane shutter, the 2000-series again used corrugated metal foil as material for the shutter curtains, though now titanium replaced the original stainless steel. As before, the metal shutter curtains proved to be quite easily damaged by clumsy fingers, which is why all 2000-series cameras except the 2000FC have a safety feature that retracts the shutter curtains as soon as the magazine is taken off. The 2000-series cameras were replaced by the 200-series cameras (with <b>rubberized</b> <b>cloth</b> shutter curtains), which included the 201 F, 202 FA, 203 FE, and 205 TCC/205 FCC. While the 201 F was a manual control camera, the other three 200-series models added a level of metering and exposure automation to the V series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{frame and}} {{structure}} of the Silver Dart were made of steel tube, bamboo, friction tape, wire and wood. The wings were covered with <b>rubberized,</b> silvery balloon <b>cloth</b> provided by Capt. Thomas Scott Baldwin of Hammondsport; hence the name the [...] "Silver Dart". Its Kirkham engine, supplied by Glenn Curtiss, was a reliable V-8 that developed [...] at 1,000 rpm. [...] The propeller was carved from a solid block of wood. The aircraft had what is now called a canard or an [...] "elevator in front" [...] design. Like most aircraft of its day the Silver Dart had poor control characteristics; likewise, it had no brakes.|$|R
