25|$|The Safety Patrol (also {{known as}} Road Rangers, and {{currently}} sponsored by State Farm) offers free <b>roadside</b> <b>assistance</b> on Florida's Turnpike mainline and Homestead Extension. Utility trucks patrol one of 12 designated zones looking for stranded motorists {{to provide services}} such as fuel, tire changes, use of a cellular phone; and also watching out for crashes and road debris. The Traffic Management Center dispatches them to accidents, debris removal, disabled vehicles, or anything that may potentially affect the traveling public; they also assist the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) with traffic maintenance with incidents involving blockage of lanes.|$|E

The {{objective is to}} optimize responsiveness, i. e., to minimize waiting in excess of a promised response time. We study how responsiveness is influenced by modeling decisions and solution methods that arise when solving the dynamic problem by repeatedly solving real-time problems. Most results are derived using a set-partitioning based solution approach, which is shown to perform best among considered alternatives.

Cole and Smith cited one study which showed 80% of all calls for police assistance did not involve crimes, but {{this may not be}} the case in all parts of the country. Because police agencies are traditionally available year-round, 24 hours a day, citizens call upon police departments not only in times of trouble, but also when just inconvenienced. As a result, police services may include <b>roadside</b> auto <b>assistance,</b> providing referrals to other agencies, finding lost pets or property, or checking locks on vacationers' homes.|$|R

25|$|The Proton Prevé has {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in Australia. Daniel DeGasperi from CarAdvice gave the Prevé GX 2 out 5 stars. The five-year warranty, free servicing and <b>roadside</b> <b>assistance</b> {{as well as}} the roomy interior, steering and handling were well-received and complemented the Prevé's five-star ANCAP rating. However, the car was met with severe criticism in terms of its expensive pricing, poor performance and fuel economy, lackluster build quality and refinement, uncomfortable urban ride quality and detail design flaws. Daniel commented “The Proton Preve should be priced at least $4,000 cheaper, to be reasonably competitive against light sedans such as the Holden Barina and Nissan Almera. It is better than the Chery J3 that sells for $6000 less, but the Proton isn’t necessarily 35 per cent better, and it certainly shares some of the Chinese-made hatchback’s quality and refinement shortfalls.” Proton Cars Australia however responded swiftly and positively, and the Prevé GX received a major $3,000 price cut on 1 August 2013, 2 months after the review was published. The 5-speed manual and 6-speed CVT variants are currently priced at $15,990 and $17,990 driveaway, down from $18,990 and $20,990 respectively. Both variants are still offered with 5 years warranty and 5 years roadside assist, but 5 years free servicing is no longer offered and has been replaced with a 5-year capped-price servicing scheme. Nonetheless, Proton Cars Australia bills the Prevé as “Australia's most affordable small car” with all things considered.|$|E

At 7:27pm, a local woman reported a car accident on a sharp corner of Route 112 adjacent to her home.
