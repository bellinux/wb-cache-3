5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

25|$|The play The Sound of the People Victorious (Ludu Aungthan) that U Nu wrote {{while he}} was Prime Minister is about the havoc that Communist {{ideologies}} can wreak in a family. Strangely enough the first production of the play {{seems to have been}} in Pasadena, California. It later became a popular comic book in Burma, was translated into English, and made into a feature film {{at the height of the}} Cold War in the 1950s. The older generation in Burma can still <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> studied the play in their schooldays.|$|E

500|$|One thing I <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> had {{a really}} {{depressing}} effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican {{for as long as}} I can <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out in opposition to the monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E
500|$|Live Through This was a {{commercial}} and critical success, hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades. The {{success of the}} record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in {{a high level of}} publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People in 1995. At Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival— Love's first public performance following her husband's death— she appeared onstage with outstretched arms, mimicking crucifixion. A MTV review of their performance referred to it as [...] "by turns macabre, frightening and inspirational." [...] John Peel wrote in The Guardian that Love's disheveled appearance [...] "would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam", and that her performance [...] "verged on the heroic... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> felt before from any stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E
500|$|John McKay gave ex-Steelers quarterback Terry Hanratty {{the start}} against his former team, saying that Hanratty’s {{familiarity}} with the Steelers’ schemes made him the best choice. “I don’t know if I’m doing him a favor or not”, said McKay, who compared the game to Custer’s last stand. Hanratty was pulled in favor of Steve Spurrier in the second half. McKay later told reporters critical of Hanratty’s performance, “You guys should take a Sunday off and play behind our offensive line. They just poured in on us." [...] Rocky Bleier ran for 118 yards and three touchdowns, and Terry Bradshaw completed two touchdown passes to Lynn Swann. Franco Harris, with 55 yards rushing, became the fourth player both to rush for 5,000 yards in four seasons, and to gain 1,000 yards four or more times. The Steelers jumped out to a quick 21–0 lead, helped by two early Tampa Bay turnovers deep in their own territory. Pittsburgh players, some of whom could still <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> gone 0–13 after winning their opener in 1969, described the game as “strange”, but {{declined to comment on}} the Buccaneers’ play. The Buccaneers managed only 85 yards of offense against a Steeler team that needed the win to maintain their playoff chances.|$|E

Did men not like clever girls? Ought we to try to appear less clever?" [...] Whilst Owen Gibson of the newspaper said she was the [...] "school swot" [...] before she turned into a [...] "beauty queen". Columnist Felicity Cloake compiled an advice guide to attending Christmas parties for the workplace, on style she advised her readers to look to Jane for inspiration {{if they want to}} [...] "dress to impress". Josh Burt of entertainment website Hecklerspray ran a make over feature inspired by Jane's make over, he also branded Jane a whore and said he thought her make over was astonishing. He also stated: [...] "Ever since Plain Jane the Superbrain took off her glasses, smeared some slutty red lipstick around her mouth, and rubbed ice cubes on her stupid nipples, the celebrity makeover has been a must for anyone hoping to increase their fame. For those unaware, the whole Plain Jane thing happened in the Australian drama serial, Neighbours. She went from geek to whore in a matter of moments." ...|$|E

500|$|On a $25 million budget, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, [...] "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." [...] Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film. The scene featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, [...] "A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs." [...] He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing {{the outside of the}} prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I can't <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> so {{much fun}} on a movie," [...] Stephen Tobolowsky {{recalled}} in 2012 for a 20th anniversary piece about the film for Slate. He had initially scoffed at the script based on its title alone, but his agent persuaded him to actually read it, and he reconsidered. Afterward, he told his agent, [...] "Now I know what a hundred million dollars {{at the box office}} reads like." ...|$|E

He admitted to having a few drinks during World War I, [...] "Of course I've had a drink, you cannot go through two world wars without taking a drink," [...] he told the Globe and Mail but added [...] "I think I had a few on Nov. 11, 1918, but I don't really <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> any since." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Hopper {{landed a}} {{part-time}} job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines. Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s. He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study the emerging art scene there. In fact, however, he studied alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later {{he said that he}} [...] "didn't <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> heard of Picasso at all." [...] He was highly impressed by Rembrandt, particularly his Night Watch, which he said was [...] "the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it's past belief in its reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{afterwards}} recalled {{not being}} able to get a job with an NHL organization for over a decade and a half. [...] "I called the Canadiens {{at least two or three}} times [...] because I thought I could help the organization in some way, not necessarily as a coach but in some role that could be developed," [...] Bossy told Sports Illustrated in 2005. [...] They never called back." [...] When former linemate Bryan Trottier was hired as New York Rangers coach in 2002, Bossy was certain Trottier would hire him on in some capacity. [...] "The reason was," [...] Bossy said, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> umpteen conversations with Bryan, having roomed with him for 10 years, that went, 'One of these days, Mike, we're going to take a team and do it our way.' I've found out since from Bryan [...] that he wasn't going to be given that chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Love's stage attire also {{garnered}} notoriety, influenced {{in part by}} Carroll Baker's wardrobe in {{the film}} Baby Doll (1956). The style was later dubbed [...] "kinderwhore" [...] by the media, and consisted of babydoll dresses, slips and nightgowns, and smeared makeup. Kurt Loder likened her onstage attire to a [...] "debauched ragdoll", and John Peel noted in his review of the band's 1994 Reading Festival performance, that [...] ", swaying wildly and with lipstick smeared on her face, hands and, I think, her back, {{as well as on}} the collar of her dress, [...] would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam. The band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> felt before from any stage." [...] Rolling Stone referred to the style as [...] "a slightly more politically charged version of grunge; apathy turned into ruinous angst, which soon became high fashion's favorite pose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not <b>remember</b> <b>having</b> had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E
