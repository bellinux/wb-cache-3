With the recent advances of Global Position System (GPS) and computer science, the differential GPS technology now can be used for the remote displacement observation of landslide.

40|$|Abstract — During a {{volcanic}} activity, {{it is very}} dangerous to approach a restricted area. For this reason, robotic <b>remote</b> <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> would be quite useful, and it is particularly urgent for {{a country with a}} high degree of volcanic activity, such as Japan. In response to this need, our research group developed a novel multi-D. O. F. tracked vehicle, called ELF, which can conduct observation in a restricted volcanic area. The robot essentially consists of six tracks, and it has eleven actuators that change its configuration. These actuators enable the robot to assume various configurations, which increase its ability to traverse weak and rough terrains in the area around a volcano. In this research, we propose one configuration of the robot, in which the surface of the contact plane at the bottom of the track is horizontal, which is advantageous for traversing a weak slope. The feasibility of this design was verified in a field experiment on Mt. Kushigata, on the island of Izu-Oshima, and in a simulated volcanic field that was filled with pumice stones. I...|$|E
40|$|The Victorian bushfires in February 2009 {{were one}} of the most terrifying recent natural {{disasters}} in Australia. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an all–weather <b>remote</b> <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> which can penetrate through cloud and smoke to image the Earth’s surface at anytime. Hence, it is an ideal tool for change detection, and in particular for fire monitoring. This paper describes the use of ALOS/PALSAR multi-temporal images and interferometric coherence data to study the 2009 Victorian Bushfires. Two areas where several ALOS PALSAR images had been acquired before, during and after the fire period were selected for this study. Landsat TM images acquired for a similar period over the same areas were used for validation purposes. Various techniques were applied to detect burnt areas, including backscatter intensity difference, coherence analysis and Principal Component Analysis. However, none of these methods could clearly locate the fire-affected regions on their own. A combined approach was significantly better. Burnt scars extraction was carried out using Maximum Likelihood, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine classification techniques, and the results were compared to identify the best classifier – that produced the most accurate fire damage map. 1...|$|E
40|$|The coarse spatial {{resolution}} of global hydrological models (typically [*]>[*]  0. 25 °) limits {{their ability to}} resolve key water balance processes for many river basins and thus compromises their suitability for water resources management, especially when compared to locally tuned river models. A possible {{solution to the problem}} may be to drive the coarse-resolution models with locally available high-spatial-resolution meteorological data as well as to assimilate ground-based and remotely sensed observations of key water cycle variables. While this would improve the resolution of the global model, the impact of prediction accuracy remains largely an open question. In this study, we investigate the impact of assimilating streamflow and satellite soil moisture observations on the accuracy of global hydrological model estimations, when driven by either coarse- or high-resolution meteorological observations in the Murrumbidgee River basin in Australia. To this end, a 0. 08 ° resolution version of the PCR-GLOBWB global hydrological model is forced with downscaled global meteorological data (downscaled from 0. 5 ° to 0. 08 ° resolution) obtained from the WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim (WFDEI) and a local high-resolution, gauging-station-based gridded data set (0. 05 °). Downscaled satellite-derived soil moisture (downscaled from [*]∼[*]  0. 5 ° to 0. 08 ° resolution) from the <b>remote</b> <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> AMSR-E and streamflow observations collected from 23 gauging stations are assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter. Several scenarios are analysed to explore the added value of data assimilation considering both local and global meteorological data. Results show that the assimilation of soil moisture observations results in the largest improvement of the model estimates of streamflow. The joint assimilation of both streamflow and downscaled soil moisture observations leads to further improvement in streamflow simulations (20  % reduction in RMSE). Furthermore, results show that the added contribution of data assimilation, for both soil moisture and streamflow, is more pronounced when the global meteorological data are used to force the models. This is caused by the higher uncertainty and coarser resolution of the global forcing. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} improve PCR-GLOBWB simulations forced by coarse-resolution meteorological data with assimilation of downscaled spaceborne soil moisture and streamflow observations. These improved model results are close to the ones from a local model forced with local meteorological data. These findings are important in light of the efforts that are currently made to move to global hyper-resolution modelling and can help to advance this research...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} {{precision}} agriculture requires accurate methods for monitoring {{the state and}} health of crops. An additional key issue is the availability of accurate and efficient techniques for in-situ determination of soil properties. Reflectance spectroscopy, a technique which can be applied in the laboratory, {{in the field and}} from <b>remote</b> <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> has attracted the attention of scientists in a variety of disciplines. In soil science, this technology as it relates to precision farming is rapidly developing and has triggered new research initiatives. Although a number of studies are available where soil properties have been derived from reflectance spectra the approach involves substantial scaling problems when transferring methods from laboratory spectroscopy to optical sensor systems onboard satellites and aircrafts. The analysis of reflectance images also requires dealing with data having limited signal-to-noise level, being distorted by atmospheric effects and largely affected by bidirectional effects in reflectance distribution. Starting with a short review of the state-of-the-art we present the potential use of reflectance spectroscopy for retrieving useful soil parameters based on several case studies. These studies serve to illustrate the existing limitations for retrieving soil properties over large heterogeneous areas...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} new applications of <b>remote</b> <b>observation</b> satellite <b>systems</b> (RO) is the near-shore bathymetry estimation based on spaceborn multispectral imageries. In recent years, many experiments aiming to estimate bathymetry in optically shallow water with the use of <b>remote</b> optical <b>observations</b> have been presented. In this paper, optimal models of satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) for relatively turbid waters of the South Baltic Sea were presented. The obtained results were analysed in terms of depth error estimation, spatial distribution, and overall quality. The models were calibrated based on sounding (in-situ) data obtained by a single-beam echo sounder, which was retrieved from the Maritime Office in Gdynia, Poland. The <b>remote</b> <b>observations</b> for this study were delivered by the recently deployed European Space Agency Sentinel- 2 satellite <b>observation</b> <b>system.</b> A detailed analysis of the obtained results has shown that the tested methods can be successfully applied for the South Baltic region at depths of 12 - 18 meters. However, significant limitations were observed. The performed experiments have revealed that the error of model calibration, expressed in meters (RMSE), equals up to 10 - 20 % of the real depth and is, generally, case dependent. To overcome this drawback, a novel indicator of determining the maximal SDB depth was proposed. What is important, the proposed SDB quality indicator is derived only on the basis of remotely registered data and therefore can be applied operationally...|$|R

This view inhibits both students and faculty from investigation of remotely sensed data as a new source of geographic knowledge that may alter our understanding of the Earth.

Rosetta mission has provided ground-truth for the low-density and high porosity of the nucleus, without heterogeneities larger than a few meters in its small lobe [1, 2].
