25|$|Because {{a single}} ball {{is used for}} an {{extended}} period of play, its surface wears down and becomes rough. The bowlers may polish it whenever they can - usually by rubbing it on their trousers, producing the characteristic <b>red</b> <b>stain</b> that can often be seen there. However, they will usually only polish one side of the ball, in order to create 'swing' as it travels through the air. They may apply saliva or sweat to the ball as they polish it.|$|E
2500|$|Huguely and Love dated {{over the}} course of two years, but had broken up. At the Charlottesville police station, Huguely waived his Miranda rights and narrated graphic details of his assaulting Love, stating that he kicked open Love's locked bedroom door and [...] "shook Love, and her head {{repeatedly}} hit the wall". Evidence that police seized from Huguely's apartment included two Apple laptop computers, a spiral notebook, two white socks, bathroom and entryway rugs, and a Virginia lacrosse shirt with a <b>red</b> <b>stain.</b> Investigators also followed leads of domestic violence between Huguely and Love, including threatening e-mail and text messages that Huguely sent to Love post-breakup; a violent encounter between the couple that was broken up by several visiting lacrosse players from the [...] University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and an incident in which Huguely attacked Love while drunk but did not recall having hit her. An unnamed student told the New York Daily News that Huguely and Love broke up after the drunken Huguely assaulted Love.|$|E

The aliquots (150  μl) of the supernatant were measured at absorbance (OD 405 nm) in 96 -well format using opaque-walled, transparent-bottomed plates (Corning, USA) in a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 5, Molecular Devices, USA).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dermatomycosis is {{prevalent}} worldwide. Discrepancy between {{microscopic examination}} and culture findings can create {{problems in the}} diagnosis of this common infection. In this study, samples from 60 patients were processed after trypsin treatment and examined by neutral <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> to distinguish viable and non-viable fungal elements. The trypsin treatment method was compared with standard laboratory techniques. A higher number of direct-microscopy-positive, culture-negative samples were obtained without trypsin treatment. Trypsin treatment increased the isolation of fungi from clinical samples, and neutral <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> was able to distinguish viable fungal elements...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{exist in the}} site of atrophic {{non-union}} fracture. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the osteogenic potency of MSCs in order to have a better understanding of the unclear pathophysiology of atrophic non-union fracture Methods: This is an in vitro experimental study. Sample was obtained from the non-union site of a patient with a 6 -years-history of atrophic non-union fracture of right femur. The MSCs was isolated from the fracture site and was cultured in the growth medium. Confirmation of the MSCs was performed and then osteogenic differentiation was performed in mono-layered MSC grown in both home-made and commercial osteogenic media. To evaluate the osteogenic differentiation, we performed Alizarin <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> and colorimetric assay for alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Results: From Alizarin <b>red</b> <b>staining,</b> most cells in the osteoblast medium were <b>stained</b> <b>red</b> by the <b>staining.</b> The result of colorimetric assessment of ALP shows that peak concentration was reached after 4 minutes in osteogenic group and control group. Conclusion: The presence of ALP activity and positive Alizarin <b>red</b> <b>staining</b> in our study showed that MSCs stem cells obtained from site of atrophic non-union is capable to be differentiated into osteogenic cells..

For the Nile <b>red</b> <b>staining,</b> 50  μL of Nile red (9 -diethyl-amino- 5 H-benzo[a]phenoxazine- 5 -one; Sigma, USA) in acetone representing a concentration of 0.1  mg mL− 1 {{was added to the}} 1  mL of sample.
