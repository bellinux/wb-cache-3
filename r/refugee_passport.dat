Recent biographies of Adolf Eichmann, who also escaped to South America, and Heinrich Himmler, the alleged founder of the ODESSA, made no reference to such an organisation. However, Hannah Arendt, in her book, Eichmann in Jerusalem, states that [...] "in 1950, Eichmann succeeded in establishing contact with ODESSA, a clandestine organisation of SS veterans, and in May of that year, he was passed through Austria to Italy, where a priest, fully informed of his identity, equipped him with a <b>refugee</b> <b>passport</b> in the name of Richard Klement and sent him on to Buenos Aires." [...] Notorious Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele also escaped to Brazil.|$|E

Lisanevich was the person who introduced the famous dish, Chicken a la Kiev, to Calcutta as a menu item at [...] "Club 300". The club was opened in 1936 and he ran it until 1946 and then left for New York City; subsequently he came back to India. Lisanevich made friends with Prince Emmanuel Golitsyn and in 1944 met and became friends with the future Nepalese king Tribhuvan, who was in Calcutta for medical treatment. Lisanevich launched secret meetings of Tribhuvan with Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and participated in restoring Tribhuvan to power. [...] Lisanevich married a Danish woman, Inger Pheiffer (died in 2013), whom he had met in Bombay. He had three sons with Inger: Mischa, Alexander and Nicholas, and one daughter Xenia from his previous marriage to Kira. In 1951 the king deposed the Rana family from power and invited Boris to Nepal as a tourist. Then he got a job in Nepal where he managed tourism and served as a consultant to the government. The local Soviet embassy asked Lisanevich to organize a meeting for Valentina Tereshkova there.|$|E

This included speaking with her at events on behalf of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, and organising the wedding of Margaret and James Drummond-Hay, at which she was one of twelve bridesmaids in rainbow colours. In her memoirs, she tells of the butler bursting in on her while she was dressing for the pre-wedding dinner, taking no notice of her being [...] "attired in nothing but bra and panties": [...] "'Your Highness', he gasped [...] [...] [...] 'I can't do it.

50|$|As {{editor of}} the Maoist {{newspaper}} La Cause du Peuple (The Cause of the People), he was arrested repeatedly by the French police, who were determined to suppress the unrest. By 1970, with arrests occurring more frequently, Lévy and the other editors decided to turn to Jean-Paul Sartre, whom they knew benefited from protection to police harassment. Sartre responded by adding his name {{to the list of}} editors, and the arrests indeed stopped. It was then discovered by the government that the proletarian leftwing leader Pierre Victor was, in fact, a stateless <b>refugee.</b> The <b>passport</b> given to him by the United Nations was confiscated, and he was ordered to appear at the local police station once every two weeks with his relatives and a lawyer. The organisation was outlawed in 1970. As stateless and leader of an outlawed organisation, Benni Lévy was forced to clandestinity until 1973, date of the auto-dissolving of the GP. By this point, however, Lévy had developed a very amicable relationship with Sartre, who decided to make him his protégé and asked him to serve as his personal secretary, which he remained from September 1974 till Sartre's death in 1980. Sartre interceded to President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and Lévy was naturalized.|$|R
5000|$|Already in {{his early}} youth he was {{interested}} in politics. From a young age, he distributed leaflets which was called on to resist the Prussian Germanization, against the forcible introduction of the German language in Poland, now in the Prussian province. His efforts were supported among others by Rosa Luxemburg, Ludwik Warynski, Felix Dzerzhinsky Edmundowitsch and Julian Balthasar Marchlewski. When he therefore threatened with arrest, the only 18 year old fled his native Czempin (then part of the Kingdom of Prussia and later German Empire and in 1920, Poland), political opinion, first to Berlin, later on Halle to Leipzig. Trąbalski made contact with German social democrats, with August Bebel, Johann Karl Pinkau, George Schoepflin, and particularly to Wilhelm Liebknecht, he had a friendly relationship. Francis was still in the same year (1898) in the Polish choir in Leipzig, behind which was hidden because of the still prevailing socialist law, an illegal socialist organization. As Francis until the abolition of the socialist law for the courier services in neighboring Borsdorf living Wilhelm Liebknecht took over, he also met his son, Karl Liebknecht. In this organization were, inter alia, Rosa Luxemburg in 1900, Hugo Haase and Lenin, who, when he was staying in Leipzig, attended Trabalski. Immediately {{after the fall of the}} socialist law, Franz took effect on 1 October 1890 the SPD again legally operating at. With the beginning of 1891 he was also a member of the recently founded in Berlin in Germany of Polish Socialist Party (TSP). In 1901 he was persuaded by the comrades to Katowice in Upper Silesia, to move to the corner of the Three Emperors (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia). There should be contact points set up so that the working party could be activated for the PPS. Another such point of contact, he set up in Kaliningrad, has been placed in <b>refugee</b> money, <b>passports</b> and other available.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} how Palestinian <b>refugees,</b> {{deprived}} of <b>passport</b> and financial resources, {{have managed to}} leave their country of residence and enter Western Europe. One of the key hypotheses could be the following: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have reconstructed in the refugee camps and in the informal gatherings systems of solidarity based kinship and local networks. These networks, developed at a local level, have been turned into transnational networks of solidarity by migrant communities, building bridges between Palestinians in Lebanon and migrants abroad. The resources such as money, information on the destination country, legal constraints or opportunities, circulate through these networks, linking potential migrants to Palestinians settled in Europe. It facilitates their mobility, {{in a context of}} high legal constraints in Europe, and lack of financial resources in Lebanon. Because of house destruction, insecurity and joblessness, however, illegal migration from Lebanon to Europe began in spite of legal barriers. Palestinians had to organise themselves to get round those difficulties. They used their transnational resources, such as their close contacts with the Palestinian communities living abroad and the migratory networks they constructed in the eighties, to facilitate their emigration. Transnationalism developed by Palestinian refugees has to be considered mainly as a strategy to escape a highly restrictive regional environment, and more specifically in Lebanon. Migratory networks, based on family, are also one of the only resource accessible to return migrants who where forced to leave Iraq and come back to Lebanon without any international assistance...|$|R
