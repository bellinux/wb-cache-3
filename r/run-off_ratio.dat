40|$|Vegetation {{cover is}} found to be an ideal {{solution}} to most problems of erosion on steep slopes. Biodegradable geotextiles (GTXs) have been proved to provide sufficient protection against soil loss in the period before vegetation reaches maturity, so favouring soil formation processes. In this study, 500  g m − 2 jute (J 500), 400  g m − 2 (C 400), and 700  g m − 2 coir (C 700) GTXs were first installed on a 9 ° slope under “no-infiltration” laboratory conditions, then on a 27 ° slope under natural field conditions. The impact of GTXs on run-off and soil loss was investigated to compare the performance of GTXs under different conditions. Laboratory <b>run-off</b> <b>ratio</b> (percentage portion of control plot) equalled 78, 83, and 91  %, while peak discharge ratio equalled 83, 91, and 97  % for J 500, C 700, and C 400 respectively. In the field, a <b>run-off</b> <b>ratio</b> of 31, 62, and 79  %, and peak discharge ratio of 37, 74, and 87  % were recorded for C 700, J 500, and C 400 respectively. All tested GTXs significantly decreased soil erosion. The greatest soil loss reduction in the field was observed for J 500 (by 99. 4  %), followed by C 700 (by 97. 9  %) and C 400 (by 93. 8  %). Irrespective of slope gradient or experimental condition, C 400 performed with lower run-off and peak discharge reduction than J 500 and C 700. The performance ranking of J 500 and C 700 in the laboratory differed from the field, which may be explained by different slope gradients, and also by the role of soil, which {{was not included in the}} laboratory experiment...|$|E
40|$|Recently in Japan, {{especially}} in very urbanized area, a small or middle size river (the catchment size is about less than 200 kin 2) is {{confronted with the}} danger of flooding because of its short run-off time and high <b>run-off</b> <b>ratio.</b> But in river planning, {{it is not so}} easy to deal with these rivers. This is mainly due to two reasons; (1) run-off mechanism in urbanized area is very complicated because of the sewerage system (2) heavy rainfall sometimes occurs in small area and short time, so the characteristic of time and space distribution of rainfall is not well known. In this paper we study about the the time and space distribution of rainfall in urbanized area around Osaka using the data of rader raingage. We first categorize rainfall data into four types; typhoon, frontal, low and thunder rainfalls. Then for each rainfall type we analyze the DAD (duration, area and depth) of rainfall and calculate the orientation of rainfall field and shape ratio (the ratio of major axis to minor axis) assumig the shape is an ellipse. And we also apply the cluster analysis to divide rainfalls into a few typical types of group using the result of DAD analysis...|$|E
5000|$|The southwestern basins (Campaspe, Loddon, Avoca, Wimmera). These have {{a marked}} winter {{rainfall}} maximum and relatively lower precipitation variability than the Lachlan or Darling. However, {{the age and}} infertility of the soils mean that <b>run-off</b> <b>ratios</b> are exceedingly low (for comparison, around a tenth that of a European or North American catchment with a similar climate). Thus, variability of runoff is very high {{and most of the}} terminal lakes found in these basins very frequently dry up. Almost all runoff occurs in the winter and spring and, in the absence of large dams for regulation, these rivers are often seasonally dry during summer and autumn.|$|R
40|$|Adapting best {{management}} practices (BMPs) is influenced by target reduction efficiency BMP size, and BMP type. The System for Urban Storm water Treatment and Analysis INtegration (SUSTAIN) model was evaluated to determine optimal size and type of BMP with monitoring results from a commercial area and a public park in Korea. The hydrology model in SUSTAIN was tested in a commercial area (impervious area: 85 %) and a public park (impervious area: 36 %) in South Korea. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the significant parameters for total flow were impervious area Manning's roughness (IMPN) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (HYDCON); and those for peak flow were IMPN, Manning's roughness of conduit (ROUGH) and HYDCON. The observed average <b>run-off</b> <b>ratios</b> of the two study sites were 0. 59 and 0. 30 for the commercial area and the public park, respectively. In contrast, the simulated average <b>run-off</b> <b>ratios</b> were 0. 53 and 0. 22, respectively. The SUSTAIN hydrology model was also evaluated statistically by comparing observed and simulated run-off. In a commercial area, R 2, root mean square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency were 0. 68, 10. 98, and 0. 46, respectively, whereas the public park yielded 0. 74, 1. 97, and 0. 62, respectively. After calibrating the model, the BMP options of SUSTAIN (i. e. bioretention, dry pond, and wet pond) were utilized to test run-off reduction capability with 11 mm of retaining run-off depth from the commercial area and 3 mm from the public park. Monitoring data showed that 11 and 3 mm run-off storage ensured about a 50 % reduction of run-off from the commercial area and the public park, respectively. In the commercial area, average reduction rates were identically all 43. 0 % for bioretention, dry pond, and wet pond, respectively, and those for the public park were 49. 6, 57. 6, and 53. 5 %, respectively. Overall, the BMP function of SUSTAIN seemed to be reasonable for reducing run-off and {{could be used to}} design BMP to meet a target reduction goal where monitoring data does not exist. close...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen land-surface schemes {{participating}} in the project for the Intercomparison of Land-surface Schemes (PILPS) Phase 2 (c) were run using 10 years (1979 - 1988) of forcing data for the Red-Arkansas River basins in the Southern Great Plains region of the United States. Forcing data (precipitation, incoming radiation and surface meteorology) and land-surface characteristics (soil and vegetation parameters) were provided {{to each of the}} participating schemes. Two groups of runs are presented. (1) Calibration-validation runs, using data from six small catchments distributed across the modeling domain. These runs were designed to test the ability of the schemes to transfer information about model parameters to other catchments and to the computational grid boxes. (2) Base-runs, using data for 1979 - 1988, designed to evaluate the ability of the schemes to reproduce measured energy and water fluxes over multiple seasonal cycles across a climatically diverse, continental-scale basin. All schemes completed the base-runs but five schemes chose not to calibrate. Observational data (from 1980 - 1986) including daily river flows and monthly basin total evaporation estimated through an atmospheric budget analysis, were used to evaluate model performance. In general, the results are consistent with earlier PILPS experiments in terms of differences among models in predicted water and energy fluxes. The mean annual net radiation varied between 80 and 105 W m - 2 (excluding one model). The mean annual Bowen ratio varied from 0. 52 to 1. 73 (also excluding one model) as compared to the data-estimated value of 0. 92. The <b>run-off</b> <b>ratios</b> varied from a low of 0. 02 to a high of 0. 41, as compared to an observed value of 0. 15. In general, those schemes that did not calibrate performed worse, not only on the validation catchments, but also at the scale of the entire modeling domain. This suggests that further PILPS experiments on the value of calibration need to be carried out...|$|R
