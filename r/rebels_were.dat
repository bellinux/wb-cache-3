50|$|No {{effort to}} pursue the {{withdrawing}} <b>rebels</b> <b>was</b> made but when the town had been secured, a massacre of prisoners, trapped rebels and civilians of both sympathies alike began which continued for days. Some hundreds were burned alive when <b>rebel</b> casualty stations <b>were</b> torched by victorious troops and more <b>rebels</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to have been}} killed in the aftermath of the battle than during the actual fighting. Reports of such atrocities brought by escaping <b>rebels</b> <b>are</b> believed to have influenced the retaliatory murder of over 100 loyalists in the flames of Scullabogue Barn.|$|R
5|$|Geoffrey Litster was at Thorpe Market on 21 June and by {{the next}} day Despenser had reached nearby Felmingham. Hearing that the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> close, Despenser {{travelled}} the short distance from Felmingham to North Walsham Heath, where he encountered Litster and his men.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{dispatched}} Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf le Meschin to Normandy {{and then}} intervened himself in late 1123. Henry {{began the process}} of besieging the rebel castles, before wintering in the Duchy. In the spring, campaigning began again. Ranulf received intelligence that the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> returning {{to one of their}} bases at Vatteville, allowing him to ambush them en route at Rougemontiers; Waleran charged the royal forces, but his knights were cut down by Ranulf's archers and the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> quickly overwhelmed. Waleran was captured, but Amaury escaped. Henry mopped up the remainder of the rebellion, blinding some of the rebel leaders– considered, at the time, a more merciful punishment than execution– and recovering the last rebel castles. Henry paid Pope Callixtus a large amount of money, in exchange for the Papacy annulling the marriage of William Clito and Sibylla on the grounds of consanguinity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, some rebels {{took over}} a {{civilian}} hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial. Those that had escaped, including Fidel and Raúl, assembled at their base where some debated surrender, while others wished to flee to Havana. Accompanied by 19 comrades, Castro decided to set out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several miles to the north, where they could establish a guerrilla base. In response to the Moncada attack, Batista's government proclaimed martial law, ordering a violent crackdown on dissent and imposing strict censorship of the media. Propaganda broadcast misinformation about the event, claiming that the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> communists who had killed hospital patients. Despite this censorship, news and photographs soon spread of the army's use of torture and summary executions in Oriente, causing widespread public and some governmental disapproval.|$|E

5|$|Spartacus' forces then retreated towards Rhegium. Crassus' legions {{followed}} and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> under siege {{and cut off}} from their supplies.|$|E
5|$|These suppressions, {{as well as}} the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, in turn {{contributed to}} more general {{resistance}} to Henry's reforms, most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large uprising in northern England in October 1536. Some 20,000 to 40,000 <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> led by Robert Aske, together with parts of the northern nobility. Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues. Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home. Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not feel obliged to keep his promises with them, so when further violence occurred after Henry's offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency. The leaders, including Aske, were arrested and executed for treason. In total, about 200 <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> executed, and the disturbances ended.|$|E
5|$|When {{the talks}} between the rebels and the papacy led to nothing and no foreign support arrived, the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> forced to capitulate to the Ottomans.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the rebellion, most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> captured; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{gathered}} 165 revolutionaries for the mission, ordering {{his troops}} not to cause bloodshed unless they met armed resistance. The attack {{took place on}} July 26, 1953, but ran into trouble; 3 of the 16 cars that had set out from Santiago failed to get there. Reaching the barracks, the alarm was raised, {{with most of the}} rebels pinned down by machine gun fire. 4 were killed before Castro ordered a retreat. The rebels suffered 6 fatalities and 15 other casualties, whilst the army suffered 19 dead and 27 wounded. Meanwhile, some rebels took over a civilian hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial.

5|$|French {{military}} forces occupied the citadel during the French Mandate period in Syria (1920–1946). During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925, the French shelled Al-Hariqa, the area immediately {{south of the}} citadel—where Syrian <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> supposed to be present—from positions in the hills {{to the north of}} the city, and from the citadel itself. This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction. After the French Mandate period, the citadel continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986.|$|E

Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 June, {{the company of the}} 6th Battalion at Nevesinje {{reported}} that <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> gathering to attack the town; Nevesinje's Ustaše commissioner claimed that the rebel force numbered 5,000, and were led by a former Yugoslav Army colonel. About 10:00, the town was attacked from the south and southwest. In response, the Home Guard despatched two more companies of the 6th Battalion from Mostar to Nevesinje. That morning, reports also arrived from Bileća and Stolac that <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> approaching the village of Berkovići from the north, and had captured the gendarmerie post at Gornji Lukavac. About 11:30, the Ustaše commissioner for Stolac reported that 3,000 Montenegrins had gathered between Nevesinje and Stolac, and he requested the immediate supply of 150 rifles for his men. A rebel attack on the gendarmerie post in the village of Divin near Bileća was repulsed around midday. A platoon of Home Guard reinforcements and weapons for the Ustaše arrived at Stolac in the afternoon, and Bileća was held throughout the day.|$|E

5|$|The rebels had {{previously}} been completely disinherited, and their land taken into the king's hands. The Dictum instead extended a pardon, and restored land to their previous owners, contingent on payment of certain penalties that were proportional {{to the level of}} involvement in the rebellion. It was traditional to value land at ten times its annual yield, and most of the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> subsequently fined at half of this amount: five times the annual yield of their lands.|$|E
5|$|Captain Fabius {{established}} a volunteer artillery unit. According to the Austrian government, the volunteers who bombarded the <b>rebels</b> <b>were</b> {{recruited by the}} Albanian Committee in Vienna. Till the end of June1914 Dutch officers were captured by rebels {{in most of the}} central Albania. They were gradually replaced with officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July4. On July27,1914 Colonel De Veer officially tendered the officers' resignations. Soon the First World War broke out and by August4 most of the officers had returned home. The rebels captured Berat on July12 and Vlore, without fight, on August21. The last two captured officers (Verhulst and Reimers) were released on September19, 1914.|$|E
