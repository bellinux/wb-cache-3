The present study aimed to determine the impact of cultivating location, harvest moisture content (HMC), and thickness fractionation on the physicochemical properties, and cooking and sensory characteristics of <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice.</b> Four <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> cultivars (purelines: Cheniere and V 3501, and hybrids: XP 760 and XL 753) were cultivated at Harrisburg, AR and Alvin, TX, and harvested at three HMC. Rough rice lots were conditioned and a portion was fractionated according to thickness into thin (3 ̆c 1. 9 mm) and thick (≥ 1. 9 mm) fractions. Unfractioned rice and thick kernels were used for further comparison. Overall, rice samples cultivated in TX showed higher amount of broken kernels, chalkiness as well as lower amylose contents compared to those cultivated in AR regardless of the cultivar, possibly due to the greater nighttime air temperatures reported in Alvin, TX. Additionally, textural characteristics and flavor attributes were affected by the cultivating location. Increases in broken kernels, lipid content, and protein content were observed with increasing of HMC. However, cooking qualities were mostly unaffected by HMC. Finally, the addition of thickness fractionation in the process stream showed to improve rice physical quality.

40|$|Rice starch {{is one of}} {{the major}} cereal {{starches}} with novel functional properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years on the characterization of rice starches separated from different rice cultivars. Studies have revealed that the molecular structure and functional properties are affected by rice germplasm, isolation procedure, climate, agronomic conditions, and grain development. Morphological studies (microscopy and particle size analysis) have reflected significant differences among rice starch granule shapes (polyhedral, irregular) and in granule size (2 to 7 mu m). Nonwaxy and <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> starches show greater variation in granular size than the waxy starches. Rice starch granules are smaller than other cereal starches with amylose contents varying from virtually amylose-free in waxy to about 35 % in nonwaxy and <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> starches. Amylose content appears to be the major factor controlling almost all physicochemical properties of rice starch due to its influence on pasting, gelatinization, retrogradation, syneresis, and other functional properties. Waxy rice starches have high swelling and solubility parameters, and larger relative crystallinity values than nonwaxy and long-grain starches. However, nonwaxy rice starches have a higher gelatinization temperature than the waxy and long-grain starches. The bland taste, nonallergenicity, and smooth, creamy, and spreadable characteristics of rice starch make it unique and valuable in food and pharmaceutical applications. This review provides recent information on the variation in the molecular structure and functional properties of different rice starches...|$|R
3000|$|The results {{presented}} in this work confirm general observations (Webb 1991; Juliano 2003) that high AAC {{is associated with a}} slender grain, whereas rices having an intermediate amylose content most often have bold grains. We clearly highlighted that the frequencies of genotypes having a low AAC (< 21.5 %) are skewed towards low L/W ratios while the frequencies of intermediate-high amylose genotypes (> 21.5 % AAC) are skewed towards high L/W ratios. These skewings can be imputed to selection for consumer preferences: for cooking and processing, rice are conventionally classified as short-, medium- and long-grain types, and an AAC[*]≥[*] 20 % is preferred for <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice,</b> whereas an AAC[*]<[*] 20 % is commonly favoured for short- and medium-grain types (Webb 1991). The width of the grain is as much, or even more, linked to the cooking application of rice than the L/W ratio: long, thin-grain rice is typically used in applications requiring distinct shape and texture, and high amylose ensures that cooked grains are firm and remain separate; on the other hand, medium- and short-grain rice are ideal for puddings, desserts, and similar applications, and low amylose content allows to obtain cooked grains that are soft, moist and sticky. Grain width and L/W ratio are more distinctive of the cooking application than grain length because <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> with bold kernel are typically used to prepare ‘risotto’, {{and many of them are}} traditional varieties with intermediate AAC. In fact, the EU classification (see Ferrero and Nguyen, 2004 for a synoptic table of USA and EU grades) further distinguishes <b>long-grain</b> <b>rice</b> (length[*]>[*] 6.0  mm) into long A (2 [*]<[*]L/W[*]<[*] 3) and long B types (L/W[*]≥[*] 3). The former wide-grain type is used for ‘risotto’ and often has intermediate AAC, while the latter thin-grain type includes high amylose rice for oriental and side dishes, prepared entrees, rice salad and garnitures. Thus, grain width is more related to cooking applications than grain length, and then it has a better association with AAC.

Severe autoclaving resulted in different protein composition from the other treatments. Peak pasting viscosity significantly increased at the first 3 months and gradually leveled off regardless of cultivar and heat treatments. Leached solid contents were decreased gradually during storage. Autoclaving (especially severe autoclaving) samples showed more distinct characteristics on HRY, leached solids and cooking properties.
