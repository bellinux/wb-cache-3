50|$|<b>Rotours</b> was {{appointed}} governor general of Guadeloupe in 1826, arrived at Basse-Terre on 31 May, {{and found that}} the city had been nearly destroyed by the hurricane of 26 July 1825. He immediately began to rebuild it on a more elaborate plan, and, after inquiring into the wants of the colony, proposed to the king a plan to unify the colonial administration, by which the island was allowed partial self-government through delegates that formed a council general. <b>Rotours</b> also provided means to check the return of yellow fever epidemics, established a hospital and a camp for the soldiers on Matouba volcano, at the coolest station in the mountains, drained the marshes that surrounded Pointe-à-Pitre, executed great works in that harbor, completed the canal named Vatable, and also constructed in Grande-Terre several other canals, which proved of great benefit to the colony. One of these has since received the name of Canal des <b>Rotours.</b> He founded the city of Bordeaux-Bourg, erected schools, churches, and bridges, and opened roads.|$|R

50|$|Under {{the command}} of General Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle, soon joined by the duc d'Angoulême and Guilleminot, the {{infantry}} of generals Bourmont, Obert and Goujeon, the cavalry of Foissac-Latour, the artillery of Louis Tirlet and the engineers under Guillaume Dode de la Brunerie took up positions before Cádiz from mid-July. Forced to use several naval divisions for surveillance of Spain's Atlantic and Mediterranean ports and coasts (held by the Constitutionalists), the French navy was able to spare only a small squadron of 10 ships under Counter-Admiral Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin to blockade the city. That proved too small a force for Hamelin to succeed in this mission and so on 27 August he was replaced by counter-admiral des <b>Rotours,</b> then by Duperré, who arrived only on 17 September, with meagre reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in the castle of <b>Rotours,</b> and entered the French Navy, 11 June 1791, with which he took part in the {{expedition}} of 1793 to Santo Domingo, and assisted in the engagement at Cape Français, 21 June, where, although bearing a flag of truce, he was taken prisoner, but afterward released. He went on a United States merchant vessel to Philadelphia, where he was furnished the means of returning to France. He was promoted commander in 1808, and captain in 1814, and 1816-1819 made a successful campaign in the West Indian waters, for which he was created baron, 25 May 1819. Afterward he was despatched with a corvette to protect the French fisheries on the coast of Newfoundland, when a difficulty with England threatened to end in war, and was promoted to rear admiral in 1821.|$|R
