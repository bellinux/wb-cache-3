40|$|Abstract—A {{technology}} has been developed that enables robots to scale flat, hard vertical surfaces including concrete, brick, stucco and masonry without using suction or adhesives. It employs arrays of miniature spines that catch on surface asperities. The approach is inspired by the mechanisms observed in some climbing insects and spiders. The spiny foot {{technology has}} been utilized successfully on one robot, Spinybot, and is now being adapted to a larger, heavier robot, the <b>RiSE</b> <b>platform.</b> This short paper covers {{the implementation of the}} approach, focusing on the design principles and their extension to a range of platforms. Index Terms—legged robots, underactuated robot...|$|R

They build their {{house with a}} <b>rise</b> <b>platform,</b> about 3 or 4 feet from the ground, is first put up and on this an ordinary hut is erected and a thatched roof with grass or cane leaves.

Houses in the villages are built facing one another with a broad path running in the centre.|$|R
50|$|The <b>RiSE</b> <b>platform</b> was {{developed}} in Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory, Stanford University. It has twelve degrees of freedom (DOF), with six identical two DOF mechanisms spaced equally in pairs {{along the length of}} the body. Two actuators on each hip drive a four bar mechanism, which is converted to foot motion along a prescribed trajectory, and positions the plane of the four bar mechanism angularly with respect to the <b>platform.</b> For the <b>RiSE</b> robot to succeed in climbing in both natural and man-made environments it has proven necessary to use multiple adhesion mechanisms. The RiSE robot does not, but will use dry adhesion in combination with spines.|$|R

Other scenes were filmed at the town hall in Hyde and outside a pillbox attached to a former Royal Ordnance Factory in Steeton, West Yorkshire. However the cinema sequences were shot at the Davenport cinema in Stockport which was chosen due to a period Art Deco interior as well as the presence in the orchestra pit in front of the screen of a Compton 3Manual/6Ranks theatre organ on a <b>rising</b> <b>platform</b> {{to the left of the}} stage which was used in the film for scenes involving an audience sing-along to such songs as [...] "Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition" [...] and [...] "Deep in the Heart of Texas" [...] and exterior shots of the unnamed Welsh resort were filmed along Happy Valley Road, Llandudno, North Wales.|$|R

Perry gets up from the wheelchair, grabbing the little girl's hand as they run down the hallway to the exit. The doors open to reveal a garden. A man dressed as Prince Charming appears riding a unicorn, and walks to Perry with fingers crossed behind his back. Perry punches him in the face, sending him through the fence. Perry and the girl find a heart-shaped exit, and the two girls high-five. They hug each other before the little girl places something in Perry's closed fist. The little girl rides away into a suburban neighborhood on a bike with a license plate reading [...] "Katheryn". Perry returns to her dressing room and opens her fist, revealing a butterfly.

It presented a whole new image as she wore very provocative and revealing leather costumes during each show.
