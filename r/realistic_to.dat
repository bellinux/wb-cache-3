5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{named for}} the German naturalist Fritz Müller, {{describes}} a situation where two or more species have similar warning or aposematic signals and both share genuine anti-predation attributes (e.g. being unpalatable). At first, Bates could not explain why this should be so—if both were harmful why did one need to mimic another? Müller put forward the first explanation for this phenomenon: if a common predator confuses two species, individuals in both those species {{are more likely to}} survive. This type of mimicry is unique in several respects. Firstly, both the mimic and the model benefit from the interaction, which could thus be classified as mutualism in this respect. The signal receiver is also advantaged by this system, despite being deceived about species identity, as it avoids potentially harmful encounters. The usually clear distinction between mimic and model is also blurred. Where one species is scarce and another abundant, the rare species can be said to be the mimic. When both are present in similar numbers, however, it is more <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> speak of each as a co-mimic than of distinct 'mimic' and 'model' species, as their warning signals tend to converge. Also, the two species may exist on a continuum from harmless to highly noxious, so Batesian mimicry grades smoothly into Müllerian convergence.|$|E

25|$|The {{first law}} of {{thermodynamics}} is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments {{it has been}} precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An experimental result that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} that had hindered higher educational development in the past continued in 1987. Funding remained a major problem because science and technology study and research and study abroad were expensive. Because education was competing with other modernization programs, capital was critically short. Another concern was whether or not the Chinese economy was sufficiently advanced to make efficient use of the highly trained technical personnel it planned to educate. For example, some observers believed that it would be more <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> train a literate work force of low-level technicians instead of research scientists. Moreover, it was feared that using an examination to recruit the most able students might advance people who were merely good at taking examinations. Educational reforms also made some people uncomfortable by criticizing the traditional practice of rote memorization and promoting innovative teaching and study methods.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} there were {{diplomatic}} contacts with the Ottoman Empire to initiate reforms in Macedonia and in Thrace, {{which at the time}} were {{under the control of the}} Ottoman Empire, for improving the living conditions of the Christian populations. Failure of such reforms would leave as a single option to remove Turkey from the Balkans, an idea that most Balkan countries shared. This scenario appeared <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> Venizelos, because Turkey was under a constitutional transition and its administrative mechanism was disorganized and weakened. There was also no fleet capable of transporting forces from Asia Minor to Europe, while in contrast the Greek fleet was dominating the Aegean Sea. Venizelos did not want to initiate any immediate major movements in the Balkans, until the Greek army and navy were reorganized (an effort that had begun from the last government of Georgios Theotokis) and the Greek economy was revitalized. In light of this, Venizelos proposed to Turkey to recognize the Cretans the right to send deputies to the Greek Parliament, as a solution for closing the Cretan Question. However, the Young Turks (feeling confident after the Greco-Turkish war in 1897) threatened that they would make a military walk to Athens, if the Greeks insisted on such claims.|$|E

500|$|Marsden {{found that}} the Kreutz sungrazers could be split into two groups, with {{slightly}} different orbital elements, implying that the family resulted from fragmentations at more than one perihelion. Tracing back the orbits of Ikeya–Seki and the Great Comet of 1882, Marsden found that at their previous perihelion passage, {{the difference between the}}ir orbital elements was of the same order of magnitude as the difference between the elements of the fragments of Ikeya–Seki after it broke up. [...] This meant it was <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> presume that they were two parts of the same comet which had broken up one orbit ago. [...] By far the best candidate for the progenitor comet was that seen in 1106 (Great Comet of 1106): Ikeya–Seki's derived orbital period gave a previous perihelion almost exactly at the right time, and while the Great Comet of 1882's derived orbit implied a previous perihelion a few decades later, it would only require a small error in the orbital elements to bring it into agreement.|$|E

500|$|Titanic {{held the}} record for box office gross for twelve years. Cameron's {{follow-up}} film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, [...] "Two-thirds of Titanic haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" [...] and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. [...] "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, [...] "I don't think it's <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have {{come out in the}} last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord."

500|$|After the film's {{release and}} unusually strong box office {{performance}} over {{its first two}} weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. [...] "Most films {{are considered to be}} healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," [...] said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. [...] "This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation." [...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being <b>realistic</b> <b>to</b> have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E
