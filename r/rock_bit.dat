50|$|The first roller cone patent was for {{the rotary}} <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> and was issued to Howard Hughes Sr. in 1909. It {{consisted}} of two interlocking cones. Walter Benona Sharp worked very closely with Hughes in developing the <b>rock</b> <b>bit.</b> The success of this bit led to {{the founding of the}} Sharp-Hughes Tool Company.|$|E
50|$|Born in Tipton County, Tennessee, Sharp's {{mother died}} when he was eight and his father moved the family to Texas. By the age of twenty Sharp was {{operating}} a water well drilling company with his brother. Sharp began drilling oil wells in 1893, although his first attempt was unsuccessful due to quicksand. Later innovations by Sharp would allow drilling through these conditions in 1901. Sharp also developed the Sharp-Hughes <b>Rock</b> <b>Bit</b> to drill through hard rock.|$|E
50|$|The cutting {{structure}} of the bits varies according to the rock formation. Soft bits will have longer protruding teeth or chisel-shaped buttons, and fewer, more widely arranged teeth. Medium formation bits will have much closer teeth than soft formation bits, and the protrusion of the teeth is reduced. The teeth are very short and closely arranged on hard formation bits. Because of the shorter teeth the penetration of the <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> during drilling is less than with soft or medium formation bits, but the other bits cannot be used in hard strata.|$|E

5000|$|Hughes Sr. married Allene Stone Gano, on June 24, 1904, in Dallas County, Texas {{and engaged}} in various mining {{business}} endeavors before capitalizing on the Spindletop oil discovery in Texas, {{as a result of}} which he began devoting his full-time to the oil business. On November 20, 1908, he filed the basic patents for the Sharp-Hughes <b>Rock</b> <b>Bit,</b> and on August 10, 1909 was granted [...] and [...] for this rock drill. Hughes's two-cone rotary drill bit, nicknamed [...] "rock eater", penetrated medium and hard rock with ten times the speed of any former bit, and its development revolutionized oil well drilling.|$|E
50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that he actually invented the two-cone roller bit, but his legal experience helped him in understanding that its patents were important for capitalizing on the invention. According to the PBS show History Detectives, several other people and companies had produced similar drill bits years earlier. In its initial tests at Goose Creek Oilfield in 1909 where the first offshore drilling for oil in Texas was occurring in Harris County, 21 mi southeast of Houston on Galveston Bay, the Sharp-Hughes <b>Rock</b> <b>Bit</b> penetrated 14 ft of hard rock in 11 hours which no previous equipment {{had been able to}} penetrate at all.|$|E
50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, a {{drill bit}} is a tool {{designed}} to produce a generally cylindrical hole (wellbore) in the earth’s crust by the rotary drilling method for the discovery and extraction of hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas. This type of tool is alternately referred to as a <b>rock</b> <b>bit,</b> or simply a bit. The hole diameter produced by drill bits is quite small, from about 3.5 in to 30 in, compared to the depth of the hole, which can range from 1000 ft to more than 30000 ft. Subsurface formations are broken apart mechanically by cutting elements of the bit by scraping, grinding or localized compressive fracturing. The cuttings produced by the bit are most typically removed from the wellbore and continuously returned to the surface by the method of direct circulation.|$|E

Different analyzing techniques, such as X- ray diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy were applied to characterize the micro-structure, residual stress and sintering behavior. The SEM analysis indicates that diamond-diamond (D-D) direct bonding had formed in the polycrystalline diamond layer. The Raman spectroscopy shows compressive stress in the polycrystalline diamond layer is much higher than that sintered using traditional assembly...|$|R
50|$|After Walter Sharp died in 1912, Hughes {{purchased}} Sharp's {{half of the}} business. The {{company was}} renamed Hughes Tool Company in 1915, and Hughes, Jr. inherited it after his father's death in 1924. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Hughes Tool Company remained a private enterprise, owned by Hughes. While Hughes was engaged in his Hollywood and aviation enterprises, managers in Houston, such as Fred Ayers and Maynard Montrose, kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion. In 1958, the Engineering and Research Laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments, such as a direct reading spectrometer and x-ray diffractometer. In 1959, Hughes introduced self-lubricating, sealed bearing <b>rock</b> <b>bits.</b> After collecting data from thousands of bit runs, Hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in 1960; 1964 saw {{the introduction of the}} X-Line <b>rock</b> <b>bits,</b> combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets.|$|R

50|$|In 1933, Hughes Tool {{engineers}} {{created a}} tri-cone rotary drill bit, and from 1934 to 1951 Hughes's market share approached 100%. The Sharp-Hughes <b>Rock</b> <b>Bit</b> found {{virtually all the}} oil discovered during the initial years of rotary drilling, and Hughes Jr. {{became one of the}} wealthiest people in the world from its revenues. Returning to play a more central role in Hughes Tool in the 1940s, Hughes Jr. diversified the company's holdings by expanding into filmmaking, aviation, and the casino industry in Las Vegas, although his father's core tool manufacturing business remained by far the company's chief source of revenue. In 1972, by which time Hughes Tool had become widely diversified, Hughes Jr. sold the nucleus tool division and realized $150 million from the sale. In 1987, Hughes Tool merged with Baker International to form Baker Hughes, a large oilfield services company still based in Houston.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to carry}} out {{tribological}} experiments to explore the applications of femtosecond laser surface texturing technology on <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> sliding bearing to enhance the lifetime and working performance of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> sliding bearing under high temperature and heavy load conditions. Design/methodology/approach - Surface textures on beryllium bronze specimen were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation (800 nm wavelength, 40 fs pulse duration, 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency), and then the tribological behaviors of pin-on-disc configuration of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> bearing were performed with 20 CrNiMo/beryllium bronze tribo-pairs under non-Newtonian lubrication of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> grease. Findings - The {{results showed that the}} surface texture on beryllium bronze specimens with specific geometrical features can be achieved by optimizing femtosecond laser processing via adjusting laser peak power and exposure time; more than 52 per cent of friction reduction was obtained from surface texture with a depth-to-diameter ratio of 0. 165 and area ratio of 5 per cent at a shear rate of 1301 s(- 1) under the heavy load of 20 MPa and high temperature of 120 degrees C, and the lubrication regime of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> bearing unit tribo-pairs was improved from boundary to mixed lubrication, which indicated that femtosecond laser ablation technique showed great potential in promoting service life and working performance of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> bearing. Originality/value - Femtosecond laser-irradiated surface texture has the potential possibility for application in <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> sliding bearing to improve the lubrication performance. Because proper micro dimples showed good lubrication and wear resistance performance for unit tribo-pairs of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> sliding bearing under high temperature, heavy load and non-Newtonian lubrication conditions, which is very important to improve the efficiency of breaking rock and accelerate the development of deep-water oil and gas resources...|$|E

50|$|The bits are sub {{divided into}} {{different}} categories depending on soil condition.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{material}} selection, design and reliability of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> WC-Co cemented carbides (hardmetals), an extensive and detailed study is conducted with the main goal of characterizing the fracture and fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior of four hardmetal grades. Work includes basic microstructural and mechanical characterization of the materials, assessment of fracture toughness and FCG kinetics. It is found that <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> cemented carbides exhibit relatively high fracture toughness values (between 17 and 20 MPa root m) in direct association with their specific microstructural characteristics, i. e. medium/coarse carbide grain size and medium cobalt content. The influence of microstructure on the measured crack growth mechanics under monotonic loading may be accounted by considering the effective operation of ductile ligament bridging and crack deflection as the prominent toughening mechanisms. Regarding FCG behavior, it is observed to exhibit a significant Km influence. Furthermore, relative increments in toughness are maintained, in terms of crack growth threshold, under cyclic loading. As a consequence, fatigue sensitivity for <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> cemented carbides {{is found to be}} lower than that extrapolated from data reported for fine-grained grades. Crack growth resistance under cyclic loading for the hardmetals studied may be understood on the basis that prevalent toughening mechanisms (ductile ligament bridging and crack deflection) show distinct susceptibility to fatigue degradation and are thus critical in determining fatigue sensitivity.

40|$|Achieving {{the highest}} Rate of Penetration (ROP) {{with the least}} {{possible}} Bit Tooth Wear Rate (BTWR) is the aim of every drilling engineer when selecting a drilling bit. Predicting the optimal ROP has become increasingly important given the rise in expenses involved in drilling a well. This has meant that oil companies engage in a perpetual struggle to predict the optimum rock mechanical property parameters. Predicting optimal rock mechanical property parameters, specifically Rate of Penetration (ROP), has become increasingly important given the rise in expenses involved in drilling a well. The prediction of ROP from the current available data is an important criterion for reduction of drilling costs. ROP represents <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> interaction which relates rock compressive strength and bit aggressivity. ROP prediction is complex because of the numerous variables which lead to difficulties in evaluating drilling parameters. Several models and methods have been published for predicting, and therefore potentially optimizing rate of penetration. However, these models and methods have limitations, too many variables are included, their input parameters are often not readily available, and their relationships are complex and not easily modeled. Therefore, the application of Neural Network is suggested in this study. A new methodology has been developed to predict the rate of penetration using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Three case studies representing different formations in Kuwait have been conducted to investigate ROP prediction for various applications. These cases have investigated the prediction of ROP for a specific heterogeneous formation (CASE I); a semihomogenous formation (CASE II); a drilling section composed of a heterogeneous formation and for a drilling section composed of a complex heterogeneous set of formations (CASE III). Predicting ROP parameters is of particular interest, therefore finding a new method to predict ROP for the cases investigated in this study will be a valuable achievement. Application of the new network models would then be used for selecting the best parameters for an optimal drilling strategy based on field data. In addition {{to the prediction of}} ROP, several runs were carried out to predict Tooth Wear Rate (TWR) for a drilling section in case III. <b>Rock</b> <b>bit</b> interactions in the field as a function of rock mechanical property parameters was achieved by predicting ROP which relates to rock compressive strength and bit aggressivity; as well as TWR which relates to rock abrasiveness and wear resistance. History of bit runs, mud logging data, geological information, offset well bit records, drill bit characteristics, and wireline data all {{play an important role in}} the prediction of <b>rock</b> <b>bit</b> interactions in this study. Based on field data, the prediction of rock mechanical property parameters can be accomplished by the use of a neural network as an alternative prediction and optimization method. Neural network offers a new form of information processing that is fundamentally different from a traditional processing system. The system uses a knowledge base of various drilling parameters, to produce a “correlation” description of the optimal Rate of Penetration.

40|$|This {{document}} details the progress {{to date on}} the OPTIMIZATION OF MUD HAMMER DRILLING PERFORMANCE [...] A PROGRAM TO BENCHMARK THE VIABILITY OF ADVANCED MUD HAMMER DRILLING contract for the quarter starting April 2001 through June 2001. Accomplishments to date include the following: (1) DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory highlighted the Mud Hammer Project at an exhibit at the Offshore Technology Conference April 30 through May 3. TerraTek assisted NETL personnel with presentation materials appropriate for the project and a demonstration sample of ''hard rock'' drilled in TerraTek's wellbore simulator. (2) TerraTek has completed 13 drilling tests in Carthage Marble and hard Crab Orchard Sandstone with the SDS Digger Tool, Novatek tool, and a conventional <b>rock</b> <b>bit.</b> After some initial mud pump and flow line problems at TerraTek, we completed the testing matrix for the SDS Digger Tool and the Novatek hammer on 27 June 2001. Overall the hammers functioned properly at ''borehole'' pressures up to 3, 000 psi with weighted water based mud. The Department of Energy goals to determine hammer benchmark rates of penetration and ability to function at depth are being met. Additionally data on drilling intervals and rates of penetration specific to flow rates, pressure drops, rotary speed, and weights-on-bit have been given to the Industry Partners for detailed analysis. SDS and Novatek have gained considerable experience on the operation of their tools at simulated depth conditions.

40|$|During the {{reporting}} period, work continued on development of formulations using the materials down-selected from the initially identified contenders for the fibrous monolith wear resistant components. In the previous reporting period, a two-stage binder removal process was developed {{that resulted in}} prototype parts free of voids and other internal defects. During the current reporting period, work was performed to characterize the two-stage binder removal process for WC-Co based FM material systems. Use of this process {{has resulted in the}} fabrication of defect free sintered WC-Co FM bodies, with minimal free carbon porosity and densities approaching 100 % theoretical. With the elimination of free carbon porosity and other binder removal process related defects, development work focused on optimizing the densification and eliminating defects observed in WC-Co based FM consolidated by pressureless sintering. Shrinkage of the monolithic core and shell materials used in the WC-Co based FM system was measured, and differences in material shrinkage were identified as a potential cause of cell boundary cracking observed in sintered parts. Re-formulation of material blends for this system was begun, with the goal of eliminating mechanical stresses during sintering by matching the volumetric shrinkage of the core and shell materials. Thirty-three 7 / 8 inch drill bit inserts (WC-Co(6 %) /WC-Co(16 %) FM) were hot pressed during {{the reporting}} period.

40|$|The work {{performed}} {{on this program}} was to develop wear resistant, tough FM composite materials with efforts focused on WC-Co based FM systems. The materials were developed for use in mining industry wear applications. Components of interest were drill bit inserts for drilling blast holes. Other component applications investigated included wear plates {{for a variety of}} equipment such as pit shovels, wear surfaces for conveyors, milling media for ball milling operations, hydrocyclone cones, grader blades and dozer teeth. Cross-cutting technologies investigated included hot metal extrusion dies, drill bits for circuit board fabrication, cutting tools for cast iron and aluminum machining. An important part of the work was identification of the standard materials used in drilling applications. A materials trade study to determine those metals and ceramics used for mining applications provided guidance for the most important materials to be investigated. WC-Co and diamond combinations were shown to have the most desirable properties. Other considerations such as fabrication technique and the ability to consolidate shifted the focus away from diamond materials and toward WC-Co. Cooperating partners such as Kennametal and Kyocera assisted with supplies, evaluations of material systems, fabricated parts and suggestions for cross-cutting technology applications for FM architectures. Kennametal provided the raw materials (WC-Co and Al-TiCN powders) for the extent of the material evaluations. Kyocera shared their research into various FM systems and provided laboratory testing of fabricated materials. Field testing provided by partners Superior <b>Rock</b> <b>Bit</b> and Brady Mining and Construction provided insight into the performance of the fabricated materials under actual operational conditions.
