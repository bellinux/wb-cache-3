There are fully decorated surfaces with frequent <b>recesses</b> and projections with deeper niches and conventional sculptures. The decoration of the walls is subdued {{compared to that of}} the later Hoysala architecture. The walls, which are broken up into hundreds of projections and <b>recesses,</b> produce a remarkable effect of light and shade, an artistic vocabulary inherited by the Hoysala builders in the decades that followed.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} performance of deep/shallow <b>recessed</b> hybrid bearing. It is intended that, {{on the basis of the}} numerical results drawn from this study, appropriate shallow <b>recess</b> depth and width can be determined for use in the bearing design process. By adopting bulk flow theory, the turbulent Reynolds equation and energy equation are modified and solved numerically including concentrated inertia effects at the <b>recess</b> edge with different depth and width of shallow <b>recess.</b> The results indicate that the load capacity, drag torque increases as the depth of shallow <b>recess</b> is shallower and the width ratio (half angle of deep <b>recess</b> versus half angle of shallow <b>recess)</b> is smaller. In contrast, the flow rate decreases as the depth of shallow <b>recess</b> is shallower and the width ratio is smaller. Nevertheless, the appropriate design of the depth and width of shallow <b>recess</b> might well induce the performance of high-speed deep/shallow <b>recessed</b> hybrid bearing...|$|R

30|$|The {{influences}} of <b>recess</b> width, <b>recess</b> depth, and orientation {{effects on the}} step height of SiGe epitaxy are investigated. Based on these results, <b>recess</b> depth/width (D/W) ratio {{plays an important role}} in facet formation. It also influences the SiGe growth in the silicon <b>recessed</b> region. Higher D/W ratio has a higher SiGe step height. SiGe step height depends on the initial { 001 } SiGe facet length above the <b>recess,</b> in which a longer initial length has a higher SiGe sf SiGe epitaxy in the <b>recessed</b> source and drain regions provides higher compressive strain to the channel and increases the carrier mobility for enhancing transistor performance. Hence drive current increases and resistance decreases with increased <b>recess</b> width, <b>recess</b> depth, and SiGe step height.|$|R

40|$|Method {{of forming}} a {{metallic}} structure (2) in a micro-machined <b>recess</b> that {{is provided in}} a surface of a semiconductor substrate (8). The method comprises positioning a protrusion (10) of an apparatus for depositing the metallic structure at least partly inside the <b>recess,</b> thus partly occupying the <b>recess</b> with the protrusion and defining in the <b>recess</b> a gap (14) along the protrusion. The method comprises driving a deposition fluid (20) through {{the gap in the}} <b>recess</b> along the protrusion. The method comprises growing in the gap the metallic structure by depositing metal ions contained by the deposition fluid. The method comprises moving the protrusion and the substrate relative to each other so that the protrusion, while being positioned in the <b>recess,</b> moves relative to the <b>recess</b> in a direction out of the <b>recess,</b> thus giving way for the growing of the metallic structure, and forming the metallic structure in the <b>recess...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled <b>recesses,</b> the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and <b>recesses</b> {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The <b>recesses</b> are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E
40|$|A {{safe and}} healthy <b>recess</b> {{promotes}} a Culture of Health in schools by providing students {{time to develop}} socially, emotionally, physically, and academically. During <b>recess,</b> students learn and practice important social and emotional skills, such as conflict resolution, decision-making, compromise, and self-regulation. They also have opportunities for physical activity, and to engage with peers and adults who they might not see in their classrooms. These benefits make <b>recess</b> an important addition to classroom activities, not a "break" from learning that can be shortened or eliminated {{in favor of more}} instructional time. School leaders who are responsible for <b>recess</b> policies generally understand both the value of <b>recess</b> and the importance of making <b>recess</b> safe and healthy for all students, but many also report they need more <b>recess</b> staff, more equipment, and better training for their <b>recess</b> monitoring staff to realize these goals (Gallup, 2010).

30|$|Influences of {{source and}} drain <b>recess</b> {{structures}} on SiGe epitaxy growth, SiGe step height, facet formation, ID,sat and resistance performance are investigated. Growth rate of SiGe height increases with decreased <b>recess</b> width {{at a fixed}} depth of 62  nm. Under a fixed <b>recess</b> width of 96.3  nm, the deeper the <b>recess,</b> the higher {{the growth rate of}} SiGe height. An increase in the depth/width ratio of the <b>recessed</b> Si geometry may promote SiGe { 001 } growth. Upon the <b>recess,</b> SiGe step height is influenced by the initial SiGe orientation. A longer { 001 } facet of SiGe initial orientation causes a higher growth rate of SiGe step height. Higher IDsat and lower resistance can be achieved by increasing SiGe volume with wider <b>recess</b> width, deeper <b>recess</b> depth, and higher SiGe step height.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of <b>recesses</b> are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, {{but it has not}} been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark <b>recesses</b> of the globe, {{including}} the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life.

Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional <b>recesses.</b> Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in the <b>recesses</b> of walls, and, on occasion, {{the use of}} wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods.
