5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{structural}} disorders associated with point mutations of this gene {{have been described}} that cause malfunctioning of the heart, such as Type 1R dilated cardiomyopathy and Type 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

25|$|Scholarship {{believed}} until <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> Anawrahta {{commissioned the}} invention of the Burmese script based on the Mon script, c. 1058, a year after the Thaton conquest. However, recent research finds that the Burmese script had been in use at least since 1035, and if an 18th-century recast inscription is permissible as evidence, since 984 CE.|$|E

25|$|Urdu is {{secondary}} to Hindi in official use. It was only <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> Maithili was also included {{as one of}} the state's official languages, although such use of it is negligible. Presently, the Bihari languages, except Maithili, are considered one of the five subgroups of Hindi by the government of India. Surajpuri is spoken in northeastern districts such as Kishanganj.|$|E
25|$|Pre-colonial Goan history {{includes}} Hindu, Buddhists and Islamic religious phases.

25|$|Diseases of the {{gallbladder}} {{have affected}} humans since antiquity, with gallstones {{found in the}} mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE.

The existence of the gallbladder has been noted since the 5th century, but it is only relatively <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly in the last two centuries.|$|E

25|$|A {{digital divide}} was noted between {{urban and rural}} areas by the NTIA in 1999, but more <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> gap has closed. Currently, {{environmental}} racism may account for some of the disparities in Internet access between residentially segregated areas according to race. The difference in Internet access and skill level can be explained by racial segregation and concentrated poverty, resulting in restricted options and availability of networks to connect to the Internet and use of ICTs.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} whether sublanguages should be {{included}} remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language {{is made up of}} lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.|$|E
25|$|Michigan began {{competing}} in intercollegiate football in 1879.

25|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the 1977 {{television}} production with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland, featuring the National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Kenneth Schermerhorn, was issued in stereo on a CBS Masterworks 2 LP-set, {{but it has}} not appeared on CD. The LP soundtrack recording was, for a time, the only stereo version of the Baryshnikov Nutcracker available, since the show was originally telecast only in mono, and it was not until <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> it began to be telecast with stereo sound. The sound portion of the DVD is also in stereo.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2006 that nearly 60% of the Afghan population lives within a two-hour walk of the nearest health facility. Disability rate is also high in Afghanistan due to the decades of war. It {{was reported}} <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> about 80,000 people are missing limbs. Non-governmental charities such as Save the Children and Mahboba's Promise assist orphans in association with governmental structures. Demographic and Health Surveys {{is working with the}} Indian Institute of Health Management Research and others to conduct a survey in Afghanistan focusing on maternal death, among other things.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the UC campuses run {{a quarter}} system (with the {{exception}} of UC Berkeley, UC Merced, the UCLA medical school, and all UC law schools) {{while most of the}} CSU campuses operate on a semester system, with {{the exception of}} six campuses. It was announced <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> the remaining six campuses in the CSU, Cal State East Bay, Cal State San Bernardino, CSULA, CSU Bakersfield, Cal Poly SLO, and Cal Poly Pomona will all be switching into the semester system {{by the end of the}} decade.

25|$|There {{are also}} many deep and wide ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs seem too {{difficult}} for current techniques, such as the Twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are infinitely many primes p such that p+2 is prime. On the assumption of the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture it has been proven <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> there are infinitely many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most12. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are infinitely many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most246.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of sterile neutrinos—relatively light neutrinos {{which do not}} participate in the weak interaction but which could be created through flavor oscillation (see below)—is unaffected by these Z-boson-based measurements, and the existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the LSND experiment. However, the currently running MiniBooNE experiment suggested, until <b>recently,</b> <b>that</b> sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data, although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos. A recent re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the Institut Laue-Langevin has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} the convent, Lucrina {{lived there for}} the rest of her life either painting decorations for the convent or painting portraits of the princesses who were raised there. She learned how to paint from her brother, Domenico. He was a male family member who was already artistically trained, so it was common for him to pass down his knowledge onto his family. However, since she became a nun, her sheltered lifestyle provided her with limited resources to visual models, artistic training, and documentary sources to record her personal life. It was only until <b>recently</b> <b>that</b> scholars were able to gather a complete collection of Lucrina’s work since most of her work was mixed up with her brother’s work.|$|E
