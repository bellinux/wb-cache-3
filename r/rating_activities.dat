40|$|Objective: To compare daily stride <b>rate</b> <b>activity,</b> daily {{exercise}} intensity, {{and heart}} rate intensity of stride rate in children with cerebral palsy with that of typically developing children. Methods: Forty-three children with cerebral palsy, walking without (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I and II) or with (GMFCS III) an aid and 27 typically developing children (age range 7 - 14 years) wore a Step Watch™ activity monitor and a heart rate monitor. Time spent and mean heart rate reserve at each stride <b>rate</b> <b>activity</b> level and time spent in each mean heart rate reserve zone was compared. Results: Daily stride <b>rate</b> <b>activity</b> was lower in children with cerebral palsy (39 %, 49 % and 79 % in GMFCS I, II and III, respectively) compared with typically developing children (p < 0. 05), while {{there were no differences}} in time spent at different mean heart rate reserve zones. Mean heart rate reserve at all stride <b>rate</b> <b>activity</b> levels was not different between typically developing children, GMFCS I and II, while mean heart rate reserve was higher for GFMCS III at stride rates < 30 strides/min (p < 0. 05).

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the effect of}} “disconfirmation”—the discrepancy between the expected and experienced quality of the same product—on the behavior of consumers leaving product reviews in an online setting. Specifically, we posit that an individual’s pre-purchase expectation {{is driven by the}} product ratings she observes and the credibility of the review system she perceives at the time of purchases. Upon product consumption, the individual obtains post-purchase evaluation and uses this information to confirm/disconfirm with her expectation. We extend the Bayesian learning framework to model the individual perception of the system credibility as how closely the ex-ante expectation matches the ex-post evaluation. Incorporating such dynamic perception in raters ’ decisions allows us to better understand the chance of consumer engagement in sharing product experience over time. We estimate the proposed model using a rich data set comprising compete purchasing and <b>rating</b> <b>activities</b> made by 361 individuals on an e-commerce website. Our results show that consumer participation in leaving product reviews is subject to the disconfirmation effect. The further an individual’s post-purchase evaluation deviates from her pre-purchase expectation, the more likely she is to express her own opinions about the product. Our results also show that online consumers tend to be less active with respect to posting reviews as they perceive the system to be more precise over time. From simulations, we highlight 1) the dissimilar effects of disconfirmation and experienced quality on consumer rating behavior; 2) various evolutionary patterns of product ratings over time; and 3) the effect of fake, inflated ratings on subsequent rating entries...|$|E
40|$|Background Pain {{is costly}} {{and a major}} reason for seeking medical care. Our aim was to assess the {{proportion}} of people experiencing pain, and the severity of pain, at randomly selected times in a representative sample of individuals in the USA. Methods A community-based telephone survey was designed that attempted to contact about 10 700 individuals by random-digit dialling. After collecting diary information for one 24 -h period, ratings of pain on a 0 – 6 anchored scale for three randomly selected 15 -min intervals of the day were obtained. Outcome measures were the proportion of intervals with non-zero pain, the proportion of intervals with pain above 3 (the scale midpoint), and the average pain <b>rating.</b> <b>Activities</b> of those individuals who reported substantial pain were also examined. To make the results representative of the US population, sample data were adjusted with sample weights developed by the Gallup Organisation. Findings 3982 individuals were interviewed (response rate 37 %). After adjustment for weighting, 28 · 8 % of men and 26 · 6 % of women reported some pain at sampled times. Those with lower income or less education spent a higher proportion of time in pain and reported higher average pain than did those with higher income or more education. The average pain rating increased with age, although it reached a plateau between the ages of about 45 years and 75 years, with little difference between men and women. Satisfaction with life or health and the pain indicators tended to move in opposite directions. Interpretation The diary-survey methods described here could be used to study pain at the population level, and will enable the combination of pain assessments with information about activities of daily living.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Drugs with {{anticholinergic}} {{effects are}} associated with adverse events such as delirium and falls as well as cognitive decline and loss of independence. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the association between anticholinergic burden and both cognitive and functional status, according to the hypothesis that the cumulative anticholinergic burden, as measured by the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) Scale and Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS), increases the risk of cognitive decline and impairs activities of daily living. METHODS: This cross-sectional, prospective study (3 -month telephone follow-up) was conducted in 66 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards participating in the Registry of Polytherapies SIMI (Società Italiana di Medicina Interna) (REPOSI) study during 2010. The sample included 1, 380 inpatients aged 65 years or older. Cognitive status was rated with the Short Blessed Test (SBT) and physical function with the Barthel Index. Each patient's anticholinergic burden was evaluated using the ACB and ARS scores. RESULTS: The mean SBT score for patients treated with anticholinergic drugs was higher than that for patients receiving no anticholinergic medications as also indicated by the ACB scale, even after adjustment for age, sex, education, stroke and transient ischaemic attack [9. 2 (95 % CI 8. 6 - 9. 9) vs. 8. 5 (95 % CI 7. 8 - 9. 2); p = 0. 05]. There was a dose-response relationship between total ACB score and cognitive impairment. Patients identified by the ARS had more severe cognitive and physical impairment than patients identified by the ACB scale, and the dose-response relationship between this score and ability to perform activities of daily living was clear. No correlation was found with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Drugs with anticholinergic properties identified by the ACB scale and ARS {{are associated with}} worse cognitive and functional performance in elderly patients. The ACB scale might permit a rapid identification of drugs potentially associated with cognitive impairment in a dose-response pattern, but the ARS is better at <b>rating</b> <b>activities</b> of daily living...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Companies {{have for}} decades built up their {{business}} around the traditional brick-and-mortar channel. The {{rise of the}} Internet and the surging popularity of online shopping have offered rapid growth in e-commerce and embodied the emerging click-and-mortar (e. g. Target. com) or solely online business model (e. g. Amazon. com). As the focus of market moves away from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce, companies have sought to adapt best digital marketing strategies to obtain competitive advantage over their rivals. Meanwhile, the prevalence of user-generated content has given consumers unprecedented power to influence the market performance of various products and services. Such transformation has created many opportunities and challenges for modern e-businesses. It has opened several new pages for IS literature as well. In my dissertation, I intend to study the impact of digital marketing on firms' pricing strategy {{as well as on}} consumers' intrinsic behaviors in the post-Internet era. In the first study, I examine a novel hybrid pricing model, featuring both online advertising and digital promotion. Endogenizing product prices as a decision variable, I explicitly consider the implementation costs and the distribution effectiveness associated with the underlying mechanism. From consumers' perspective, cashback shopping provides an attractive saving opportunity as the prices they pay are perceived lower. Surprisingly, under some conditions the "low" post-cashback price is actually "high", relative to the level in the absence of cashback mechanism. As a consequence, the introduction of cashback may reduce consumer surplus and social welfare. In the second essay, I investigate a fundamental question: Under what conditions are consumers more likely to post product ratings voluntarily? Unlike existing literature, I follow an established theory and propose a novel approach, decomposing consumer satisfaction into product quality and quality disconfirmation. I find that the discrepancy between a consumer's expected and realized product quality has a significant impact on her propensity to share product experience. Such intension to contribute is subject to the crowding-out effect, meaning that the underlying propensity declines as more peer consumers have already shared their opinions. Furthermore, the more credible a consumer perceives the online review system, the less prone she would be to interact with the system. A series of simulations are designed to further understand: (1) the association between product evaluation and lurking behavior, (2) the evolution pattern of product ratings, and (3) the effect of review manipulation on subsequent <b>rating</b> <b>activities.</b> In sum, these investigations provide {{a better understanding of how}} information systems and IT-enabled marketing methods reshape merchants' competitive strategy and consumers' decision-making processes.

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} argatroban versus aspirin plus clopidogrel {{in the treatment of}} acute ischemic stroke. Methods　Seventy five patients with acute ischemic stroke within 48 h of symptom onset were randomly divided into two groups: argatroban group (argatroban was used for 7 days according to the instructions, followed by aspirin 100 mg per day plus clopidogrel 75 mg per day until discharge, n= 35), and combination antiplatelet group (300 mg of clopidogrel for the first day, then 75 mg daily plus aspirin 100 mg daily until discharge, n= 40). Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification was assessed in patients before treatment. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used for rating neurological deficit score of patients, and Barthel index for <b>rating</b> <b>activities</b> of daily life (ADL), and modified Rankin scale for handicap score. NIHSS was assessed one week after enrollment, while ADL and mRS assessment were recorded 3 months after onset. Brain imaging, liver and kidney function, blood routine tests and blood coagulation capacity of the patients were measured before and one week after enrollment to observe changes in hemorrhage and biochemical indicators. Drugs-related adverse events were recorded during treatment. All patients received TOAST analysis before leaving hospital. Results　 1. In both groups, NIHSS was reduced after oneweek treatment, compared with that before treatment, while ADL was improved at three-month follow-up, compared with those at admission. The results showed statistically significant difference (P 0. 05) was found between two groups. The transient ischemic attacks (TIA) disappeared in both groups. Brain imaging showed that in three patients the lesion advanced to infarction in argatroban group (total 6 patients), and two patients in the combined antiplatelet group (total 5 patients) suffered from the same change. 2. The brain imaging and measuring of relevant laboratory indicators of patients in both groups were performed again after one-week treatment. There was no bleeding events (including intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhage in other organs) or impairment of hepatorenal function (P> 0. 05). 3. In both groups, OCSP classifications ofpatients were mainly divided into the partial anterior circulation infarction (PACI), lacunar infarction (LACI) and posterior circulation infarction (POCI), while TOAST etiological analyses of patients were mainly large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and small artery occlusion (SAO). In both groups, the neurological defects were improved after treatment, and there was no significant bleeding events during treatment period. There was no significant difference of NIHSS one week after enrollment between PACI subgroups (P> 0. 05), while better neurological improvement was showed in the POCI subgroup of argatroban group. Conclusions 　Argatroban anticoagulant and combination antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel can effectively improve neurological deficit of patients, reduce recurrence rate and deterioration of the illness in acute phase, and improve patients' daily activities (ADL). Argatroban therapy showed better neurological function improvement in the posterior circulation infarction patients. As a new anticoagulant drug, argatroban is safe in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. For the patients who have infarction involving the posterior circulation, argatroban, as a more aggressive treatment, should be recommended.
