5|$|The carvings at Isurumuniya {{are some}} of the best {{examples}} of the stone carving art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Skill in arts was a respected and valued trait during this period and artists were well <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> the rulers. The Mahavamsa records that Jetthatissa II (328–337) was himself skilled in stone and ivory carving.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1877, it {{was through}} Kogălniceanu's speech in Parliament that Romania {{acknowledged}} she was discarding Ottoman suzerainty. He was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> Carol, {{becoming one of the}} first three statesmen received into the Order of the Star of Romania. The Minister also negotiated the terms under which the Romanian Land Forces were to join the war effort in Bulgaria, specifically demanding Russian reparations and indemnities.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{thrives on}} change and new experiences, and many {{handlers}} find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead {{it to find}} solutions to problems that are not necessarily <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.|$|E
5|$|The Nansouty {{family was}} ancient Burgundy nobility {{and it was}} intimately linked {{to the history of}} this region, to which it gave several esteemed magistrates and {{soldiers}} throughout the centuries. One of its illustrious members, Seigneur de Nansouty was instrumental in ensuring the allegiance of Burgundy to King Henri IV and was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> the monarch for his fidelity by being named state counselor.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> the Empress Anna for getting rid of the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E

5|$|Barring a few {{exceptions}} where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's monkey general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India.|$|E
5|$|In 1276, {{following}} their great {{victory over the}} Lombard triarchs of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines renewed their offensive in Euboea. Licario attacked his native Karystos, seat of the southern triarchy, and took it, after a long siege, in the same year. For this success, he was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek wife with a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor. Gradually, Licario reduced the Latin strongholds on the island, until, by 1278, he had seized {{almost all of it}} except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis).|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, Tucker {{joined the}} escorts {{working out of}} Brest, France. On 1 August, while {{steaming}} out to meet an inbound convoy, she received word that the group's escort, the , had been torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The American destroyer soon {{arrived on the scene}} and helped to save the survivors of the stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E

5|$|In {{organizing}} a 1952 exhibition of abstract art, Marcus lured local leaders {{to the show}} by two means. First, he solicited the donation of art from the collections of David Rockefeller and his brothers, along with those from other noted national business leaders. Second, he requested that the donors personally write letters of invitation to their Dallas colleagues, feeling that the otherwise suspect art would benefit from the imprimatur of respected figures known for their fine taste. His efforts were <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> a numerous and appreciative turnout for the show.|$|E
5|$|James Pope-Hennessy came to Banagher in 1970 {{to write}} his {{biography}} of Anthony Trollope. Pope Hennessy had published his first book, London Fabric in 1939, {{for which he was}} awarded the Hawthornden Prize and was a well-established biographer and travel writer by the time he arrived in Banagher. Among his more notable works were a biography of Queen Mary for which he was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> being created a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1960, Verandah (1964) a biography of his grandfather, the Irish colonial governor John Pope Hennessy and Sins of the Fathers (1967), an account of the Atlantic slave traffickers.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{achieved}} {{more success}} in 1999 as they finished the round-robin in fourth place, then won their semi-final, and final (both away from home) {{to take another}} championship. Hammett's achievements with the Crusaders were <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> being called into the All Blacks in 1999, {{at the age of}} 26. His first game was against New Zealand 'A', on 11 June in Christchurch, quickly followed by his first Test against France on 26 June. Hammett eventually played in the 1999 Tri Nations Series, and was selected for the 1999 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

30|$|A {{weighted}} reward criterion {{consists of}} a weighted combination of the average reward criterion and the discounted reward criterion. The decision maker can pay more or less emphasis on the long-term reward versus short-term <b>reward</b> <b>by</b> changing their associated weights. Krass et al. (1992) presented a general formula as shown in Eq. (1) to calculate the weighted reward {{in terms of the}} average reward and the discounted reward. This “weighted reward” is a convex combination of the average reward and discounted <b>reward</b> <b>by</b> varying their weights (Krass et al. 1992).|$|R

5|$|The Nazi Propaganda Ministry {{was quick}} to {{capitalise}} on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made {{for the first time}} to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made Flag Officer of U-Boats.|$|E
5|$|Theodosius was {{the first}} child of Maurice and his wife, the Augusta Constantina. He was born on August 4, 583 (according to the {{contemporary}} John of Ephesus and other chroniclers) or 585 (according to the later histories of Theophanes the Confessor and Kedrenos). He {{was the first}} son to be born to a reigning emperor since Theodosius II in 401, and was accordingly named after the previous ruler. The papal envoy, or apocrisiarius, to Constantinople, the future Pope Gregory the Great, acted as his godfather. The scholar Evagrius Scholasticus composed a work celebrating Theodosius' birth, {{for which he was}} <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> Maurice with the rank of consul.|$|E
5|$|Two {{victories}} – away to Aalborg {{and at home}} to Celtic – {{and four}} draws were enough to secure passage to the knockout phase of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners. This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto and Juventus in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Internazionale, Lyon and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with José Mourinho's Internazionale, but since United had won their group, they were <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> having the second leg at home.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Theodore Synadenos was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> {{being made}} {{governor}} of Constantinople, Apokaukos became {{head of the}} imperial secretariat, Kantakouzenos remained Andronikos III's principal advisor as megas domestikos, and Syrgiannes was named governor of Thessalonica. Around 1330, Synadenos was sent as governor to Mesembria, while in 1336, after Andronikos III and John Kantakouzenos annexed Epirus, he became its governor. In late 1338, however, a revolt broke out in Epirus in favour of Nikephoros II Orsini, the last descendant of the Epirote ruling dynasty. Synadenos was taken captive in the capital, Arta by the rebels, and remained a prisoner until 1340, when Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos campaigned against the rebels and recovered the region. John Angelos, a relative of Kantakouzenos, was installed as the new governor, while Synadenos {{was moved to the}} governorship of Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|Harlech was {{established}} with a garrison of 36 men: a constable, 30 men, including 10 crossbowmen, a chaplain, a smith, carpenter and stonemason, and Master James was <b>rewarded</b> <b>by</b> being made the constable of Harlech from 1290–93. In 1294, Madog ap Llywelyn began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales. Several English-held towns were razed and Harlech, along with Criccieth Castle and Aberystwyth Castle, were besieged that winter. Fresh supplies were sent from Ireland by sea, arriving via Harlech's water gate, and the uprising was quashed. In {{the aftermath of}} the revolt, additional defences were built around the route down to the sea. Further work was undertaken between 1323–24, following the Despenser War; Edward II was threatened in the region by the Mortimer Marcher Lord family, and ordered his sheriff, Sir Gruffuld Llywd, to extend the defences leading up to the gatehouse with additional towers.|$|E

40|$|Discounting of delayed <b>rewards</b> <b>by</b> {{pathological}} gamblers {{was compared}} to discounting of delayed <b>rewards</b> <b>by</b> matched control nongambling participants. All participants completed a hypothetical choice task in which they made repeated choices between dollars 1, 000 available after a delay and an equal or lesser amount of money available immediately. The delay to {{the large amount of}} money was varied from 1 week to 10 years across conditions. Indifference points between immediate money and delayed money were identified at each delay condition by varying the amount of immediate money across choice trials. For the majority of participants, indifference points decreased monotonically across delays. Overall, gamblers discounted the delayed rewards more steeply than did control participants...|$|R
