5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have <b>recently</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia {{was not as}} significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains {{along the length of}} Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos {{on the other side of}} the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have <b>recently</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had <b>recently</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E
