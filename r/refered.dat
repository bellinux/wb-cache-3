40|$|This work {{provides}} a high-level taxonomy {{of the field}} of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). Specifically, the taxonomy presented is not application focused {{as is the case in}} de Castro and Timmis' seminal reference on the field rather the field is presented firstly by computational paradigm and secondary by so-called thrust of research. This secondary aggregation involves the subjective organisation of work based on authors involved and the theme of the presented research. The intent of this work is to provide both a high-level overview of the principle computational paradigms of the field and provide some indication of the major works and their relationships within each paradigm. This work is not a complete bibliography rather it contains seminal and influencial works from each selected paradigm. Section 2 considers the general field of Artificial Immune Systems and provides references regarding defintinios overview of the field and conceptual frameworks. Section 3 considers those works inspired by the self-nonself principle <b>refered</b> to as the Negative Selection Paradigm. Section 4 considers those works inspired by Burnet's clonal selection theory <b>refered</b> to as the Clonal Selection Paradigm. Section 5 considers those works inspired by Jerne's immune network theory <b>refered</b> to as the Immune Network Paradigm. Section 6 considers those works inspired by Matzinger's danger theory <b>refered</b> to as the Danger Signal Paradigm. Section 7 considers those works that do not fit neatly into the selected organisation of the field. Finally Section 8 considers works that focus on the distributed concerns of the immune system.
