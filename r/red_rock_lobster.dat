Particular attention was devoted to investigating the performances of the fishery with regard to three features identified as major impacts in the literature: rationalization of the fishing fleet, change in fishing strategy in order to maximise the fisher’s profit and concentration of fishing rights and activity. On average, the fishery reacted as expected and reached its objective in terms of reconstruction of the biomass, but the overall assessment in terms of resulting profitability is not very conclusive.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the potential utility of trace elemental natural tags to resolve fine-scale stock structure and residency patterns in adult crustaceans, we investigated whether concentrations of trace elements in exoskeleton could be used to resolve capture sites of <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> Jasus edwardsii. Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, we measured ratios of Li, Mg, Mn, Ba and Sr to Ca in samples of exoskeleton from 4 pairs of inner fjord and outer coast sites in Fiordland on New Zealand's southwest coast. Water column salinity structure was characterised at these 8 sites from a 12 yr series of conductivity, temperature and depth casts. Information on capture site, sex, carapace length and moult stage was used in an information theoretic framework to assess the degree to which capture site could be statistically discriminated using trace element signatures of exoskeleton. Using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found significant differences in trace elemental signatures of exoskeleton at the scale of 10 to 20 km for 2 of the 4 fjords. In these same 2 fjords, we found persistent differences in water column salinity structure between sites. A multivariate permutational assignment test (canonical analysis of principal coordinates) successfully reclassified individuals from all 4 pairs of sites better than chance. These results indicate that trace elements can effectively be used to discriminate capture sites of adult <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> between regions with different water mass characteristics. Within these limits, trace elements of exoskeleton may prove effective as natural tags to provide valuable information on fine-scale stock structure and residency patterns for <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters...</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} Rena Long Term Environmental Recovery Programme {{commissioned}} by the Ministry for the Environment {{in response to the}} grounding of the MV Rena on Astrolabe Reef (Otaiti), an experimental study of ecotoxicological effects was initiated to examine potential effects of major pollutants discharged from or associated with the Rena shipwreck. This project {{is one of the first}} examinations of ship wreck and oil spill pollution in New Zealand. Research will aid responses to future oil pollution events such as ship groundings and oil industry pollution. The container ship MV Rena ran aground on Astrolabe Reef in the Bay of Plenty in October 2011 and discharged approximately 350 tonnes of heavy fuel oil (HFO). During the response HFO was treated with approximately 3 m³ of the oil dispersant Corexit 9500 at sea. Other pollutants associated with the Rena grounding included general cargo and other goods classified as environmentally hazardous, in particular, 560 tonnes of sodium hexafluoroaluminate or cryolite. Given the almost total absence of toxicity data relevant to HFOs, Corexit 9500 and other contaminant mixtures on New Zealand marine species, this project sought to assess the acute sublethal toxicity of these contaminants to a range of culturally, ecologically and commercially important species. Sub-adult snapper (Pagrus auratus), spotted wrasse (Notolabrus celidotus) and <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> (Jasus edwardsii) were exposed to 1 : 1000 cryolite, 1 : 10000 HFO (HFO WAF), 1 : 400000 Corexit 9500 and 1 : 40 HFO/Corexit 9500 combination (HFO CEWAF: 1 : 10000 HFO, 1 : 400000 Corexit 9500) for up to 96 h followed by recovery for up to 10 d. These concentrations and exposure durations were viewed as being environmentally realistic. Fish were necropsied and examined for haematology and accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Exposure to toxicants caused no lethality but did indicate sub-lethal effects. Measurements of blood parameters indicated two main effects in fish of erythrocyte swelling and haemoconcentration. The overall pattern of response in fish appeared to be a greater degree of erythrocyte swelling in response to the HFO WAF treatment. HFO WAF and HFO CEWAF treatments caused changes in leukocyte differential counts indicating negative responses of immunosuppression in fish. Corexit 9500 and cryolite exposure caused negligible/minimal changes in haematology in all species. Haematological assessment of Jasus edwardsii indicated immune effects of HFO WAF, HFO CEWAF and cryolite exposure as evident by changes in differential haemocyte counts. Bile PAHs in fish and <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> reached levels several orders of magnitude higher than controls. Corexit 9500 increased PAH body burden when combined with oil, however in fish it also appeared to accelerate depuration of PAHs during post-exposure recovery. Depuration was not as evident in <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobster.</b> Exposure to HFO appeared to stimulate an increase in melanomacrophages in the spleen of Pagrus auratus. Overall HFO exposure with or without the addition of Corexit 9500 caused apparent sublethal changes in haematology that mostly recovered by 10 d post-exposure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The spiny <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> （Jasus edwardsii ） is the third-biggest seafood export earner in New Zealand with {{exports from}} the wild fishery valued at just under （$NZ ） 100 million in 2004. Consequently, there is {{significant}} interest in capturing wild Jasus edwardsii pueruli and on-growing them through to a marketable size. Following several attempts to on-grow pueruli in land-based facilities the focus on lobster aquaculture research in New Zealand has switched from land to sea-based on-growing utilis-ing specifically designed sea-cages. Following experimental scale sea-cage on-growing, and in conjunction with commercial partners, NIWA have successfully run commercial scale sea-cage on-growing trials, rearing Jasus edwardsii pueruli from wild caught pueruli through to a marketable size of 200 - 250 g in 2 - 3 years. These trials culminated in the presentation of sea-cage on-grown lobsters to politicians and restaurateurs in December 2003. Following this commercial success NIWA has continued research into sea-cage design {{and the development of}} an artificial lobster diet to improve the economic viability of lobster on-growing in sea-cages.

40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of gene flow across a species range {{is a vital}} component of an effective fisheries management strategy. The advent of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers has facilitated the detection of fine-scale {{patterns of}} genetic differentiation at levels below the resolving power of earlier techniques. This has triggered the wide-spread re-examination of population structure {{for a number of}} commercially targeted species. The aims of thesis were to re-investigate patterns of gene flow of the <b>red</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> Jasus edwardsii throughout New Zealand and across the Tasman Sea using novel microsatellite markers. Jasus edwardsii is a keystone species of subtidal rocky reef system and supports lucrative export markets in both Australia and New Zealand. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed from 454 sequence data and screened across a Wellington south coast population to obtain basic diversity indices. All loci were polymorphic with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 6 - 39. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 563 - 0. 937 and 0. 583 - 0. 961, respectively. There were no significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium following standard Bonferroni corrections. The loci were used in a population analysis of J. edwardsii that spanned 10 degrees of latitude and stretched 3, 500 km across the South Pacific. The analysis rejected the null-hypothesis of panmixia based on earlier mDNA analysis and revealed significant population structure (FST= 0. 011, RST= 0. 028) at a wide range of scales. Stewart Island was determined to have the highest levels of genetic differentiation of all populations sampled suggesting a high degree of reproductive isolation and self-recruitment. This study also identified high levels of asymmetric gene flow from Australia to New Zealand indicating a historical source-sink relationship between the two countries. Results from the genetic analysis were consistent with results from oceanographic dispersal models and {{it is likely that the}} genetic results reflect historical and contemporary patterns of Jasus edwardsii dispersal and recruitment throughout its range...|$|E

40|$|Length {{frequency}} distributions {{obtained from}} the FIMS of the west coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> constitute one of data inputs into the assessment {{as well as an}} estimate of the percentage of females. The length composition of the catch for each station and leg is obtained from measurements of a sub-sample of the catch, or sometimes the whole catch is measured. Nominal length frequencies (un-weighted frequencies pooled across stations) for males and females have been used previously as inputs to the assessment model of the <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> resource. The same is the case for the percentage of females. If the sampling of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> for measurement represents a random sample from a station and the sample is representative of the size composition of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> then no weighting of the data is necessary. However if this is not the case, then the length frequencies should be weighted before pooling. This paper investigates length frequency distributions of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> by sex obtained in various ways. A method is suggested that should be used in constructing length frequency distributions to be used as an input to the assessment model. Annual estimates of the female percentage of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster,</b> weighted in a similar way to that of the length frequency distributions, are also given.

40|$|Few {{studies of}} rock-lobster diet have {{included}} analyses of mature females or juveniles of either sex. This {{study focused on}} the diet {{of male and female}} West Coast <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Jasus lalandii) in three size classes (viz. : 10 - 35 mm CL (carapace length) - small, 40 - 59 mm CL - medium and 70 - 85 mm CL - large), using visual analyses of stomach contents. The principle aims were to examine potential differences in diet between: (1) male and female rock lobsters; (2) changes in diet with size and (3) a comparison of rock-lobster diet between areas of known fast- and slow-growth rates. The primary prey items of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> are shown to be the black mussel (Choromytilus meridianalis), ribbed mussel (Aulacomya ater), barnacle (Notomegabalanus algicola), sea urchin (Parechinus angulosus), sponge and crustacean remains. There was no difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> within any size class. Bray-Curtis similarity dendograms and Multi-Dimensional scaling plots revealed differences between small, medium and large rock-lobster diets. Small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed mainly ribbed and black mussels, whereas medium <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> consumed higher percentages of barnacle and sponge. Sea urchins comprised a substantial percentage of large rock-lobster diet. ANOSIM (Primer v 4. 0) established significant differences (p < 0. 05) among diets of the three size classes. Differences in diet were also observed between areas of fast- and slow-growth rates, but these were limited to the small and medium size classes. Key prey items responsible for this difference in diet were black mussel and rock-lobster remains. The gut fullness index decreased with increasing rock-lobster size. In conclusion, {{there appears to be no}} difference in diet between male and female <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> regardless of their size. However, rock-lobster diet does appear to vary with size. The inverse relationship between gut fullness indices and size, suggests that small <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> which have a higher moult frequency, feed relatively more frequently than larger <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Diet composition plays a role in determining the growth rate of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> from different areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of sea urchin 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to sea urchin barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult sea urchins experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where sea urchin predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) sea urchins was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of sea urchins was exposed to three sizes of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> in a caging experiment, juvenile sea urchins were eaten more frequently than larger sea urchins by all sizes of <b>rock</b> <b>lobster,</b> but only the largest <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> (N 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult sea urchins. Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult sea urchins in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult sea urchins experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of sea urchins to <b>rock</b> <b>lobster</b> (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult sea urchins in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters,</b> exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult sea urchins are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of <b>rock</b> <b>lobsters</b> is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations...|$|R
