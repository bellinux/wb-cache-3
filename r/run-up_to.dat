The Black Canary Wedding Planner details the preparations; in Birds of Prey #109, Dinah and Barbara discuss the wedding (and Ollie). Countdown: Justice League Wedding Special, and Justice League #13 deal with the {{bachelor}} and bachelorette parties. A plot thread throughout is a plan by the Injustice League to attack the wedding.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{a general}} rule the {{different}} types of bowlers use similar approaches to each other. For example, Spin bowlers tend to have very short run-ups, some even approach the bowling crease at a walking pace. Medium bowlers tend to run up off a short run-up of about 10 paces or so. Fast bowlers tend to have long, rhythmical <b>run-ups</b> <b>to</b> allow them to develop momentum which adds to their ability to bowl the ball at high speeds.|$|R

50|$|Holmes came to {{prominence}} as a hard-hitting batsman for Oxford University from 1925 to 1927, also playing a few matches for Surrey {{and for the}} Gentlemen against the Players.

5|$|Robinson's first {{position}} in broadcasting was at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, {{which he took}} up while recovering from his injuries. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a television and radio producer {{for a variety of}} shows including Newsround and Crimewatch. He then became an assistant producer for On the Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> local elections.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the elections, a CH-53E {{helicopter}} crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, {{killing all}} 31 Marines and sailors, {{most of whom}} were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle of Fallujah. This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second Battle of Fallujah, the Marines faced {{three main}} tasks: {{providing}} humanitarian {{assistance to the}} hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city, retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the battle, and providing security for the Iraqi parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 January.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ways}} the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E

30|$|What {{did these}} <b>run-ups</b> mean <b>to</b> the coastal lines? Let’s take Shanwei City as an example. In Shanwei City, there are seaside scenic spots, many factories, {{warehouses}} and docks, but no breakwaters; some waterside roads {{are no more}} than 5 m high. If some tsunami like tsunami induced to Landslide S 4 occurs in NSCS, particularly in the 32 run-up splace mentioned above, the coastal production and living quarters will suffer greatly or even a catastrophe.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the 1872 election, Macdonald {{had yet to}} {{formulate}} a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that {{would be needed to}} secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E

50|$|The checks {{performed}} {{during a}} run-up {{vary with the}} type of aircraft and (to a lesser extent) with the operating rules under which the flight is being conducted, e.g., Instrument Flight Rules, Visual Flight Rules, operation as a commercial carrier or private pilot, and so on. The term <b>run-up</b> alludes <b>to</b> engine checks that involve temporarily advancing the throttles to ensure that engines are capable of producing take-off thrust, although not all run-up procedures involve such checks.|$|R

25|$|As in all mercury-based {{gas-filled}} tubes, {{mercury is}} slowly adsorbed onto the glass, phosphor, and tube electrodes throughout {{the life of}} the lamp, until it can no longer function. Loss of mercury will take over from failure of the phosphor in some lamps. The failure symptoms are similar, except loss of mercury initially causes an extended <b>run-up</b> time <b>to</b> full light output, and finally causes the lamp to glow a dim pink when the mercury runs out and the argon base gas takes over as the primary discharge.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again {{seen in the}} <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time {{it appeared that the}} dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E
5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy {{emerged as}} one of the world's fastest {{recovering}} economies with high competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E
500|$|Construction on NIF {{completed}} in 2009 {{and it began}} a lengthy series of <b>run-up</b> tests <b>to</b> bring it to full power.

NIF failed in this goal, with fusion performance that was well below ignition levels and differing considerably from predictions. With the problem of ignition unsolved, the LIFE project was canceled in 2013.|$|R
50|$|When using run-up {{enhancements}} {{like the}} multi-slope run-up, where {{a portion of}} the converter's resolution is resolved during the run-up phase, it is possible to eliminate the run-down phase altogether by using a second type of analog-to-digital converter. At the end of the run-up phase of a multi-slope run-up conversion, there will still be an unknown amount of charge remaining on the integrator's capacitor. Instead of using a traditional run-down phase to determine this unknown charge, the unknown voltage can be converted directly by a second converter and combined with the result from the <b>run-up</b> phase <b>to</b> determine the unknown input voltage.|$|R
50|$|The {{easing of}} credit also coincided with {{spectacular}} stock market <b>run-ups</b> from 1999 <b>to</b> 2000. The NASDAQ, {{at less than}} 800 points in 1994, surged to over 5,000 in March 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial Index traded at roughly 2,000 points in 1990 and 4,000 in 1995, nearly tripled to over 11,000 by mid-2000.|$|R
