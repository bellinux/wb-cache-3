Theoretical part sketches out general concept of foreign exchange reserves and how to understand them in a balance sheet. Additionally, it shows their purpose in foreign exchange rate systems which are more detailed described bellow and what influence they have on performance of national bank. Practical part shows a development of foreign exchange reserves of Czech National Bank since 1993. First, due to fixed foreign exchange rate and then since 2013 due to intervention of Czech National Bank, it accumulated a huge amount of foreign exchange reserves in its balance sheet. That was the cause of open foreign exchange position. The thesis analyses the relation between foreign exchange reserves and performance of Czech National Bank, which hugely depends on <b>revaluation</b> <b>differences</b> of foreign exchange reserves. It also focuses on a dilemma, whether it truly is a problem for Czech National Bank to suffer a loss from expected appreciation of Czech Koruna after leaving the intervention obligation...|$|E

This study includes a sample of 239 buildings from a district from Romania. Buildings belong to 67 shares companys. The period we have analyzes is between 2008 to 2011 but we have also used data about the past years of revaluation in order to establish the differences. The study involves observing the values fluctuations of buildings during financial crisis. To measure buildings fluctuations we have used fair value obtained during revaluation and inventory value recorded before revaluation, also used as imposable value. Having this two important values, we have compared them in order to observe if exists an increase or a decrease during the years of financial crisis. We have followed the evolution of <b>revaluation</b> <b>differences</b> whithin years and values observing both apreciations and depreciations. Also, we have analysed the periodicity with which buildings are revaluated and its importance over the taxation. Results show {{that the majority of the}} buildings have experienced a decrease from initial value in the period when our country passed through the famous crisis. In the years following the crisis buildings values have increased slightly, most registering increases up to 25 %. Also, it shows that most companies which make reassessments of buildings, usually are done at 3 years to pay a minimum tax...|$|E
40|$|Asset {{revaluation}} {{can trigger}} different signals to investors depending upon company type, asset intensity and category and investors’ expectations. In the same time, motivations behind asset revaluation decisions are diverse, being influenced by management incentives, credit covenants, faithful representation {{and various other}} reasons. In many cases the revaluation decision is imposed upon the company by auditors or the need to reduce information asymmetry. In Romania, {{one of the main}} decision drivers is the Fiscal Code, due to buildings taxation provisions. For companies that revaluate their fixed assets for taxation purposes only (which is the case for most small companies in Romania), the primary concern is to reduce the fiscal impact – the preferred scenario in this case is most likely to be the one that reduces tax expenses. Our research aims to provide a full picture of the motivations behind the revaluation decision and point to the manipulation instruments made available to companies by the allowed alternatives in what regards (1) which assets to be revalued and (2) how to recalculate book values. By means of a case study we identify the options available to a revaluating company and show how each one can impact the financial statements and financial ratios, thus influencing financial statement users’ perception. Our analysis is limited to fixed assets revaluation, as these are the ones revaluated by most Romanian companies. The comparative analysis shows that the decision to not revaluate certain assets categories can lead to serious distortions of the faithful image. Financial ratios can be significantly impacted by the type of assets revalued, depending upon the revaluation direction (upward or downward) and the <b>revaluation</b> <b>differences.</b> In upward revaluation leverage ratios and solvency can improve, leading to a better position in relation to credit covenants. Equity is also positively affected. Alternatively, a decrease of assets’ value will be reflected in a negative manner upon these indicators, which might be a serious reason for a company to not revaluate, thus not preserving the true and fair value of assets in the financial statements. Companies can choose between two alternatives of recalculating book values and depreciation. The option taken can also influence the company’s financial position. Our study shows that impact over profitability is lower and that profit tax is not affected in a significant manner even if an influence can be identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{accounting}} depreciation is an older concern of this study's authors on the incidence over the true and fair {{view of the}} earning and the net value of the non- current assets. Proceeding from the consideration that the present depreciation methods, acknowleged by the accounting standards and regulations are not sufficient to render the reality of the irreversible impairment of the fixed assets nor that of the material and immaterial investment recovery we performed a research on the indicators reported by 20 companies in Cluj county and we applied a questionnaire to each entity on the depreciation methods used, their incidence on the {{true and fair view}} and their proposals for the completion of the depreciation methods. The objective of the research is to identify the most appropriate depreciation methods, truthfully illustrating the effects of the irreversible impairment on the net asset and on the earning, to introduce the excluded assests in the cathegory of the non-current assets (like property and plant, goodwill, intangible assets created with ones own strengths) and the enforcement of appropriate treatments to the <b>revaluation</b> <b>differences</b> and their own overhead investments. The International Accounting Standard IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment refers to three depreciation methods: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the technical depreciation method (units of production method). In Romania only two of these methods are accepted: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the accelerated method was additionally instilled, which is used internationally in exceptional situations and not currently. The results of the research led us to the following conclusions: - for the depreciation of the machinery, facilities and technological equipments it is recommended to use the technical depreciation method or the units of production method; -taking into consideration the financial conception on the non-current assets the depreciation of all cathegories of tangible and intangible assets is recommended, the purpose being the gradual recovery of the investment in these assets and not the covering of the wear and tear or obsolescence; - the surplus value resulted from the revaluation of the tangible assets musn't be depreciated because it generates in fictional expenses; - the depreciation of the overhead assets musn't be acknowledged as an expense but it should be treated as a reduction in the income resulting from fixed assets; -the completion of the depreciation concept with its financial meaning, namely the process of recovering the investments in tangible and intangible assets; The application of the research results leads to correcting the image provided by financial reportings on the tangible and intangible assets contribution to the income, the depreciation's reflection in the expenses and the net value of these assets. The contribution of the authors consists in interceding to ensure the application of the research results by modifying and completing the national accounting rules in order to achieve accounting's consecrated objective: reproducing a true and fair view on the financial position and performances. These issues have not been addressed in other specialty studies in the country or abroad...|$|E
