40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that forest {{ecosystems}} can potentially mitigate the impact of climate change, the carbon balance of managed forests has caught the attention of a large scientific community. Some authors conclude that extending rotation lengths would actually favour the climate change mitigation effect since more carbon would be stored in the biomass on the average. However, when the occurrence of catastrophic disturbances such as windstorms is not considered, the advantage of extending the <b>rotation</b> <b>length</b> might be overestimated for some species. In this study, we addressed this issue by coupling a growth model, a windstorm damage model and a carbon assessment tool. The evolution of an even-aged European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand was simulated under three different rotation lengths. Simulations including stochastic windstorm events were run and compared with deterministic simulations with no catastrophic disturbance. Our results indicate that when disturbances caused by storms were not taken into account, the carbon balance was actually overestimated in some cases and that this overestimation increased with the <b>rotation</b> <b>length.</b> In our case study, omitting windstorm damage resulted in an overestimation as large as 8 % for the longer <b>rotation</b> <b>length.</b> Nevertheless, when windstorm damage was taken into account in the simulation, the longer <b>rotation</b> <b>length</b> still stored more carbon on the average than shorter rotation lengths.

Three harvesting intensities and four <b>rotation</b> <b>lengths</b> were investigated. Results suggest that intensive harvesting regimes (e. g. whole-tree harvesting (WTH)) would decrease total ecosystem C, soil C storage, and N availability, compared with conventional harvesting (CH). Harvested biomass would increase with increasing harvesting intensity. Net loss of forest productivity (indicated by above-ground biomass) would be higher in higher productivity {{stands in the}} low boreal ecoclimatic region. For a given harvesting intensity, total ecosystem C stock and N availability would be highest with long rotations (120 years) and reduced under shorter rotations (60 and 30 year). Extremely short rotations (i. e. 30 year) would reduce boreal forest productivity {{by as much as}} 65 %.

Outputs from five carbon (C) pools were considered: merchantable stemwood (stump height of 30 cm, minimum DBH of 9 cm and a minimum top diameter of 7 cm), deadwood, soil C, total ecosystem C and cumulative total ecosystem C emissions. Yield curves strongly affected the predicted size of all five pools. Longer <b>rotation</b> <b>lengths</b> led to larger pools with the relative differences between <b>rotation</b> <b>lengths</b> varying with stand types. Pools associated with poplar were usually the largest while those of jack pine on shallow sites were generally the smallest. When compared to the starting point of the simulations, cumulative total ecosystem C and C emissions increased with the 100 - and 250 -year harvest rotations (HARV 100 and HARV 250, respectively) and declined with the 50 -year harvest rotation (HARV 50). Fire disturbances resulted in stable pools of cumulative ecosystem C and declines in C emissions. CBM-CFS 3 provided realistic pool values but the authors suggest further development of the model depiction of ecosystem processes, especially with respect to the treatment of respiration.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} and contrasts {{two main}} roles of forestry {{in light of}} the debate on the global climate. As the main problem is related to the increases of the CO 2 -concentration in the atmosphere, forests may be viewed as part of the alleviation of the problem through their function as (i) carbon storage, since a growing forest extracts atmospheric CO 2 and fixes it as carbon in biomass, and as (ii) a source of biomass for energy production, which may replace fossil fuels and thus reduce CO 2 -emissions. The addition of the carbon storage value to the traditional focus on the forest's timber value is well known in the economics' literature, and it's main effect is to increase the <b>rotation</b> <b>length</b> of the forestry. In this paper we also add the value of forests as source of bioenergy and discuss the effect of this addition on the optimal <b>rotation</b> <b>length</b> within the traditional Faustmann model.

Compared to equivalent fossil chains, all eucalyptus scenarios achieved savings of fossil energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the 80 - 90 % range, and had generally lower impacts, except for eutrophication. The 3 year rotation scenario was the most energy and GHG-intensive, whereas manual felling for the longer rotations resulted in twofold larger photochemical ozone impacts compared to the other scenarios. Transportation of wood chips and fertilization were the top two contributors to the impacts, the latter being more important with the shorter <b>rotation</b> <b>lengths</b> due to the evergreen character of eucalyptus. The possibility of including ecosystem carbon dynamics was also investigated, by translating the temporary sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 in the above and belowground biomass of eucalyptus as CO 2 savings using various published equivalence factors.

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{growth rates of}} most tree species in Sweden is {{expected}} to increase in the near future as a result of climate change, increased risks of damage by storms and various pests and pathogens, notably root rot and bark beetles, may also occur. Thus, forest management practices such as changes to thinning regimes, reductions in <b>rotation</b> <b>lengths,</b> and switching to other species (native or exotic) may represent adaptive management strategies to increase the resistance and resilience of Swedish forests to climate change. Clearly, thorough analyses examining the effects of anticipated climatic changes on damage levels, and the potentially relieving effects of possible management adaptations are needed before implementing such changes. In this study, damage caused by storms, root rot and bark beetles (single and in various combinations) under selected climate and management scenarios were simulated in Norway spruce (Pice abies L.

40|$|Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. {{has been}} widely planted in {{subtropical}} China to meet increasing timber demands, leading to short-rotation practices that deplete soil nutrients. However, increased nitrogen (N) deposition offsets soil N depletion. While long-term experimental data investigating the coupled effects related to short rotation practices and increasing N deposition are scarce, applying model simulations may yield insights. In this study, the CenW 3. 1 model was validated and parameterized using data from pure C. lanceolata plantations. The model was then used to simulate various changes in long-term productivity. Results indicated that responses of productivity of C. lanceolata plantation to increased N deposition were more related to stand age than N addition, depending on the proportion and age of growing forests. Our results have also shown a rapid peak in growth and N dynamics. The peak is reached sooner and is higher under higher level of N deposition. Short rotation lengths had a greater effect on productivity and N dynamics than high N deposition levels. Productivity and N dynamics decreased as the <b>rotation</b> <b>length</b> decreased.
