40|$|Observation of {{vertical}} structure of katabatic winds blowing in Mizuho Plateau {{was made by}} means of <b>radio</b> <b>sondes.</b> It {{was found that the}} layer of the katabatic winds is roughly identical with the surface inversion layer. The surface inversion layer showed seasonal variations in thickness and intensity. The katabatic wind layer disappeared when a cyclone was passing over the ocean in the vicinity of Syowa Station, as noticed from the disarranged wind speed profiles. Wind vectors in the lowest few hundred metres of the katabatic wind layer showed that a thermal wind persisted in the surface inversion layer. Therefore, the katabatic winds in Mizuho Plateau may be called the "inversion winds", because they are essentially controlled by the thermal wind due to the existence of a sloped inversion layer...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{original}} optimum strategy for retrieval of precipitable water from routine ground-based midinfrared FTS measurements performed {{at a number}} globally distributed stations within the NDACC network. The strategy utilizes FTIR retrievals which are set {{in a way to}} match standard <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> operations. Thereby, an unprecedented accuracy and precision for measurements of precipitable water can be demonstrated: the correlation between Zugspitze FTIR water vapor columns from a 3 months measurement campaign with total columns derived from coincident radio sondes shows a regression coefficient of R = 0. 988, a bias of 0. 05 mm, a standard deviation of 0. 28 mm, an intercept of 0. 01 mm, and a slope of 1. 01. This appears to be even better than what can be achieved with state-of-the-art micro wave techniques, see e. g., Morland et al. (2006, Fig. 9 therein). Our approach is based upon a careful selection of spectral micro windows, comprising a set of both weak and strong water vapor absorption lines between 839. 4 – 840. 6 cm- 1, 849. 0 – 850. 2 cm- 1, and 852. 0 – 853. 1 cm- 1, which is not contaminated by interfering absorptions of any other trace gases. From existing spectroscopic line lists, a careful selection of the best available parameter set was performed, leading to nearly perfect spectral fits without significant forward model parameter errors. To set up the FTIR water vapor profile inversion, a set of FTIR measurements and coincident radio sondes has been utilized. To eliminate/minimize mismatch in time and space, the Tobin best estimate {{of the state of the}} atmosphere principle has been applied to the radio sondes. This concept uses pairs of radio sondes launched with a 1 -hour separation, and derives the gradient from the two <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> measurements, in order to construct a virtual PTU profile for a certain time and location. Coincident FTIR measurements of water vapor columns (two hour mean values) have then been matched to the water columns obtained by integrating the best-estimate <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> profiles. This match was achieved via investigating the quality of the correlation plots between the columns derived from the radio sondes and the FTIR retrievals, and iteratively tuning the regularization strength of the FTIR retrieval. The FTIR regularization matrix is based on a Tikhonov operator which allows for empirical tuning of the regularization strength via one parameter. The figures of merit for the iterative tuning have been the slope, the intercept, and the regression coefficient of the correlation. By this way an optimum retrieval setting could be found, guaranteeing a response of the FTIR retrievals to true water vapor changes, which is matched to the <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> operation. As first examples for utilizing this approach to derive long-term trends of precipitable water from NDACC type long-term FTIR measurements, we present trends from two time series. I. e., one retrieved from continuous FTIR measurements at the NDACC Primary Station Zugspitze, Germany (47. 42 °N, 10. 98 °E, 2964 m a. s. l.), which covers the time span 1995 - 2009, and one from the International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ, 46. 5 °N, 8. 0 °E, 3580 m a. s. l., Swiss Alps), covering the time span 1984 – 2009. A detailed trend analysis of both series via the bootstrap method will be presented. In ongoing work we apply this optimum retrieval approach to historical long-time measurement series of further selected FTIR stations of the NDACC network. Thereby we will obtain unprecedented new climate data via long term trends of precipitable water at a set of globally distributed locations...|$|E

Fuji weather station located at an altitude of about 3. 8 km. On average, the numbers of daily occultation that included the negative elevation angle were six events. We succeeded in retrieving the refractivity profiles over the southern area of Mt. Fuji from these DL measurement data by applying Abel inversion. These profiles were consistent with the <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> observation near Mt. Fuji. 1...|$|E
40|$|Water vapour {{plays in}} {{important}} role in the energy budget of the atmosphere. Despite many years of study there are still considerable uncertainties both in the measurement of water vapour and it’s representation in radiation models. In an attempt to reduce these uncertainties two field experiments in differing atmospheres were conducted in 1999. The results from a tropical atmosphere and a sub-arctic atmosphere show significant differences between differing <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> sensors. Microwave radiometer measurements are used to validate radiation models and also to constrain the input profile for thermal infra-red modelling. Results from the GENLN 2 v 4 line-by-line radiation model with the CKD 2. 4 water vapour continuum show very good agreement with airborne interferometer measurements in the thermal infra-red...|$|E

A theoretical atmospheric transmission model is {{used to compare the}} two sets of data. We have found a large discrepancy between our theory and the experimental data amounting to more absorption than predicted.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Water vapour {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} atmospheric gases. More than 99 % of water vapour is located in the troposphere where it significantly contributes to atmospheric chemistry, weather, and climate [1]. Its large spatial and temporal variability makes water vapour a tracer for tropospheric changes and especially important for global models which aim to predict climate. The importance of water vapour has generated the need for global water vapour data. The main sources for water vapour data are currently in situ <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> measurements, space borne IR measurements, for example by the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and microwave soundings, for example with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), see e. g. [2], and references therein. Recently, two different approaches have shown that measurements of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) may provide an additional source of global water vapour data [3; 4]. The GOME instrument is a space-base...|$|E
40|$|The volcano El Chichon (Mexico) erupted violently {{over several}} {{days at the}} end of March and at the {{beginning}} of April 1982. After the eruptions a sudden increase of backscattered light from the stratospheric aerosol layer was detected by a lidar (0. 6943 μm) at Nagoya (35 °N, 137 °E) in mid-April 1982. At the end of May the observed scattering ratio reached the maximum value about 44. The effect of the eruption of El Chichon on the stratospheric aerosol layer seems to be larger than that of the volcan de Fuego eruption or Mt. St. Helens eruption. Immediately after the eruption, an apparent two-layer structure of scattering ratio profiles was observed. According to the <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> data over Japan, the aerosols in the upper layer were possibly transported by easterly wind and those in the lower layer by westerly wind, respectively. After September 1982 the centroid height of particulate backscattering and the main peak height decreased gradually due to the effect of sedimentation...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{thunderstorms}} are {{a manifestation}} of deep convection. Conditional instability {{is known to be}} the mechanism by which thunderstorms are formed. The energy that drives conditional instability is convective available potential energy (CAPE), which is computed with <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> data at each pressure level. The purpose of the present paper is to identify the pattern or shape of CAPE required for the genesis of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata (22 ° 32 ′N, 88 ° 20 ′E) confined within the northeastern part (20 °N to 24 °N latitude, 85 °E to 93 °E longitude) of India. The method of chaotic graph theory is adopted for this purpose. Chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are formed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. Ranks of the adjacency matrices constituted with the union of chaotic graphs of pressure levels and CAPE are computed for thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm days. The results reveal that the rank of the adjacency matrix is maximum for non-thunderstorm days and a column with all zeros occurs very quickly on severe thunderstorms days. This indicates that CAPE loses connectivity with pressure levels very early on severe thunderstorm days, showing that for the genesis of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata short, and therefore broad, CAPE is preferred.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} propagation of GPS signals under multipath conditions and their detection are simulated. Using the multiple phase screen method C/A-code modulated L 1 signals are propagated through a spherically symmetric refractivity field {{derived from a}} high-resolution <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> observation. The propagated signals are tracked by GPS receivers implemented in software and converted to refractivity profiles by the canonical transform technique and the Abel inversion. Ignoring noise and assuming an ideal receiver tracking behaviour the true refractivity profile is reproduced to better than 0. 1 % at altitude above 2 km. The non-ideal case is simulated by adding between 14 and 24 dB of Gaussian white noise to the signal and tracking the signal with receivers operating at 50 and 200 Hz sampling frequency using two different carrier phase detectors. In the upper troposphere and stratosphere the receiver models {{used in this study}} yield comparable refractivity profiles. However, in the mid-troposphere down to altitudes of about 2 km a Costas-type phase-locked loop tracking induces negative refractivity biases on the order of − 1 to − 2 % at 50 Hz sampling frequency. Modifications to the receiver tracking algorithm significantly improves the retrieval results. In particular, replacing the Costas-loop’s two-quadrant phase extractor with a four-quadrant discriminator reduces the refractivity biases by a factor of 5; increasing the sampling frequency from 50 to 200 Hz gains another factor of 2...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of the vertical structure and the spatial gradients of aerosol extinction coefficients have been made from airborne lidar measurements across the coastline into offshore oceanic regions along {{the east and west}} coasts of India. The vertical structure revealed the presence of strong, elevated aerosol layers in the altitude region of similar to 2 - 4 km, well above the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Horizontal gradients also showed a vertical structure, being sharp with the e(- 1) scaling distance (D- 0 H) as small as similar to 150 km in the well-mixed regions mostly under the influence of local source effects. Above the ABL, where local effects are subdued, the gradients were much shallower (similar to 600 - 800 km); nevertheless, they were steep compared to the value of similar to 1500 - 2500 km reported for columnar AOD during winter. The gradients of these elevated layers were steeper over the east coast of India than over the west coast. Near-simultaneous <b>radio</b> <b>sonde</b> (Vaisala, Inc., Finland) ascents made over the northern Bay of Bengal showed the presence of convectively unstable regions, first from surface to similar to 750 - 1000 m and the other extending from 1750 to 3000 m separated by a stable region in between. These can act as a conduit for the advection of aerosols and favor the transport of continental aerosols in the higher levels (> 2 km) into the oceans without entering the marine boundary layer below. Large spatial gradient in aerosol optical and hence radiative impacts between the coastal landmass and the adjacent oceans within a short distance of < 300 km (even at an altitude of 3 km) during summer and the premonsoon is of significance to the regional climate...|$|E
