40|$|When {{films of}} zinc 5 -(4 -carboxyphenyl), 10, 15, 20 -triphenyl {{porphyrin}} (ZnTPP) {{are exposed to}} waterborne amine in pH- neutral or alkaline media, both Q- band and Soret band respond with a change of absorbance due to the donation of amine ‘lone pair’ electrons to the metalloprophyrin π orbital. However, this is difficult to reveal with a conventional spectrometer even under high amine concentration. We therefore introduce optical fibres coated with ZnTPP into a bespoke ‘light balance’ evanescent wave absorbance meter [doi: 10. 1016 /j. snb. 2016. 05. 065]. The light balance makes absorbance changes clearly visible under only 5  μM aqueous amine, making PVC membranes redundant. We find sensitivity is higher, and limit- of- detection lower, in the Soret band rather than the Q- band, reflecting the stronger Soret band absorbance. Also, we find that sensitivity is higher, and limit- of- detection approximately two times lower, when rough rather than smooth fibres are used. We believe the <b>rough</b> <b>fibre</b> surface leads to enhanced evanescence, and therefore better overlap of the wave propagating in the fibre with the ZnTPP fibre cladding. We find a limit of detection to waterborne amines below 1  μM, which compares well to other sensors for waterborne amines [Korent, S. M. et. al. Anal. Bioanal.

He ordered that any theatre-goer in dark (or coloured or dirty) clothing {{be sent to the}} back seats, traditionally reserved for who those had no toga; ordinary or common women, freedmen, low-class foreigners and slaves. He reserved the most honourable seats, front of house, for senators and equites; this was how it had always been, before the chaos of the civil wars; or rather, how it was supposed to have been. Infuriated by the sight of a darkly clad throng of men at a public meeting, he sarcastically quoted Virgil at them, [...] "Romanos, rerum dominos, gentemque togatam [...] " [...] ("Romans, lords {{of the world and the}} toga-wearing people"), then ordered that in future, the aediles ban anyone not wearing the toga from the Forum and its environs – Rome's [...] "civic heart".

The effect of fibre treatment (i. e. 5 wt. % NaOH solution at 20 °C for 30 min) on microstructure and mechanical properties of coir fibre, coir fibre reinforced epoxy (CFRE) and coir fibre reinforced cementitious (CFRC) composites were investigated. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) {{studies were carried out}} to examine the microstructures of untreated and treated coir fibres, fibre/epoxy and fibre/cement interfaces. Mechanical properties of CFRE were determined by vibration, tensile and flexure tests and mechanical properties of CFRC were determined by compression and four-point bending tests, respectively. The test results show that coir fibre had a much cleaner and <b>rougher</b> <b>fibre</b> surface after the alkali treatment. Compared with the untreated CFRE, treatment improved the tensile and flexural properties of composites, i. e. 17. 8 % and 16. 7 % growth in tensile and flexural strength, respectively. However, the treatment also reduced the damping ratio of the CFRE. The increase in tensile and flexural properties and reduction in damping ratio are attributed to the improvement of fibre and epoxy matrix interfacial adhesion due to the treatment, as displayed by SEM micrographs. Compared with the plain concrete, coir fibre improved the compressive strength, flexural strength and toughness effectively. The treatment can further improve these properties of CFRC. SEM studies clearly confirmed that the failure modes of coir fibres in cement matrix are fibre breakage, fibre pull-out and fibre debonding from the cement matrix.

40|$|In this work, the {{formation}} of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) has been studied using a jet mixing method not previously used for mixing polyelectrolytes. The PECs were formed from two weak polyelectrolytes, i. e., polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH), with different mixing times, {{and the results were}} compared with those for PECs formed using the conventional polyelectrolyte titration method.   The adsorption behaviour of the formed PECs on silicon oxide substrates and pulp fibres was analysed, and the results were compared with those for polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) prepared from the same two polyelectrolytes.   The results indicated that by using the jet mixer, the size of the formed PECs could be controlled, which was not the case with the polyelectrolyte titration method. The PECs produced by jet mixing were also found to be smaller than those produced by polyelectrolyte titration. From these results, a two-step mechanism for {{the formation}} of PECs was suggested: initial precomplex formation, which is a fast and diffusion-controlled process, followed by a reconformation process, during which the vigorous mixing in the jet mixer can partially limit secondary aggregation.   When the complexes were adsorbed to silicon oxide or pulp fibre surfaces, adsorption studies indicated {{that it was impossible to}} reach the same adsorption levels for PECs as for PEMs. This was explained in terms of free energy, entropical, reasons rather than to any geometric limitation of the surface. Despite the smaller amount of polyelectrolyte adsorbed from the PEC treatment than from the PEM treatment of pulp fibres, the PEC treatment had the greatest effect on paper strength per adsorbed amount of polymer. This was thought to be because the three-dimensional structure of the PECs, versus the smoother structure of PEMs, allows for {{the formation of}} multiple contact points between the macroscopically <b>rough</b> <b>fibres</b> and increased molecular contact area.   In the adsorption experiments, it was also found that net cationic complexes can adsorb to both anionic and cationic substrates. This phenomenon was explained by the occurrence of anionic patches on the surface of the net cationic PECs and the ability of the PECs, formed from weak polyelectrolytes, to partially change charge upon exposure to a surface of the same charge as the complex itself, due to a change of the degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolytes constituting the complex.

40|$|The current {{importance}} of investigating the anatomical and ultrastructural organization of Tardigrada nervous system is determined {{in relationship to}} the early evolution of the arthropods. According to the data by Dewel and Dewel (1996, 1999), the organization of the Tardigrada brain could be best understood by analyzing the pattern of the nervous system in the trunk. On this basis, we analyzed the ultrastructure of the trunk ganglia in the eutardigrade Macrobiotus richtersi. The trunk ganglion is located ventrally under the midgut beneath the delicate visceral muscles and surrounded by the body-cavity. The ganglion has an oval compact shape and distinct basal lamina. Eight perikarya have been found in the investigated portion of the ganglion (25 serial sections were examined). Most of them are located at the periphery and they contact basal lamina directly. At least one of the neurons is situated to some extent deeper and it contacts fringe cells. This neuron projects the process {{to the center of the}} neuropile and then passes into the lateral nerve. Usually, perikarya have an oval nucleus and neuroplasm with dense packed organelles such as mitochondria, reticulum and vesicles. Only one cell has irregular-shaped nucleus and a lucent cytoplasm. It is unclear if the Tardigrada nervous system has glial cells or not. Perhaps this lucent cell has a glia-like function in the trunk ganglion of M. richtersi. A pair of nerves goes out from the ganglion and innervates the lateral area of the segment. These nerves have no neuron cell bodies and any other cells like glial cells. The nervous processes are slim, dense-packed and contain mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. A basal lamina surrounds not only the ganglion but nerves too, and consists of fine dense filaments. <b>Rough</b> <b>fibres</b> have not been found. There are numerous neurites containing small clear and rare dense vesicles in the neuropile. Besides in the ganglion there is one large axon which contains clear cytoplasm and dense-core vesicles. Its perikaryon is not found in the ganglion. This axon goes through the ganglion and passes out into a nerve. Many processes in the neuropile have a specific dense neuroplasm with clear small vesicles. We have found a similar pattern in neurites innervating the salivary duct and muscles of the salivary glands and perhaps in the circumesophageal connective of another eutardigrade, Ramazzottius tribulosus.

Computational results for the nasal capture efficiency for nano-particles and various breathing rates in the laminar regime were found to correlate well with the ratio of particle diffusivity to the breathing rate. For micron particles, particle inertia is the most significant property and the need to use sufficient drag laws is important.

40|$|Natural fibres are a {{realistic}} and ecological alternative to synthetic fibres as reinforcement for polymer composite materials {{due to their}} low cost, environmental friendliness, natural abundance, and mechanical properties. The latter allows the design of composite materials to meet specific mechanical properties. For instance, bamboo exhibits a combination of low density (~ 1. 4 g/cm³) and high stiffness (~ 43 GPa) and strength (~ 800 MPa), while coir fibres are not very strong and stiff, but exhibit high strain to failure (approximately 40 %). However, their potential as reinforcing agent is reduced when compatibility problems with polymer matrices arise at the interface. The generally hydrophilic nature of natural fibres produces low interfacial interactions with certain important hydrophobic thermoplastic matrices, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, leading to a poor interfacial strength. Mechanical properties of composite materials can be greatly affected by the bond strength at the fibre-matrix interface. When a composite structure is loaded, the load is transferred from the matrix to the fibres mainly through shear stresses at the interface. Load transfer increases with increasing interfacial (shear) stresses, thus improving the composite strength. The adhesion at the interface {{can be described as}} a combination of physical adhesion (related to wettability), chemical bonding, and mechanical interlocking. In this study, the wettability and compatibility of the fibre and the matrix is assessed by the analysis of their surface energies. This is done by measuring contact angles, which is a quantitative measure of solid-liquid molecular interactions and thus provides information on the surface energy of solids. This dissertation develops an interdisciplinary and integrated approach that deals with the physical, chemical, and mechanical aspects of natural bamboo fibre composite interfaces. The wetting and mechanical behaviour at the interface of smooth and isotropic synthetic fibres (glass, polyethylene terephthalate) are compared with that of a rough and anisotropic natural fibre (bamboo). Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and optical profilometry techniques were used to study the fibres topography and chemistry. A new approach, based on an autoclave treatment, to reduce the noise in performing contact angle measurements on <b>rough</b> natural <b>fibre</b> surfaces is presented. The results indicate that the high concentration of lignin on the surface of bamboo fibres is responsible for their surface wetting properties. The wetting dynamics of various test liquids on bamboo fibres is analysed by applying the molecular-kinetic theory of wetting. The surface free energy components are calculated according to the acidbase theory. These values are then used to calculate the theoretical work of adhesion, spreading coefficient, wetting tension, and interfacial energy for analysing the fibre-matrix compatibility. Additionally, a novel way to measure equilibrium contact angles by using sound excitation is proposed. This way it is possible to better take into account both polar and dispersive surface energy components. The findings suggest that the contact angle obtained by forcing relaxation through acoustic vibration is a reliable method to study the wetting behaviour of natural fibres. Moreover, understanding of the stress state in the composite after processing and during mechanical testing is required for a correct analysis of adhesion properties. The mechanical strength of the interfaces was assessed by single fibre pull-out tests, and transverse 3 -point bending tests. The fibre matrix interfacial bond strength was characterized by the critical local value of interfacial shear stress. Since during crack initiation in the pull-out test, the crack surfaces move directly apart, it is possible to correctly relate the theoretical work of adhesion with the normal stress at the debond point. This radial normal stress at the interface at the moment of crack initiation is also used in this study as a parameter for correlating thermodynamic work of adhesion and practical adhesion. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  <w:latentstyles=""  status: publishe...|$|R
