60|$|She {{perfectly}} {{understood the}} motive of Lady Glencora's visit, {{and thought that}} she would at any <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> something in the very triumph of baffling the manoeuvres of so clever a woman. Let Lady Glencora throw her ægis before the Duke, {{and it would be}} something to carry off his Grace from beneath the protection of so thick a shield. The very flavour of the contest was pleasing to Madame Goesler. But, the victory gained, what then would remain to her? Money she had already; position, too, she had of her own. She was free as air, and should it suit her at any time to go off to some lake of Como in society that would personally be more agreeable to her than that of the Duke of Omnium, there was nothing to hinder her for a moment. And then came a smile over her face,--but the saddest smile,--as she thought of one with whom it might be pleasant to look at the colour of Italian skies and feel the softness of Italian breezes. In feigning to like to do this with an old man, in acting the raptures of love on behalf of a worn-out duke who at the best would scarce believe in her acting, there would not be much delight for her. She had never yet known what it was to have anything of the pleasure of love. She had grown, as she often told herself, to be a hard, cautious, selfish, successful woman, without any interference or assistance from such pleasure. Might there not be yet time left for her to try it without selfishness,--with an absolute devotion of self,--if only she could find the right companion? There was one who might be such a companion, but the Duke of Omnium certainly could not be such a one.|$|E
5000|$|... === Vectoring === Performance in G.fast {{systems is}} limited to a large extent by {{crosstalk}} between multiple wire pairs in a single cable. Self-FEXT (far-end crosstalk) cancellation, also called vectoring, is mandatory in G.fast. Vectoring technology for VDSL2 was previously specified by the ITU-T in G.993.5, also called G.vector. The first version of G.fast will support an improved version of the linear precoding scheme found in G.vector, with non-linear precoding planned for a future amendment. Testing by Huawei and Alcatel shows that non-linear precoding algorithms can provide an approximate data <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> of 25% compared to linear precoding in very high frequencies; however, the increased complexity leads to implementation difficulties, higher power consumption, and greater costs. Since all current G.fast implementations are limited to 106 MHz, non-linear precoding yields little performance gain. Instead, current efforts to deliver a gigabit are focusing on bonding, power and more bits per hertz.|$|E

40|$|Often in {{multiuser}} wireless {{systems like}} cellular networks, data {{is present in}} both directions (uplink and downlink). One way to formulate protocols for such networks, is to design the uplink and downlink independently. But such a design ignores the two-way nature of data. We show that by jointly designing the uplink and downlink, we get <b>rate</b> <b>gains</b> {{as long as there}} is data in both the directions. We make a distinction between data being two-way and the channel being two-way and show that for the case where only the channel is two-way, a disjoint design is optimal. The <b>rate</b> <b>gains</b> can be attributed to the inherent feedback in two-way schemes which enables cooperation in all topologies (including hidden node topologies). Furthermore, in near-far situations, the weak user gains appreciably from such cooperation.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analytically}} {{study the}} regime in which practical full-duplex systems can achieve larger rates than an equivalent half-duplex systems. The key challenge in practical full-duplex systems is uncancelled self-interference signal, which {{is caused by a}} combination of hardware and implementation imperfections. Thus, we first present a signal model which captures the effect of significant impairments such as oscillator phase noise, low-noise amplifier noise figure, mixer noise, and analog-to-digital converter quantization noise. Using the detailed signal model, we study the <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> region, which is defined as the region of received signal-of-interest signal strength where full-duplex systems outperform half-duplex systems in terms of achievable rate. The <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> region is derived as a piecewise linear approximation in log-domain, and numerical results show that the approximation closely matches the exact region.

40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a distributed source coding {{problem with a}} joint distortion criterion depending on the sources and the reconstruction. This includes as a special case the problem of computing {{a function of the}} sources to within some distortion and also the classic Slepian-Wolf problem [12], Berger-Tung problem [5], Wyner-Ziv problem [4], Yeung-Berger problem [6] and the Ahlswede-Korner-Wyner problem [3], [13]. While the prevalent trend in information theory has been to prove achievability results using Shannon’s random coding arguments, using structured random codes offer <b>rate</b> <b>gains</b> over unstructured random codes for many problems. Motivated by this, we present a new achievable ratedistortion region (an inner bound to the performance limit) for this problem for discrete memoryless sources based on “good” structured random nested codes built over abelian groups. We demonstrate <b>rate</b> <b>gains</b> for this problem over traditional coding schemes using random unstructured codes. For certain sources and distortion functions, the new rate region is strictly bigger than the Berger-Tung rate region, which has been the best known achievable rate region for this problem till now. Further, there is no known unstructured random coding scheme that achieves these <b>rate</b> <b>gains.</b> Achievable performance limits for single-user source coding using abelian group codes are also obtained as parts of the proof of the main coding theorem. As a corollary, we also prove that nested linear codes achieve the Shannon rate-distortion bound in the single-user setting. Note that while group codes retain some structure, they are more general than linear codes which can only be built over finite fields which are known to exist only for certain sizes...|$|R

40|$|Assuming perfect channel state {{information}} (CSI), a receiver in a point-to-point MIMO channel can compute the transmit beamforming vector that maximizes the transmission rate. For frequency-division duplex, a transmitter {{is not able}} to estimate CSI directly and has to obtain a quantized transmit beamforming vector from the receiver via a rate-limited feedback channel. We assume that time evolution of MIMO channels is modeled as a Gauss-Markov process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient. For a given feedback rate, we analyze the optimal feedback interval that maximizes the average transmission rate or received power of systems with two transmit and/or two receive antennas. For other system sizes, we derive the <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> in a large system limit, which is shown to approximate the <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> of a finite-size system well.
