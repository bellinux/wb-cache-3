40|$|The illegal {{disposal}} of construction waste (CW) {{in public places}} {{has been a problem}} in Brazilian municipalities, causing various environmental impacts and public cleaning costs to municipalities. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the main factors that can influence the generators and transport companies to illegal {{disposal of}} construction waste (CW) in São Paulo. The methodological procedure adopted was the descriptive research through the identification and analysis of variables and aspects related to the empirical phenomenon of irregular disposal of CW. As techniques for data collection, we used the documentary research, with emphasis on the Plan of Integrated Solid Waste Management (PGIRS) of the municipality, and other legal documents, supplemented by literature review. It was concluded that the main factors related to the irregular disposal in public places may be associated with income, which limited the small low-income generators to require the <b>rental</b> <b>container</b> for the transport of waste, besides the difficulty of accessibility and logistic costs to the voluntary delivery points (VEPs). There is also a lack of reasonable and appropriate criteria in the definition of small and large generator. The work suggests that there would be a need for services of collection, transportation and treatment of CW to be offered under public law - paid through tax and priced through social and environmental criteria - for greater control over generators and transport companies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Back-haul {{problems}} {{occur in}} many areas of transportation. One way rental of equipment often takes it from an area of high demand to an area of low demand. Examples include <b>container</b> <b>rentals,</b> car rentals and other cases of mobile equipment. The problem is to return the equipment to the location of need. Typically this is viewed as an administrative and scheduling problem. The approach taken here is "decentralized" in which a specially designed market organizes competition and information to minimize the cost of back-hauls without the direct intervention of administrative negotiations or command-and-control types of scheduling. Laboratory experimental methods are employed to test the concept and explore its limitations...|$|R
50|$|As {{a part of}} 2009 Foxfield Races, the Foxfield Racing Association (FRA) has {{initiated}} a “Go Green” Program which encourages people attending the races to not use glass and to start recycling their cans. As {{a part of the}} “Go Green” program the FRA will now transport all trash from the races to a recycling center and not a landfill. Also another part of the program is that the FRA has provided large containers (supplied by the company <b>Container</b> <b>Rentals)</b> for attendees to put filled trash bags. This program is a reply to the complaints of many civilians and people of the amount of trash that is left behind or found after the Spring Foxfield race, and {{as a response to the}} cooler size change which will lead to a large increase in Styrofoam coolers.|$|R
