50|$|<b>Restricted</b> <b>Data</b> and Formerly <b>Restricted</b> <b>Data</b> are {{classification}} markings {{that concern}} nuclear information. These {{are the only}} two classifications that are established by federal law, being defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nuclear information is not automatically declassified after 25 years. Documents with nuclear information covered under the Atomic Energy Act will be marked with a classification level (confidential, secret or top secret) and a <b>restricted</b> <b>data</b> or formerly <b>restricted</b> <b>data</b> marking. Nuclear information as specified in the act may inadvertently appear in unclassified documents and must be reclassified when discovered. Even documents created by private individuals have been seized for containing nuclear information and classified. Only the Department of Energy may declassify nuclear information.|$|E
50|$|For example, the marking ATOMAL, {{is applied}} to U.S. <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>DATA</b> or FORMERLY <b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>DATA</b> and United Kingdom ATOMIC {{information}} that has been released to NATO.
