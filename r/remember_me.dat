He successfully {{recovered from the}} illness after undergoing a life-saving emergency operation that had a survival rate of just 10%. Whilst in hospital {{he had been given}} the last rites twice.

5|$|Don't Nod Entertainment SARL, doing {{business}} as Dontnod Entertainment (stylised as DONTИOD), is a French video game developer based in Paris. Founded in 2008, it started {{development on the}} action-adventure <b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> (2013). Because of its poor return on investment, Dontnod resolved its financial situation with recourse to public funding to subsidise the graphic adventure Life Is Strange (2015). Momentum gained from the successful release of Life Is Strange was allocated {{to focus on the}} upcoming action role-playing game Vampyr (2018) and Life Is Strange 2 (TBA).|$|E

5|$|<b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
5|$|<b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> is a {{cyberpunk}} action-adventure {{video game}} developed by Dontnod Entertainment {{and published by}} Capcom. It was released worldwide in June 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game's plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by megacorporation Memorize. With {{the help of a}} mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people's recollections. The combat consists of a modified combo system called Pressen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> was {{developed}} as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, {{with one of}} the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.|$|E

American rapper Fabolous {{said in an interview}} that he is planning a collaboration album with Ne-Yo as well. Ne-Yo has also written songs for Mary J. Blige, JB, Beyoncé, Monica, Alexandra Burke, Cheryl Cole and Willow Smith's upcoming albums. Ne-Yo starred in two motion pictures, the long-gestating George Lucas project Red Tails, released in early 2012, and , which was released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Ne-Yo has already finished writing songs for American singer and Roc Nation artist Alexis Jordan and her self-titled debut album as well as Jennifer Hudson for her second studio album, I <b>Remember</b> <b>Me,</b> which had a North American release on March 22, 2011. Ne-Yo appeared in the children's preschool show The Fresh Beat Band and was one of the few artists not to cancel appearances in the wake of the 2011 Japan earthquake.|$|E

25|$|Several {{films and}} {{television}} series have been filmed {{in and around}} the city. For example, portions of the BBC television series Happy Valley were filmed in Huddersfield; in addition to exteriors, some of the studio filming was done at North Light Film Studios at Brookes Mill, Huddersfield. As well, interiors for the BBC's Jamaica Inn, for the BBC's <b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> and for ITV series Black Work, were also filmed at the studios. More recently, many of the exteriors of the BBC series Jericho were filmed at the nearby Rockingstone Quarry and some interior work was done at North Light Film Studios.|$|E
25|$|West Yorkshire has {{particularly}} {{benefited from}} {{a great deal of}} production activity. For example, portions of the BBC television series Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax were filmed in the area, in Huddersfield and other cities; in addition to exteriors, some of the studio filming for Happy Valley was done at North Light Film Studios at Brookes Mill, Huddersfield. As well, the BBC's Jamaica Inn, for the BBC's <b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> and for ITV series Black Work, were also filmed at the studios and in nearby West Yorkshire locations.

He {{appeared as a}} troubled young man in <b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> (2010) and also starred in a romantic drama, Water for Elephants (2011). His performance as a tough, cold-hearted and calculating billionaire in David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis (2012), earned him critical praise. He gained further critical appreciation for his performances in David Michod's futuristic western The Rover (2014), in Cronenberg's satire drama Maps to the Stars (2014), in James Gray's The Lost City of Z (2017), as an aide-de-camp to an explorer who disappeared in the Amazon while looking for an ancient city, and in Safdie Brothers Good Time (2017).|$|E
25|$|In 2005 <b>Remember</b> <b>Me</b> This Way, the {{documentary}} filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued {{for the first}} time on DVD. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, The Remixes and Live in Concert (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, The Best of Gary Glitter. In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as iTunes and eMusic.|$|E
25|$|In {{addressing}} {{the future of}} the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to females in particular. One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include females could be seen in Sega's use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games. Other examples of this include games like Mass Effect 3, <b>Remember</b> <b>Me,</b> and the Last of Us, which include a female option for the main character. The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales. Examination of IGN's Big Games at E3 2012 and Big Games at E3 2013 shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013. Other efforts outside of making games with female characters have also started to occur. One example is that Women in Games International has teamed up with the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles {{in order to create a}} video game patch which the two organizations hope will encourage Girl Scouts to develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. Activism and specifically female-targeted LAN parties in Scandinavia have helped boost female game playing.|$|E
