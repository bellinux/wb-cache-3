With the {{development}} of society and progress in science and technology, the social competition has been fiercer and fiercer, printing factories also face more challenges and developments, {{and more and more}} printing factories hope to reduce the waste <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> products reasonably, so as to continuously improve the printing quality and increase printing speed, thus increasing the enterprise competitiveness and ensuring the very advantageous status of enterprises. Therefore, t is required to continuously research new technologies, and improve the economic and social benefits of enterprises. The continuous application of pneumatic devices in printing can effectively improve the product precision, stability and production efficiency, and this is also the first objective for manufacturing of printing factories. This paper mainly researches the application of pneumatic devices in the printing machinery...|$|E

40|$|Objective – This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether evidence indicates a need to preserve print equivalent journal collections. In addition, this research aimed to provide data on the failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> equivalent materials for possible digitization to replace existing poor quality or defective electronic surrogates. Methods – The project compared the content of randomly selected journal titles, volumes, and issues from seven electronic journal archives and their print equivalents held at the University of Saskatchewan Library. The archives were obtained from five separate vendors representing humanities, social sciences, science, technology, and medicine. Data were collected on the frequency and types of failure of electronic surrogates, supplemental content missing from electronic surrogates, and frequency and types <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>print</b> equivalent materials. Results – Across all electronic journal archives the failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> electronic surrogates was 7. 5 % for all PDF documents and 11. 5 % for scholarly PDF documents. For individual electronic journal archives the failure rate ranged from 0. 7 % to 19. 5 % for all PDF documents and from 0. 3 % to 26. 5 % for scholarly PDF documents. Data is presented on the failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> individual electronic journal archives, types of failure, and missing supplemental content. An examination <b>of</b> <b>print</b> equivalent titles found 1. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>print</b> scholarly articles {{could not be used}} or were not optimal for digitization. Conclusions – The study demonstrates the need for preserving print equivalent journal titles for at least the short (less than 5 years) to medium term (up to 10 years), while poorly digitized materials are identified, replaced, and digitally preserved. While electronic surrogates of image-rich scholarly papers {{are more likely to have}} quality issues, the study found some text-only PDF scholarly documents were illegible, indicating the need for caution against liberally applying this as a criterion for disposal <b>of</b> <b>print</b> equivalent titles. There is significant supplemental content absent from electronic surrogates which indicates a need for further discussion of the necessity for such information or for incorporating it into the digitization process to ensure a complete record <b>of</b> the <b>print</b> equivalent journals for future use. The failure <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>print</b> equivalent titles for possible digitization provides additional data for discussions related to the determination of optimal overlap. It also suggests that the number of copies required for a full set of preserved journals over a specified time horizon may be greater than anticipated, unless page level validation is performed...|$|R

A typical example of off-line recognition is postal mail sorting where addresses on envelopes are automatically scanned, processed in an OCR-system, and, according to the recognition results, mechanically routed to the appropriate sorting bins. Off-line recognition rates vary with the size of the lexicon, the country, etc. However, {{it can be said that}} the state of the art for writer independent recognition is around 95 % for lexica of American city names containing a few hundred words.

A Tradespace analysis is used to help decompose some of the complexity into a visualization that simplifies the decision process. The Tradespace analysis suggests that more utility can be achieved by upgrading the design of existing test fixtures versus purchasing off of the shelf solutions. The second phase will identify a design concept, offer specific design solutions, and finally a fully designed system that is capable of improving the performance of the test fixtures in electronic board test area by 50 %. The system is then upgradable with in-line conveyors to run autonomously decoupling the operator from the process. by David McCalib, Jr. Thesis: M.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a multifont classification scheme to help recognition of multifont and multisize characters. It uses typographical attributes such as ascenders, descenders and serifs {{obtained from a}} word image. The attributes are used as an input to a neural network classifier to produce the mul-tifont classification results. It can classify 7 commonly used fonts for all point sizes from 7 to 18. The approach devel-oped in this scheme can handle {{a wide range of}} image quality even with severely touching characters. The detection of the font can improve the character segmentation as well as the character recognition because the identification of the font provides information on the structure and the typographical design of characters. Therefore, this multifont classification algorithm can be used in maintaining good recognition <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> a machine <b>printed</b> OCR system regardless of fonts and sizes. Experiments have shown font classification accura-cies reach high performance levels of about 95 percent even with severely touching characters.

40|$|The general patriarchal {{character}} of the media aligns with the logic of commercialism which prioritizes profit and restricts the diversity of news content in favour {{of those who have}} the means of purchase. It explains why there is a male preponderance in media ownership, staffing and content consumption especially in Nigeria where women have access to, and appear in, the news far fewer times than men. This provokes a question: Does low content consumption by women influence the way media report them? This paper unravels these two variables within a political context. Content assessment and respondents’ <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> Nigeria’s dominant <b>print</b> media (1999 - 2003) shows a robust political reporting but with a gender differential that is heavily skewed towards men. Focus group evaluations of the situation show a connection between women’s low visibility in the news and inconsequential access to content. One evaluation attributes the scenario to unconscious reporting! That brings to the fore journalistic consciousness-raising as a critical factor, among others, in media performance.
