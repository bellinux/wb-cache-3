40|$|Context. Material {{processed}} by the CNO cycle in stellar interiors is enriched in 17 O. When mixing processes from the stellar surface reach these layers, as occurs when stars become red giants and undergo the first dredge up, {{the abundance of}} 17 O increases. Such an occurrence explains the drop of the 16 O/ 17 O observed in RGB stars with mass larger than 1. 5 M_. As a consequence, the interstellar medium is continuously polluted by the wind of evolved stars enriched in 17 O. Aims. Recently, the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) collaboration released an improved rate of the 17 O(p,alpha) 14 N reaction.

Accordingly, in this paper, we investigate the characteristics of VoIP trafc and the limitations of state-of-the-art rate adap-tation algorithms, and then enhance the QoS of voice over WLAN (VoWLAN) by ameliorating the existing rate adaptation algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>revised</b> <b>rate</b> control {{scheme based on}} an improved frame complexity measure. Rate control adopted by both MPEG- 4 VM 18 and H. 264 /AVC use a quadratic rate-distortion (R-D) model that determines quantization parameters (QPs). Classical quadratic R-D model is suitable for MPEG- 4 but it performs poorly for H. 264 /AVC {{because one of the}} important parameters, mean absolute difference (MAD), is predicted through a linear model, whereas the MAD used in MPEG- 4 VM 18 is the actual MAD. Inaccurately predicted MAD results in wrong QP and consequently degrades rate distortion optimization (RDO) performance in H. 264. To overcome the limitation of the existing rate control schemes, we introduce an enhanced linear model for predicting MAD, utilizing some knowledge of current frame complexity. Moreover, we propose a more accurate frame complexity measure, namely, normalized MAD, to replace the current use of MAD parameter. Normalized MAD has a stronger correlation with optimally allocated bits than that of the predicted MAD. To minimize video quality variations, we also propose a novel long-term QP limiter (LTQPL). Finally, a dynamic bit allocation scheme among basic units is implemented. Extensive simulation results show that our method, with inexpensive computational complexity added, improves the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and reduces video quality variations considerably...|$|E

40|$|US {{antidumping}} (AD) {{policy can}} generate anticipatory effects on firms subject to AD duties {{because of a}} process called "administrative reviews" in which US government agencies determines refund rates based on exporters' most recent pricing behavior. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the anticipatory effects from importers' and exporters' side by examining the US-Canada softwood lumber disputes. Using a demand estimation technique, we find evidence of the importers' anticipation: importers were less sensitive to tariff rates under the AD duties compared to standard tariffs, which indicates that the importers increased their volume of imports anticipating the future refund. We further show that the importers adjusted their anticipation adaptively, in the sense that the anticipated refund rate evolved according to the most recent <b>revised</b> <b>rate</b> of an AD duty released in the determination of an administrative review. On the other hand, using a pass-through regression, we find evidence of the exporters' anticipation: the pass-through of the AD duties into export prices (boarder prices) is larger than that of standard tariffs by about 41 % after controlling for unobserved demand shocks. The result indicates that the exporters set their prices higher under the AD duties in order to raise the future refund, which in turn increase their future profits through the evolution of the importers' anticipation. ...|$|E

All this is done within a unified framework that allows for a detailed comparative analysis. I present two main findings. Firstly, the choice of last look design and trading protocol determines the degree of execution risk inherent in the process, but the effective transaction costs borne by the trader need not be affected by it. Secondly, when a trader adversely selects the iquidity provider she chooses to deal with, the distinction between the different symmetric and asymmetric last look designs fades and the primary driver of execution risk is the choice of trading protocol...|$|E

These two reactions are studied with sophisticated theoretical methods that should provide accurate predictions for the rate coefficients. The potential energy surfaces are studied with high-level electronic structure methods. For both reactions, simple long-range expansions are shown to be sufficiently accurate for predicting the kinetics at room temperature and lower. The kinetics is predicted from a combination of transition state theory, trajectory simulations, and master equation analysis. For the O(3 P) reaction, the interplay between the spin-orbit and the charge-quadrupole interactions is explicitly considered. For the CO reaction, we also consider the isomerization and decomposition dynamics of the two initially formed adducts. The final predictions, which are expected to be accurate to about 10 to 20 %, are compared with the available experimental data. For the O(3 P) reaction, the predicted rate coefficient is accurately reproduced by the expression 1. 14 × 10 - 9 (T/ 300) - 0. 156 exp(- 1. 41 /T) cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1 over the 5 to 400 K temperature range.
