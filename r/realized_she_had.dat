5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

Two American boats came alongside and began to take off survivors, but quickly pushed away again fearing an imminent magazine explosion, which promptly occurred.

She was the youngest girl born to Charles Henry Smith, an investment broker, and Katherine DeWitt Willcox Smith. Jessie attended private elementary schools. At the age of sixteen she was sent to Cincinnati, Ohio to live with her cousins and finish her education. She trained to be a teacher and taught kindergarten in 1883. However, Smith found that the physical demands of working with children were too strenuous for her. Due to back problems, she had difficulty bending down to their level. Persuaded to attend one of her friend's or cousin's art classes, Smith <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a talent for drawing.|$|E
500|$|Advised of her failing health, Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron-Jetté on April 4, 1864, and {{administered}} {{to her the}} last rites. Rosalie Cadron-Jetté died shortly thereafter, during {{the early hours of}} April 5, 1864. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix. Around 2 a.m. she made {{the sign of the cross}} and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus! Then I noticed she was getting weaker; we brought the light closer to her and <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> already passed over to a better life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when she <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E

500|$|Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the {{television}} series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: [...] "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius." [...] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that [...] "Oracle" [...] was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abanndoned ...|$|E

So, it made sense to ask Brian as he's a great friend of mine that also lives in Los Angeles and he has a great studio with lots of resources. He helped oversee the production of the record and made sure that everything was done on time and nothing was missed out during recording and it worked out just perfect", she said. It was easy for her to work with Foote who, understanding that she was a [...] "control freak", tried to [...] "step away a lot". Yet, {{he had a lot of}} [...] "great suggestions about how to change little things to make them more effective", according to Danilova, and also let her use his [...] "amazing synth collection" [...] which helped the songs grow.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Wie's slump continued, {{including}} a four-month hiatus, due to injuries to both wrists, a disqualification, and several missed cuts and withdrawals. At the LPGA Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika, she was 14 over par through 16 {{holes in the}} first round before withdrawing after a conversation with her agent, citing the aggravated wrist injury. The withdrawal was controversial owing to the LPGA Rule of 88, which states that a non-LPGA member shooting a score of 88 or more is forced to withdraw and banned from LPGA co-sponsored events {{for the rest of the}} year. While Wie claimed that the injury and not the rule of 88 was the cause of the withdrawal, her playing partner, Alena Sharp, questioned this claim. Controversy continued in the middle of the State Farm Classic when it was <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> failed to sign her second round scorecard, resulting in a disqualification.

2500|$|Jane Kowalski's {{call was}} placed by {{cellphone}} at 6:30p.m. {{while she was}} driving on U.S. Route 41. [...] "I was at a stoplight and a man pulled up {{next to me and}} there was a child screaming in the car", she said. [...] She explained further that she heard [...] "terrifying screaming" [...] and that she had [...] "never heard anything like that". [...] Kowalski believed that she was witnessing a child abduction. [...] She also identified the car as a Camaro but stated the color as blue (rather than green). [...] She stated that she had made eye contact with the driver after which [...] "a hand came up and started banging on the passenger window". [...] Since she had crossed the county line into Charlotte, the call was routed to Charlotte County's 9-1-1 call center. [...] It was only after she saw the news the following day that she <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> witnessed the abduction of Lee rather than that of a child. [...] When she called the North Port Police Department to explain who she was and that she had made a 9-1-1 call, it became apparent that the call had not been forwarded to the correct authorities. [...] It is this call that is alleged to have been mishandled {{due to the fact that}} the operatives neglected to file it correctly. [...] This call was also presented by the state prosecutors as part of the key evidence at King's trial.|$|E

After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son George W. and at that point Barbara <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not cooked in twelve years, and had difficulty driving on her own to the point where she did not drive far from home {{for a long time and}} her husband warned people to get out of the way if they saw her car. A month after they left office, in February 1993, Bush was surprised by her husband when he booked them on the [...] "Love Boat" [...] ship Regal Princess. On April 27, 1993, Bush and her husband had breakfast with Margaret Thatcher during her speaking tour. Thatcher mentioned the most recent celebration of former President Ronald Reagan's birthday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, where he orated the same card twice. Bush read about the incident after Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which she called a [...] "tragedy for both" [...] Mr. and Mrs. Reagan. On January 16, 1995, Bush flew to Austin, Texas with her husband to attend her son George W.'s inauguration as Governor of Texas.
