50|$|Rotary filing long predated milling. A {{rotary file}} by Jacques de Vaucanson, circa 1760, is well known. It {{is clear that}} milling {{machines}} as a distinct class of machine tool (separate from lathes running <b>rotary</b> <b>files)</b> first appeared between 1814 and 1818. The centers of earliest development of true milling machines were two federal armories of the U.S. (Springfield and Harpers Ferry) together with the various private armories and inside contractors that shared turnover of skilled workmen with them.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare root canal {{preparation}} with <b>rotary</b> ProTaper <b>files</b> and hand ProTaper files to find a better instrumentation technique for maintaining root canal geometry with the aid of computed tomography. Material and methods: Twenty curved root canals with at least 10 degree of curvature were divided into 2 groups of 10 teeth each. In group I the canals were prepared with hand ProTaper files and in group II the canals were prepared with <b>rotary</b> ProTaper <b>files.</b> Image analysis was performed at four levels 4 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, and 12 mm from the root apex to assess changes in canal transportation and centering ratio using computed tomography (CT). Results: Data suggest that <b>rotary</b> ProTaper <b>files</b> presented the best outcomes for both variables evaluated. <b>Rotary</b> ProTaper <b>files</b> caused lesser transportation and remained better centered in the canal than hand ProTaper files.

50|$|Taper — The taper of a file {{refers to}} the gradual {{increase}} in diameter along its working surface. NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> usually have a higher taper compared to the taper of standard traditional hand files which is 0.02 mm/mm (ISO taper of endodontic files, taper 0.02 mm/mm indicates 20 microns increase in diameter for every 1 mm gain in {{the length of a}} file). Their taper commonly ranges from 0.02 to 0.12 mm/mm. Different systems are sometimes classified according to their taper which can be constant or variable.|$|E
50|$|A nickel {{titanium}} (NiTi) {{rotary file}} is an engine-driven tapered and pointed endodontic instrument made of nickel titanium alloy with cutting edges used to mechanically shape and prepare the root canals during endodontic therapy or {{to remove the}} root canal obturating material while performing retreatment. The first NiTi file {{was introduced to the}} market in 1991. Superelasticity and shape memory are the properties that make Niti files very flexible. The high flexibility of Niti files makes them superior to stainless steel files for the purpose of rotary root canal preparation. The use of NiTi <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> in dentistry is a common practice.|$|E
50|$|Many {{elements}} are often alloyed with steel. The main purpose for alloying most elements with steel {{is to increase}} its hardenability and to decrease softening under temperature. Tool steels, for example, may have elements like chromium or vanadium added to increase both toughness and strength, which is necessary for things like wrenches and screwdrivers. On the other hand, drill bits and <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> need to retain their hardness at high temperatures. Adding cobalt or molybdenum can cause the steel to retain its hardness, even at red-hot temperatures, forming high-speed steels. Often, small amounts of many different {{elements are}} added to the steel to give the desired properties, rather than just adding one or two.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of three methods in removal of Resilon/new Epiphany self-etch (SE) soft resin endodontic obturation system. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted single rooted human teeth were prepared for endodontic treatment and obturated with Resilon/Epiphany SE. The roots were randomly divided into three groups; group 1 roots were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo files; group 2 were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo accompanied with chloroform; and group 3 were retreated using Mtwo R/Mtwo accompanied with Endosolv R. The cleanliness of canal walls was determined using scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and LSD tests. Results: Endosolv R combined with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> was more efficient in material removal compared to chloroform combined with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> alone (P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in-vitro}} {{study was}} to compare the accuracy of two new electronic apex-locator controlled handpieces (EALHs) using the first <b>rotary</b> Mtwo <b>file</b> while rotating in the canal. A total of 36 extracted mandibular molar teeth were selected. The lengths of the mesio-buccal canals to the major foramina were measured directly using a size 10 K-file introduced in the canal until the tip was visible under a loupe and then 0. 5 mm was subtracted from the recorded lengths as the actual working lengths (AWLs). Subsequently, the teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups and embedded in an alginate model. Auto-stop function of the EALHs was preset at " 0. 5 " mark and then electrical working lengths (EWLs) in groups 1 and 2 were recorded by VDW GOLD and Dentaport ZX, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA, 1 -way) and Tukey pairwise multiple comparison intervals (0. 05) were used to compare the accuracy of the two electronic devices. For VDW GOLD, 61. 1 % of the measurements were within ± 0. 5 mm and 88. 9 % were within ± 1 mm of the AWL. For Dentaport ZX, 88. 9 % of the measurements were within ± 0. 5 mm and 94. 4 % were within ± 1 mm of the AWL. There {{was no significant difference between}} AWLs and EWLs (p= 0. 466 for Dentaport ZX and p= 0. 283 for VDW Gold) and between the accuracy of the two devices in determining the EWL (p= 0. 8). Both Dentaport ZX and VDW Gold were suitable for determining working length using a <b>rotary</b> <b>file.</b> To avoid over instrumenting the canal, we recommend setting the devices to automatically stop or reverse the <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> at 1 mm level...|$|R

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the dentinal cracks after root canal preparation with rotary files: Gates Glidden, ProTaper Universal, ProTaper Next, and HyFlex CM at different instrumentation lengths. Methodology. Sixty-five mandibular premolars were mounted in the acrylic tube with simulated periodontal ligaments and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented with different <b>rotary</b> <b>files,</b> namely, ProTaper Universal, ProTaper Next, and HyFlex CM, to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, and beyond AF.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{incidence}} of apical root cracks and dentinal detachments after canal preparation with hand and <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> at different instrumentation lengths. Methods Two hundred forty mandibular incisors were mounted in resin blocks with simulated periodontal ligaments, and the apex was exposed. The root canals were instrumented with rotary and hand files, namely K 3, ProTaper, and nickel-titanium Flex K files to the major apical foramen (AF), short AF, or beyond AF. Digital images of the apical surface of every tooth were taken during the apical enlargement at each file change. Development of dentinal defects was determined by comparing these images with the baseline image. Multinomial logistic regression test was performed to identify influencing factors. Results Apical crack developed in 1 of 80 teeth (1. 3 %) with hand files and 31 of 160 teeth (19. 4 %) with <b>rotary</b> <b>files.</b> Apical dentinal detachment developed in 2 of 80 teeth (2. 5 %) with hand files and 35 of 160 teeth (21. 9 %) with <b>rotary</b> <b>files.</b> Instrumentation with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> terminated 2 mm short of AF and did not cause any cracks. Significantly less cracks and detachments occurred when instrumentation with <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> was terminated short of AF, as compared with that terminated at or beyond AF (P <. 05). The AF deviated from the anatomic apex in 128 of 240 teeth (53 %). Significantly more apical dentinal detachments appeared in teeth with a deviated AF (P =. 033). Conclusions Rotary instruments caused more dentinal defects than hand instruments; instrumentation short of AF reduced the risk of dentinal defects...|$|E
