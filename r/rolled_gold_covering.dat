50|$|The system evolved out of less rigid racial {{practices}} {{under the}} American-owned Panama Railroad and the earlier French-led canal effort. But {{the system was}} gradually tightened up specifically to enforce racial segregationist policies. This process took place between 1905 and 1908 under Chief Engineer John Stevens and his successor, George Washington Goethals, and even {{played a role in}} the U.S. presidential election of 1908. Skilled workers from the West Indies were demoted to the silver <b>roll.</b> The <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> was explicitly limited to U.S. and Panamanian citizens by order of U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft during his 1908 presidential campaign, in response to demands by American labor unions. A small number of black American citizens were also employed on the <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> but were denied <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> privileges. In response to their protests, the canal authorities stopped hiring black U.S. citizens. Hardly any black American citizens remained on the canal workforce after 1909.|$|R

2500|$|During its {{construction}} {{and into the}} 1940s, the labor force in the Canal Zone (which was almost entirely publicly employed) was divided into a [...] "gold" [...] roll (short for payroll) classification, and a [...] "silver" [...] roll classification. The origins of this system are unclear, {{but it was the}} practice on the 19th-century Panama Railroad to pay Americans in US gold and local workers in silver coin. Although some Canal Zone officials compared the <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> to military officers and the silver roll to enlisted men, the characteristic that determined on which roll an employee was placed was race. With very few exceptions, American and Northern European whites were placed on the <b>gold</b> <b>roll,</b> and blacks and southern European whites on the silver roll. American blacks were generally not hired; black employees were from the Caribbean, often from Barbados and Jamaica. American whites seeking work as laborers, which were almost entirely silver roll positions, were discouraged from applying. In {{the early days of the}} system, bosses could promote exceptional workers from silver to gold, but this practice soon ceased as race came to be the determining factor. As a result of the initial policy, there were several hundred skilled blacks and southern Europeans on the <b>gold</b> <b>roll.</b> In November 1906, Chief Engineer John Stevens ordered that most blacks on the <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> be placed on the silver roll instead (a few remained in such roles as teachers and postmasters); the following month, the Canal Commission reported that the 3,700 <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> employees were [...] "almost all white Americans" [...] and the 13,000 silver roll workers were [...] "mostly aliens". On February 8, 1908, President Roosevelt ordered that no further non-Americans be placed on the <b>gold</b> <b>roll.</b> After Panamanians objected, the <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> was reopened to them in December 1908; however, efforts to remove blacks and non-Americans from the <b>gold</b> <b>roll</b> continued.|$|R
