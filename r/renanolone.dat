50|$|<b>Renanolone</b> (INN), or 11-ketopregnanolone, {{also known}} as 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} neuroactive steroid which {{is described as a}} general anesthetic but was never introduced for clinical use. Its isomers, alfaxolone and alfadolone, are also general anesthetics, and are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, a property which is likely the case for <b>renanolone</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} derivatives and analogues of allopregnanolone with similar activity and effects exist, including alfadolone (3α,21-dihydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), alfaxolone (3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione), ganaxolone (3α-hydroxy-3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), minaxolone (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one), Org 20599 (21-chloro-3α-hydroxy-2β-morpholin-4-yl-5β-pregnan-20-one), Org 21465 (2β-(2,2-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl)-3α-hydroxy-11,20-dioxo-5α-pregnan-21-yl methanesulfonate), and <b>renanolone</b> (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-11,20-dione).|$|E
50|$|Alfaxalone, {{also known}} as 11-oxo-3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone {{has been reduced to}} a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. Alfaxalone is also a derivative of allopregnanolone (5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one), differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include ganaxolone (3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), minaxolone (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), pregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), and <b>renanolone</b> (5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione).|$|E
