5|$|From medieval times, English {{companies}} {{thrived in}} Calais. Calais {{was a particularly}} important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware. Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> cotton yarn and cork. During the five years 1901–1905 the average annual value of exports was £8,388,000 (£6,363,000 in the years 1896–1900), of imports £4,145,000 (£3,759,000 in 1896–1900).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, English wool export shifted from <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> to {{processed}} cloth, resulting in losses for the cloth manufacturers of the Low Countries. In the Baltic and North Sea, the Hanseatic League reached {{the peak of}} their power in the 14th century, but started going into decline in the fifteenth.|$|E
40|$|An optical {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring the mean weight density of <b>raw</b> glass <b>wool</b> in manufacturing plant.

Mean error of the system was about 10 %, which was enough accuracy {{to be used in the}} practical plant. The system may further be applied for the quality control of manufacturing <b>raw</b> glass <b>wool...</b>|$|R
60|$|These saddle {{bags are}} most fascinating. They are {{coarsely}} woven in bands of <b>raw</b> black-rusty <b>wool,</b> with varying bands of <b>raw</b> white <b>wool</b> or hemp or cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours, rose-red {{and blue and}} green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags, some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in themselves.|$|R
50|$|On 31 December 1881, a {{group of}} 127 {{businessmen}} and traders from Sabadell Barcelona founded the Bank {{with the purpose of}} financing local industries and providing them with <b>raw</b> materials (<b>wool</b> and coal) under more favourable conditions.|$|R
25|$|Prices {{certainly}} fell, {{but almost}} every other index of economic activity - output of coal and pig iron, tonnage of ships built, consumption of <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> and cotton, import and export figures, shipping entries and clearances, railway freight clearances, joint-stock company formations, trading profits, consumption per head of wheat, meat, tea, beer, and tobacco - all of these showed an upward trend.|$|E
25|$|Though this {{influence}} may be exaggerated also: the French at {{this time}} had practically no part in the carrying trade, and the Dutch dominated the export of Spain's main export, <b>raw</b> <b>wool.</b> For political reasons (Portugal was {{at war with the}} Dutch in the same period over the aftermath of the reconquest of Dutch Brazil) the English predominated in the Portuguese trade. The Dutch dominated the salt trade with Portugal, however, also because the 1661 peace treaty stipulated that the war indemnity imposed on Portugal to compensate the WIC for the loss of Brazil, would be paid in that commodity. This was important, because Portuguese salt was better suited than high-magnesium French salt for the preservation of herring.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} mediaeval Dundee centred on {{the export of}} <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> with the {{production}} of finished textiles being a reaction to recession in the 15th century. Two government Acts in the mid 18th century {{had a profound effect}} on Dundee's industrial success: the textile industry was revolutionised by the introduction of large four-storey mills, stimulated in part by the 1742 Bounty Act which provided a government-funded subsidy on Osnaburg linen produced for export. Expansion of the whaling industry was triggered by the second Bounty Act, introduced in 1750 to increase Britain's maritime and naval skill base. Dundee, and Scotland more generally, saw rapid population increase at end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the city's population increasing from 12,400 in 1751 to 30,500 in 1821.|$|E

40|$|An optical {{method to}} measure the weight density of <b>raw</b> glass <b>wool</b> has been {{developed}} {{for use in a}} manufacturing plant. The method is based on the light developed for use in manufacturing plant. The method is based on the light attenuation theory. The system consists of the usual white light as a light source, a solar cell as a light-sensitive receiver, an amplifier, a personal computer with an A/D converter for data acquisition and a monitor for display of the data. The accuracy of the system was found to be above 98 % and the system can be effectively applied to practical use in the factory. The system may be further applied for quality control in manufacturing <b>raw</b> glass <b>wool...</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{is a small}} cottage {{industry}} of carpet makers in the city, primarily employing women. The advantages for the local carpet makers are the availability of cheap <b>raw</b> materials, <b>wool</b> from the desert Bedu who use Samawah as their main trading post, {{and the availability of}} cheap labour in this poor city.|$|R
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to establish with any certainty {{the exact number of}} inhabitants in England at the eve of the Black Death, and estimates range from 3 to 7 million. The number is probably in the higher end, and an estimate of around 6 million inhabitants seems likely. Earlier demographic crises − in particular the Great Famine of 1315–1317 − had resulted in great numbers of deaths, but {{there is no evidence of}} any significant decrease in the population prior to 1348. England was still a predominantly rural and agrarian society; close to 90% of the population lived on the countryside. Of the major cities, London was in a class of its own, with perhaps as many as 70,000 inhabitants. Further down the scale were Norwich, with around 12,000 people, and York with around 10,000. The main export, and the source of the nation's wealth, was wool. Until the middle of the century the export had consisted primarily of <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> to cloth makers in Flanders. Gradually though, the technology for cloth making used on the Continent was appropriated by English manufacturers, who started an export of cloths around mid-century that would boom over the following decades.|$|E

500|$|Up until 1962, {{before the}} pass was sealed, goods such as pens, watches, cereals, cotton cloth, edible oils, soaps, {{building}} materials, and dismantled scooters and four-wheelers were exported to Tibet through the pass on mule-back. Two hundred mules, each carrying about [...] of load, {{were used to}} ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa, which used to take 20–25 days. Upon return, silk, <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> musk pods, medicinal plants, country liquor, precious stones, gold, and silverware were imported into India. Most of the trade {{in those days was}} carried out by the Marwari community, which owned 95% of the 200 authorised firms.|$|E
40|$|Cotton wool {{for use in}} {{medicine}} must be sterilized and heat treatment {{is the most common}} sterilization technique for bulk processing of agricultural materials. Modelling the effect of temperature variations on specific death rate of the micro-flora of <b>raw</b> cotton <b>wool</b> was carried out in this project. The <b>raw</b> cotton <b>wool</b> was collected from a farmer in Kano State, the most important cotton wool producing state of Nigeria. The micro-flora was determined by inoculating and incubating with 0. 85 % NaCl diluents and the number of bacteria determined by plate count method. As the sterilization temperatures were varied with increased time, the thermal death rates and thermal death time of the micro-flora were determined for each temperature and these was used in the modelling. The model lnK = 83. 9 – 34190 (1 /T) shows that the sterilization temperature has a linear relationship with the death rate constant and it is in line with Arrhenius model...|$|R
5000|$|The Jews {{were active}} in all the stages of production: dyeing, {{spinning}} and weaving. [...] The women {{were involved in the}} spinning the <b>raw,</b> short-fibered <b>wool</b> at home while the weaving was performed in workshops. [...] Scholars residing in Safed {{who were involved in the}} business included Rabbi Moses Galante who owned a factory and Rabbis Moses Berab, Menachem HaBavli and his brother Reuben who were wool dyers.|$|R
2500|$|In August 1815, {{the manager}} of the cotton factory, named the [...] "Bridgeport Manufacturing Company", {{announced}} that it was ready to begin operations. Using Daniel French's steam engines the company would process <b>raw</b> cotton and <b>wool</b> into yarn.|$|R
2500|$|Pendleton Woolen Mills is a {{maker of}} wool blankets, shirts, and an {{assortment}} of other woolen goods. Founded in 1909 by Clarence, Roy and Chauncey Bishop, the company built upon earlier businesses related to the many sheep ranches in the region. A wool-scouring plant [...] opened in Pendleton in 1893 to wash <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> for shipping. In 1895, the scouring mill was converted into a mill that made wool blankets and robes for Native Americans. Both businesses failed to survive, but the Bishops, {{with the help of a}} local bond issue, enlarged the mill and improved its efficiency. They developed a successful line of garments and blankets with [...] "vivid colors and intricate patterns." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{worldwide}} primacy {{in trade}} {{would not have}} been possible if it only rested on Dutch primacy in the carrying trade. After all, one has to trade something. Even where the counterparty is primarily interested in gold and silver as means of exchange, as in South-East Asia, that specie must be earned by a surplus on the balance of payments with other trading partners. A surplus in [...] "invisibles", like shipping services, would not suffice to cover the enormous financing requirement of the spice trade. At first, the Dutch had little indigenous to offer, beyond herring and dairy products. But the industrial revolution of the early 17th century brought an industry into being that by the 1640s had matured enough to play an important part in Dutch exports. This industrial growth was partly innovation driven, stimulating all kinds of heretofore not seen mechanization, that greatly enhanced labor productivity, thereby driving down prices for Dutch products, even while nominal wages rose steeply at the same time. But the commerce-engendered Dutch control of many raw-material markets (like Spanish and Turkish <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> Swedish iron and copper, Ibero-American dyestuffs, Portuguese salt, French wine, Baltic grain, Scandinavian tar and wood, Caribbean sugar, American tobacco etc.) was an important factor in stimulating the booms of the industries that used those materials: textiles, guns, vinegar, shipbuilding, sugar and salt refining, tobacco blending, to name only a few. [...] The Dutch entrepot was therefore supplied by an important domestic industrial sector, and not limited to reexporting wares obtained abroad. Industry and commerce were in this period closely integrated (though in later stages of the Dutch economy they would become disaggregated again, when foreign protection and a structurally high real-wage level forced the decline of the Dutch industrial sector).|$|E
2500|$|With the {{settlement}} of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, {{there was no longer}} any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands. [...] Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits. [...] As they did so they found that {{there was a great deal}} of demand for their products. [...] Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands. [...] However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere. [...] The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool. [...] Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins. [...] Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its [...] "Golden Age." [...] Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time. The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.|$|E
50|$|During the {{worldwide}} depression (1931 to 1934), Japanese exterior commerce grew. The expansion of this trade {{was in part}} due to European difficulties in supplying their colonies, allowing Japan to expand into new markets. Before the war, crude silk represented one-third of exports and 10% of processed silk. Other products for export were rayon, cotton, processed silk and others. In 1937 exports were crude silk, cotton fabrics, and rayon. Japan was importing <b>raw</b> cotton, <b>wool,</b> and oil imported products.|$|R
25|$|In the countryside, where guild rules did not operate, {{there was}} {{freedom for the}} {{entrepreneur}} with capital to organize cottage industry, a network of cottagers who spun and wove in their own premises on his account, provided with their raw materials, perhaps even their looms, by the capitalist who took {{a share of the}} profits. Such a dispersed system could not so easily be controlled where there was a vigorous local market for the <b>raw</b> materials: <b>wool</b> was easily available in sheep-rearing regions, whereas silk was not.|$|R
50|$|The <b>raw</b> Pashmina <b>wool</b> is then {{transported to}} the valley of Kashmir in {{northern}} India, where it is entirely hand processed. All steps from combing (removing impurities and guard hair, and aligning fibers) and spinning, to weaving and finishing, is entirely carried out by hand by specialized craftsmen and women. The major center of Pashmina fabric production is the old district of Srinagar, capital of Indian Jammu and Kashmir. The approximate craft time put into producing a single Pashmina stole (70x200cm) is 180 hours.|$|R
60|$|Let us {{run over}} the chief items again: (1) Iron goods. In view of Germany's loss of resources, an {{increased}} net export seems impossible {{and a large}} decrease probable. (2) Machinery. Some increase is possible. (3) Coal and coke. The value of Germany's net export before the war was $110,000,000; the Allies have agreed that {{for the time being}} 20,000,000 tons is the maximum possible export with a problematic (and in fact) impossible increase to 40,000,000 tons at some future time; even on the basis of 20,000,000 tons we have virtually no increase of value, measured in pre-war prices;[129] whilst, if this amount is exacted, there must be a decrease of far greater value in the export of manufactured articles requiring coal for their production. (4) Woolen goods. An increase is impossible without the <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> and, having regard to the other claims on supplies of <b>raw</b> <b>wool,</b> a decrease is likely. (5) Cotton goods. The same considerations apply as to wool. (6) Cereals. There never was and never can be a net export. (7) Leather goods. The same considerations apply as to wool.|$|E

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the woollen mill in Ipswich provided a centrally located processing plant for the <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> produced on the Darling Downs. Prior to {{the building of the}} woollen mill the <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> was sent for processing to Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide (all of which already had well established wool processing plants), but this was costly and inefficient. The Ipswich mill allowed <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> to be processed locally, benefiting the Darling Downs' sheep graziers. It was also an important indicator that the Queensland economy was developing beyond the supply of raw materials, and vertical integration was occurring, in this case for the sheep industry.|$|E

50|$|They came to {{prominence}} when weavers from Flanders {{settled in the}} area, having been displaced by {{what came to be}} known as 'the hundred years war'. Up to that time the English wool trade with the rest of Europe was mostly in the form of the export of <b>raw</b> <b>wool.</b> However, exports of woven cloth quickly replaced the export of <b>raw</b> <b>wool</b> (the latter being heavily taxed by Edward 111 to help finance the war) and those engaged in the trade began to amass great wealth.|$|E
