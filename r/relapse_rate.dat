5|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills have contradictory {{results from}} different studies regarding any effect of decreasing <b>relapse</b> <b>rate</b> {{in women with}} multiple sclerosis. Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as carbamazepine (used to treat spasms and pain) and modafinil (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective.|$|E
5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of <b>relapse</b> <b>rate</b> reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the <b>relapse</b> <b>rate</b> more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product.

40|$|Relapses are a {{characteristic}} clinical feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), but {{an appreciation of}} factors that cause them remains elusive. In this study, we have examined seasonal variation of relapse in a large population-based MS cohort and correlated observed patterns with age, sex, disease course, and climatic factors. Relapse data were recorded prospectively in 2076 patients between 2005 and 2014. 3902 events were recorded in 1158 patients (range 0 – 24). There was significant seasonal variation in <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> (p < 0. 0001) and this was associated with monthly hours of sunshine (odds ratio OR 1. 08, p = 0. 02). <b>Relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were highest in patients {{under the age of}} 30 (OR 1. 42, p = 0. 0005) and decreased with age.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to increase the knowledge about the relationship of positive health behaviors and smoking <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> in order to improve future smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions. This study examined the correlations between infant feeding method (breastfeed and formula feed), smoking <b>relapse</b> <b>rates,</b> and other health behaviors in the postpartum time period. The study is part of a larger, postpartum, nurse-delivered smoking cessation intervention sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Foundation. Forty-two women from the primary intervention were included in this study. Data was collected at baseline on socio-economic status, household environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and knowledge of health-related factors surrounding smoking. Data was again collected in the postpartum time period at six months on breastfeeding status and smoking status. Fourteen women made no attempt to breastfeed and 28 women breastfed their infant for various degrees of time. The breastfeeding group was older (mean = 24. 5, SD = 5. 24) compared to the non-breastfeeding group (mean = 21. 2, SD = 2. 74) (p= 0. 012) and had more years of education (mean = 13. 2, SD = 2. 86) compared to the non-breastfeeding group (mean = 11. 3, SD = 1. 68) (p= 0. 009). The breastfeeding group was significantly less dependent on nicotine than the non-breastfeeding group, as measured by time to first cigarette (p= 0. 023). Abstinence and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were not significantly different among women who breastfed for different lengths of time. Knowledge of health-related factors, ETS conditions and abstinence and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were also not significant by different infant feeding groups. Further research is needed to explore these variables in order to find links between postpartum behaviors and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> to influence positive postpartum interventions. This {{is one of the few}} studies to investigate the relationship of women's health behaviors and infant feeding methods.

40|$|Background: Relapse {{is common}} among {{recovered}} anorexia nervosa (AN) patients. Studies on relapse prevention {{with an average}} follow-up period of 18 months found <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> between 35 and 41 %. In leading guidelines there is general consensus that relapse prevention in patients treated for AN {{is a matter of}} essence. However, lack of methodological support hinders the practical implementation of relapse prevention strategies in clinical practice. For this reason we developed the Guideline Relapse Prevention Anorexia Nervosa. In this study we examine the rate, timing and predictors of relapse when using this guideline. Method: Cohort study with 83 AN patients who were enrolled in a relapse prevention program for anorexia nervosa with 18 months follow-up. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meijer survival analyses and Cox regression. Results: Eleven percent of the participants experienced a full relapse, 19 % a partial relapse, 70 % did not relapse. Survival analyses indicated that in the first four months of the program no full relapses occurred. The highest risk of full relapse was between months 4 and 16. None of the variables remained a significant predictor of relapse in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusion: The guideline offers structured procedures for relapse prevention. In this study the <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were relatively low compared to <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> in previous studies. We recommend that all patients with AN set up a personalized relapse prevention plan {{at the end of their}} treatment and be monitored at least 18 months after discharge. It may significantly contribute to the reduction of <b>relapse</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

25|$|All TB regimens in {{use were}} 18 months or longer until the {{appearance}} of rifampicin. In 1953, the standard UK regimen was 3SPH/15PH or 3SPH/15SH2. Between 1965 and 1970, EMB replaced PAS. RMP began {{to be used to}} treat TB in 1968 and the BTS study in the 1970s showed that 2HRE/7HR was efficacious. In 1984, a BTS study showed that 2HRZ/4HR was efficacious, with a <b>relapse</b> <b>rate</b> of less than 3% after two years. In 1995, with the recognition that INH resistance was increasing, the British Thoracic Society recommended adding EMB or STM to the regimen: 2HREZ/4HR or 2SHRZ/4HR, which are the regimens currently recommended. The WHO also recommend a six-month continuation phase of HR if the patient is still culture positive after 2 months of treatment (approximately 15% of patients with fully sensitive TB) and for those patients who have extensive bilateral cavitation at the start of treatment.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Persistent cue {{reactivity}} to drug-related stimuli is {{a well-known}} phenomenon among abstinent drug users and {{has been found to}} be a predictor of relapse. Cue exposure therapy (CET) aims to reduce this cue reactivity by exposing abstinent drug users to conditioned drug-related stimuli while preventing their habitual response, i. e. drug use. METHODS: 127 abstinent heroin-dependent Dutch inpatients were randomized to CET (n = 65; 55 completers) and placebo psychotherapy treatment (PPT) (n = 62; 59 completers). It was examined whether CET would lead to a decrease in drug-related cue reactivity (using mixed-design ANOVA) and subsequently to lower dropout and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> (using logistic regression) compared to PPT. RESULTS: Both groups responded with a similar decrease in self-reported cue reactivity (craving, mood). The CET group did show a significant decrease in physiological reactivity (skin conductance) compared to PPT. However, dropout and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were, contrary to our expectations, significantly higher in the CET group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial showing that CET, compared to a non-specific psychotherapy, might increase dropout and <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> among abstinent heroin-dependent clients in a drug-free setting. Caution is warranted when applying CET in this specific contex...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Report {{long-term}} {{safety and}} effectiveness of natalizumab over 240 weeks in the prospective, observational, open-label Safety of TYSABRI Re-dosing and Treatment (STRATA) Study. Methods: Patients (N 5 1, 094) previously enrolled in natalizumab multiple sclerosis clinical trials received natalizumab 300 mg IV every 4 weeks, up to 240 weeks. Serious adverse events, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and annualized <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> were analyzed. Results: At data cutoff (February 9, 2012), natalizumab exposure was 3, 460 patient-years; a median of 56 (range 1 - 70) infusions were received. Serious adverse events, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, were consistent with natalizumab's known profile. Upon natalizumab re-exposure, rates of anti-natalizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions were 3 % and 5 % overall, and 40 % and 24 % among patients with 1 to 2 prior natalizumab doses. Patients originally randomized to placebo/another disease-modifying therapy vs natalizumab in previous studies had significantly higher EDSS scores at STRATA baseline; this difference persisted over 240 weeks. EDSS scores generally remained stable. Patients initially randomized to natalizumab had lower annualized <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> over 240 weeks. Conclusions: Serious adverse events were consistent with natalizumab's known safety profile; short exposure with a gap before redosing was associated with higher incidences of antinatalizumab antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions. Stability of EDSS scores and consistently low <b>relapse</b> <b>rates</b> over 5 years of natalizumab treatment are consistent with its known efficacy profile. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis, natalizumab stabilizes EDSS scores, decreases <b>relapse</b> <b>rates,</b> and is {{associated with an increased}} risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology...|$|R

Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment.

25|$|National policymakers have {{recently}} shifted their position and publicly acknowledged {{the extent and}} pattern of increasing drug use, {{which has led to}} a rapid increase in treatment options for drug users. According to the regulations on the prohibition of narcotics, drug users identified by authorities for the first time are fined or sent to a voluntary detoxification center run by the health system, which might include short-term use of methadone, buprenorphine, or traditional Chinese medicine. Detoxification costs 2000–5000 yuan (about US$250–625) for one phase of treatment. If, as often happens, the treatment is not successful, relapsing patients identified by authorities are sent to a compulsory rehabilitation center, administered by the Ministry of Public Security, for 3–6 months. Those with multiple relapses are detained in a re-education-through-labor center, managed by the Ministry of Justice, for 1–3 years. In reality, internment procedures and durations vary enormously between administrative units. In general, centers focus on detoxification. Although some health education or treatment is provided, the <b>relapse</b> <b>rate</b> is extremely high.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychological}} dependence associated with morphine addiction {{is complex and}} protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think {{and talk about the}} use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process. Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including {{psychological dependence}}. A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its <b>relapse</b> <b>rate.</b> Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.|$|E
