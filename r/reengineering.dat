25|$|Others {{have claimed}} that <b>reengineering</b> was a {{recycled}} buzzword for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for <b>Reengineering</b> peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that <b>Reengineering</b> was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the assembly line in 1908, he was in fact <b>reengineering,</b> radically changing the way of thinking in an organization).|$|E
25|$|Many {{companies}} used <b>reengineering</b> as {{a pretext}} to downsizing, though {{this was not the}} intent of reengineering's proponents; consequently, <b>reengineering</b> earned a reputation for being synonymous with downsizing and layoffs.|$|E

25|$|An easy {{to follow}} seven step INSPIRE {{framework}} is developed by Bhudeb Chakravarti which can be followed by any Process Analyst to perform BPR. The seven steps of the framework are Initiate a new process <b>reengineering</b> project and prepare a business case for the same; Negotiate with senior management to get approval to start the process <b>reengineering</b> project; Select the key processes {{that need to be}} reengineered; Plan the process <b>reengineering</b> activities; Investigate the processes to analyze the problem areas; Redesign the selected processes to improve the performance and Ensure the successful implementation of redesigned processes through proper monitoring and evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Business process <b>reengineering</b> is {{also known}} as {{business}} process redesign, business transformation, or business process change management.|$|E
25|$|Despite this critique, <b>reengineering</b> {{was adopted}} at an {{accelerating}} pace and by 1993, {{as many as}} 60% of the Fortune 500 companies claimed to either have initiated <b>reengineering</b> efforts, or to have plans to do so. This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, {{but also by the}} study Made in America, conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, time-to-market and productivity.|$|E
25|$|According to Eliyahu M. Goldratt (and his Theory of Constraints) <b>reengineering</b> {{does not}} provide an {{effective}} way to focus improvement efforts on the organization's constraint.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reengineering</b> {{assumes that}} the factor that limits an organization's {{performance}} is the ineffectiveness of its processes (which {{may or may not}} be true) and offers no means of validating that assumption.|$|E
25|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) {{has historically}} {{played an important}} role in the <b>reengineering</b> concept. It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders.|$|E
25|$|If successful, a BPM {{initiative}} {{can result}} in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of <b>reengineering</b> projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.|$|E
25|$|When {{the process}} becomes too complex or inefficient, and {{optimization}} is not fetching the desired output, {{it is usually}} recommended by a company steering committee chaired by the president / CEO to re-engineer the entire process cycle. Business process <b>reengineering</b> (BPR) {{has been used by}} organizations to attempt to achieve efficiency and productivity at work.|$|E
25|$|Michael Hammer and James Champy {{felt that}} these {{resources}} needed to be restructured. In a process that they labeled <b>reengineering,</b> firm's reorganized their assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.|$|E
25|$|Business Process <b>Reengineering</b> (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E
25|$|With the {{publication}} of critiques in 1995 and 1996 {{by some of the}} early BPR proponents, coupled with abuses and misuses of the concept by others, the <b>reengineering</b> fervor in the U.S. began to wane. Since then, considering business processes {{as a starting point for}} business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} Yugo {{vehicles}} (Red, White, and Blue) {{were introduced to}} the U.S. public at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in May 1984 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front page articles about the Yugo appeared in the Los Angeles Times (Business Section), New York Times, and The National Enquirer. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the California Air Research Board (CARB) for emissions testingâ€“ it failed abysmally. The Yugo needed lots of <b>reengineering,</b> and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.|$|E
25|$|Re-engineering {{recognizes that}} an organization's {{business}} processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and {{tasks that are}} carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one {{is responsible for the}} overall performance of the entire process. <b>Reengineering</b> maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process <b>reengineering,</b> lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E
25|$|Political {{considerations}} then intruded. Illinois {{politician and}} Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand obtained permission from Lincoln to recruit an army in southern Illinois and command it on a river-born expedition aimed at Vicksburg. He {{was able to}} get Sherman's corps assigned to him, but it departed Memphis before McClernand could arrive. When Sherman returned from the Yazoo, McClernand asserted control. He inexplicably detoured from his primary objective by capturing Arkansas Post on the Arkansas River, but before he could resume his main advance, Grant had reasserted control, and McClernand became a corps commander in Grant's army. For the rest of the winter, Grant attempted five separate projects to reach the city by moving through or <b>reengineering,</b> rivers, canals, and bayous to the north of Vicksburg. All five were unsuccessful; Grant explained afterward that he had expected these setbacks and was simply attempting to keep his army busy and motivated, but many historians believe he really hoped that some would succeed and that they were too ambitious.|$|E
500|$|While in the {{planning}} stages, the ride {{was going to be}} named Velocetron and themed as The Man of Steel. The ride was announced on January 5, 1996 as Superman: The Escape, breaking records as the first roller coaster to reach , passing Desperado and Phantom's Revenge at [...] The ride was designed by Intamin, a Swiss roller coaster firm. It was originally intended to open on June 1, 1996. However, due to a range of problems with the launch system, its opening was delayed. In late 1996, there was a preview for season pass holders. After 10 months of testing and <b>reengineering,</b> the ride opened on March 15, 1997. After its opening, the media claimed Superman to be the fastest roller coaster in the world. However, since it was delayed, a similar roller coaster known as Tower of Terror, which also has a , had opened about a month earlier at Dreamworld in Australia. Superman therefore lost its claim as being the first roller coaster to reach , although it was then tied with Tower of Terror as the fastest roller coaster in the world. However, the ride became the first roller coaster in the world to go over 400ft, therefore becoming the tallest roller coaster in the world at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Business process <b>reengineering</b> (BPR) is the {{practice}} of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs. <b>Reengineering</b> starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and customer needs. Basic questions are asked, such as [...] "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?"

[...] Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them. [...] As a result, process <b>reengineering</b> is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent. [...] To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and <b>reengineering</b> complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organizationâ€™s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process.
