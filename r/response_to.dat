On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts and probes were nondifferentially reinforced was compared with procedures whereby correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts and probes were differentially reinforced according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts and probes were reinforced nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every correct response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on a CRF schedule and correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> prompts combined with the CRF schedule for correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of correct <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> probes, the highest accuracy (correct <b>responses</b> relative <b>to</b> correct <b>responses</b> plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

The <b>response</b> <b>to</b> Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering that she was a sex slave, and his cold <b>response</b> <b>to</b> her death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been a topic of racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the serologic <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Pneumocystis jirovecii major surface {{glycoprotein}} (Msg) antigen in African cohorts, or the IgM <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Msg in HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons with respiratory symptoms. We conducted a prospective study of 550 patients, both HIV-positive (n = 467) and HIV-negative (n = 83), hospitalized with cough ≥ 2 weeks in Kampala, Uganda, to evaluate the association between HIV status, CD 4 cell count, and other clinical predictors and antibody <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> P. jirovecii. We utilized ELISA to measure the IgM and IgG serologic <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> three overlapping recombinant fragments that span the P. jirovecii major surface glycoprotein: MsgA (amino terminus), MsgB (middle portion) and MsgC 1 (carboxyl terminus), and to three variations of MsgC 1 (MsgC 3, MsgC 8 and MsgC 9). HIV-positive patients demonstrated significantly lower IgM antibody <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgC 1, MsgC 3, MsgC 8 and MsgC 9 compared to HIV-negative patients. We found the same pattern of low IgM antibody <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgC 1, MsgC 3, MsgC 8 and MsgC 9 among HIV-positive patients with a CD 4 cell count < 200 cells/µl compared to those with a CD 4 cell count ≥ 200 cells/µl. HIV-positive patients on PCP prophylaxis had significantly lower IgM <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgC 3 and MsgC 9, and lower IgG <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgA, MsgC 1, MsgC 3, and MsgC 8. In contrast, cigarette smoking was associated with increased IgM antibody <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgC 1 and MsgC 3 but was not associated with IgG responses. We evaluated IgM and IgG as predictors of mortality. Lower IgM <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MsgC 3 and MsgC 8 were both associated with increased in-hospital mortality. HIV infection and degree of immunosuppression are associated with reduced IgM <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> Msg.

40|$|Do microtubules {{influence}} growth <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> environmental stimuli in plants? Microtubules (MTs) have numerous {{roles in}} plant development and these functions are assisted by Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs). To further explore MT function we study a MAP called END BINDING 1 (EB 1). Previous analysis of eb 1 mutants indicates root defects in <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> mechanical stimulation (MS) and/or gravity. To determine whether EB 1 activity contributes <b>to</b> root <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MS or gravity or both, two approaches were taken. First, I analyze {{the effects of}} altering the type and amount of MS perceived by the root. Second, I analyzed double mutants between eb 1 b and plants carrying mutations in genes associated with <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> MS and gravity.

40|$|The subtypes of postjunctional a-adrenoceptors {{activated}} by neuronally released and exogenous norepinephrine {{and the source}} of calcium used for vasoconstrictor responses were investigated in the feline mesenteric vascular bed. Under constant flow conditions, intra-arterial injections of phenyl-ephrine and UK 14304, a,- and a 2 -adrenoceptor agonists, increased mesenteric arterial perfusion pressure in a dose-related manner. Prazosin, an a,-antagonist, reduced vasoconstrictor <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> phenylephrine without altering <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> UK 14304. Yohimbine, an a 2 -antagonist, reduced <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> UK 14304 without altering <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> phenylephrine. The same pattern of blockade was observed in animals pretreated with 6 -hydroxydopamine to destroy the integrity of adrenergic terminals. <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> phenylephrine and UK 14304 were reduced by nitrendipine, a calcium-entry blocking agent, and this agent decreased vasoconstrictor <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> sympathetic nerve stimulation, tyramine, and norepinephrine. <b>Responses</b> <b>to</b> sympathetic nerve stimulation were selectively blocked by prazosin, but <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> norepinephrine were selectively blocked by yohimbine. Vasoconstrictor <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> tyramine were reduced by both prazosin and yohimbine. Nitrendipine also reduced <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> angiotensin II, U 46619, a prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue, Bay K 8644, and potassium chloride. These data suggest the presence of a,- and postjunctional a 2 -adrenoceptors and support the hypothesis that norepinephrine released by nerve excitation acts mainly on a,-receptors but that exogenous norepinephrine acts primarily on a 2 -receptors. However, norepinephrine released by tyramine acts on both receptor subtypes. Nitrendipine inhibited <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> the a,- and a 2 -adrenoceptor agonists as well as those to nerve released and exogenous norepinephrine, the calcium agonist, Bay K 8644, and to other vasoconstrictor agents. These data suggest that in the feline mesenteric vascular bed, an extracellular source of calcium ions is required for vasoconstriction induced by a variety of mechanisms including activation of a,- and postjunctional a 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that interactions of endogenous angiotensin II (AII) with the noradrenergic neuroeffector junction are important in renin-dependent hypertension. In the in situ blood-perfused rat mesentery, in normal rats exogenous AII potentiated mesenteric vascular <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> periarterial (sympathetic) nerve stimulation (PNS) more than vascular <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> exogenous norepinephrine (NE). In 2 -kidney- 1 -clip (2 K- 1 C) rats with renovascular hypertension mesenteric vascular <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> PNS and NE were greater than in sham-operated rats, and renovascular hypertension mimicked the effects of exogenous AII with respect <b>to</b> enhancing <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> PNS more than <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> NE.

Finally, 1 -Sar- 8 -Ile-AII attenuated sympathetic nerve stimulation-induced neuronal spillover of NE in 2 K- 1 C rats, but not in sham-operated rats.
