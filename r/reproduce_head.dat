40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 65) The {{advent of}} helical scan recording systems {{has brought about}} the necessity for more sophisticated tracking systems. The {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of data reproduced from the tape decreases dramatically if the <b>reproduce</b> <b>head</b> is not exactly aligned with the recorded track. Any loss of SNR directly affects the probability of data reproduction errors. An example of one such tracking control system is presented. This system is designed to provide for optimum overlap of the <b>reproduce</b> <b>head</b> on. the recorded track. This is accomplished by continuously comparing signal levels obtained from the tap with previous values, and applying control signals to maintain a maximum average level. The system is composed of two basic elements: the capstan servo, and a digital portion, known as autophasing. In itself, the capstan servo constitutes a feedback control system responsible for maintaining tape position and velocity. It drives the capstan motor and feedback is provided from an optical tachometer mounted on the capstan shaft. In the system studied, this servo is one element of a broader feedback loop which also includes the autophasing block. The feedback for the overall system is the actual high frequency signal reproduced from the tape. The block diagrams of each basic element and of the overall system are presented and described. Stability of the capstan servo loop is demonstrated through magnitude and phase plots. A simplified computer model of this system is developed. The system's output response is simulated with a variety of inputs: constant, ramp, and sine wave. The results are compared with that which is theoretically predicted. The simulation results reveal two design limitations which would cause mistracking and instability. Solutions to the problems are derived, in one instance using a truth table, and then implemented in the model by the insertion of new model blocks. The improved model is again tested with ramp and sine wave inputs, and the removal of the instability is demonstrated. Correct system operation is verified...|$|E
40|$|Analog {{magnetic}} tape remains a medium {{of choice for}} high-fidelity sound recording and reproduction. Some of this fidelity is sacrificed during the tape playback process; an optimized playback preamplifier is therefore critical {{to the performance of}} the medium. Existing playback methods integrate the voltage generated across the <b>reproduce</b> <b>head</b> to obtain a signal directly proportional to the remanent magnetic flux of the tape. An alternate playback method proposes the use of a transresistance amplifier to convert flux-proportional re-produce head current directly to voltage. This eliminates the need for voltage integration and minimizes the amount of equalization performed upon playback. Circuit size and complexity are likewise reduced. A practical transresistance playback preamplifier is designed and its performance is evaluated against se-lected integrating playback preamplifiers. SPICE simulation verifies that the proposed design offers a significant reduction in harmonic distortion, as well as improved transient response, magnitude response, and phase margin. ii...|$|E

We replace a groundwater flow model governed by a partial differential equation with a simple model governed by an ordinary differential equation. Model reduction is achieved with empirical orthogonal functions, i. e., principal components. Replacement of the full-scale model by a reduced model allows implementation of the embedding approach for optimal groundwater management. Comparing the results obtained with the full-scale simulation model, preliminary analyses show that the reduced model is able to <b>reproduce</b> <b>head</b> variations in the flow domain with good accuracy and, to a certain degree, the sensitivities of head with respect to pumping. A key advantage of the reduced model {{is that it is}} simple and easy to solve, and in many instances captures the dominating characteristics of the original model. In view of the many sources of uncertainty influencing groundwater simulation, the accuracy provided by a reduced model may be sufficient for planning purposes.

This paper {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} with several new techniques which {{are being used to}} extend the frequency bandwidth limits and the signal to noise ratios of instrumentation magnetic tape record/ reproduce systems. During the past decade, wideband magnetic tape information recording densities have advanced in several stages to the currently used 60 to 80 micro inch wavelengths. The new techniques described in this paper now make it practical to record and reproduce wavelengths in the order of 30 to 40 micro inches. This results in a frequency bandwidth of 1. 0 MHz at a tape speed of 30 inches per second. In comparison with present wideband systems this means an improvement of 2 X in bandwidth, or a reduction of tape speed by one half is now possible while maintaining approximately 20 dB broadband signal to noise ratio with a track width of. 025 inches.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this paper a new forgery {{scenario}} {{for the evaluation of}} talking-face verification systems. The scenario is a replay-attack where we assume that the forger has got access to a still picture of the genuine user. The forger is then using a dedicated software to realistically animate the face image, <b>reproducing</b> <b>head</b> and lip movements according to a given speech waveform. The resulting forged video sequence is finally replayed to the sensor. Such attacks are nowadays quite easy to realize for potential forgers and can be opportunities to attempt to forge text-prompted challenge-response configurations of the verification system. We report the evaluation of such forgeries on the BioSecure BMEC talking face database where a set of 430 users are forged according to this face animation procedure. As expected, results show that these forgeries generate much more false acceptation in comparison to the classically used random forgeries. These results clearly show that such kind of forgery attack potentially represents a critical security breach for talking-face verification systems. I. INTRODUCTION One of the direct advantages of biometric systems consists {{in the fact that the}} user doesn't have to remember passwords or keep all the different access keys. The other advantage of biometric systems is often claimed to be enhanced security. It is indeed generally believed that biometric data is difficult to steal, imitate or generate. The work reported {{in this paper}} is challenging this last statement in the framework of talking face systems. Talking face systems are multi-modal systems combining voice and face. We usually evaluate the security performance of biometric verification systems by measuring their ability to accept true users and to reject impostures. This is classically done using a pre-recorded biometric database, preferably composed of a large collection of users. The ability of the system to accept true clients can be quite precisely estimated provided that the recording conditions of the database match the ones of the deployed system. On the other hand, it is hard to estimate reliably the ability to reject impostures as the behavior of the forgers is typically never known in advance. Frequently, evaluations are carried out using so-called random impostures. This means that the data of a randomly chosen user is presented to the system using the claimed identity of a true user. In practice, such a scenario would correspond to very weak attacks, not very much realistic when considering intentional forgers. Random forgery evaluations are mainly used due to their simplicity of implementation. However, performances measured with such scenarios shoul...|$|R

Data assimilation was used to test the ability of different riverbed K patterns to <b>reproduce</b> hydraulic <b>heads,</b> riverbed K and river-aquifer exchange fluxes. Both fully saturated as well as variably saturated conditions underneath the riverbed were tested. The data assimilation experiments with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) were carried out for four types of geostatistical models of riverbed K fields: (i) spatially homogeneous, (ii) heterogeneous with multi-Gaussian distribution, (iii) heterogeneous with non-multi-Gaussian distribution (channelized structures) and (iv) heterogeneous with non-multi-Gaussian distribution (elliptic structures). For all data assimilation experiments, state variables and riverbed K were updated by assimilating hydraulic heads. For saturated conditions, heterogeneous geostatistical models allowed a better characterization of net exchange fluxes than a homogeneous approximation. Among the three heterogeneous models, the performance of non-multi-Gaussian models was superior to the performance of the multi-Gaussian model, but the two tested non-multi-Gaussian models showed only small differences in performance from one another. For the variably saturated conditions both the multi-Gaussian model and the homogeneous model performed clearly worse than the two non-multi-Gaussian models. The two non-multi-Gaussian models did not show much difference in performance. This clearly shows that characterizing heterogeneity of riverbed K is important. Moreover, particularly under variably saturated flow conditions the mean and the variance of riverbed K do not provide enough information for exchange flux characterization and additional histogram information of riverbed K provides crucial information for the reproduction of exchange fluxes...|$|R

Such cases are explained by the presence of gemmules derived from each part, and disseminated throughout the body. I have heard the process compared with that of the repair of the broken angles of a crystal by re- crystallisation; and the two processes have this much in common, that in the one case the polarity of the molecules is the efficient cause, and in the other the affinity of the gemmules for particular nascent cells. But we have here to encounter two objections which apply not only to the regrowth of a part, or of a bisected individual, but to fissiparous generation and budding. The first objection is that the part which is reproduced is in the same stage of development as that of the being which has been operated on or bisected; {{and in the case of}} buds, that the new beings thus produced are in the same stage as that of the budding parent. Thus a mature salamander, of which the tail has been cut off, does not reproduce a larval tail; and a crab does not reproduce a larval leg. In the case of budding it was shown in the first part of this chapter that the new being thus produced does not retrograde in development,--that is, does not pass through those earlier stages, which the fertilised germ has to pass through. Nevertheless, the organisms operated on or multiplying themselves by buds must, by our hypothesis, include innumerable gemmules derived from every part or unit of the earlier stages of development; and why do not such gemmules reproduce the amputated part or the whole body at a corresponding early stage of development? ...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of using remotely sensed soil moisture data and in situ discharge observations to calibrate a large-extent hydrological model. The model used is PCR-GLOBWB-MOD, which is a physically based and fully coupled groundwater-land surface model operating at a daily basis and having a resolution of 30 arc sec (about 1 km at the equator). As a test bed, we use the combined Rhine-Meuse basin (total area: about 200, 000 km 2), where there are 4250 point-scale observed groundwater head time series that are used to verify the model results. Calibration is performed by simulating 3045 model runs with varying parameter values affecting groundwater head dynamics. The simulation results of all runs are evaluated against the remotely sensed soil moisture time series of SWI (Soil Water Index) and field discharge data. The former is derived from European Remote Sensing scatterometers and provides estimates of the first meter profile soil moisture content at 30 arc min resolution (50 km at the equator). From the evaluation of these runs, we then introduce a stepwise calibration approach that considers stream discharge first, then soil moisture, and finally verify the resulting simulation to groundwater head observations. Our results indicate that the remotely sensed soil moisture data can be used for the calibration of upper soil hydraulic conductivities determining simulated groundwater recharge of the model. However, discharge data should be included to obtain full calibration of the coupled model, specifically to constrain aquifer transmissivities and runoff-infiltration partitioning processes. The stepwise approach introduced in this study, using both discharge and soil moisture data, can calibrate both discharge and soil moisture, as well as predicting groundwater head dynamics with acceptable accuracy. As our approach to parameterize and calibrate the model uses globally available data sets only, it opens up the possibility to set up large-extent coupled groundwater-land surface models in other basins or even globally.

Two devices, measuring cervical range of motion, were compared: Myrin, an inclinometer/compass method and Zebris®, a 3 -dimensional ultrasound movement analyser. Both devices showed good reliability and agreement with less variability for the computerized method. The Myrin can be used in clinical routine work and the Zebris® adds information about 3 -dimensional movements. (Study I). Cervical range of motion was examined in three dimensions in 120 neck-healthy subjects. Movement patterns of combined primary and coupled movements and the influence of age, gender and body mass index on these movements were investigated. Coupled movements are a natural part of cervical motion together with primary movements. Age affects the majority of primary and coupled cervical movements; the coupled movements of primary rotation and lateral flexion are especially changed with age (Study II). Twenty-two patients with dizziness of suspected cervical origin were examined with a structured physical examination and carefully examined to exclude other causes of dizziness. The effects of physiotherapy, based on these musculoskeletal findings, were evaluated directly after treatment and again long-term with questionnaires. Patients with suspected cervicogenic dizziness had some musculoskeletal findings in common, e. g., tenderness and tightness in the dorsal neck muscles, preserved cervical mobility and reduced cervico-thoracic mobility. Treatment based on these findings reduced both neck pain and dizziness. Some patients seem to need a maintenance strategy to avoid relapses in the long-term (Study III). Twenty neck-healthy subjects were examined before and after a unilateral neck muscle fatiguing task with head repositioning tests. An average overshoot before the fatiguing task decreased after acute muscle fatigue and the increased accuracy was significant and most pronounced for movements directed towards the fatigued side (Study IV). Eleven subjects with bilateral vestibulopathy were compared to fifteen healthy subjects in their ability to <b>reproduce</b> different <b>head</b> on trunk target positions. The subjects with bilateral vestibulopathy maintained their ability to recognize and fine-tune head on trunk movements (Study V). Cervical movement performance changed with increasing age. Treatment of cervical musculoskeletal findings reduced both neck pain symptoms and dizziness; diagnosis ex juvantibus supports the diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this paper is to investigate the possibility of using spaceborne remote sensing data for groundwater head prediction. Remotely-sensed soil moisture time series of SWI (Soil Water Index) derived from ERS (European Remote Sensing) scatterometers are used to predict groundwater head dynamics in the Rhine-Meuse basin, where over four thousand observed groundwater head time series are available. Our study consists of three evolving research steps. First, the correlation between observed time series of groundwater head and SWI is investigated. Second, SWI time series are used as input to a transfer-function noise (TFN) model for temporal prediction (forecasts) of groundwater heads. Third, TFN models with spatially interpolated parameters are used with SWI time series for spatio-temporal prediction of groundwater heads. Here, HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) as derived from a digital elevation model is used as auxiliary information. Results show that the correlation between SWI and groundwater head time series is apparent, particularly in areas with shallow groundwater, and that correlation increases when a time-lag is taken into account. Temporal predictions with TFN models <b>reproduce</b> observed groundwater <b>head</b> time series well at locations with shallow groundwater, but results are poor for locations with deep groundwater. The spatio-temporal prediction method is not able to estimate the absolute value of groundwater heads. However, head variation in terms of timing and amplitude is predicted reasonably well, in particular in areas with shallow groundwater. This suggests that, once a groundwater model is suitably calibrated, remotely sensed soil moisture data could be used to improve groundwater prediction in an operational data-assimilation framework. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|The Olivargas Reservoir {{is located}} in a remote and {{scarcely}} monitored area in the Odiel River Basin (Southwest Spain) and is used for domestic, agricultural and mining water supplies. In contrast with highly monitored reservoirs, this paper explores the application of the CE-QUAL-W 2 model, that was designed by Cole and Wells in 2005, to a poorly monitored reservoir and the utility of the results obtained. The model satisfactorily <b>reproduced</b> the water <b>head</b> measured continuously over three years, temperature (T), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH measured bimonthly in a depth profile near the dam. A significant increase in TDS and decrease in DO and pH profiles were observed for four months, especially in the hypolimnion. The model reproduced changes in the parameters by assuming the occurrence of an acid water spill into the reservoir. A comparison of calculated results and measured TDS and DO prompted the conclusion that the spill consisted of approximately 3000 t of TDS (mainly sulfates) and 26 t of Fe(II) flowing into the reservoir for approximately 15 days at rates of approximately two and 0. 02 kg/s, respectively.
