5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new <b>rotating</b> <b>light</b> system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E

50|$|In chemistry, {{specific}} rotation (α) is a property of a chiral chemical compound. It {{is defined as}} the change in orientation of monochromatic plane-polarized light, per unit distance-concentration product, as the light passes through a sample of a compound in solution. Compounds which <b>rotate</b> <b>light</b> clockwise are said to be dextrorotary, and correspond with positive {{specific rotation}} values, while compounds which <b>rotate</b> <b>light</b> counterclockwise are said to be levorotary, and correspond with negative values. If a compound is able to <b>rotate</b> plane-polarized <b>light,</b> it is said to be “optically active”.|$|R
25|$|<b>Rotating</b> <b>lights</b> {{often use}} a quartz-halogen or {{conventional}} incandescent bulb, though some rotating beacons are now made with LEDs rather than bulbs.|$|R
50|$|The Miramare section also {{previously}} had unique <b>rotating</b> <b>lights</b> to indicate any malfunction on the line, but this feature {{has also been}} dismantled.|$|R
25|$|Many U.S. states allow {{volunteer}} fire, EMS and Search and Rescue {{personnel to}} place emergency warning lights {{in their personal}} vehicles for use when responding to emergencies. The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single <b>rotating</b> <b>light</b> on the dashboard or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers. Some states also allow volunteer use of sirens and air horns to request the right of way.|$|E
25|$|There were {{originally}} three lighthouse keepers {{with their families}} on the island. The initial <b>rotating</b> <b>light</b> mechanism had to be wound up hourly, and in 1883, the principal lighthouse keeper died when he fell down the central shaft trying to attach weights to the mechanism. In 1977, the number of lighthouse keepers were reduced from two to one due to operational improvements. There was a Committee of Inquiry into lighthouse automation in 1981 and the Dog Island site was one of nine sites throughout New Zealand that was to remain staffed; in this case, {{it was due to}} its remoteness, and its ability to help with search and rescue in the area. In August 1989, Dog Island was fully automated and the last permanent lighthouse keeper in New Zealand was withdrawn from service. The lighthouse is remote controlled from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office.|$|E
500|$|Indirectly, {{the effect}} of {{gravitational}} waves had been detected in observations of specific binary stars. Such pairs of stars orbit each other and, as they do so, gradually lose energy by emitting gravitational waves. For ordinary stars like the Sun, this energy loss would be {{too small to be}} detectable, but this energy loss was observed in 1974 in a binary pulsar called PSR1913+16. In such a system, one of the orbiting stars is a pulsar. This has two consequences: a pulsar is an extremely dense object known as a neutron star, for which gravitational wave emission is much stronger than for ordinary stars. Also, a pulsar emits a narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. As the pulsar rotates, its beam sweeps over the Earth, where it is seen as a regular series of radio pulses, just as a ship at sea observes regular flashes of light from the <b>rotating</b> <b>light</b> in a lighthouse. This regular pattern of radio pulses functions as a highly accurate [...] "clock". It can be used to time the double star's orbital period, and it reacts sensitively to distortions of spacetime in its immediate neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|The film {{features}} several {{innovative and}} practical lighting techniques by Andréas Winding and Armand Thirard. Most {{notably in the}} psychedelic climax of the film, <b>rotating</b> <b>lighting</b> rigs were placed in-front of the camera and actors.

40|$|As {{they travel}} through space, some <b>light</b> beams <b>rotate.</b> Such <b>light</b> beams have angular momentum. There are two {{particularly}} important {{ways in which}} a light beam can rotate: if every polarization vector <b>rotates,</b> the <b>light</b> has spin; if the phase structure <b>rotates,</b> the <b>light</b> has orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be many {{times greater than the}} spin. Only in the past 20 years has it been realized that beams carrying OAM, which have an optical vortex along the axis, can be easily made in the laboratory. These light beams are able to spin microscopic objects, give rise to rotational frequency shifts, create new forms of imaging systems, and behave within nonlinear material to give new insights into quantum optics...|$|R
