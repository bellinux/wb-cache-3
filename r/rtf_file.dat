50|$|Font {{embedding}} in {{word processors}} is not widely supported nor interoperable. For example, if an <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> with embedded fonts is opened {{in other word}} processor than MS Word, it will usually remove embedded fonts.|$|E
50|$|The default {{text editor}} for Mac OS X, TextEdit, can also view, edit and save <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> {{as well as}} RTFD files. TextEdit {{currently}} (as of July 2009) has limited ability to edit RTF document margins. Much older Mac word processing application programs such as MacWrite and WriteNow were able to view, edit, and save <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|The {{free and}} {{open-source}} word processors AbiWord, Apache OpenOffice, Bean, Calligra, KWord, LibreOffice and NeoOffice can view, edit and save <b>RTF</b> <b>files.</b> <b>RTF</b> format {{is also used}} in the Ted word processor.|$|R
50|$|In Microsoft Windows, RTFD {{files are}} {{displayed}} as folders. Editing these folders may destroy the data inside the RTFD. In particular editing {{any of the}} elements, such as the text file, inside the folder will remove other elements, such as graphics. Any text associated with the RTFD file appears in the Windows folder as an <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b> However, when the <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> is edited in a text editor such as WordPad, Notepad or Word, graphics elements are replaced by a text notation showing their inclusion and, when saved, the graphics elements inside the folder are 'lost' when the RTFD file is subsequently opened in Mac OS X.|$|E

5000|$|... iStudio Publisher can export colour managed PDF files {{suitable}} {{for use in a}} prepress workflow for professional print jobs. It can also export to booklet PDF, EPUB or <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b> iStudio Publisher has an XML based file format and supports Unicode character encoding. However, it does not yet support complex script rendering and cannot be used for languages written with Arabic, Hebrew, Indic and East_Asian (CJK) writing systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> {{are usually}} 7-bit ASCII plain text. RTF {{consists}} of control words, control symbols, and groups. <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> {{can be easily}} transmitted between PC based operating systems because they are encoded as a text file with 7-bit graphic ASCII characters. Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for MS Windows or Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters and binary data can contain any 8-bit values.|$|R

5000|$|For some time, <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> {{were used}} to produce Windows [...]HLP help files, though this use has been {{superseded}} by Microsoft Compiled HTML Help files.|$|R
50|$|RTF {{supports}} {{inclusion of}} JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), Windows Metafile (WMF), Apple PICT, Windows Device-dependent bitmap, Windows Device Independent bitmap and OS/2 Metafile picture types in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format in a <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b> Not {{all of these}} picture types are supported in all RTF readers. When a RTF document is opened in software that {{does not support the}} picture type of an inserted picture, such picture is not displayed at all.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> can {{consist of}} only 7-bit ASCII characters, but can encode characters beyond ASCII by escape sequences. The character escapes are of two types: code page escapes and, starting with RTF 1.5, Unicode escapes. In a code page escape, two hexadecimal digits following a backslash and typewriter apostrophe {{are used for}} denoting a character taken from a Windows code page. For example, if the code page is set to Windows-1256, the sequence [...] will encode the Arabic letter bāʼ (ب).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike many word {{processing}} formats, RTF code can be human-readable: when an <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> {{is viewed as}} a plain text file, the contained ASCII text is legible. The formatting code is not too distracting nor counter-intuitive, provided that the document's creator kept formatting concise. At the time of RTF's initial release, this was rare among document formats. Today, XML-based formats, which are human-readable, are more common. In contrast, MS Word's [...] format is binary, with only a few scraps of legible text.|$|E
40|$|The rtfutil {{package is}} {{a suite of}} file {{handling}} utilities for producing Rich Text Format (<b>RTF)</b> <b>files</b> in Stata, possibly containing plots and tables. These <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> can then be opened by Microsoft Word, and possibly by alternative free word processors. The plots can be included by inserting, as linked objects, graphics files that might be produced by the graph export command in Stata. The tables can be included by using the listtex command, downloadable from SSC, with the handle() option. Rich Text Format, RTF, MS Office, OpenOffice...|$|R

Word and <b>rtf</b> <b>files</b> are converted into text or tagged pdf files subject to the format specified by the user in the subject line, e.g., txt or pdf. PowerPoint files are converted into tagged pdf, web projects or <b>rtf</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> {{can carry}} malware; {{sometimes}} malicious <b>files</b> in <b>RTF</b> format are renamed with the [...]DOC extension. One exploit attacking a vulnerability was patched in Microsoft Word in April 2015.|$|R
5000|$|... {{a robust}} bilingual RTF table format, {{which is used}} in many ways for review, {{translation}} or providing feedback by filtering comments made by translators or reviewers. This format simplifies the involvement {{of those who do}} not work with computer-assisted translation tools, as translation or review of a text or comments can be performed in any word processor capable of reading an <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b> This approach was introduced originally by Atril's Déjà Vu and has been adopted in various ways by many other environments over the years.|$|E
50|$|However, RTF drawing {{objects are}} not {{supported}} in many RTF implementations, such as Apache OpenOffice (though they are supported in LibreOffice 4.0 on) or Abiword. When an RTF document with drawing objects is opened in an application {{that does not}} support RTF drawing objects, they are not displayed at all. Some implementations will also not display any text inside drawing objects. Similarly, when a document with drawing objects is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, these are not preserved in the <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
5000|$|RTF {{specification}} supports annotations (comments in documents) since version 1.0. RTF 1.7 specification defined {{some new}} features for annotations: date stamp (there was previously only [...] "time stamp") and parents of annotations. When a RTF document with annotations is opened in an application {{that does not}} support RTF annotations, they are not displayed at all. Similarly, when a document with annotations is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF annotations, annotations are not preserved in the <b>RTF</b> <b>file.</b> Some implementations may hide annotations by default or require some user action to display them - e.g. in Abiword since version 2.8 or in IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3).|$|E
50|$|SIL International’s Toolbox {{freeware}} {{application for}} developing and publishing dictionaries uses RTF as its {{most common form}} of document output. <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> produced by Toolbox are designed to be used in Microsoft Word, but can also be used by other RTF-aware word processors.|$|R
50|$|The {{backslash}} {{is used in}} the TeX typesetting {{system and}} in <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> to begin markup tags. In Haskell, the backslash is used both to introduce special characters and to introduce lambda functions (since it is a reasonable approximation in ASCII of the Greek letter lambda, λ).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{how to apply}} Visual Basic for Application (VBA) procedures in the Microsoft Word to dynamically manipulate SAS output list files. In the paper, the author shall show how to convert SAS list files into Rich Text Format (<b>RTF)</b> <b>files</b> with appropriate page setup; extract {{the first page of}} each SAS list file; assemble all <b>RTF</b> <b>files</b> into a single file and send print command to Microsoft Word from SAS. All the manipulation tasks shall be accomplished by executing an integrated SAS macro which dynamically interacts with VBA subroutines. The code of both the SAS and VBA macros are included in the paper. The testing of the macros was verified in a Windows Operating System PC with SAS version 9. 0 and 9. 1. 3 and Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007...|$|R
50|$|Pivotal {{conversion}} {{is similarly}} {{used in other}} areas. Office applications, when employed to convert between office file formats, use their internal, default file format as a pivot. For example, a word processor may convert an <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> to a WordPerfect file by converting the RTF to OpenDocument and then that to WordPerfect format. An image conversion program does not convert a PCX image to PNG directly; instead, when loading the PCX image, it decodes it to a simple bitmap format for internal use in memory, and when commanded to convert to PNG, that memory image is converted to the target format. An audio converter that converts from FLAC to AAC decodes the source file to raw PCM data in memory first, and then performs the lossy AAC compression on that memory image to produce the target file.|$|E
50|$|A {{study by}} Guéguen {{showed that the}} foot-in-the-door-technique is not only {{effective}} in person, but also online. In his study, he found that asking students for help saving a document as an <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> via email increased their willingness to complete an online survey emailed {{to them by the}} initial requester. This information coupled with work by Swanson, Sherman, and Sherman, which found that students' compliance to an initial, neutral and small request not only increased their willingness to comply with a subsequent larger and anxiety-producing request, but also indicated that the anxiety-producing request was deemed less anxiety-producing than did the control group, has very large implication for possible online uses of the FITD technique. With the privacy and anonymity provided by the internet, the technique could be used online to gather information about anxiety producing incidents in a manner that would not produce as much anxiety as in-person questioning would. Further research in this domain is needed.|$|E

In SAS 8. 2, ODS supported in-line formatting and added the TEXT = option. All of these formatting methods give us the ability to insert formatting text into a cell or paragraph and can be used to enhance output. In this paper, an <b>RTF</b> <b>file</b> will be created with enhanced SAS TITLES, footnote symbols in variable labels and values, custom footnotes, an inserted image, and an inserted hyperlink.
