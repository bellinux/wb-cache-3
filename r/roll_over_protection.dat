25|$|Agriculture {{workers are}} often {{at risk of}} work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers related to {{chemical}} use or prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery. The {{most common cause of}} fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which can be prevented by the use of <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>protection</b> structures which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over. Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects. As an industry in which families, including children, commonly work alongside their families, agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among younger workers. Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, Hewitt began {{testing and}} working to reduce engine emissions. He formed an energy {{management}} program that tracked energy use and required operations to implement energy-conservation initiatives.

50|$|If (lateral) load {{transfer}} reaches the tire loading {{on one end}} of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in handling characteristic. If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to <b>roll</b> <b>over.</b> Some large trucks will <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> only when they leave the road. Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.|$|R

Volvo featured this advancement in {{a copy of the}} [...] "Volvo Saved My Life Club" [...] brochures. There, a woman was able to walk away from an accident after she slid off an ice-covered mountain road and rolled her C70 which then slid more than 30 ft down the mountain face.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{attachment}} for a CUT is the front-end loader or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled three-point hitch. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>protection</b> structures just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include Kubota, John Deere Tractor, New Holland Ag, Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson. Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{ranks among}} the most {{hazardous}} industries due {{to the use of}} chemicals and risk of injury. Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries (general traumatic injury and musculoskeletal injury), work-related lung diseases, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, chemical-related illnesses, and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. In an average year, 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. (1992-2005). Every day, about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost-work-time injuries, and about 5% of these result in permanent impairment. Tractor overturns are the leading cause of agriculture-related fatal injuries, and account for over 90 deaths every year. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>protection</b> structures on tractors {{to reduce the risk of}} overturn-related fatal injuries.|$|E
50|$|In a dump truck, wet {{materials}} {{stick in}} the top of the tub during unloading and causes trailer <b>roll</b> <b>over.</b> Insurance costs are lower for a live bottom trailer because it does not have to be raised in the air and there are few cases of trailer <b>roll</b> <b>over.</b>|$|R

50|$|Production {{started in}} 1960 using a Riley, twin-carburettor version, of the 1.5 litre BMC B Series engine, {{independent}} front suspension by torsion bar modified {{from that of the}} Morris Minor and live rear axle suspended by coil springs. Other engines could be fitted including the Morris Minor, MG MGA, and Ford 109E. The engine and front suspension was mounted on a tubular steel subframe bonded to the body shell and <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>protection</b> was provided by a steel tube over the windscreen. The car appeared at the Copenhagen Racing Car Show and the Geneva Motor Show. A very complete kit, including an engine and all other mechanical parts, cost £670. About 250 were made when the fire caused production to be suspended. The car was available in both left and right hand drive and cars were exported to several countries including Australia and the United States. On test by The Motor magazine in 1961 a 1.5 litre Riley engined model achieved a top speed of 102 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 11.9 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{different}} from the original one. There's a high-efficiency engine in it that has higher petrol consumption. 100 octane fuel is used in these race cars. Many things are transferred or removed from the engine compartment {{to make it easier to}} repair and to get rid of the unnecessary elements such as the air filter.The structural and electronical changes in Lada VFTS cars results 160-180 HP that was only 75 HP in the model 2105.The body is also strengthened in order to make the car suitable for the race adversities. The axle housing was heavily fortified.A single-row gearshift that {{is different from}} the usual one is used in this car that produces the characteristic sound of these cars. Due to the modifications there were changes in the places of each gear also that is the result of the lack of space.The cabin is also converted. <b>Roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>protection</b> bars are inserted. There are only two bucket seats with 4-point seat belts.The dashboard is also reorganized to make the contingent repairs easier and faster.|$|E
