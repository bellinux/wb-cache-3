In 1949, partnering with four independent plants and with financing arranged through First National Bank, the Tillamook Cheese Factory north of Tillamook was built. The enlarged facility included a storage plant and traffic department.|$|E

In dairy company (Lura, Bjelovar) the natural ripening process of rind Trappist cheese occurs. Afterwards, the cheese is packaged into shrinkable plastic pouch and the <b>rindless</b> <b>cheese</b> is produced. The obtained results are statistically processed. The above mentioned ripening process has a significant influence on moisture content of the fat-free matter and is 5. 34 % higher for the Trappist cheese in plastic pouch in comparison to rind Trappist cheese, while the fat content is 6. 13 higher for the rind Trappist cheese...|$|E
50|$|In Canada {{the term}} farmer's cheese means {{a kind of}} hard, <b>rindless</b> white <b>cheese</b> which is firm but springy in texture with a mild, milky and buttery flavor which {{may be used in}} a way likened to colby or cheddar.|$|R
5000|$|Bocconcini ( [...] ; {{singular}} Bocconcino, [...] ) {{are small}} mozzarella cheeses {{the size of}} an egg. Like other mozzarellas, they are semi-soft, white and <b>rindless</b> unripened mild <b>cheeses</b> which originated in Naples and were once made only from milk of water buffalo. Nowadays they are usually made from a combination of water buffalo and cow's milk. Bocconcini are packaged in whey or water, have a spongy texture and absorb flavours.|$|R

Powder x-ray diffractometry (PXRD) offers a simple means to identify and resolve complex combinations of crystals that contribute to cheese characteristics. The objective of the present research was to demonstrate the application of PXRD to study crystals {{from a range of}} different cheese types, specifically Cheddar, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Gouda, and soft washed-rind (smear ripened) cheeses. In studies of Parmigiano-Reggiano and long-aged Gouda, PXRD has confirmed that hard (crunchy) crystals that form abundantly within these cheeses consist of tyrosine. Furthermore, PXRD has tentatively identified the presence of an unusual form of crystalline leucine in large (up to 6  mm in diameter) spherical entities, or “pearls”, that occur abundantly in 2 -year-old Parmigiano Reggiano and long-aged Gouda cheeses, and on the surface of <b>rindless</b> hard Italian-type <b>cheese.</b> Ongoing investigations into the nature of these “pearls” are providing new insight into the roles that crystals play in the visual appearance and texture of long-aged cheeses. Crystals also sometimes develop profusely in the eyes of long-aged Gouda, which have been shown by PXRD to consist of tyrosine and the aforementioned presumptive form of crystalline leucine. Finally, crystals have been shown by PXRD to form in the smears of soft washed-rind cheeses. These crystals may be associated in some cheeses with gritty mouth feel and with zonal body softening that occurs during ripening. Heightened interest in artisanal cheeses highlights the need to better understand crystals and their contributions to cheese characteristics...|$|R
