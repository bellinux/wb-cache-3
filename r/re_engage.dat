50|$|In {{this early}} period, McLaren’s {{research}} emphasized {{the development of}} a critical emancipatory consciousness, self-conscious reason, and the centrality of nonidentity thinking towards a non essentialist view of revolutionary consciousness grounded in a theory of intersubjective understanding through language. Practically, his work attempted to create an oppositional cultural politics that enabled teachers and students to analyze how the dominant and negotiated meanings that inform classroom texts were produced and to uncover the ideological and political meanings that circulated within them. McLaren attempted through critical reading strategies to illuminate the dominant pedagogical codes of teachers as well as the normative codes within classroom cultures of students. His purpose was to create alternative readings as well as new pedagogical practices.

40|$|Purpose. To explore eight individuals' {{experiences}} {{and responses to}} {{taking part in a}} personalised observation-based intervention for stroke rehabilitation. Methods. Eight participants who had experienced a cerebrovascular accident were recruited to a 16 -week observation-based intervention. Participants were interviewed face-to-face to explore their responses to, and experiences of, taking part in the intervention. A list of topics, derived from the intervention process and earlier studies provided a provisional structure for the interview. All interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using inductive content analysis to explore the impact of the observational intervention for these participants. Results. Three main themes emerged: physical function, behaviour change and DVD content. Lower order themes were also identified. These included: interaction with the physiotherapist; ability to complete tasks; and increased motivation to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> in activities of everyday living. Conclusion. The findings suggest that a programme of action observation, linked to individualised and meaningful motor behaviours can provide a valid intervention for individuals affected by stroke by serving as a motivating agent to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> in activities which they had believed they could not perform following their stroke. There was also evidence for positive affect on psychological wellbeing and motor function...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{compilation}} thesis consisting of an introduction and four separate papers. It is an inquiry into women‟s working lives in Penang, Malaysia. The export-oriented development model adopted in Malaysia stimulated women‟s large-scale entry to the formal labor force. However, export-orientation {{has not been able}} to sustain women‟s long terms participation in the formal labor market and female labor force participation rates in Malaysia have never exceeded 50 percent. This means that despite the expansion of the Malaysian economy, declining fertility rates and increased female educational attainment, over half of working aged women in Malaysia remain „outside the labor force‟. This thesis aims to investigate women‟s room to maneuver in the labor market by scrutinizing women‟s move from the formal to the informal economy over the life course. It also aims to contribute further knowledge relating to women‟s work in the informal economy – in particular its spatial aspects. The empirical study is based on field work conducted in Penang between 2009 and 2011. The 80 women interviewed in Penang share the common feature that they make their living in the informal economy – mostly as street vendors (hawkers). The majority used to work in the formal economy as machine operators or assembly workers in factories or in low-skilled jobs the tourism industry. An important reason for the low female labor force participation rates in Malaysia is that women‟s engagement in the formal labor market has a strong one-peaked pattern with many permanently leaving the labor force at a relatively young age. However, although women who leave the formal labor market tend to go missing statistically – they continue to work in the informal economy. This study suggests that while women‟s formal labor force participation has one peak, their full work participation over the life course can be more accurately described as two-peaked. This study has found that women‟s decisions to leave formal employment were often made under the simultaneous influence of marriage, child-birth and unsustainable labor conditions. In a similar fashion their decisions to not (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> in formal employment but rather to opt for informal work were influenced by the lack of institutional support for working mothers, norms around gender, work and place and an unwillingness to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> in exploitative work in the formal economy.

40|$|Despite the {{diversification}} {{of the student}} population in higher education, there has been little empirical research on the impact of Access to Higher Education (AHE) courses, on mature students' learning identities, and of the changes in higher education policy on their chances to participate. Using data from a study examining AHE students' learning transitions at three further education colleges in the East Midlands in England, we employ Bourdieu's concept of habitus and the complexities of the relations between habitus and field to understand how AHE students experience and conceptualise their positions as they (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> in formal learning. The article will draw on the study's findings to show how the AHE students participate in these fields and the learner identities that emerge. For the purposes of the article three themes are discussed. These relate to the AHE students' reticence towards learning and difficult educational beginnings; transforming learner identities and learning to become a learner. It will argue that when immersed in new fields, AHE students can develop strategies and nuanced understandings of their previous experiences, social background and different learning cultures and contexts to inform the development of their learner identities. By doing this article shows how Bourdieu's ideas of habitus and field can be used to critically evaluate the effects of this interplay on mature learners' dis/positions and activities within their AHE course and their career decision-making.

Kids In Need or KIN, was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2001 to a rural community located between two First Nation's Reserves, in southern Alberta. I analyze the KIN project and its ensuing controversy as the site of struggle over the meaning of parenting. Given the predominance of neoliberalism as a discursive practice, centered on individual responsibility, the controversy generated by the KIN project reflects the central question of how to implement a program devised to assist children living with adults presumably "responsible " for their well-being. Implicitly the debate centered on particular class-based, neoconservative constructions of families, which support a gendered division of labor and were deployed in this community to <b>re</b> <b>engage</b> long standing notions about the parental deficits of Natives.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{experiences}} of midwives who were also homeopaths as they attempted to straddle the different philosophical and practice paradigms they encountered in each domain. It also explored the implications of their experience on their practice. Over recent decades the National Health Service (NHS) has moved towards a scientific-bureaucratic perspective, in which {{the emphasis is on}} the use of evidence-based frameworks. It has been argued that this development has moved the focus in healthcare away from ‘caring’. In parallel, there has been an increase in the demand for complementary and alternative medicines in the United Kingdom (UK), and elsewhere. In responding to this call a number of midwives have taken up training opportunities in massage, aromatherapy, hypnotherapy, acupuncture and homeopathy, amongst others. There are no studies however, that have examined the impact of training as a homeopath on midwives and their practice. After a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, this study used an interpretive hermeneutic framework to explore the experience of midwives who trained as homeopaths. In-depth interviews were conducted with seven midwife homeopaths. The findings were analysed using three different lenses. The first of these conceptualised and explored the midwives narratives as personal and professional metamorphoses, as they changed from midwife to homeopath or midwife homeopath. Secondly, the data were framed using a Heideggerian lens, which illuminated a process of transformation into being authentic practitioners. This demonstrates how authenticity allowed the participants to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> with, and further value the therapeutic relationship as a fundamental element of their clinical practice. The final lens explored the impact engendered of being authentic on the therapeutic relationship that developed between midwife homeopath and the women in their care. The conclusion was drawn that the therapeutic relationship developed by an authentic practitioner via a homeopathic consultation is transferable to other healthcare practitioners, and offers a challenge to practice based in notions of scientism and bureaucracy. Further exploration of these phenomenon’s could help to deliver on the drive to deliver compassionate personalised care across the NHS as a whole...|$|E
40|$|This {{particular}} telling and retelling from {{a living}} narrative inquiry (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000) {{into the early}} experiences of three high school science teachers – Beth, Joel, and Christina – explores the emergent inquiry landscapes constructed as we implemented a renewed, decolonizing, science curriculum in Saskatchewan founded on a philosophy of inquiry and on a broader, more holistic definition of scientific literacy, both Western and Indigenous. This inquiry draws on an ontology of lived experience (Dewey, 1938) and, more subtly, on the borderland of narrative inquiry and complexity science in order to illustrate the emergence and coming to knowing (Delandshire, 2002; Ermine, as cited in Aikenhead, 2002) of our identities {{in a way that}} avoids the reduction in complexity of our experiences. While my initial wonders persisted throughout the research as I lived alongside Beth, Joel, and Christina for two years, they diffracted into the contextualized wonder: how do we share a philosophy of inquiry {{with each other and with}} our students? As such, this inquiry is a sharing about our own identities, about our own agency, about identity work, and about which experiences we choose to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> with as we attempt to (re) find the narrative diversity, both individual and collective, necessary to shift from enacted identities to 'wished-we-could-enact' identities. This exploration of our 'mo(u) rning stories', early experiences from our shifting identities after stepping through the liminal and onto emergent inquiry landscapes, or our 'stories to relive with' provides a language and context to our shifting identities and hence, to science education, as we move towards a more holistic and humanistic form of scientific literacy for all our students. What emerged through the enmeshing of our landscapes and through the construction of voids in existing practices, followed by deformalizations in assessment and planning, was the development of a way of sharing our philosophy of inquiry and hence, our shifting identities. The artifacting and sharing of our contextualized inquiry experiences highlighted the rich assessment making, and curriculum making experiences (Huber, Murphy & Clandinin, 2011) we shared with our students and highlighted a view of assessment as a relationship. As we told and retold our stories to relive with, our identities shifted towards those more akin to facilitator and anthropologist and away from sage and engineer/architect...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I outline a new {{approach}} towards media and diaspora using {{the concept of the}} ‘franchise nation’. It is my contention that current theories on migration, media and diaspora with their emphasis on exile, multiple belongings, hybrid identities and their representations are inadequate to the task of explaining {{the emergence of a new}} trend in diaspora, home and host nation relationship. This, I suggest, is a recent shift most notable in the attitudes of the Chinese and Indian governments toward their diasporas. From earlier eras where Chinese sojourners were regarded as disloyal and Indians overseas left to fend for themselves, Chinese and Indian migrants are today directly addressed and wooed by their nations of origin. This change is motivated in part by the realisation that diasporic populations are, in fact, resources that can bring significant influence to bear on home nation interests within host nations. Such sway in foreign lands gains greater importance as China and India are, by virtue of their economic rise and prominence on the world stage, subject to ever more intense international scrutiny. Members of these diasporas have willingly responded to these changes by claiming and cultivating pivotal roles for themselves within host nations as spokespersons, informants and representatives, trading on their assumed familiarity with home cultures, language and commerce. As a result, China and India have initiated a number of statecraft strategies in recent years to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> their diasporas. Both nations have identified media as amongst the key instruments of their strategies. New media enhances the ability of all parties—home and host states, institutions and individuals—to participate, interact and reciprocate. While China’s centralised government has utilised the notion of soft power (ruan shili) to describe its practices, India’s efforts are diffused along the lines of nation branding via myriad labels like India Inc. and the Global Indian. To explain this emergent trend, I propose a new framework, franchise nation, defined as a reciprocal relationship between nation and diaspora that is characterised by mutual obligations and benefits. In appropriating this phrase from Stephenson, I liken contemporary statecraft operating in China and India to a business franchising system wherein benefits may be economic or cultural and; those thus connected signal their willingness for mutual exchange and concede a sense of obligation. As such, franchise nation is not concerned with remote, unidirectional interference in home nation affairs a la Anderson’s ‘long-distance nationalism’. Rather, it is a framework that seeks to reflect more closely the dynamism of the relationship between diaspora, home and host nations. ...|$|E

The population, however, has not changed with the times, but remains low-skilled and largely unemployable to many of the industries the region is trying to attract to regenerate itself.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the lived experience of seven adult female learners as they (<b>re)</b> <b>engaged</b> with post-secondary education at the mid-sized university in western Canada. Using phenomenological hermeneutics, particularly as it is interpreted by Max van Manen, the researcher aimed to elicit from the participants the essential themes of their experience. The goal was to better understand and appreciate how adult female learners construct the transformative and connective qualities of this journey. As post-secondary institutions in Canada are grappling with declining enrolments within the traditional student demographic, many are actively discussing the multi-faceted concepts of student engagement, support and persistence. This study focused on adult learners, a demographic that is growing at Canadian institutions and one that will become more critical as the traditional 18 - 25 age group shrinks {{as a proportion of}} post-secondary enrollment. The study provided an opportunity for students to express themselves in their own words over a 13 week period and permitted an in-depth examination of how they constructed their learning experiences and self-knowledge. Using van Manen’s approach to phenomenological hermeneutics, the current study emphasized the interpretive analysis of actual life texts, writing as research and the development of pedagogical competence. Through purposeful sampling techniques, seven participants were recruited who were between the ages of 27 and 57 years and enrolled in a university preparation English course. Phenomenological hermeneutical analysis, both structural analysis and meaning unit coding, was then applied to the weekly journals created by the participants. The results produced ten themes, which were further refined into three main themes of motion, emotion and connection.

40|$|Secondary {{schooling}} {{continues to}} marginalise a significant minority {{of young people}} attending school in South Australia. As a consequence, I was a teacher morally obliged to redress the institutional codes, social relations and pedagogical practices of three secondary schools for those young people who were marginalised by them. Unfortunately, my lack of critical sociological awareness at the time associated with the insidious influence of what Foucault described as `neoliberal governmentalities’ drove my emancipatory school re-engagement efforts towards a neoliberal schooling curriculum that valued the development of entrepreneurial values and schooling for the labour market. The losers {{in all of this}} were many of the students I worked with who soon discovered the harsh realities of a labour market that didn’t value nor want them. In this auto ethnographic action research study I developed, managed and taught in three engagement programs with teacher and community youth stakeholders across three mainstream secondary school sites involving over 200 marginalised young people. All three programs succeeded in improving school retention and are still active today but only one program empowered students to be active participants in their community, offering them transition pathways into university, TAFE, apprenticeships and work. In Lesson 1, I came to understand that teachers, parents and community youth stakeholders are the agents best placed to effect educational change for students with a disability in a large country secondary school. Through collaborative school and community based activism I was able to mobilise the voices of parent, teacher and community youth stakeholders to improve resourcing, curriculum options and work related opportunities for students. This action resulted in significant structural inclusion and vocational pedagogical change for the students with disabilities. In Lesson 2 providing an after-hours regional second chance schooling option drew over forty young people back into formalised learning. However, offering a vocational curriculum embedded in casual or part-time work expectations proved to be an inadequate option for those students unable to gain employment. There was significant structural and cultural change evident in this schooling program but little pedagogical and curricular rigour. In Lesson 3 I oriented senior secondary schooling within an adult education environment geographically removed from the mainstream school campus. This second chance senior schooling program involved young people, teachers and community stakeholders in a continual negotiation of school structures, culture, pedagogy and curriculum. This approach (re) engaged over 150 young people back into the SACE (South Australian Certificate of Education) over three years. By investigating the nature of the community-school nexus and using community as a curriculum resource, students were offered greater learning authenticity and opportunity, presenting some answers to the question; how can I (a teacher), (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> marginalised young people back into learning in the official senior school curriculum? The difficulty with the first two engagement initiatives was neoliberal public policy as it manifested in South Australia’s version of local school management and in my practice. For me, a way through the neoliberal quagmire came only through participation in an Australian Education Union (AEU) funded and university led Professional Learning Community (PLC). This dialogic community offered me thinking space, intellectual challenge and rich conversation with teacher colleagues and university partners to wrestle with and enact critical educational social theory and practice. Through my involvement in this PLC and my subsequent enactment of engaging and rigorous pedagogical practices I was able to work `against the grain’ of the existing neoliberal policy logic as it played out in schools and in my mind. This required a move to socially just critical praxis in my work with teacher colleagues, students, parents and community youth stakeholders to embed structural, cultural, curricula and pedagogical democratic schooling purpose within the final engagement initiative.

40|$|This {{research}} provides {{insight into}} the use of social networks and social media by students at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. The primary purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate student social media practices at NMMU to establish the reasons for students engaging in social media. A growing number of educators acknowledge the potential of social networking to (<b>re)</b> <b>engage</b> learners with their studies, while others fear that such practices compromise and disrupt student engagement with traditional education provision (Selwyn, 2009). This study, therefore, aims to identify how and for what reasons students use social networks and social media. This study attempts to provide answers to the following research questions: For which social networking sites do students register and actively engage in? What is the most popular social networking site for students? How often do students engage in social media practices? What is the main purpose for students engaging in social media practices? How do students gain access to social media? For what educational purposes can social media be used? For which business purposes can social media be used? Do students use social media to collaborate with peers and lecturers? Do students use social media to make buying decisions? The literature overview was conducted on social media and social networks from journals and books published between the periods 2003 to 2011 as the popularity of social media came to the forefront during this period. Topics researched included social networks and libraries, educational and business uses of social networking and social media. A quantitative study was considered to be most appropriate to conduct the research for this study; and non-probability sampling was the most appropriate given the size of the population and the nature of this research. xiv Students were {{invited to participate in the}} research by completing and submitting a survey questionnaire at the conclusion of their lectures in the second semester during the month of September. The data collected was then analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics to provide insight into student use of social media. The results would determine if relationships exist between the independent variables from the questionnaire, namely, age, gender, campus and course enrolment and the dependent factors, namely, usage, information exchange and security. This relationship would be determined for both the perceptions of social networking in general and the perceptions of NMMU social networking. These results are then used to identify further areas of research in the future. The majority of the population sample was between the ages of 17 and 21 and primarily females. The sample typically became aware of social media by means of word-of-mouth and accesses their social networking site/s more than five times a day. The main reason for registering and joining social networking sites was for social purposes. Furthermore, the sample used social networking sites for entertainment, social involvement, meeting new friends and maintaining relationships. The sample agreed that social networking makes information searching easier. The majority of the sample indicated that they were not registered on any NMMU Social Networking sites of the university or any faculty, department or unit social networking sites at the NMMU. However, it was clear that the majority of students was registered on social networking sites of some sort and would continue to use social networking and social media. The results from the study indicated that the mean value for the perceptions of social media in general were greater than that of the perceptions of NMMU social media in terms of usage. Likewise, the mean value for the perceptions of social networking in general was also greater than that of the perceptions of NMMU Social Networking for information exchange but the difference were very small. However, the mean value for the perceptions of NMMU Social Networking showed a greater mean value than that of the perceptions of social networking in general in terms of security. This means that respondents used social networking in general more than NMMU Social Networking. xv However, the respondents perceived NMMU Social Networking sites to be more secure than social networking sites in general.

This study explores the complexities, challenges and policy tensions of supporting young mothers in their (re) engagement with education and/or training. There is limited research available in Australia on the quality of school-based education programs for young mothers. While teenage/young mothering is a frequently, albeit often narrowly, studied topic, most of the research that is performed in this area is based within the psycho-medical and social welfare disciplines. This thesis sets out to inform education policy frameworks that aim to improve educational outcomes for young mothers through school-based programs. Two case studies were conducted: the Young Mothers in Education program established at Plumpton High School, a Year 7 – 12 public school in New South Wales (NSW) in 2004; and the CCCares program, established at the Canberra College, a Year 11 and 12 public senior secondary school located in the Australian Capital Territory in 2009. Through its analysis of these two programs, the thesis identifies the critical factors for success in delivering education programs for young mothers. However, the research also highlights several macro and micro tensions that appear inherent in school-based young mothers’ education programs that need to be understood by policy actors and policy subjects involved in the delivery of young mothers’ education programs (Ball, Maguire, Braun & Hoskins, 2011). These tensions pose ongoing threats to the success of young mothers’ education programs and need to be recognised, understood and continually negotiated by policy actors involved in the delivery of these programs in school settings...|$|R

The chapter starts from a recognition that emotion (pathos) is a crucial element of story (mythos), something noted {{a long time ago}} by Aristotle. Emotions may seem to surface and subside irr egularly {{in the course of a}} story, a drama or a conversation, but they have an inner logic that ties them to various plotlines, such as tragic, comic or epic.

50|$|Eventually {{it became}} a battle between the {{supporters}} of Rennie's direct route (which {{was the most difficult}} and expensive to build), and Stephenson's (which was longer but involved less civil engineering work). After prolonged campaigns by the supporters of the different proposals, a bill for Stephenson's route was approved by the House of Commons in 1836, but was later rejected by the House of Lords. A Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry was established to consider the merits of all four schemes. The chairman of the committee moved that an Ordnance engineer should be appointed to survey all four routes. The proposal was agreed and a Captain Robert Alderson <b>R.E.</b> was <b>engaged</b> to do the work. He recommended the adoption of the Rennie direct route after Redhill. However, members of the Committee insisted that a stretch of the new route between Croydon and Redhill should be shared with the South Eastern Railway as part of its projected route to Dover, which had not been part of Rennie's plan.|$|R

The same year she went to Dublin and played the General in a stage version of Gulliver’s Travels at the Theatre Royal. She made her London music hall debut at Gatti's [...] "Gatti's-in-the-Road" [...] on Westminster Bridge Road. From 1878 to 1879 she appeared with Wilson Barrett at the Grand Theatre in Leeds. The next two years were spent at the Theatre Royal in Manchester. Pryde appeared in all the leading halls in London and throughout Britain. She was also a favourite in pantomime, appearing at venues throughout Britain for some years. In December 1896 she appeared in {{a revival of the}} Edwardian musical comedy The Gay Parisienne with W.H. Denny and Ada Reeve at the Duke of York's Theatre. From 1890 to 1892 she toured the United States: [...] "Peggy Pryde would probably not have become famous in the variety [...] "perfesh" [...] if she had not been the daughter of that veteran and high priced music hall singer, Jennie Hill. Miss Pryde is pert, vivacious, sprightly and piquant. Her forte is serio-comic business, and she has made a great success of it. She is English, and while she was in New York Jennie Hill, [...] "The Vital Spark," [...] objected to her having her billed as her daughter, but Miss Pryde has now reached that point where she does not require anybody's reflected glory. She is earning money very fast, and is saving it too."She married Maurice De Frece, a well-known theatrical agent. [...] In May 1898 Pryde made her Australian debut for Harry Rickards, touring for six months, which required her to delay other engagements: [...] "My Australian and South African engagements having already been made of course I was unable to accept. My season in Africa was a big success and I was <b>re</b> <b>engaged</b> for an extra month the first time I believe such a compliment had been paid to any artist. Indeed at the present time I should be appearing at Syndicate Halls, but they kindly postponed to allow me to play this engagement here." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{ocean wave}} energy resource potential exceeds 50 % {{of the annual}} domestic energy demand of the United States, is located close to coastal population centers, and, although variable in nature, may be more consistent and predictable than some other renewable generation technologies. As a renewable electricity generation technology, ocean wave energy offers a low air pollutant option for diversifying the U. S. electricity generation portfolio. Furthermore, the output characteristics of these technologies may complement other renewable technologies. This study addresses the following: (1) The theoretical, technical and practical potential for electricity generation from wave energy (2) The present lifecycle cost profile (Capex, Opex, and Cost of Electricity) of wave energy conversion technology at a reference site in Northern California at different plant scales (3) Cost of electricity variations {{as a function of}} deployment site, considering technical, geo-spatial and and electric grid constraints (4) Technology cost reduction pathways (5) Cost reduction targets at which the technology will see significant deployment within US markets, explored through a series of deployment scenarios RE Vision Consulting, LLC (<b>RE</b> Vision), <b>engaged</b> in various analyses to establish current and future cost profiles for marine hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies, quantified the theoretical, technical and practical resource potential, performed electricity market assessments and developed deployment scenarios.

T his {{study was designed to}} contribute to efforts to lower the energy footprint of Husky Village. Primarily, the study sought to test discrete interventions to moti vate a decrease in energy use among residents of Husky Village following promising methods used in the literature. I sought to expl ore how two potential intervention processes, providing feedback on energy consumption and encouraging goal setting, could i mpact subsequent energy use, and developed a factorial experiment to test the efficacy of these methods alone and in combination. Unfortunately, only one unit of students opted to participate in the intervention and survey. Although it is possible that s tudents reduced their energy use in response to the notice regarding the study alone, no significant differences in energy use {{over the course of the}} study were seen among the treatment groups. Secondarily, this study contributes a fine scale analysis of t he electricity metering data from the apartments that could be used for future administrative interventions. I found that three apartments ha d un usual energy consumption, which should be investigated further by campus staff. Re commendation s are made for mo <b>re</b> successfully <b>engaging</b> students in assessments and interventions to encourage participation in energy conservation efforts at Husky Village. In addition, suggestions are made for policies that could reduce energy consumption over the short term. ...|$|R

40|$|Actin {{dynamics}} and membrane trafficking influence cell commitment to {{programmed cell death}} through largely undefined mechanisms. To investigate how actin and recycling endosome (<b>RE)</b> trafficking can <b>engage</b> death signaling, we studied the death program induced by the adenovirus early region 4 open reading frame 4 (E 4 orf 4) protein as a model. We found {{that in the early}} stages of E 4 orf 4 expression, Src-family kinases (SFKs), Cdc 42, and actin perturbed the organization of the endocytic recycling compartment and promoted the transport of REs to the Golgi apparatus, while inhibiting recycling of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. The resulting changes in Golgi membrane dynamics that relied on actin-regulated Rab 11 a membrane trafficking triggered scattering of Golgi membranes and contributed to the progression of cell death. A similar mobilization of RE traffic mediated by SFKs, Cdc 42 and Rab 11 a also contributed to Golgi fragmentation and to cell death progression in response to staurosporine, in a caspase-independent manner. Collectively, these novel findings suggest that diversion of RE trafficking to the Golgi complex through a pathway involving SFKs, Cdc 42, and Rab 11 a plays a general role in death signaling by mediating regulated changes in Golgi dynamics...|$|R
