5000|$|In the Communist {{socio-economic}} organization, {{the relations}} of production would operate the mode of production and employ each worker according to their abilities, and benefit each worker according to their needs. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, minimal-wage [...] "job" [...] meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour, as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed Communist society, the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but, instead, will be directed {{to meet the needs}} of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated, by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the Communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the collective ownership of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical, and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker, to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.|$|E

[...] Her opinion was that a [...] "more balanced view for both medievalists and non-specialists" [...] was provided by volume one of A History of the University in Europe (1992), edited by Hilde Ridder-Symoens. A more favorable review was given by DR Jones: Pedersen [...] "develops a complex explanation {{of the nature of}} the university, if not a theory of causation. His first universities are shaped by interweaving requirements of subject matter, teaching methods, legal and organizational means, and <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and state." [...] A balanced review was given by H. E. J. Cowdrey: [...] "Perhaps the most valuable chapters of the book are those which concern the classical inheritance of medieval higher education and the transition from ancient science to monistic learning." [...] On the other hand, Cowdrey notes a [...] "disconcerting number of factual errors", [...] "too much attention is given to relatively unimportant topics", and [...] "very little account indeed has been taken of scholarly work published since the early 1970s."Marcia L. Colish described the book as [...] "a superficial and shaky sketch of what universities actually taught. He emphasizes the organization, not the content of education." [...] Colish finds Pedersen prone to [...] "repeat and compound factual errors more recently given the descent burial they deserve." [...] She suggests other, more reliable, authorities. On the other hand, Ian P. Wei gave the book an enthusiastic review, calling it a [...] "clear and lively work of synthesis." [...] He wrote that the [...] "main thrust of the book is to present medieval universities as institutions which can only be understood in relation to broader political and social developments. Particular emphasis is laid on the significance of the struggles between popes and emperors, and on Roman law. The book’s greatest strength is its extraordinary breadth of vision." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{communist}} {{economic system}} was officially enumerated {{as the ultimate}} goal of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its party platform. According to the 1986 Programme of the CPSU: Communism is a classless social system with one form of public ownership of the means of production and with full social equality of all members of society. Under communism, the all-round development of people will be accompanied by the growth of the productive forces on the basis of continuous progress in science and technology, all the springs of social wealth will flow abundantly, and the great principle [...] "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" [...] will be implemented. Communism is a highly organised society of free, socially conscious working people a society in which public self-government will be established, a society in which labour for the good of society will become the prime vital requirement of everyone, a clearly recognised necessity, and the ability of each person will be employed to the greatest benefit of the people.The material and technical foundation of communism presupposes the creation of those productive forces that open up opportunities for the full satisfaction of the reasonable <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and the individual. All productive activities under communism will be based on the use of highly efficient technical facilities and technologies, and the harmonious interaction of man and nature will be ensured.In the highest phase of communism the directly social character of labor and production will become firmly established. Through the complete elimination of the remnants of the old division of labor and the essential social differences associated with it, the process of forming a socially homogeneous society will be completed.Communism signifies the transformation of the system of socialist self-government by the people, of socialist democracy into the highest form of organization of society: communist public self-government. With the maturation of the necessary socioeconomic and ideological preconditions and the involvement of all citizens in administration, the socialist state—given appropriate international conditions—will, as Lenin noted, increasingly become a transitional form [...] "from a state to a non-state." [...] The activities of state bodies will become non-political in nature, and the need for the state as a special political institution will gradually disappear.The inalienable feature of the communist mode of life is a high level of consciousness, social activity, discipline, and self-discipline of members of society, in which observance of the uniform, generally accepted rules of communist conduct will become an inner need and habit of every person.Communism is a social system under which the free development of each is a condition for the free development of all.|$|E
