5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round.

After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examined}} the influence of communication and decision-making factors on family planning and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> among couples. A total of five hundred couples from Ibadan metropolis constituted the sample for the study. Their ages ranged from 32 years to 45 years {{with a mean age}} of 38. 5 years and standard deviation of 11. 2. The two instruments used were author-constructed questionnaires with 0. 68 and 0. 63 reliability coefficient respectively. The data obtained were analysed using frequency counts, percentages and multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that significant relationship existed between each of the variables, and family planning and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> among the couples involved in the study. The results further indicated that a combination of the independent variables significantly predicted family planning and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>behaviours.</b> The results therefore, indicate the need counselling psychologists to take cognizance of those variables that have been found to influence family planning and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>behaviour</b> among couples. The results further recommend counselling psychologists to mount intervention strategies to help couples achieve effective family planning and <b>reproductive</b> health <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much {{knowledge}} has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{numerous}} polymorphic fertility genes {{have been}} associated with reproductive system diseases causing infertility/subfertility. nvestigations carried out in populations at natural fertility suggest that some fertility genes have acquired clinical relevance only in the last decades due to the interaction with contemporary <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> (birth control, delayed childbearing, and spacing birth order among others). In recent years, a new physiological role in human fertility regulation has emerged for the tumor suppressor p 53 gene (P 53), and the P 53 Arg 72 Pro polymorphism has been associated with recurrent implantation failure in humans. In order to detect a possible interaction between fertility gene P 53 and reproductive patterns, in present investigation we examined the impact of Arg 72 Pro polymorphism on fertility in two samples of Italian women collected from populations with different (premodern and modern) <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> not selected for impaired fertility. Among the women at near-natural fertility(n= 98), the P 53 genotypes were not associated with different reproductive efficiency, whereas among those with modern <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> (n= 68), the P 53 genotypes were associated with different mean numbers of children (Pro/Pro <Pro/Arg <Arg/Arg, = 0. 056) and a significant negative relationship between the number of children and P 53 Pro allele frequencies (p= 0. 028) was observed. These results are consistent with those of clinical studies reporting an association between the P 53 Pro allele and recurrent implantation failure. These findings seem to support the hypothesis that some common variants of fertility genes may have become “detrimental” following exposure to modern reproductive patterns and might t therefore be associated with reduced reproductive success...|$|R

500|$|Gastrotrich {{reproduction}} and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{has been little}} studied. That of macrodasiyds probably most represents that of the ancestral lineage and these more primitive gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, possessing {{both male and female}} sex organs. There is generally a single pair of gonads, the anterior portion of which contains sperm-producing cells and the posterior portion producing ova. The sperm is sometimes packaged in spermatophores, and is released through male gonopores that open, often temporarily, {{on the underside of the}} animal, roughly two-thirds of the way along the body. A copulatory organ on the tail collects the sperm and transfers it to the partner's seminal receptacle through the female gonopore. Details of the process and the behaviour involved vary with the species, and there are a range of different accessory reproductive organs. During copulation, the [...] "male" [...] individual uses his copulatory organ to transfer sperm to his partner's gonopore and fertilisation is internal. The fertilised eggs are released by rupture of the body wall which afterwards repairs itself. As is the case in most protostomes, development of the embryo is determinate, with each cell destined to become a specific part of the animal's body. At least one species of gastrotrich, Urodasys viviparus, is viviparous.|$|E

Among EA women only, current IPV was significantly associated with previous miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 41; 95 %CI, 1. 13 – 5. 14). In both groups of women, current IPV was associated with a lack of joint couple decision making about contraception; however, the magnitude of this effect was higher among PP women.

50|$|The ethological {{perspective}} (Barkow, 1980) {{suggests that}} self-esteem is an adaptation that has evolved {{for the purpose}} of maintaining dominance in relationships. It is said that human beings have evolved certain mechanisms for monitoring dominance in order to facilitate <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> such attaining a mate. Because attention and favorable reactions from others were associated with being dominant, feelings of self-esteem have also become associated with social approval and deference.

2500|$|The giant {{trevally}} is an [...] apex predator {{in most of}} its habitats, and {{is known}} to hunt individually and in schools. The species predominantly takes various fish as prey, although crustaceans, cephalopods and molluscs make up a considerable part of their diets in some regions. The species has some quite novel hunting strategies, including shadowing monk seals to pick off escaping prey, as well as using sharks to ambush prey. The species reproduces in the warmer months, with peaks differing by region. Spawning occurs at specific stages of the lunar cycle, when large schools congregate to spawn over reefs and bays, with <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviour</b> observed in the wild. The fish grows relatively fast, reaching sexual maturity at a length of around 60cm at three years of age. The giant trevally is both an important species to commercial fisheries and a recognised gamefish, with the species taken by nets and lines by professionals and by bait and lures by anglers. Catch statistics in the Asian region show hauls of 4,000–10,000 tonnes, while around 10,000 lbs of the species is taken in Hawaii each year. The species is considered poor to excellent table fare by different authors, although ciguatera poisoning is common from eating the fish. Dwindling numbers around the main Hawaiian Islands have also led to several proposals to reduce the catch of fish in this region.|$|E
2500|$|Saltwater {{crocodiles}} mate {{in the wet}} season, {{when water}} levels are at their highest. In Australia, {{the male and female}} engage in courtship in September and October, and the female lays eggs between November and March.

While crocodilians generally nest every year, there have been several recorded cases of female saltwater crocodiles nesting only every other year and also records of a female attempting to produce two broods in a single wet season. The female selects the nesting site, and both parents will defend the nesting territory, which is typically a stretch of shore along tidal rivers or freshwater areas, especially swamps. Nests are often in a surprisingly exposed location, often in mud with little to no vegetation around, and thus limited protection from the sun and wind.

40|$|Genetic {{parentage}} analyses reveal considerable {{diversity in}} alternative <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> (e. g. sneaking) in many taxa. However, {{little is known}} about whether these behaviours vary seasonally and between populations. Here, we investigate seasonal variation in male <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in a population of two-spotted gobies (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Norway. Male two-spotted gobies guard nests, attract females and care for fertilized eggs. We collected clutches and nest-guarding males early and late in the breeding season in artificial nests and used microsatellite markers to reconstruct parentage from a subset of offspring from each nest. We hypothesized that mating, reproductive success and sneaking should be more prevalent early in the breeding season when competition for mates among males is predicted to be higher. However, parentage analyses revealed similar values of mating, reproductive success and high frequencies of successful sneaking early (30 of nests) and late (27 of nests) in the season. We also found that multiple females with eggs in the same nest were fertilized by one or more sneaker males, indicating that some males in this population engage in a satellite strategy. We contrast our results to previous work that demonstrates low levels of cuckoldry in a population in Sweden. Our results demonstrate marked stability in both the genetic mating system and male alternative reproductive tactics over the breeding season. However, sneaking rates may vary geographically within a species, likely due to local selection influencing ecological factors encountered at different locations. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

40|$|International audienceMany animals attract mating {{partners}} {{through the}} release of volatile sex pheromones, which can convey information on the species, gender and receptivity of the sender to induce innate courtship and mating behaviours by the receiver. Male Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies display stereotyped <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> towards females, and these behaviours are controlled by the neural circuitry expressing male-specific isoforms of the transcription factor Fruitless (FRU(M)). However, the volatile pheromone ligands, receptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that promote male courtship have not been identified in this important model organism. Here we describe a novel courtship function of Ionotropic receptor 84 a (IR 84 a), which {{is a member of}} the chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptor family, in a previously uncharacterized population of FRU(M) -positive OSNs. IR 84 a-expressing neurons are activated not by fly-derived chemicals but by the aromatic odours phenylacetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde, which are widely found in fruit and other plant tissues that serve as food sources and oviposition sites for drosophilid flies. Mutation of Ir 84 a abolishes both odour-evoked and spontaneous electrophysiological activity in these neurons and markedly reduces male courtship behaviour. Conversely, male courtship is increased [...] in an IR 84 a-dependent manner [...] in the presence of phenylacetic acid but not in the presence of another fruit odour that does not activate IR 84 a. Interneurons downstream of IR 84 a-expressing OSNs innervate a pheromone-processing centre in the brain. Whereas IR 84 a orthologues and phenylacetic-acid-responsive neurons are present in diverse drosophilid species, IR 84 a is absent from insects that rely on long-range sex pheromones. Our results suggest a model in which IR 84 a couples food presence to the activation of the fru(M) courtship circuitry in fruitflies. These findings reveal an unusual but effective evolutionary solution to coordinate feeding and oviposition site selection with <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> through a specific sensory pathway...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{chemical}} communication involved in aggressive and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the European lobster (Homarus gammarus). Both male and female H. gammarus established and maintained dominance, but the sexes used different strategies for dominance maintenance. Male losers recognised individual fight opponents and avoided them but fought actively against unfamiliar dominants. In contrast, female losers avoided both familiar and unfamiliar dominants, indicating that they react to the dominance status of the opponent. Unexpectedly, females used more high-level aggression than males. Blocking of the urine release in male lobster pairs with established dominance led to increased fight duration and increased aggression in a subsequent encounter, de¬monstra¬ting the importance of urine signals for dominance maintenance in male H. gammarus. Intruding American lobsters (H. americanus) have repeatedly been caught in European waters. Since the two species are closely related and have similar food and shelter require-ments, aggressive and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> and communication signals may be similar and result in both competition for resources and possibly hybridisation. Aggressive interac-tions between male European and American lobsters showed that interspecific communi-cation and dominance maintenance indeed occurs between the two species. Lobsters often reproduce when the female is newly moulted, but mating can occur {{at any time during}} the female moult cycle. Intermoult courtship and mating behaviours were common in European lobsters, unless the sense of smell (olfaction) was blocked in the male, indicating the presence of a female pheromone that induces mating. Female olfaction was not important for these behaviours. A morphological study of the European lobster antenna demonstrated unique sex differ-ences in size and distribution of the olfactory aesthetasc hairs. Females had more antenna segments with aesthetascs than males, and also had longer aesthetascs. In contrast, males had more aesthetascs per antenna segment, possibly compensating for the fewer number of segments with this type of sensory hair...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} genetic {{consequences of}} supportive breeding {{programs are not}} well understood. Nevertheless, stocking populations with hatchery-produced fish to compensate for losses of natural production are common practice, for example after constructions of hydroelectric power dams. Hatcheries typically fertilize eggs using ‘mixed-milt fertilizations’, without consideration to natural <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and hence, natural selective regimes would be altered. Here, a series of experiments with focus on Mhc and mate choice in a population of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) {{with a history of}} long-term stocking are presented. The major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) constitutes of genes coding for antigen presentation in the vertebrate immune system. In addition to the immunological function, Mhc genes might also influence <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as mate choice. For example, in some species individuals are able to recognize Mhc genotypes of potential mates and to some extent base their mate choice on this information. Here, I address these questions on brown trout. Can the phenomena be observed in brown trout? Could such mechanisms help individuals to avoid inbreeding, or are other mechanisms important? How does the artificial rearing of fish for enhancement of natural populations relate to these issues? The results presented here, in combination with previous work, shows that several factors are important in the process of pair formation in salmonid species. For example, females of the studied population used more than a single criterion when choosing among the available mates Mhc genes and males with certain Mhc genotypes achieved more matings, possibly an effect from increased fighting ability. Further, the population appears to contain an unnatural high level of Mhc variation, and some results indicate that the population might suffer from outbreeding depression at the Mhc. These negative effects are most likely derived from compression of sub-populations after dam-construction, in combination with supportive breeding with no consideration to natural spawning behaviour...|$|R
