40|$|Insects have a {{remarkable}} ability to sense whether odours are released from one point source or from two closely separated ones. Therefore {{it is of}} interest to study the interactions of pheromone component odour plumes to affect the insect behaviour when the release points of different components are physically separated. It helps us to understand the mechanism that insects use to find their host or any attractive source. We studied the behavioural response of Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) males, in a walking bioassay, to two components of the female sex pheromone blend, (9 Z, 11 E-tetradecadienyl acetate) and(9 Z, 12 E-tetradecadienyl acetate), released from two separate dispensers at various distances (0 - 5 cm) from each other. The main pheromone component, 9 Z- 11 E- 14 :OAc was tested at 1 and 10 ng {{in combination with the}} minor component 9 Z- 12 E- 14 :OAc, at 1 % of the main component. The low dose always showed a lower behavioural response than the high dose at the same separation distances (0 - 5 cm). When low doses were used, the response was higher at 0 and 3 cm separation than other separations whereas when high doses were used there was not much difference in response at 0, 2, and 3 cm separations. A Photo Ionization Detector(PID) was used to investigate plume width and overlap. The PID showed that 5 cm separation of odour sources was enough to totally separate the odour plumes from each other, whereas at 3 cm separation, plumes partially overlapped. By comparing the behavioural <b>results</b> <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> data it is concluded that insects are much more sensitive than the PID, since they responded at distances where the PID showed zero ppb. Male insects may respond well to doses that are 20 times lower than one female equivalent. A field experiment for S. litura was done in Pakistan on cotton crop by spacing sex pheromone components. Pheromone components were spaced horizontally at 0, 3, 5 and 15 cm on plastic moth pheromone traps. The high dose attracted more males than the medium and low dose. Males were highly attracted at 0 cm separation but spacing decreased the catch and at 15 cm spacing there was no catch. The behavioural effect of separating ph. components was further studied on the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus L., in the field. The attraction of I. typographus to traps baited with the two aggregation pheromone components (cis-verbenol and 2 -metyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol) separated, was investigated in a Norway spruce clear-cut. The pheromone components were separated both vertically (0 - 112 cm) on extended Lindgren (19 funnel) traps and horizontally (0 - 80 cm) on modified windvane traps. I. typographus was strongly attracted when the two components were released from the same point but spacing between components decreased the trap catch. However, at 16 cm distance, in both the vertical and horizontal test, the trap catch was not much different from the positive control (0 cm separation). The effect of odour source spacing in the field on I. typographus was also studied with regards to repellent non-host volatiles (NHV). In this test, the aggregation pheromone were separated from a blend of repellents (trans-conopthorin, 1, 8 -cineol, 3 -octanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 1 -hexanol and verbenone) using the same experimental design. NHV showed strong inhibitory effect up to 48 cm spacing but there was not much effect at 80 and 112 cm separations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceShape memory alloys (SMA) {{are more}} and more {{integrated}} in engineering applications. These materials with their shape memory effect permit to simplify mechanism and {{to reduce the size of}} actuators. SMA parts can easily be activated by Joule effect but their modelling and consequently their control remains difficult, it is principally due to their hysteretic thermomechanical behaviour. Another difficulty is that the characteristics of the material are time-varying, especially during cyclic loadings. So, most of successful control strategy applied to SMA actuator are particularly heavy and used the Preisach model or neural networks to model the hysteretic behaviour of these material but this kind of models are difficult to identify and to use in real time. That is why this study deals with an application of the new framework of model-free control and restricted model control applied to a SMA spring based actuator. This control strategy is based on new results on fast derivative s estimation of noisy signals, its main advantages are: its simplicity, its robustness and the fact that it is easy to compute.

The research aimed to understand the evolving emotional experience between people and portable interactive devices (PIDs). Activity Theory was the theoretical framework used to contextualise the research approach and findings. Two longitudinal experiments were conducted investigating emotional experiences <b>with</b> <b>PIDs</b> over six months. Experiment 1 focused on media / entertainment PIDs while Experiment 2 focused on medical / health PIDs. Mixed research methods consisting of diaries, interviews and codiscovery sessions were used to collect data. Results identified that more social interactions were experienced <b>with</b> media <b>PIDs</b> than medical PIDs. Different Task Categories, and their emotional responses, were also revealed including Features, Functional, Mediation and Auxiliary Categories. Functional and Mediation categories were characterised as overall positive while Features and Auxiliary Categories were characterised as overall negative. Further, the consequences of Negative Personal and Social interactions on the overall emotional experience were determined. For media PIDs, Negative Social experiences adversely impacted the evolving emotional experience. For medical PIDs, both Negative Social and Negative Personal experiences adversely impacted the evolving emotional experience.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Many {{patients}} with {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID) present to their general practitioners. Chlamydia trachomatis is the organism most commonly implicated in this condition. This study aims to examine how well PID is managed in the primary care setting and highlight areas for improvement. METHODS: The study was performed by sending postal questionnaires to 180 randomly selected general practitioners in Birmingham. Given {{the example of a}} woman presenting clinically <b>with</b> <b>PID,</b> the doctors were asked questions on diagnosis and treatment. To assess factors that may influence the answers, they were also asked about their sex, year of qualification, and postgraduate training. RESULTS: 139 questionnaires (77 %) were returned. 91. 4 % of the respondents feel confident in managing patients <b>with</b> <b>PID,</b> and only 9. 3 % would usually refer these patients on. However, 54. 7 % do not perform an endocervical swab for C trachomatis, 37. 4 % do not include anti-chlamydial antibiotics in their treatment regimen, and 24. 5 % do not advise sexual partners to be screened. Female doctors, those with higher degrees, or obstetrics and gynaecology experience were more likely to give anti-chlamydial therapy, but no factors of the respondents significantly influenced contact tracing behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The management of a patient presenting <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> should include investigation for C trachomatis and treatment with an appropriate antibiotic. As PID is often a sexually transmitted disease, contact tracing of sexual partners should be undertaken. The study suggests that a significant proportion of general practitioners would not have offered optimal management to patients <b>with</b> <b>PID.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) is {{the most}} frequent malignancy associated with primary immune deficiency disease (PID). We aimed to present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Belarusian children <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> who developed NHL. Procedure. We reviewed 16 patients <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> and NHL. Eight patients had combined PID: 5 —Nijmegen breakage syndrome, 1 —Bloom syndrome, 1 —Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and 1 —Х-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. Results. In 75 % cases PID was diagnosed simultaneously or after the NHL was confirmed. PID-associated NHL accounted for 5. 7 % of all NHL and was characterized by younger median age (6. 3 versus 10. 0 years, P< 0. 05) and by prevalence of large-cell types (68. 8 % versus 24. 5 %, P< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this case-control study, investigating 51 in-patient women with acute {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID) and 50 healthy women attending for routine gynecological check-up, were to investigate the background and reproductive history of women, who are considered at low risk of sexually transmitted infection presenting <b>with</b> <b>PID,</b> to examine whether intrauterine device (IUD) use per se and long use affects the microbiology and clinical course of the disease, to identify risk factors for PID and to examine whether IUD use is an independent risk factor for PID. The most striking difference regarding the background and reproductive history between women <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> and healthy women over age 25 were related to socio-demographic factors and not to common risk factors for PID. There was little difference between healthy women and women <b>with</b> current <b>PID</b> <b>with</b> regard to single microbes. The finding of combinations of several anaerobic or aerobic/anaerobic microbes appeared to be associated <b>with</b> <b>PID,</b> particularly in women over 35. The pathogenesis of non-sexually transmitted PID appears {{to be associated with}} a synergistic effect between several pathogens, possibly facilitated by the presence of an IUD. IUD use per se was associated with an increased risk of PID in women 35 and older. There was an association between IUD use and complicated PID in women over 35, which was possibly influenced by long-term IUD use. Age over 35 and IUD use, independently of each other, were associated with an increased risk of failed conservative treatment, necessitating surgery in patients <b>with</b> <b>PID.</b> An observational study showed that Latvian obstetrician-gynecologists participate actively in contraceptive counseling and are very experienced with regard to IUD use. Physicians’ attitudes and perceptions towards IUD are generally positive and their clinical considerations are in good agreement with that of doctors in other countries. Antibiotics are widely used around IUD insertion by doctors, possibly driven by a liberal attitude towards IUD use in women with a potential risk of STI.

Materials and methods: Self- and parent-rated data from 25 children <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> were available. As controls, data from 50 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 89 healthy children were included. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory was used for HRQOL assessments. Anxiety symptoms were identified using the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders questionnaire, while depressive symptoms were identified using the Mood and Feeling Questionnaire. Results: Children <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> had significantly lower Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory total scores compared to children with JIA and healthy children as child-rated (P= 0. 02) and parent-rated (P< 0. 001). Specifically, they had significantly lowered emotional functioning compared to children with JIA, and social functioning compared to both children with JIA and healthy children. School functioning was significantly lower among children <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> (parent-rated only). By parent-rated responses, six (24 %) out of 25 children <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> had significant anxiety symptoms, while five (20 %) children had significant depressive symptoms, which was statistically higher than among children with JIA and healthy controls (P= 0. 05).

[...] Microorganisms associated <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> are listed below.|$|R
40|$|In IVIG-treated {{children}} <b>with</b> <b>PID,</b> protective PnPsAb {{levels for}} most pathogenic serotypes were obtained. A correlation was observed between PnPsAb levels in patients {{and in the}} IVIG product. This offers the potential to improve infection prevention by adapting the IVIG product and dose according to epidemiology...|$|R

We describe the finding of sonographic CMT in a patient who presented to the ED with pelvic pain and a difficult to localize physical examination. The patient was ultimately diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> and a TOA.|$|R
30|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979, Semchyshyn et al. found perihepatitis in 12 % of patients having PID, using only clinical criteria [15]. Onsrud et al. added laparoscopic criteria and found a 13.8 % rate of perihepatitis combined <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> [16]. This 2 -year study included all patients <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> who were examined in one hospital, from which 37 % had no right upper quadrant pain but had strong laparoscopic evidence of both PID and perihepatitis. Women who had undergone placement of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) within the previous 6  weeks had higher laparoscopic evidence of perihepatitis than those who retained such device for a longer period. Other studies from Paavonen et al. and Wang et al. demonstrated significantly lower laparoscopic and clinical evidence of perihepatitis related to PID [7, 8].|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{manipulator}} (FM) is {{a robotic}} arm that can accomplish different tasks and the arm is a lightweight type, which means {{at least one}} dimension of their cross section is relatively small compared to their length. This project presents the development of direct strain feedback (DSFB) <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> controller for vibration control of a FM system. Strain gauge is the main sensor used as a strain measurement for giving a feedback to the system. The strain measurement also {{has been used as}} a displacement sensor at the endpoint of the link. The displacement was used to observe the performance of the system. The performances of the controllers are assessed in terms of the input tracking capability (desired position) and vibration reduction as compared to original system. Finally, the DSFB <b>with</b> <b>PID</b> has been implemented to achieve the desired performance...|$|R
