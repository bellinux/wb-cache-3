25|$|<b>Radioteletype</b> (RTTY) is a {{telecommunications}} system consisting originally {{of two or}} more electromechanical teleprinters in different locations connected by radio rather than a wired link. These machines were superseded by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate teleprinters. <b>Radioteletype</b> evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s. The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US military used <b>radioteletype</b> in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. From the 1980s, teleprinters were replaced by computers running teleprinter emulation software.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{data can}} be encoded and {{transmitted}} via FM by shifting the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits - for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0. This modulation technique is known as frequency-shift keying (FSK). FSK is widely used in modems and fax modems, and {{can also be used}} to send Morse code. <b>Radioteletype</b> also uses FSK.|$|E
25|$|Morse Code {{cannot be}} treated as a {{classical}} <b>radioteletype</b> (RTTY) signal when it comes to calculating a link margin or a link budget for the simple reason of it possessing variable length dots and dashes as well as variant timing between letters and words. For the purposes of Information Theory and Channel Coding comparisons, the word PARIS is used to determine Morse Code's properties because it has an even number of dots and dashes.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{personal}} computers have encouraged {{the use of}} digital modes such as <b>radioteletype</b> (RTTY) which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment. Hams led the development of packet radio in the 1970s, which has employed protocols such as AX.25 and TCP/IP. Specialized digital modes such as PSK31 allow real-time, low-power communications on the shortwave bands. EchoLink using Voice over IP technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local Internet-connected repeaters and radio nodes, while IRLP has allowed the linking of repeaters to provide greater coverage area. Automatic link establishment (ALE) has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with global coverage. Other modes, such as FSK441 using software such as WSJT, are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>radioteletype</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} both the original <b>radioteletype</b> system, sometimes described as [...] "Baudot", {{as well as the}} entire family of systems connecting two or more teleprinters or PCs using software to emulate teleprinters, over radio, regardless of alphabet, link system or modulation.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{combinations}} {{of speed and}} shift are standardized for specific services using the original <b>radioteletype</b> system: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} (or [...] "Baudot") <b>radioteletype</b> {{system is}} based almost invariably on the Baudot code or ITA-2 5 bit alphabet. The link {{is based on}} character asynchronous transmission with 1 start bit and 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits. Transmitter modulation is normally FSK (F1B). Occasionally, an AFSK signal modulating an RF carrier (A2B, F2B) is used on VHF or UHF frequencies. Standard transmission speeds are 45.45, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 300 baud.|$|E
2500|$|As truce talks continued, {{communist}} [...] "land grab" [...] attacks became common. By July 1953, {{the final}} month's fighting, the 6147th TCG was keeping {{as many as}} 28 [...] "Mosquito" [...] T-6s on forward air control duties simultaneously. On 12 July 1953, the Air Force Joint Operations Center finally established secure trustworthy communications via <b>Radioteletype</b> between itself and the Navy's Task Force 77. A naval liaison officer was also stationed at the JOC. By combat's end, the communists had lost an estimated 72,000 men in their final offensive.|$|E
2500|$|PSK31 or [...] "Phase Shift Keying, 31 Baud", also BPSK31 and QPSK31, is {{a popular}} computer-sound card-generated <b>radioteletype</b> mode, used {{primarily}} by amateur radio operators to conduct real-time keyboard-to-keyboard chat, most often using frequencies in the high frequency amateur radio bands (near-shortwave). [...] PSK31 is distinguished from other digital modes {{in that it is}} specifically tuned to have a data rate close to typing speed, and has an extremely narrow bandwidth, allowing many conversations in the same bandwidth as a single voice channel. This narrow bandwidth also concentrates the RF energy [...] in a very narrow bandwidth, allowing relatively low-power equipment (25 watts) to communicate globally using the same skywave propagation used by shortwave radio stations.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, new {{organizations}} focused on amateur <b>radioteletype</b> started to appear. The [...] "British Amateur Radio Teletype Group", BARTG, {{now known as}} the [...] "British Amateur Radio Teledata Group" [...] was formed in June 1959. The Florida RTTY Society was formed in September 1959. Amateur Radio operators outside of Canada and the United States began to acquire surplus teleprinter and receive permission to get on the air. The first recorded RTTY QSO in the UK occurred in September 1959 between G2UK and G3CQE. A few weeks later, G3CQE had the first G/VE RTTY QSO with VE7KX. This was quickly followed up by G3CQE QSOs with VK3KF and ZL3HJ. Information on how to acquire surplus teleprinter equipment continued to spread and before long it was possible to work all continents on RTTY.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, amateur radio {{operators}} in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators {{with the understanding}} that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. [...] "The Amateur <b>Radioteletype</b> and VHF Society" [...] was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to [...] "The VHF Teletype Society" [...] and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur <b>radioteletype</b> QSO of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW's test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of [...] "The RTTY Society of Southern California" [...] publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at {{the beginning and the end}} of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.|$|E
