5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Class DD13 6th-batch locomotives, the Class DD14 was a single-end-cab design with a <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough</b> {{unit at the}} cab end. It was the first {{diesel-powered}} <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough</b> built by JNR. The locomotives had two [...] diesel engines. One engine {{could be used for}} propulsion with the other driving the <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough</b> unit, giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 3,000 tonnes per hour, or the unit could be operated in multiple with a second locomotive allowing both engines to drive the <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough,</b> giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 4,000 tonnes per hour.|$|E
50|$|The Class DD14 (DD14å½¢) was a B'B' wheel {{arrangement}} {{diesel-hydraulic locomotive}} type operated in Japan as a self-propelled <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough</b> unit from 1961 to 2015 {{by the national}} railway company Japanese National Railways (JNR), and later by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). West Japan Railway Company (JR West), and Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido).|$|E
50|$|Another current {{project is}} the {{restoration}} of a steam-powered <b>rotary</b> <b>snowplough</b> {{to deal with the}} heavy snowfall that needs to be cleared from the route before services can commence each year. This may provide a lucrative opportunity as photographers and film-makers from across Europe and the world will be keen to capture such clearances on camera.|$|E
