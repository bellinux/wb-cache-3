40|$|The Oligocene-Early Miocene As Pontes basin is a non-marine strike-slip basin, {{filled with}} small-sized {{alluvial}} fan deposits and related coal-bearing lacustr'ine-palustrine successions. The heavy mineral associations were determined in samples collected from two coal exploration wells, which cut the whole basin infill succession. The resulting data {{enabled us to}} reconstruct {{the evolution of the}} relief in the source areas that supplied sediment to the basin. The source areas were small and located in Precambrian to Palaeozoic (Cambrian-Silurian) rocks belonging to a basement structured during the Variscan orogeny. The main factor controlling the final heavy mineral assemblage in the Tertiary sequences was the initial source area lithology. Climatic variations and transport do not seem to {{have played a role in}} modifying the resulting heavy mineral composition. The environmental conditions in the basin led to a pervasive, early diagenetic sulfide neoformation in the terrigenous facies, whereas other diagenetic processes were not significant. The catchment areas which fed the As Pontes basin were mainly controlled by the major Pedroso-As Pontes-Moiñonovo fault system. They reached their maximum extent eastward, whereas their areal extent was more restricted northward and westward. Source area uplift and <b>relief</b> <b>rejuvenation</b> are recorded in the sedimentary infill by an increase in contribution of detrital grains ofultrastable heavy mineral (mainly zircon and tourmaline) fed from the metamorphic Precambrian 0110 de Sapo domain. Moreover, the progressive incision and down cutting ofthe drainage networks are recorded by progressive variation in the relative metamorphic heavy mineral percentages (biotite, gamet, andalusite, staurolite, sillimanite and kyanite...|$|E
40|$|An echo-character {{analysis}} of the oil tanker Prestige wreck area was undertaken using high-resolution marine geophysical methods (TOPAS and airgun seismic-reflection profiles, multibeam echosounder and TOBI sidescan sonar). Integration and comparison of the results using all these methods is presented given some practical applications for indirect near-surface and seafloor interpretations. Ten different echo types were identified and grouped into four main classes: I) distinct; II) indistinct; III) irregular and IV) hyperbolic. Echo-character distribution enabled us to determine recent sedimentary processes in the area. Two major depositional systems can be found through the identification of these sedimentary processes: a) a slope depositional system (SDS) located in the eastern and central area, where mass-movement processes are dominant and b) a turbiditic Main Channel depositional system (TDS) located in the western area where channel-related processes are dominant. Both of these interact over the half-graben structure of the southwestern sector of the Galicia Bank, where the Prestige wreck is located. Within the SDS, erosive and depositional mass-movement processes characterised a complex depositional system. Erosive processes occur on the fault scarp, channels head, inter-lobe channels and distal part of the sedimentary lobes. Moreover, depositional processes {{take place on the}} top of the fault scarp, sedimentary wedges, sedimentary lobes, and on the west flank of the Main Channel. Both depositional systems interact, but the SDS should be more active during fault-scarp reactivation periods, through <b>relief</b> <b>rejuvenation</b> and new exposed deposits. Microearthquake activity would favour the available materials, being weathered, eroded and transported by mass-movements. In such a situation, the TDS acts as the main collector of eroded sediment derived from the fault scarp throughout the SDS being responsible for its evacuation into the Iberian Abyssal Plain.

40|$|Basic surface {{features}} of the Łask Interfluve near Zduńska Wola originated during the Wartanian ice-sheet areal deglaciation. The ice-sheet waning resulted in formation of groups of crevasse landforms such as kame plateaux, kame hillocks, kame terraces and melt-out depressions. The post-Wartanian morphogenesis increased diversity of the <b>relief</b> by <b>rejuvenation</b> of most of buried valleys, by cutting new valleys and raising the interfluve surface with aeolian sheets and dunes. Sand and silt were deposited in melt-out depressions. The depressions had initially functioned as closed depressions and had formed a local base level. They were incorporated into a valley network presumably {{at the end of}} the Vistulian glaciation. Blocks of dead ice melted gradually and it has led to the formation of flattenings in the melt-out depressions bottoms. The flattenings are 2 - 3 m high and have short gentle slopes. These slopes and the slopes of the melt-out depressions are cut with dells and basin-like valleys. Few of the cuttings continue their direction as barely perceptible, shallow flat-floored valleys drained by perennial or intermittent watercourses. In the Holocene eight types of geocomplexes with stable matter and energy structure were formed, as a result od natural processes. Man's influence has led to diversification of the environment which can be represented by 19 types of present-day geocomplexes. The 19 types are characteristic of all the melt-out depressions in the environs of Zduńska Wola, but they display a unique mosaic in each depression. It is noteworthy that the depressions function as groups of homolithic geocomplexes. Man-made changes in the depressions result from agricultural land useArtykuł przedstawia typologię i funkcjonowanie geokompleksów zagłębień wytopiskowych na tle rozwoju paleogeograficznego zachodniego fragmentu Wysoczyzny Laskiej w okolicach Zduńskiej Woli.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to review Middle Permian through Middle Triassic {{continental}} successions in European. Secondly, areas of Middle–Late Permian sedimentation, the Permian–Triassic Boundary (PTB) and the onset of Triassic sedimentation at the scale of the westernmost peri-Tethyan domain are defined in order to construct palaeogeographic maps of the area and to discuss the impact of tectonics, climate and sediment supply on the preservation of continental sediment. At the scale of the western European peri-Tethyan basins, the Upper Permian is characterised by a general progradational pattern from playa-lake or floodplain to fluvial environments. In the northern Variscan Belt domain, areas of sedimentation were either isolated or connected to the large basin, which was occupied by the Zechstein Sea. In the southern Variscan Belt, during the Late Permian, either isolated endoreic basins occurred, with palaeocurrent directions indicating local sources, or basins underwent erosion and/or there was no deposition. These basins were not connected with the Tethys Ocean, which could be explained by a high border formed by Corsica–Sardinia palaeorelief and even parts of the Kabilia microplate. The palaeoflora and sedimentary environments suggest warm and semi-arid climatic conditions. At the scale of the whole study area, an unconformity (more or less angular) is observed almost everywhere between deposits of the Upper Permian and Triassic, except in the central part of the Germanic Basin. The sedimentation gap is more developed in the southern area where, in some basins,Upper Permian sediment does not occur. The large sedimentary supply, erosion and/or lack of deposition during the Late Permian, as well as the variable palaeocurrent direction pattern between theMiddle–Late Permian and the Early Triassic indicate a period of <b>relief</b> <b>rejuvenation</b> during the Late Permian. During the Induan, all the intra-belt basins were under erosion and sediment was only preserved in the extra-belt domains (the northern and extreme southern domains). In the northern domain (the central part of the Germanic Basin), sediment was preserved under the same climatic conditions as during the latest Permian, whereas in the extreme southern domain, it was probably preserved in the Tethys Ocean, implying a large amount of detrital components entering themarinewaters. Mesozoic sedimentation began in the early Olenekian; the ephemeral fluvial systems indicate arid climatic conditions during this period. Three distinct areas of sedimentation occur: a northern and southern domain, separated by an intra-belt domain. The latter accumulated sediments during the Early–Middle Permian and experienced erosion and/or no-deposition conditions between the Middle–Late Permian and the beginning of Mesozoic sedimentation, dated as Anisian to Hettangian. At the top of the Lower Triassic, another tectonically induced, more or less angular unconformity is observed: the Hardegsen unconformity, which is dated as intra-Spathian and is especially found in the North European basins. This tectonic activity created new source areas and a new fluvial style, with marine influences at the distal part of the systems. During the Anisian and Ladinian, continental sedimentation was characterised by a retrogradational trend. In other words, the fluvial system evolved into fluvio-marine environments, attesting to a direct influence of the Tethys Ocean in the southern and northern domains.
