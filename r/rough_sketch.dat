5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and <b>rough</b> <b>sketch,</b> drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> {{of the eastern}} Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) {{as well as the}} names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to global}} demand and the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

He included a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of his design in the memorandum.|$|E
25|$|Paxton {{left his}} 9 June 1850 meeting with Henry Cole fired with enthusiasm. He {{immediately}} went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board {{meeting of the}} Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he famously doodled onto a sheet of pink blotting paper. This <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> (now in the Victoria & Albert Museum) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, {{and it is a}} mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks.|$|E
25|$|George McCready Price {{attempted}} {{to fit a}} great deal of earth's geological history into a model based on a few accounts from the Bible. Price's simple model was used by Whitcomb and Morris initially but they did not build on the model in the 60s and 70s. However, a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of a creationist model could be constructed from creationist publications and debate material. Recent creationist efforts attempt to build complex models that incorporate as much scientific evidence as possible into the Biblical narrative. Some scientific evidence used for these models was formerly rejected by creationists. These models attempt to explain continental movements in a short time frame, the order of the fossil record, and the Pleistocene ice age.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{constructing}} the Taipei Metro was first put forth {{at a press}} conference on June 28, 1968, where the Minister of Transportation and Communications Sun Yun-suan announced his ministry's plans to begin researching the possibility {{of constructing}} a rapid transit network in the Taipei metropolitan area; however, the plan was shelved due to fiscal concerns and the belief that such a system was not urgently needed at the time. With the increase of traffic congestion accompanying economic growth in the 1970s, the need for a rapid transit system became more pressing. In February 1977, the Institute of Transportation (IOT) of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) released a preliminary rapid transport system report, with the designs of five lines, including U1, U2, U3, S1, and S2, to form a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of the planned corridors, resulting in the first rapid transit system plan for Taipei.|$|E
25|$|Chapman J. Root, {{president}} of the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and Earl R. Dean, bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design {{on one of the}} soda's two ingredients, the coca leaf or the kola nut, but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped cocoa pod in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Dean made a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.|$|E
25|$|A {{breakaway}} rim is {{a basketball}} hoop that can bend slightly when a player dunks a basketball, and then instantly snap {{back into its}} original shape when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without shattering the backboard, and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. According to the Lemelson Center, an affiliation of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the breakaway rim was invented by Arthur Ehrat. After six years, from July 1976 to December 1982, Ehrat received a patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,365,802). His application was rejected twice, with patent examiner Paul Shapiro noting that Frederick C. Tyner held a patent for a similar device (U.S. Patent No. 4,111,420). However, a court appeal finally {{ruled in favor of}} Ehrat, as he proved through notarized copies of canceled checks and a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of his invention, that he was working on his breakaway basketball goal in 1975 before Frederick Tyner conceived of his.|$|E

He painted {{directly on}} the white canvas, without <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm...|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Salvo {{presented}} artist Ernie Runyon with a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of {{his ideas}} for the game. The crew of Apollo brainstormed titles {{for half an hour}} before deciding on Lost Luggage; Runyon later remembered one of the proposed titles was [...] "Airport Mayhem". Runyon programmed the game with help from Salvo. He has stated {{he would have liked to}} include a luggage train, but there was not enough room in the 4-kilobyte cartridge. Salvo had difficulties with collision detection and synchronizing the character movements with the joystick, which took one week to fix. Due to a hardware issue, a graphical bug would also occur whenever a suitcase was captured, which was solved by compiling the game on another computer.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the run of}} the manga, {{the series}} used digital editing processes. After a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of a page was created, the page layout and basic detail were drawn and scanned into an Apple Macintosh. The major page {{elements}} were then shaded or filled with patterns, and elements that were drawn separately were added digitally to the page. [...] The manga also used a series of [...] "banked images", which were basic line drawings of locations, such as a characters room. Instead of redrawing a location from scratch every time it was used, these banked images {{could be used as a}} base, and extra detail added to them depending on the requirements for the scene.|$|E
5000|$|Game art {{design is}} {{a subset of}} game development. It {{is the process of}} {{creating}} the artistic aspects for video games. Video game art design begins in the pre-production phase of creating a video game. The video game artists are visual artists involved from the conception of the game and they make <b>rough</b> <b>sketches</b> of the characters, setting, objects, etc. [...] These starting concept designs can also be created by the game designers before the game is moved into actualization. Sometimes these are concept designs are called “programmer art”. After the <b>rough</b> <b>sketches</b> are completed and the game is ready to be moved forward those artists or more artists are brought in to bring these sketches to life through graphic design.|$|R

500|$|Waptia fieldensis {{was one of}} {{the first}} fossils {{discovered}} by Charles D. Walcott from the Burgess Shale in August 1909. A <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of Waptia is present in his diary for August 31, 1909, alongside sketches of Marrella and Naraoia. A formal description for the species was published by Walcott in 1912. The species was named after the two mountains connected by the Fossil Ridge containing the Burgess Shale locality, Mount Wapta and Mount Field of Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. The name of Mount Wapta itself comes from the First Nation Nakoda word , meaning [...] "running water"; while Mount Field was named after the American telecommunications pioneer Cyrus West Field.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} before the levitation, scaring Lord Lindsay, Home had opened the same window, stepped out and stood on the outside ledge in the {{presence}} of two witnesses. Ivor Lloyd Tuckett argued that Home did this to provide [...] "a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of the picture which he aimed at producing". Another possible natural explanation for Home's famous levitation was proposed by the psychical researcher Guy William Lambert who suggested he had attached a rope to the chimneys {{on the roof of the}} building, and hung the rope down unseen to the third floor. During the alleged levitation Home [...] "swung out and in" [...] the room by using a double rope maneuver. Lambert's rope hypothesis was supported by the magician John Booth.|$|E
500|$|The Greek term [...] "pteryx" [...] (...) {{primarily}} means [...] "wing", but {{can also}} designate merely [...] "feather". Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's remex (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a <b>rough</b> <b>sketch</b> of the London specimen, to which he referred as a [...] "Skelett eines mit ähnlichen Federn bedeckten [...] " [...] ("skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term Schwinge which {{does not necessarily mean}} a wing used for flying. Urschwinge was the favoured translation of Archaeopteryx among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, [...] "ancient pinion" [...] offers a rough approximation.|$|E
