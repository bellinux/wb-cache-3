They do not address wireless network issues explicitly. This paper presents a protocol that not only guarantees exact delivery but also checks the validity of messages to avoid duplication and assure exactly once medical <b>record</b> <b>delivery</b> in mobile communication environments...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Birth {{records and}} {{hospital}} admission records are valuable {{for research on}} maternal smoking, but individually are known to under-estimate smokers. This study investigated {{the extent to which}} combining data from these records enhances the identification of pregnant smokers, and whether this affects research findings such as estimates of maternal smoking prevalence and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with smoking. Methods: A total of 846, 039 birth records in New South Wales, Australia, (2001 - 2010) were linked to hospital admission <b>records</b> (<b>delivery</b> and antenatal). Algorithm 1 combined data from birth and <b>delivery</b> admission <b>records,</b> whereas algorithm 2 combined data from birth <b>record,</b> <b>delivery</b> and antenatal admission records. Associations between smoking and placental abruption, preterm birth, stillbirth, and low birthweight were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Algorithm 1 identified 127, 612 smokers (smoking prevalence 15. 1 %), which was a 9. 6 % and 54. 6 % increase over the unenhanced identification from birth records alone (prevalence 13. 8 %), and <b>delivery</b> admission <b>records</b> alone (prevalence 9. 8 %), respectively. Algorithm 2 identified a further 2, 408 smokers from antenatal admission records. The enhancement varied by maternal socio-demographic characteristics (age, marital status, country of birth, socioeconomic status); obstetric factors (multi-fetal pregnancy, diabetes, hypertension); and maternity hospital. Enhanced and unenhanced identification methods yielded similar odds ratios for placental abruption, preterm birth, stillbirth and low birthweight. Conclusions: Use of linked data improved the identification of pregnant smokers. Studies relying on a single data source should adjust for the under-ascertainment of smokers among certain obstetric populations. © 2014 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Poor {{medical record}} {{documentation}} remains a pervasive problem in hospital delivery rooms, hampering efforts {{aimed at improving}} the quality of maternal and neonatal care in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the feasibility and completeness of labor room documentation within a quasi-experimental study aimed at improving emergency preparedness for obstetric and neonatal emergencies in 8 nonteaching, subdistrict, secondary care hospitals of Karnataka state, India. Methods: We redesigned the existing open-ended case sheet into a structured, <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> cum job aide adhering to principles of local clinical relevance, parsimony, and computerizability. Skills and emergency drills training along with supportive supervision were introduced in 4 “intervention arm” hospitals while the new <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> were used in eight intervention and control hospitals. Results: Introduction of the new <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> was feasible over a “run-in” period of 4 months. About 92 % (6103 of 6634) of women in intervention facilities and 80 % (6205 of 7756) in control facilities had their <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> filled in during the 1 -year study period. Completeness of <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> documentation fell into one of two subsets with one set of parameters being documented with minimal inputs (in both intervention and control sites) and another set of parameters requiring more intensive training efforts (and seen more in intervention than in control sites; P <. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the single}} {{greatest}} contributor to the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Our objective is to determine if holistic CVD risk assessment, introduced {{as part of the}} new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Adult Health Check (AHC), results in better identification of elevated CVD risk, improved delivery of preventive care for CVD and improvements in the CVD risk profile for Aboriginal adults in a remote community. Methods Interrupted time series study over six years in a remote primary health care (PHC) service involving Aboriginal adults identified with elevated CVD risk (N = 64). Several process and outcome measures were audited at 6 monthly intervals for three years prior to the AHC (the intervention) and three years following: (i) the proportion of guideline scheduled CVD preventive care services delivered, (ii) mean CVD medications prescribed and dispensed, (iii) mean PHC consultations, (iv) changes in participants' CVD risk factors and estimated absolute CVD risk and (v) mean number of CVD events and iatrogenic events. Results Twenty-five percent of AHC participants were identified as having elevated CVD risk. Of these, 84 % had not been previously identified during routine care. Following the intervention, there were significant improvements in the <b>recorded</b> <b>delivery</b> of preventive care services for CVD (30 % to 53 %), and prescription of CVD related medications (28 % to 89 %) (P P = 0. 004) following the intervention. However, there were no significant changes in the mean number of PHC consultations or mean number of CVD events or iatrogenic events. Conclusions Holistic CVD risk assessment during an AHC can lead to better and earlier identification of elevated CVD risk, improvement in the <b>recorded</b> <b>delivery</b> of preventive care services for CVD, intensification of treatment for CVD, and improvements in participants' CVD risk profile. Further research is required on strategies to reorient and restructure PHC services to the care of chronic illness for Aboriginal peoples in remote areas for there to be substantial progress in decreasing excess CVD related mortality. </p...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} variables {{available in}} early Swedish <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> and {{their relation to}} birth outcomes for home and hospital deliveries in Gothenburg at {{the early part of}} this century.  DESIGN—A retrospective recovery of original <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> and social variables in a cross sectional population.  SETTING—Gothenburg, Sweden.  PARTICIPANTS— 851 fullterm singleton female births with known gestational age born into five birth cohorts on selected dates (1908,  1914,  1918,  1922  and 1930).  MAIN RESULTS—Delivery site, maternal parity, gestational age, and social group were significant factors influencing birth outcome as birth weight and length. The mean birth weight and length of hospital born infants was consistently lower than for home deliveries across all cohorts. Site of delivery changed significantly during the period of births under study, 1908 - 1930.  CONCLUSIONS—In this study, which was based on original <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> from {{the early part of this}} century, it was found that delivery site was an important factor influencing birth outcome across five birth cohorts.
