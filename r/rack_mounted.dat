25|$|Also in 1954 Evans Products, a {{manufacturer}} of loading racks for carrying automobiles in conventional boxcars, developed a bi-level Auto-Loader superstructure with an elevating top deck capable of carrying six cars or light trucks on a typical flatcar. Two prototype units were constructed and mounted on conventional 53ft flat cars for field testing. NYC 500085 carried a semi-streamlined rack, while UP 5800 had a more utilitarian <b>rack</b> <b>mounted.</b> Neither design went into commercial production.|$|E
25|$|The SX-28 saw use {{by various}} {{branches}} of U.S. and allied military and signals intelligence agencies during World War II. SX-28 and Hallicrafters S-27 and S-36 receivers were often <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> in British government listening posts and secret listening stations for monitoring German radar and communications {{during the war}} such as Beaumanor Hall in the English Midlands where German and Italian encrypted radio messages were sent to Bletchley Park for decoding. A number of the receivers were sent to Russia {{as a part of}} the Lend Lease Act, subsequently modified to accommodate Russian tubes.|$|E
25|$|Seeking a more {{efficient}} method, in February 1959 the Saint Louis-San Francisco Railroad (SL-SF, or Frisco) designed and built a prototype bi-level <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> on 42-foot flat car SL-SF 95844. Satisfied that the basic concept was sound, the railroad contracted with Pullman-Standard to design and construct a full-size tri-level prototype. The result that rolled out of the Pullman plant on January 29, 1960 was SLSF 3000, an 83-foot tri-level car capable of carrying 12 automobiles. When testing proved the car satisfactory the Frisco ordered 130 production cars, SL-SF 3001–3130, delivered by Pullman that August and September.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 the Frisco wasn't {{the only}} {{railroad}} experimenting with racks mounted on flat cars to carry automobiles. In January the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) constructed a prototype trilevel <b>rack</b> <b>mounted</b> on 53-foot flat ATSF 90082. Santa Fe's first production auto racks were 85-foot trilevel Auto-Veyor units supplied by Dana-Spicer and Whitehead & Kales {{later in the}} year, both mounted on General American-built G85 cars. The Southern Pacific actually took delivery of the first Whitehead & Kales Auto-Pack tri-level racks in April, mounting them on General American-built Clejan and G85 cars. The slightly longer 85-foot racks could carry 12 full size or 18 compact autos per car. Several other railroads quickly ordered their own auto racks from Dana and W or from American Car & Foundry, Darby Corporation, Evans Products, Paragon Bridge & Steel, or Thrall Car Manufacturing. The Santa Fe and Frisco also built some of their autoracks in their own car shops.|$|E
