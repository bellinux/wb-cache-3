40|$|The present article joint costs {{attribution}} methods {{applied to}} <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding</b> activity are discussed. In this activity, {{as well as}} in other agrobusiness, the costs incurred along the initial phases of the production cannot be directly imputed to the several products generated up to the separation point, but after this point. That is due to the diversity of characteristics presented by the several coproducts and by-products obtained in <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding.</b> Through a bibliographical research the main methods of attribution of joint costs were verified, and from a case study it is tried to demonstrate the application of these methods in the <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding.</b> It was verified that the several existent methods are based in tracking of the general production costs before the partition point. It is possible to infer that all of the methods of joint costs attribution {{can be applied to the}} <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding</b> activity, displaying advantages and disadvantages, falling to the manager to decide the best one to be used in his operation. Due to the characteristics of the <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding,</b> it is considered that the method of the technical indexes is it which would better adapt to this activity. <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding,</b> joint cost, methods of cost’s allocations.,...|$|R

50|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} meerkats (Suricata suricatta) {{the dominant}} <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> {{is the oldest}} and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate <b>females</b> during the <b>breeding</b> season and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group. Evicted subordinates suffer repeated attacks during the later stages of the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pregnancy and showed GC levels two times higher than normal. Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> evicts all subordinate females, {{but if it is}} large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.|$|R

50|$|Caribou have {{developed}} adaptions for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months {{as well as}} for during cold months. The body composition of caribou varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> between seasons. <b>Breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> as non-breeding females were able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>females</b> peaked in September. During the months of March through April, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> have more fat mass than the nonbreeding females with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the <b>breeding</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

40|$|Intensive <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding</b> {{normally}} {{involves the}} use of small collective cages housing from 2 to 8 rabbits according to the surface area of the cage. Average density normally lies between 15 and 18 rabbits/m 2. Increased interest in safeguarding animal welfare in livestock farming and the need to reduce intensive rabbit production costs have led in recent years to studying alternative housing to the classic cage. In this context, <b>rabbit</b> <b>breeding</b> in colonies could represent an interesting alternative to the classic cage. Colonial breeding and greater space availability appear to better satisfy the behavioural needs of rabbits and their welfare (Ferrante et al., 1997).

5000|$|Infanticide is a {{mechanism}} of reproductive success {{that occurs in}} many species. Alpha female dwarf mongooses and African wild dogs kill offpring other than their own, but alpha males do not use infanticide to enforce reproductive suppression. This may occur because the breeding alpha may have sired a rare subordinate's offspring. Subordinate females time their rare pregnancies such that they give birth several days after the alpha female {{to reduce the risk}} of infanticide.Pregnant suborordinate meerkats are known to kill the pups of the dominant <b>breeding</b> <b>female.</b> No dominant female pups have ever been observed killed after their 4th day of life. Evicted subordinate females are kept out for 3 days after the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> gave birth.Eight infanticides involving the killing of a subordinate female's offspring by the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> have been observed in wild common marmosets, as well as two instances of infanticide in which the subordinate female bred and then killed the <b>breeding</b> <b>female's</b> babies. [...] Infanticidal marmoset females are often in the last trimester of pregnancy, but postpartum females don't commit infanticide.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of helpers allows the <b>breeding</b> <b>female</b> to reduce her prenatal {{investment in the}} offspring, which may lead to altricial births; altricial is the production of young which are dependent upon adult aid to survive.
