60|$|There {{is another}} inquiry which bears {{indirectly}} upon this question, and upon which I must {{say a few}} words. You are all of you aware of the phenomena {{of what is called}} spontaneous generation. Our forefathers, down to the seventeenth century, or thereabouts, all imagined, in perfectly good faith, that certain vegetable and animal forms gave birth, in the process of their decomposition, to insect life. Thus, if you put a piece of meat in the sun, and allowed it to putrefy, they conceived that the grubs which soon began to appear were the result of the action of a power of spontaneous generation which the meat contained. And they could give you receipts for making various animal and vegetable preparations which would produce particular kinds of animals. A very distinguished Italian naturalist, named Redi, took up the question, at a time when everybody believed in it; among others our own great Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood. You will constantly find his name quoted, however, as an opponent of the doctrine of spontaneous generation; but the fact is, and you will see it if you will take the trouble to look into his works, Harvey believed it as profoundly as any man of his time; but he happened to enunciate a very curious proposition--that every living thing came from an 'egg'; he did not mean to use the word in the sense in which we now employ it, he only meant to say that every living thing originated in a little <b>rounded</b> <b>particle</b> of organized substance; and it is from this circumstance, probably, that the notion of Harvey having opposed the doctrine originated. Then came Redi, and he proceeded to upset the doctrine in a very simple manner. He merely covered the piece of meat with some very fine gauze, and then he exposed it to the same conditions. The result of this was that no grubs or insects were produced; he proved that the grubs originated from the insects who came and deposited their eggs in the meat, and that they were hatched by the heat of the sun. By this kind of inquiry he thoroughly upset the doctrine of spontaneous generation, for his time at least.|$|E

40|$|Inert gas {{condensation}} (IGC) {{has been}} employed to produce nanoparticles of the low-temperature combustion catalyst CuOx/CeO 2. For {{the first time}} we have used a multiple heating crucible setup to tailor various morphologies over the whole compositional range (2 - 98 % Cu). The factors that control the growth, structure, and morphology of the nanocomposite have been studied. A powerful combination of complementary characterization methods has been used to elucidate the catalytic synergistics of this material. Investigations by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) are supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-energy diffraction (HED) measurements. The nonstoichiometric CuOx/CeO 2 composite displays an amorphous character consisting of aggregated CeO 2 (ceria) nanocrystallites over which amorphous copper clusters (or a thin film of a solid solution) are finely dispersed. In the range 6 similar to 20 % Cu, copper is predominantly located at the surface, which can give the material optimum catalytic properties. Development of crust structures, for example, core-shells, are formed in the 30 similar to 70 % Cu concentration range and is attributable to a sequential oxidation of Ce followed by Cu and an ideal proportion of lattice expansion for the oxides. We suggest a model that illustrates the formation of the crust structure and may explain the observed extreme dispersion of copper on ceria. The helium gas pressure during the thermalization controls the crystal size and the degree of crystallite aggregation. <b>Rounded</b> <b>particle</b> shapes consisting of epitaxially interfaced nanocrystallites exhibit an X-ray amorphous character, while block-shaped crystals displaying sharp edges and distinct flat surfaces give rise to a higher X-ray crystallinity.

40|$|Rockfills {{are widely}} used in civil engineering, such as dams, railways, and airport {{foundations}} in mountain areas. A significant long-term post-construction settlement may affect the serviceability or even the safety of rockfill infrastructures. The creep behavior of rockfills is influenced {{by a number of}} factors, such as particle size, strength and shape, water condition and stress level. However, the effect of particle shape on rockfill creep still remains poorly understood, which deserves a careful investigation. Particle-based discrete element method (DEM) was used to simulate the creep behavior of rockfills under different boundary conditions. Both angular and <b>rounded</b> <b>particles</b> were considered in this numerical study, in order to investigate the influence of particle shape. The preliminary results showed that angular particles experience more breakages and larger creep strains under one-dimensional compression than <b>rounded</b> <b>particles.</b> On the contrary, larger creep strains were observed in he rounded specimens in the direct shear test. The mechanism responsible for this difference is that the possibility of the existence of key <b>particle</b> in <b>rounded</b> <b>particles</b> is higher than that in angular particles. The above simulations demonstrate that the influence of particle shape on the creep behavior of rockfills can be simulated by DEM properly. The method of DEM simulation may facilitate our understanding of deformation properties of rockfill materials...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Amorphous {{silicate}} sediments comprise most of {{the upper}} part of the sedimentary column of the Atlantis II Deep, whereas more crystalline phases are found in the lower part. The objective of this study was to focus on the newly-formed, metastable, hydrothermal phases, that eventually transform into clays or Fe oxides. Short-range ordered Si-Fe phases (Si/Fe = 0. 20. 6) rounded to elliptical in shape, and amorphous Si-Fe platy phases (Si/Fe = 0. 09 pure Si) comprise some of the amorphous sediments in Atlantis II Deep. The <b>rounded</b> <b>particles</b> have distinct electron-dense (thicker, relatively ordered) margins and a less crystalline inner core. They have rhombohedral symmetry with unit-cell parameters of a = 0. 504 nm and c = 1. 08 nm.

Similar rounded phases (Si/Fe = 0. 26) were synthesized under saline, neutral, hydrothermal conditions (408 C, pH 7, 2 M NaCl) with initial Si/Fe = 1. 5.
