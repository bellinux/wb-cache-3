5|$|The Belgian {{resistance}} was praised by contemporaries for {{its contribution to}} the Allied war effort; particularly during the later period. In a letter to Lieutenant-General Pire, commander of the , General Eisenhower praised the <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Belgian resistance had played in disrupting German supply lines after D-Day. The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being {{able to use the}} country as a secure base, never fully becoming pacified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of a}} change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E

5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E

25|$|In opposition, Quon and {{the other}} {{respondents}} argued, as Wardlaw's concurrence had, that Ikuta and petitioners had greatly exaggerated the <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> less-intrusive-means test had played in the panel opinion, and that {{the facts of the}} case did not present any constitutional issues.

25|$|Calculations in the 1970s {{suggested}} that it may actually be weakly first-order due {{to the effect of}} long-range fluctuations in the electromagnetic field.

25|$|Because of the {{influential}} <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US stock market plays in international finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets {{that in the}} short run, shocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most {{of the variation in}} the US stock market. In the long run, the US stock market is profoundly affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks however play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the US stock market.|$|E

25|$|The contact {{activation}} pathway {{begins with}} {{formation of the}} primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (Hageman factor). Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contact activation pathway has in initiating clot formation can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a bleeding disorder. Instead, contact activation system seems to be more involved in inflammation, and innate immunity. Despite this, interference with the pathway may confer protection against thrombosis without a significant bleeding risk.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to scar-inducing factors, like those discussed above, astrocytes up regulate {{the production of}} chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Astrocytes are a predominant type of glial cell in {{the central nervous system}} that provide many functions including damage mitigation, repair, and glial scar formation. The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) {{have been shown to be}} up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs. CSPGs have been shown to inhibit regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but the <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CSPG core protein vs. CS-GAGs had not been studied until recently.|$|E
