5000|$|One day, ornithologist Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to Rio de Janeiro on the {{condition}} that Blu, who is the last male of his species, needs to mate with the last female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a <b>red-crested</b> <b>cardinal</b> named Pedro and his yellow canary friend Nico. At Túlio's aviary, Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent Spix's macaw longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a sulphur-crested cockatoo named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel. While Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on [...] "pretty birds" [...] after his role on a television program had been ruined by one. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a toco toucan, who offers to take them to his bulldog friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain. He attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel hires a horde of thieving marmosets led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the two birds to a Rio-style dance party, where they perform a duet and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a tram. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover that the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the Rio Carnival parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. A survey of the internal parasites present in 21 species of birds in the Diamond Head area on Oahu was conducted during 1972 - 1973. A total of 121 birds were examined for protozoa and helminth infections. Twenty individuals were infected with protozoa and 40 with helminths. Forty of these birds were also examined for internal mites; seven were infected. Each type of parasite is discussed and its history in Hawaii. First records of parasites in Hawaii include Syngamus trachea taken from a <b>Red-crested</b> <b>Cardinal,</b> Capillaria sp. from a Cordon-bleu, Orange-cheeked Waxbill, and two Cardinals: Plagiorhynchus charadrii from a Golden Plover; Mediorhynchus orientalis from a Common Mynah, Cardinal, and two Red-crested Cardinals; and Sternostoma tracheacol from a Cordon-bleu and Red-eared Waxbill.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the current status of vertebrate invasive species throughout Chile, updating information on terrestrial exotics and reporting {{for the first time the}} situation of exotic freshwater fishes. In addition, we document the legislation and programs that the Chilean government has implemented to limit the entry of exotics to the country or minimize their impact on native wild flora and fauna and on natural ecosystems. We document what is known about the introduction of 26 exotic fish species to continental waters of the country, discussing the distribution and putative effects of those 11 species that may be considered invasive. From a previous list of 24 terrestrial vertebrate invaders, we withdraw the Argentine tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and mouflon (Ovis ammon) because there are no data on their subsistence in the wild. On the other hand, we add three new species: red-eared freshwater turtle (Trachemys scripta), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), and <b>red-crested</b> <b>cardinal</b> (Paroaria coronata), thus keeping the total number of terrestrial invaders unchanged at 24 species. The chief agency in charge of existing laws and regulations regarding the import of exotic freshwater species is the National Fisheries Service (SERNAPESCA, in Spanish), a dependency of the Ministry of Economy. The main agency in charge of enforcing existing laws and regulations regarding the import of exotic terrestrial species to Chile is the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG, in Spanish), a dependency of the Ministry of Agriculture. Currently, SAG is not only controlling major border passes, seaports and airports, but also is funding studies to monitor and control already existing invaders. In addition, the Chilean Forest Service (CONAF, in Spanish) is also concerned about invasive species, but only if they enter national parks and reserves within the National System of Protected Wildlife Areas (SNASPE, in Spanish) Entregamos una revisión del estado actual de las especies de vertebrados invasores en Chile, actualizando información sobre las especies exóticas terrestres y documentando la situación de las especies exóticas de peces dulceacuícolas. Además, revisamos la legislación pertinente y los programas que el gobierno chileno ha implementado para limitar la entrada de especies exóticas al país o para minimizar su impacto sobre la flora y fauna nativas y los ecosistemas naturales. Documentamos lo que se conoce sobre la introducción de 26 especies exóticas de peces a las aguas continentales de Chile, discutiendo la distribución y efectos putativos de 11 especies que pueden considerarse invasivas. De la lista previa de 24 especies invasoras de vertebrados terrestres, nosotros retiramos la tortuga argentina (Chelonoidis chilensis), el reno (Rangifer tarandus) y el muflón (Ovis ammon), porque no hay evidencias de que hayan logrado asilvestrarse. Por otra parte, agregamos la tortuga dulceacuícola de orejas rojas (Trachemys scripta), la cotorra argentina (Myiopsitta monachus) y el cardenal de cresta roja (Paraoria coronata), manteniéndose así el total de invasoras constante en 24 especies. La principal agencia a cargo de implementar las leyes y regulaciones existentes con respecto a la importación de especies exóticas de peces es el Servicio Nacional de Pesca (SERNAPESCA), una dependencia del Ministerio de Economía. La principal agencia a cargo de aplicar las leyes y regulaciones vigentes sobre la importación de especies exóticas terrestres a Chile es el Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero (SAG), una dependencia del Ministerio de Agricultura. Actualmente, el SAG no solo controla los pasos fronterizos, puertos y aeropuertos de Chile, sino también financia estudios para monitorear y controlar los invasores ya presentes en el país. Además, la Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) también se involucra con especies invasoras, pero solo si ellas entran al Sistema Nacional de Áreas Silvestres Protegidas del Estado (SNASPE...|$|E
