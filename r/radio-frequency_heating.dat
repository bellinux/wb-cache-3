From the high-resolution pictures taken during the process, this growth angle was evaluated to be 11 ± 2. Furthermore, the free surface of the melt was modeled using the Laplace-Young equation.

Each year this diverse {{industry}} yields 1. 5 {{million metric tons}} of product, worth about $ 2 billion, with exports constituting 45 % of the market. Infestation by post-harvest insects are a serious problem, usually requiring disinfestation treatments before distribution of product. Fumigants have been the treatment of choice in many cases, but environmental and regulatory concerns over their continued use have generated interest in non-chemical alternatives. Identifying potential applications for non-chemical methods requires familiarity with processing and storage methods as well as marketing constraints within the industry. Although no single non-chemical alternative {{could serve as a}} direct substitute for fumigation, use of non-chemical treatments for specialized applications would substantially reduce fumigant use.

50|$|Enhancements for {{improving}} the effectiveness of SVE can include directional drilling, pneumatic and hydraulic fracturing, and thermal enhancement (e.g., hot air or steam injection). Directional drilling and fracturing enhancements are generally intended to improve the gas flow through the subsurface, especially in lower permeability zones. Thermal enhancements such as hot air or steam injection increase the subsurface soil temperature, thereby improving the volatility of the contamination. In addition, injection of hot (dry) air can remove soil moisture and thus improve the gas permeability of the soil. Additional thermal technologies (such as electrical resistance heating, six-phase soil heating, <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating,</b> or thermal conduction heating) {{can be applied to}} the subsurface to heat the soil and volatilize/desorb contaminants, but these are generally viewed as separate technologies (versus a SVE enhancement) that may use vacuum extraction (or other methods) for collecting soil gas.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} finite-element {{model is}} used to compare isothermal and radio-frequency-assisted chemical vapor infiltration of long cylindrical carbon preforms. Densification with <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> at a constant input power initially occurs radially around the central zone and then axially toward {{the ends of the}} preform. This densification pat-tern results in significant entrapment of porosity {{at the center of the}} preform and requires a relatively long time for com-pletion. A novel scheme for improved <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> of long cylindrical preforms is proposed which entails insulating the axial ends of the preform, induction heating at a relatively high operating frequency, and linear ramping of input power with time. Simulations show that, under these conditions, radial "inside-out " densification can be achieved uniformly along the entire length of the preform. This scheme results in complete densification of the preform and reduces the overall processing time fivefold when compared to the conventional isothermal process.

30|$|The H board {{could not}} be {{manufactured}} at all densities owing {{to the lack of}} curing {{at the center of the}} board (Table  1). Conversely, the RH and ARH boards could be manufactured at all densities even at 3  min. The temperature of the H board with a density of 0.7  g/cm 3 was 116  °C at 3  min, which is the lowest temperature (Fig.  3). It is likely that the H board contained a significant amount of vapor, thereby not allowing the temperature to increase and inhibiting the curing of the urea-formaldehyde resin [15, 16]. Conversely, the vapor in the RH board was heated by <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating,</b> resulting in the vapor being discharged and the temperature being raised quickly to a high value. Thus, the RH board could be manufactured in 3  min. In addition, the vapor in the ARH board was also heated by <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> and was discharged by air injection, resulting in the temperature being raised to a high value. The release of vapor and increase in temperature are likely to cure the urea-formaldehyde resin, thereby also enabling the manufacture of the ARH board in 3  min. Therefore, a radio-frequency hot press and an air-injection radio-frequency hot press were clearly effective in reducing the pressing time.|$|E
30|$|As heat {{does not}} {{transfer}} quickly {{from the upper}} and lower heating plates {{to the center of the}} board in an ordinary hot press (Fig.  1 a, hot press), an additional heating method is needed to reduce the pressing time. Moreover, for manufacturing a thick board, long pressing time is needed owing to low heat conduction at the center of the board. Thus, other heating methods are needed for manufacturing a thick board. A hot press with a <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating</b> device installed has been designed to reduce the pressing time and to manufacture thicker boards (Fig.  1 c, radio-frequency hot press) [7 – 10]. This radio-frequency hot press can not only heat board surfaces between {{the upper and lower}} heating plates, but can also heat the inside of a board by <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>heating.</b> This results in simultaneous and uniform heating of the entire board and a rapid rise in temperature at the center of the board [10]. Thus, a thick board can be manufactured with reduced pressing time [11]. However, the radio-frequency hot press significantly increases the water vapor pressure inside the board because of the rapid rise in temperature; therefore, this press is likely to be more prone to inadvertent blowout than an ordinary hot press [12].|$|E
