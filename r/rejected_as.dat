5|$|Ahmadiyya, a modern-era movement, {{consider}} Krishna as one {{of their}} ancient prophets. Ahmadi's consider themselves to be Muslims, but they are <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> apostates of Islam by mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims, because Ahmadis consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of Ahmadiyya, as a modern-day prophet.|$|E

5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 {{hoping to}} study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> {{probably}} lacking the stamina for a dancing career. While studying at home under a governess for six months, at Whitsun 1921 she took {{part as a}} dancer in a production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian, a version largely devised by Joseph.|$|E
5|$|In the December 1934 â€“ January 1935 {{issue of}} Hornig's fanzine, Fantasy Magazine, {{he took the}} unusual step of listing several stories that he had <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> lacking novelty, but which had {{subsequently}} appeared in print in other magazines. The list includes several by successful writers of the day, such as Raymond Z. Gallun and Miles Breuer. The most prominent story named is Triplanetary by E. E. Smith, which appeared in Amazing.|$|E

Esther, his mother (Ruth Nelson), sympathetic at this stage, buys the $8 violin for the boy.|$|R

5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} be brought to the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial he was accused of aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> slander.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon, Raj, Leonard and Howard discuss Howard's {{bachelor}} party, with Howard reaffirming to Raj that strippers {{are banned}} from the party. Raj then suggests a wine tasting train trip through Napa Valley but, despite Sheldon's approval, this idea is <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> well. Meanwhile, Amy is filming Bernadette and Penny making wedding party gifts. She begins {{to ask a question}} about consummation but Penny tells her to ask something normal, such as what Bernadette's married name will be.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1993 {{creation}} of the National Native Title Tribunal, there have been four separate claims to Native Title lodged over alienated lands in the ACT by representatives of the Ngunnawal communities, in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. The first two of these were discontinued after reaching a Federal Court hearing, and the third was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> not meeting applicable provisions. The fourth claim was dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The mansion was {{completed}} in 1914. Because McCreary was widowed before his second term in office, his granddaughter, Harriet Newberry McCreary, served as the mansion's first hostess during her summer vacations from her studies at Wellesley College. When Harriet McCreary was away at college, McCreary's housekeeper, Jennie Shaw, served as hostess. McCreary authorized the state to sell the old mansion at auction, but the final bid of $13,600 was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> unfair by the mansion commission.|$|E
5|$|The opening was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> too {{expensive}} to film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50million.

5|$|This made reactor {{plutonium}} {{unsuitable for}} use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a fizzle). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and <b>rejected,</b> <b>as</b> plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.|$|E

5|$|Vitamin E and {{selenium}} were {{proposed and}} later <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> a potential method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity. There is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin E and selenium aid in preventing in vivo lipid peroxidation and free radical damage, and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive hyperbaric oxygen exposures.|$|E
5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was <b>rejected.</b> <b>As</b> both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
50|$|Gadamer draws {{heavily on}} the ideas of Romantic hermeneuticists such as Friedrich Schleiermacher {{and the work of}} later hermeneuticists such as Wilhelm Dilthey. He <b>rejects</b> <b>as</b> unachievable the goal of objectivity, and instead {{suggests}} that meaning is created through intersubjective communication.|$|R

5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been <b>rejected,</b> <b>as</b> the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were <b>rejected</b> <b>as</b> tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E

Eight days later, he made his only other appearance of the season, coming on for Stefan Bailey in the 68th minute of a defeat by the same score away to the already-crowned winners of the Football League Championship, Reading.|$|E
