40|$|The {{grain size}} (GS) and volume {{fraction}} of alumina have been systematically varied in composites with a zirconia matrix {{and the corresponding}} residual stresses have been assessed by means of piezo-spectroscopy. The compressive stress in alumina depends on the volume fraction and it is well predicted by a stochastic model based on information theory. No dependence with GS has been detected, except at the highest volume content (20 % vol. alumina). Conversely the stress distribution is independent from the volume fraction and depends on GS: intermediate values of GS exhibit the wider stress distribution. The tensile stress in zirconia shows no clear correlation with the volume fraction and increases with increasing zirconia GS. This latter behaviour has been compared with a model based on diffusional <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> The model reproduces correctly the stress change due to different alumina contents, but it diverges from the experimental data at smaller GSs, overestimating the residual stress.

Results showed that a wide range <b>of</b> residual <b>stress</b> levels (both tensile and compressive) were obtained with the change of Ti contents in the deposited films. After film deposition, the thermal and intrinsic stress in the film could be very large, but due to the differences in phase transformation stress and transformation temperatures, the real stress values under room temperature, and stress evolution with temperature during phase transformation were quite different. For the film with a Ti content of 50. 2 %, due to the significant <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> caused by the perfect martensite transformation, the residual stress under room temperature was very low (− 20 MPa) {{and recovery}} stress during heating was as high as 750 MPa.

40|$|A {{detailed}} fatigue {{characterization of}} Alloy 10, a high strength nickel-based disk alloy, {{was conducted on}} test coupons machined from a 'pancake' forging. Smooth bar, strain controlled fatigue testing at various R-ratios was run at representative bore, 750 F, and rim, 1300 F, temperatures. This was followed by notch fatigue testing (Kt= 2) run under load control. Analysis of the fatigue data using a Smith-Watson-Topper approach and finite element analysis of the notch root was employed to understand material behavior in these tests. Smooth bar fatigue data showed a significant R-ratio dependence at either test temperature which could be accounted for using a Smith-Watson-Topper parameter (SWT). In general, fatigue life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F for a given SWT. For notch fatigue tests, life was longer at 750 F than 1300 F but only at higher stresses. This was attributed to differences in alloy strength.

Besides, {{in the days}} to decades after the main shock ongoing deformation is usually observed that is related to <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> caused by the earthquake. In this thesis I relate gravity changes as observed by the GRACE satellite mission to solid earth deformation caused by earthquakes. Special attention is given to modeling the contribution of ocean mass redistribution to gravity changes, and its relation to changes in bathymetry. I show that common modeling practices are usually not properly taking into account the effect of ocean water redistribution when computing seismic gravity changes. Using a combination of GRACE data and GPS observations I interpret ongoing gravity changes and crustal motions after the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake as dominantly caused by viscoelastic mantle flow. Contrasts in relaxation styles from both observation types are related to lateral variations in mantle rheology below the subduction zone. The combined analysis of GPS and GRACE data strongly suggest that the mantle at the continental side of the subduction zone is weaker than the oceanic side.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} {{stress relaxation}} in a strongly segregated lamellar mesophase, where block copolymers {{are in the}} “brush ” state with junction points confined to the interface between the adjacent lamellae and blocks stretched out away from it. If the molecular weight of the blocks is large enough, they entangle with their neighbors {{as well as with}} blocks from the opposite brush. The number of entanglements of one particular chain with the opposite brush varies from chain to chain even in the monodisperse system. We demonstrate that this dispersion of the number of entanglements leads to a very broad spectrum <b>of</b> <b>relaxation</b> times and to an effectively power-law-like stress relaxation function log G- (log t) “ with CY = 1 / 2 (a = 2) in the strong (weak) chain-stretching limit. We analyze various disentanglement mechanisms for diblocks and triblocks and the onset of the diffusion of copolymers along the interface. Another relaxation mechanism is due to the displacement of a block across the interface into the “enemy ” phase. We conclude that for highly entangled copolymers it will be an important mode <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relaxation</b> (especially for triblock copolymers). For asymptotically long times the <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> along the perfectly ordered lamella will be liquidlike.
