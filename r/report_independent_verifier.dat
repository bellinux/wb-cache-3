40|$|Independent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) {{follow-up}} verifiers such as monitoring agencies, checkers, {{supervisors and}} control officers are active on various construction sites across the world. There are, however, differing {{views on the}} value that these verifiers add and very limited learning in EIA has been drawn from <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers.</b> This paper aims to appraise how {{and to what extent}} <b>independent</b> EIA follow-up <b>verifiers</b> add value in major construction projects in the developing country context of South Africa. A framework for appraising the role of <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers</b> was established and four South African case studies were examined through a mixture of site visits, project document analysis, and interviews. Appraisal results were documented in the performance areas of: planning, doing, checking, acting, public participating and integration with other programs. The results indicate that <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers</b> add most value to major construction projects when involved with screening EIA requirements of new projects, allocation of financial and human resources, checking legal compliance, influencing implementation, reporting conformance results, community and stakeholder engagement, integration with self-responsibility programs such as environmental management systems (EMS), and controlling records. It was apparent that verifiers could be more creatively utilized in pre-construction preparation, providing feedback of knowledge into assessment of new projects, giving input to the planning and design phase of projects, and performance evaluation. The study confirms the benefits of proponent and regulator follow-up, specifically in having <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers</b> that disclose information, facilitate discussion among stakeholders, are adaptable and proactive, aid in the integration of EIA with other programs, and instill trust in EIA enforcement by conformance evaluation. Overall, the study provides insight on how to harness the learning opportunities arising from EIA follow-up through the appointment of <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{technique}} for certifying domain-specific properties of code generated using program synthesis technology. Program synthesis is a maturing technology that generates code from a high-level specification in a particular domain. For acceptance of the generated code in safety-critical applications, it must be thoroughly tested (an estimated 80 % of total software development costs in general). We show how the program synthesis system AUTOFILTER can be extended to generate not only code but also proofs that properties hold in the code. We target properties that are sufficiently complex that they cannot be proved automatically from the code alone, but which can be proved using domain knowledge in the synthesis system producing proofs {{that can be easily}} checked by an <b>independent</b> <b>verifier.</b> This technique has the potential to reduce the costs associated with testing generated code. 1...|$|R
40|$|The current {{recycling}} {{market is}} highly disaggregated, {{with thousands of}} players and transactional middlemen, leading to significant inefficiencies. Growing regulatory and consumer pressures to ensure that products are disposed of and recycled responsibly {{have led to the}} need to develop better approaches for efficient recycling. One such approach, termed a Recycling Exchange, involves a centralized platform which can serve as an <b>independent</b> <b>verifier</b> of recyclable and recycled materials. Additionally, it serves as a data consolidator and financial engine that incentivizes producers and consumers to close the loop on the recycling process. In this approach, nanomaterial tags are embedded in the products, allowing them to be easily tracked within the platform. These nano materials can be tracked from the beginning {{to the end of a}} product’s useful life, thus enabling disparate stakeholders to realize value from products even after they have been discarded. Coupling nanotechnology with a Recycling Exchange concept can help catalyze the shift to a zero waste economy...|$|R

40|$|Low-level Inlined Reference Monitors (IRM) such as control-flow {{integrity}} and software-based fault isolation can foil numerous software attacks. Conventionally, those IRMs are implemented through binary rewriting or transformation on equivalent low-level {{programs that are}} tightly coupled with a specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Resulting implementations have poor retargetability to different ISAs. This paper introduces an IRM-implementation framework at a compiler intermediate-representation (IR) level. The IR-level framework enables easy retargetability to different ISAs, but raises the challenge of how to preserve security at the low level, as the compiler backend might invalidate the assumptions at the IR level. We propose a constraint language to encode the assumptions and check whether they still hold after the backend transformations and optimizations. Furthermore, an <b>independent</b> <b>verifier</b> is implemented to validate the security of low-level code. We have implemented the framework inside LLVM to enforce the policy of control-flow {{integrity and}} data sandboxing for both reads and writes. Experimental results demonstrate that it incurs modest runtime overhead of 19. 90 % and 25. 34 % on SPECint 2000 programs for x 86 - 32 and x 86 - 64, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|Certifying {{compilation}} {{allows a}} compiler to produce annotations that prove that target code abides by a specified safety policy. An <b>independent</b> <b>verifier</b> can check the code without needing {{to trust the}} compiler. For such a system to be generally useful, the safety policy should be expressive enough to allow different compilers to effectively produce certifiable code. In this work, we use our experience in writing a certifying compiler to suggest general design principles that should allow concise yet expressive certificates. As an extended example, we present our compiler’s translation of the control flow of Popcorn, a high-level language with function pointers and exception handlers, to TALx 86, a typed assembly language with registers, a stack, memory, and code blocks. This example motivates techniques for controlling certificate size and verification time. We quantify the effectiveness of techniques for reducing the overhead of certifying compilation by measuring the effects their use has on a real Popcorn application, the compiler itself. The selective use of these techniques, which include common-subexpression elimination of types, higherorder type abbreviations, and selective re-verification, can change certificate size and verification time by well over an order of magnitude. We consider this report {{to be the first}} quantitative study on the practicality of certifying a real program using a type system not specifically designed for the compiler or source language. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{is growing}} public concern about {{personal}} {{data collected by}} {{both private and public}} sectors. People have very little control over what kinds of data are stored and how such data is used. Moreover, the ability to infer new knowledge from existing data is increasing rapidly with advances in database and data mining technologies. We describe a solution which allows people to take control by specifying constraints on the ways in which their data can be used. User constraints are represented in formal logic, and organizations that want to use this data provide formal proofs that the software they use to process data meets these constraints. Checking the proof by an <b>independent</b> <b>verifier</b> demonstrates that user constraints are (or are not) respected by this software. Our notion of “privacy correctness ” differs from general software correctness in two ways. First, properties of interest are simpler and thus their proofs should be easier to automate. Second, this kind of correctness is stricter; in addition to showing a certain relation between input and output is realized, we must also show that only operations that respect privacy constraints are applied during execution. We have therefore an intensional notion of correctness, rather that the usual extensional one. We discuss how our mechanism can be put into practice, and we present the technical aspects via an example. Our example shows how users can exercise control when their data is to be used as input to a decision tree learning algorithm. We have formalized the example and the proof of preservation of privacy constraints in Coq. ...|$|R

The tool includes a user friendly GUI that allows the user to describe a parameterized system and to perform guided, interactive or random simulation. This tool empowers the user to plug in several <b>independent</b> <b>verifiers</b> to perform verification. A mockup verifier is developed {{in order to facilitate}} the development of the tool and testing the required functionalities. The mockup verifier involves parsing descriptions of the parameterized systems to be analyzed. In order to interact with the verifier, the tool is user friendly and flexible {{in the sense that the}} user can plug in a verifier developed in any language as long as it allows to perform a number of basic computations on the parameterized system (such as the set of enabled transitions or the set of successor configurations). In order to plug in a new tool, our tool needs to be able to make use of these operations, for instance using a wrapper written for a verifier particular to a class of parameterized systems. Given these operations, our tool enables the user to carry out various types of simulations like random, interactive or guided simulations. Moreover, our tool can submit verification queries to the underlying verifier and walk the user through the generated counter examples as if it was a simulation session...|$|R
