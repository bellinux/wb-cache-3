5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that takes {{many different types of}} prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the <b>rapid</b> <b>depletion</b> of the Azores stock is often cited {{as an example of the}} susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

25|$|After {{researching the}} oral {{histories}} and journalistic records of past jubilees, measuring physical and meteorologic conditions, and taking {{biological and chemical}} measurements, Loesch concluded that accumulated organic material on the bay floor could, under a certain set of conditions, result in a <b>rapid</b> <b>depletion</b> of oxygen (hypoxia) {{in parts of the}} bay, driving fish to the surface seeking oxygenated water.|$|E
50|$|While it {{had been}} known since 1988 that ground level ozone {{underwent}} periodic <b>rapid</b> <b>depletions</b> during March-June each year, it was not discovered until 1995 that atmospheric mercury behaved in a nearly identical manner. (The first continuous monitoring instruments for atmospheric mercury were installed at the observatory that year.) Until that time, it was generally agreed that elemental mercury persisted in the atmosphere for 6-12 months, which allowed it to reach remote locations such as the Arctic, far from emission sources.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{chemical}} composition of rain at high temporal resolution provides additional information on wet deposition processes. High resolution data was obtained using a microprocessor-based acid rain monitor at two sites in SW Scotland and SE England. Meteorological details of the transport and wet deposition processes during two frontal rain events were examined and related to rainfall composition. <b>Rapid</b> <b>depletions</b> of ion concentrations during heavy rainfall in the first event were interpreted using a rainfall scavenging model. The sub-event data for the second event showed the influence of frontal discontinuities. Increasing ionic concentrations during this second event were attributed both to the change in air mass, and to diminished upwind precipitation scavenging...|$|R

25|$|British {{historian}} Mark Gallear {{maintains that}} US government experts rejected the lever-action repeater designs, deeming them ineffective {{in the event}} of a clash with fully equipped European armies, or in case of an outbreak of another American civil conflict. Gallear's analysis minimizes the allegation that <b>rapid</b> <b>depletion</b> of ammunition in lever-action models influenced the decision in favor of the single-shot Springfield. The Indian War, in this context, appears as a minor theatre of conflict, whose contingencies were unlikely to govern the selection of standard weaponry for an emerging industrialized nation.|$|E

25|$|A {{period of}} {{profound}} crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage circa 1520, under Prince Ștefăniță, {{when it was}} confronted with <b>rapid</b> <b>depletion</b> of funds and rising demands from the Porte. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the Great Turkish War, suffered {{the impact of the}} stagnation of the Ottoman Empire; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on counterfeit coinage (usually copies of Swedish riksdalers, as was that issued by Eustratie Dabija). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the feudal-based Moldavian military forces were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional mercenaries such as the seimeni.|$|E
