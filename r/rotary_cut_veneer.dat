40|$|Fast growing sengon (Paraserianthes moluccana) {{is largely}} rotary-cut to produce veneer for core plywood production. In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> <b>veneer</b> thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.

40|$|At {{the present}} time, plywood has lost market share to {{competitors}} such as waferboard and {{oriented strand board}} (OSB). Improvement in plywood production and plywood performance is required to make plywood competitive with other wood based panel products. The objectives of this study are: (1) to examine {{the possibility of using}} microwave for drying <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> <b>veneer,</b> (2) to investigate treatment methods for veneer both before and after fabrication of panels using diphenyl-methane diisocyanate (MDI), (3) to test the characteristics of veneer and panels visually and mechanically. The experimental (preliminary and main research topics) approach to addressing this question involves investigating the characteristics of high performance panel products. All experimental designs used in this study are factorial ANOVA models for different factorial levels. A one factorial design was used to analyse the effect of moisture content (0 % and 10 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of veneer samples, and the effect of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) on the % solid MDI uptake of small cube wood samples. A two factorial design was used to investigate uptake of MDI in veneer and plywood treatments. The variables tested included three concentrations of MDI (50 %, 60 % and 70 %) and three levels of soaking times (5. 10, and 15 minutes). Another two factorial design was used to analyse the effects of five levels of % MDI concentrations (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, and 20 %) and three levels of temperature setting (60, 100, and 140 C) on the curing time of MDI solution for small cube wood samples. Analysis of the effects of edge sealing (sealed and unsealed) and pressure type (low and high pressure) on the uptake MDI and Copper Naphthenate was analysed using a two factorial design. The study shows that microwave drying of veneer is technically feasible to cope with veneer drying problems, which at the present time poses a "bottleneck" and is the major consumer of thermal energy used in plywood production. Microwave drying is characterised by having low within charge variability in moisture content after drying; no drying defects and has no effect on the glueability of plywood. However, some importance aspects of the use of microwaves should be taken into account- in designing a commercial drying process. These include: the position, condition, type of wave guide covers and the power level of microwave. Microwave power had a significant effect on drying time. The higher the microwave power used the shorter the drying time. The highest uptake of solid MDI in plywood samples was obtained with 70 MDI following 10 minutes soaking (51 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 MDI (45 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (41 kg/m 3) respectively. The highest solid MDI uptake in radiata pine veneer was obtained with 70 % MDI following 10 minutes soaking (115 kg/m 3). This was followed by 60 % MDI (94 kg/m 3) after 15 minutes soaking and 50 % MDI after 15 minutes soaking (71 kg/m 3) respectively. Investigation into the curing processes indicated that the best temperature for curing MDI solution was 60 C. Microwave energy could not be applied for curing MDI treated samples. Microwaving resulted in substantial losses of MDI solution from the wood blocks. Pressure impregnation of MDI, increased the uptake of resin compared to soaking techniques. The highest uptake of solid MDI for plywood samples was obtained with 70 % MDI in unsealed samples using high pressure treatment (359 kg/m 3). This was followed by the treatment of plywood which had been edge sealed and high pressure treated (208 kg/m 3), sealed and low pressure treatment (71 kg/m 3) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (51 kg/m 3), respectively. The highest uptake of Copper Naphthenate in plywood samples was obtained for edge-sealed and high pressure treatment (0. 92 % wt/wt Cu) followed by unsealed and high pressure treatment (0. 88 % wt/wt Cu), unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 45 % wt/wt Cu) and unsealed and low pressure treatment (0. 51 % wt/wt Cu), respectively. MDI solution applied to plywood and veneers by immersion improved the surface qualities of these products. The surfaces were smoother, more rigid; there was water resistance compared to untreated samples. Water absorption was limited to 8 kg/m 3 after 5 minutes exposure compared to 84 kg/m 3 for untreated plywood. The average surface hardness of MDI treated veneers (82) was 4 points (in Shore C scale) higher than untreated veneers (78). The greatest hardness was obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (85), followed by 60 % (83) and 70 % (78) MDI solutions. The average surface hardness of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment (85) was 6 points higher than untreated plywood (79). When MDI was applied by pressure impregnation surface hardness scores of 90 were obtained. The average shear strength of MDI treated veneer (0. 183 kN) is 35 % higher than untreated veneers (0. 135 kN). The highest values were obtained for samples treated with 50 % MDI solution (0. 202 kN), followed by 70 % (0. 178 kN) and 60 % (0. 169 kN) MDI solutions. The average shear strength of MDI treated plywood using soaking treatment was 0. 125 kN. This was 24 % higher than untreated plywood (0. 101 kN). This shear strength value is 19 % higher when compared to that for Cu Naphthenate treated plywood using pressure treatment (0. 105 kN). It can be concluded that MDI resin can be used to improved the water resistance, surface hardness and strength properties of veneer and plywood. Cu naphthenate (in kerosene) preservative can also be used for treating finished plywood without affecting the strength properties of treated plywood.

40|$|A {{solid board}} factory {{produces}} rectangular sheets of cardboard {{in two different}} formats, namely large formats and small formats. The production process consists of two stages separated by an inventory point. In the first stage a cardboard machine produces the large formats. In the second stage {{a part of the}} large formats is cut into small formats by a separate <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> machine. Due to very large setup times, technical restrictions, and trim losses, the cardboard machine is not able to produce these small formats. The company follows two policies to satisfy customer demands for <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format orders. When the company applies the first policy, then for each customer order an ‘optimal’ large format (with respect to trim loss) is determined and produced on the cardboard machine. In case of the second policy, a stock of a restricted number of large formats is determined {{in such a way that}} the expected trim loss is minimal. The <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format order then uses the most suitable standard large format from the stock. Currently, the dimensions of the standard large formats in the semi finished inventory are based on intuitive motives, with an accent on minimizing trim losses. From the trim loss perspective it is most efficient to produce each <b>rotary</b> <b>cut</b> format from a specific large format. On the other hand, if there is only one large format in each caliper, the variety is minimal, but the trim loss might be inacceptably high. On average, the first policy results in a lower trim loss. In order to make efficiently use of the two machines and to meet customer’s due times the company applies both policies. In this paper we concentrate on the second policy, taking into account the various objectives and restrictions of the company. The purpose of the company is to have not too many different types of large formats and an acceptable amount of trim loss. The problem is formulated as a minimum clique covering problem with alternatives (MCCA), which is presumed to be NP-hard. We solve the problem by using an appropriate heuristic, which is built into a decision support system. Based on a set of real data, the actual composition of semi finished inventories is determined. The paper concludes with computational experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|Automobile and aero {{industries}} have an increasing interestin materials with improved mechanical properties. However, manyof these new materials {{are classified as}} difficult-to-cut withconventional tools. It is obvious that tools, cutting processesand cutting models has to be devel-oped parallel to materialsscience. In this thesis rotary cutting tools are tested as analternative toexpensive diamond or cubic bore nitridetools. Metal matrix composites mostly consist of a light metalalloy (such as aluminium or titanium) reinforced with hard andabrasive ceramic parti-cles or fibres. On machining, thereinforcement results in {{a high rate of}} tool wear. This is themain problem for the machining of MMCs. Many factors affect thelife length of a tool, i. e. matrix alloy, type, size andfraction of the reinforcement, heat treatment, cuttingconditions and tool properties. In tests, the Al-SiC MMC formed a deformation layer duringmilling, probably affected by lack of cooling. The dominatingfactor for tool life was the cutting speed. Water jet or CO 2 cooling of turning did not provide dramatic increase in toollife. With PCD, cutting speeds up to 2000 m/min were usedwithout machining problems and BUE formation. Tool flank wearwas abrasive and crater wear created an "orange-peel type" wearsurface. PCD inserts did not show the typical increase in flankwear rate {{at the end of its}} lifetime. The use of self-propelled rotary tools seems to be apromising way to increase tool life. No BUE was formed on therotary tool at high cutting data. The measurements indicatethat the rotary tool creates twice as good surface as PCDtools. The longest tool life was gained with an inclinationangle of 10 degrees. Tool costs per component will beapproximately the same, but rotary cutting tool allows higherfeeds and therefore a higher production rate and thus a lowerproduction cost. The rotary cutting operation might have a potential toincrease productiv-ity in bar peeling. The lack of BUE withrotary cutting gives hope on higher tool life. The test resultsshow that tool wear was 27 % lower with rotary cutting tools. Increase of cutting speed from 22 to 44 m/min did not affectcutting forces. This indicates that the cutting speed canincrease without significant change in tool wear rate. Issues related to rotary cutting like cutting models,cutting processes, standards, tools and models have beendiscussed. A tool wear model with kinetic energy has beendiscussed.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} linear motors, a {{technology}} nearly a century old, have not been adopted for {{a large number of}} linear motion applications is that they have historically had poor efficiencies. This has restricted the progress of linear motor development. The concept of a linear motor as a <b>rotary</b> motor <b>cut</b> and laid out flat with a conventional rotary motor control scheme as a design basis {{may not be the best}} way to design and control a high-speed linear motor.

25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a <b>rotary</b> blade grinder <b>cuts</b> the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|R
60|$|Tomorrow was Monday. Monday, the {{beginning}} of another school-week! Another shameful, barren school-week, mere routine and mechanical activity. Was not the adventure of death infinitely preferable? Was not death infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life? A life of barren routine, without inner meaning, without any real significance. How sordid life was, how {{it was a terrible}} shame to the soul, to live now! How much cleaner and more dignified to be dead! One could not bear any more of this shame of sordid routine and mechanical nullity. One might come to fruit in death. She had had enough. For where was life to be found? No flowers grow upon busy machinery, there is no sky to a routine, there is no space to a rotary motion. And all life was a <b>rotary</b> motion, mechanised, <b>cut</b> off from reality. There was nothing to look for from life--it was the same in all countries and all peoples. The only window was death. One could look out on to the great dark sky of death with elation, as one had looked out of the classroom window as a child, and seen perfect freedom in the outside. Now one was not a child, and one knew that the soul was a prisoner within this sordid vast edifice of life, and there was no escape, save in death.|$|R

40|$|Figure can {{add value}} to wood products, but its {{occurrence}} is unpredictable. A {{first step in}} reliably producing figured wood is determining whether it is faithfully transmitted to progeny via sexual and asexual reproduction. We describe a 26 -year-old male aspen genotype, designated ‘Curly Poplar’, which was {{shown to be a}} Populus × canescens hybrid using microsatellite markers. All rooted cuttings of this genotype exhibited an undulating pattern on the radial surface that was not seen in the control trees, all of which showed a smooth radial surface and straight grain. We observed spiral grain with a magnitude of 2. 77 ± 0. 12 °/cm from vertical in 11 -month-old, field-grown rooted Curly Poplar cuttings, but spiral grain was not apparent in wood from the 26 -year-old mature ortet that supplied these cuttings. <b>Veneer</b> <b>cut</b> from the mature tree exhibited a novel type of figure that we called ‘Scattered Moiré’. Reciprocal grafts between Curly Poplar and various non-figured aspens showed that a graft-transmissible signals {{did not appear to be}} involved in figure formation in Curly Poplar or the induction of figure in straight-grained trees. Curly Poplar was crossed to a straight-grained clone to test the inheritance of the gene(s) responsible for figure. Samples from the resulting population revealed that 79 out of 377 seedlings exhibited figure. A Chi-square test led to the rejection of a 1 : 1 segregation ratio between figured and non-figured phenotypes (p < 0. 01), but not of a 1 : 3 segregation ratio (p 0. 0793). Overall, these analyses showed that figure in Curly Poplar is under genetic control, but its inheritance may not be simple...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{construction}} has a promising {{future in the}} face of global sustainable development challenges. Using timber as the main structural material, the carbon footprint of a building is strongly reduced since the carbon will be stored {{for as long as the}} building stands or the timber is used. An integrated structural concept was developed for free-form timber structures, which is light and yet strong while trying to keep difficult node connections to a minimum. The structural concept consists of ribbed elements that are covered with plates on the top and the bottom. The ribbed elements are <b>cut</b> from laminated <b>veneer</b> lumber to allow a smooth transition in depth according to the structural demands. The ease of fabrication is achieved by designing simple connections such as an incision in the ribbed elements and the plates are connected by screws. The maximum length subject to fabrication and transportation constraints has been considered. This has been achieved by determining the efficient height and the allowable stresses have been reduced. For structural design, an automated procedure was developed to yield a smooth height variation of the roof structure and place the material where structurally required and thus achieving a significant weight reduction. Deep sections are used where bending govern the design and shallow section where shell action is dominant. Furthermore, the smooth height variation meets the desired shape from architectural design's point-of-view. In general, it can be concluded that the developed structural concept is suitable for the design of a free-form timber structure that exhibits both bending and shell behaviour. In order to achieve an integrated structural concept, the inhomogeneous material properties of timber were incorporated in the structural concept. Precaution has been taken in the computational modelling by also taking into account the different directions for the anisotropic material properties. <br/...|$|R
