40|$|The project {{consists}} {{in the design}} and calculation of a submarine transport platform. It must be able to carry the submarine while a boat tows the platform to the place where it will have to submerse. At this point, the designed platform will be able to release and isolate the submarine so that it could perform the required missions. From the beginning, the intention was to make a project for a company, it means working in a professional environment in a real project. At the same time, it is a good opportunity to enter in the professional world and apply the knowledge learned during the university. In addition, it is a innovatitive project. The principal objective of the project is to satisfy initial specifications given by the company. These specifications delimit the characteristics of the naval device and denote which missions the platform have to perform. These specifications designate which situations will service and where will this services be done. The main objective of the project is to go round the spiral of projects, making a first design of how the platform could be and should be according to the specifications, and to make the first calcs of the dimension according to the choosing design. Once the specifications are understood, the process is to carry out a market study of all the variants related to the given specifications to define the characteristics of the naval device to be designed along with all delimitations that must have. The initial requirements give an idea of the platform functionalities and the way to use them. The advantages this platform presents to the company are described throughout the document. The most conclusive is to minimize submarine’s time in the water, {{to be able to make}} <b>repaires</b> without having to remove it from the water, and to decrease transportation’s cost. The platform will act at the same time as a working platform, where the operators of the submarine could be on it without any problem...|$|R

Before this she had spent all her time with her companions, talking to them about their mother, playing on their memory of her, making them cry and making them laugh, reminding them of blest hours of their early childhood, telling them anecdotes of her own. None the less she confided to them that she believed there was no harm at all in Mrs. Churchley, and that when the time should come she would probably take them out immensely. She saw with smothered irritation that they enjoyed their visit at Prince's Gate; they had never been at anything so [...] "grown-up," [...] nor seen so many smart bonnets and brilliant complexions. Moreover they were considered with interest, quite as if, being minor elements, yet perceptible ones, of Mrs. Churchley's new life, they had been described in advance and were the heroines of the occasion.

60|$|The {{confusion}} of the day, with the multitude thronging {{the courts and}} park of Versailles, uttering the most frightful threats and insults, had been beyond all description; {{but there had been}} a pause at night, and at two o'clock, poor Queen Marie Antoinette, spent with horror and fatigue, at last went to bed, advising her ladies to do the same; but their anxiety was too great, and they sat up at her door. At half-past four they heard musket shots, and loud shouts, and while one awakened the Queen, the other, Madame Auguier, flew towards the place whence the noise came. As she opened the door, she found one of the royal bodyguards, with his face covered with blood, holding his musket so as to bar the door while the furious mob were striking at him. He turned to the lady, and cried, 'Save the Queen, madame, they are come to murder her!' Quick as lightning, Madame Auguier shut and bolted the door, rushed to the Queen's bedside, and dragged her to the opposite door, with a petticoat just thrown over her. Behold, the door was fastened on the other side! The ladies knocked violently, the King's valet opened it, and in a few minutes the whole family were in safety in the King's apartments. M. de Miomandre, the brave guardsman, who used his musket to guard the Queen's door instead of to defend himself, fell wounded; but his comrade, M. de <b>Repaire,</b> at once took his place, and, according to one account, was slain, and the next day his head, set upon a pike, was borne before the carriage in which the royal family were escorted back to Paris.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are scarce}} degrees of {{difference}} in my constant need of hearing from you, yet when that felicity comes it manages each time to seem pre-eminent and to have assuaged an exceptional hunger. The pleasure and relief, at any rate, three days since, were of the rarest quality--and it's always least discouraging (for the exchange of sentiments) to know that your wings are for the moment folded and your field a bit delimited. I knew you were back in Paris as an informer passing hereby on his way thence again to N.Y. had seen you dining at the Ritz en nombreuse compagnie, [...] "looking awfully handsome and stunningly dressed." [...] And Mary Hunter cesjours-ci had given me earlier and more exotic news of you, yet coloured with a great vividness of sympathy and admiration.... But I feel {{that it takes a}} hard assurance to speak to you of [...] "arriving" [...] anywhere--as that implies starting and continuing, and before your great heroic rushes and revolutions I can only gape and sigh and sink back. It requires an association of ease--with the whole heroic question (of the [...] "up and doing" [...] state)--which I don't possess, to presume to suggestionise on the subject of a new advent. Great will be the glory and joy, and the rushing to and fro, when the wide wings are able, marvellously, to show us symptoms of spreading again--and here I am (mainly here this winter) to thrill with the first announcement. London is better for me, during these months, than any other spot of earth, or of pavement; and even here I seem to find I can work--and n'ai pas maintenant d'autre idée. Apropos of which aid to life your remarks about my small latest-born are absolutely to the point. The little creature is absolutely of the irresistible sex of her most intelligent critic--for I don't pretend, like Lady Macbeth, to bring forth men-children only. You speak at your ease, chère Madame, of the interminable and formidable job of my producing à mon âge another Golden Bowl--the most arduous and thankless task I ever set myself. However, on all that il y aurait bien des choses à dire; and meanwhile, I blush to say, the Outcry {{is on its way to}} a fifth edition (in these few weeks), whereas it has taken the poor old G.B. eight or nine years to get even into a third. And I should have to go back and live for two continuous years at Lamb House to write it (living on dried herbs and cold water--for [...] "staying power"--meanwhile;) and that would be very bad for me, would probably indeed put an end to me altogether. My own sense is that I don't want, and oughtn't to try, to attack ever again anything longer (save for about 70 or 80 pages more) than the Outcry. That is déjà assez difficile--the [...] "artistic economy" [...] of that inferior little product being a much more calculated and ciphered, much more cunning and (to use your sweet expression) crafty one than that of five G.B.'s. The vague verbosity of the Oxusflood (beau nom!) terrifies me--sates me; whereas the steel structure of the other form makes every parcelle a weighed and related value. Moreover nobody is really doing (or, ce me semble, as I look about, can do) Outcries, while all the world is doing G.B.'s--and vous-même, chère Madame, tout le premier: which gives you really the cat out of the bag! My vanity forbids me (instead of the more sweetly consecrating it) a form in which you run me so close. Seulement alors je compterais bâtir a great many (a great many, entendezvous?) Outcries--and on données autrement rich. About this present one hangs the inferiority, the comparative triviality, of its primal origin. But pardon this flood of professional egotism. I have in any case got back to work--on something that now the more urgently occupies me as the time for me circumstantially to have done it would have been last winter, when I was insuperably unfit for it, and that is extremely special, experimental and as yet occult. I apply myself to my effort every morning at a little <b>repaire</b> in the depths of Chelsea, a couple of little rooms that I have secured for quiet and concentration--to which our blest taxi whirls me from hence every morning at 10 o'clock, and where I meet my amanuensis (of the days of the composition of the G.B.) to whom I gueuler to the best of my power. In said <b>repaire</b> I propose to crouch and me blottir (in the English shade of the word, for so intensely revising an animal, as well) for many, many weeks; so that I fear dearest Edith, your idea of [...] "whirling me away" [...] will have to adapt itself to the sense worn by [...] "away"--as it clearly so gracefully will! For there are senses in which that particle is for me just the most obnoxious little object in the language. Make your fond use of it at any rate by first coming away--away hither....|$|E
6000|$|The great reward {{dispensed}} {{to us for}} our {{sessions in}} the house of pain--as to which it became our subsequent theory that we had been regularly dragged there on alternate Saturdays--was our being carried on the return to the house of delight, or to one of them, for there were specifically two, where we partook of ice-cream, deemed sovereign for sore mouths, deemed sovereign in fact, all through our infancy, for everything. Two great establishments for the service of it graced the prospect, one Thompson's and the other Taylor's, the former, I perfectly recall, grave and immemorial, the latter upstart but dazzling, and having together the effect that whichever we went to we wondered if we hadn't better have gone to the other--with that capacity of childhood for making the most of its adventures after a fashion that may look so like making the least. It is in our father's company indeed that, as I press the responsive spring, I see the bedizened saucers heaped up for our fond consumption (they bore the Taylor-title painted in blue and gilded, with the Christian name, as parentally pointed out to us, perverted to [...] "Jhon" [...] for John, whereas the Thompson-name scorned such vulgar and above all such misspelt appeals;) whence I infer that still other occasions for that experience waited on us--as almost any would serve, and a paternal presence so associated with them was not in the least conceivable in the Wall Street <b>repaire.</b> That presence is in fact not associated for me, to any effect of distinctness, with the least of our suffered shocks or penalties--though partly doubtless because our acquaintance with such was of the most limited; a conclusion I form even while judging it to have been on the whole sufficient for our virtue. This sounds perhaps as if we had borne ourselves as prodigies or prigs--which was as far as possible from being the case; we were bred in horror of conscious propriety, of what my father was fond of calling [...] "flagrant" [...] morality; what I myself at any rate read back into our rare educational ease, for the memory of some sides of which I was ever to be thankful, is, besides the general humanisation of our apprehended world and our [...] "social" [...] tone, the unmistakeable appearance that my father was again and again accompanied in public by his small second son: so many young impressions come back to me as gathered at his side and in his personal haunts. Not that he mustn't have offered his firstborn at least equal opportunities; but I make out that he seldom led us forth, such as we were, together, and my brother must have had in his turn many a mild adventure of which the secret--I like to put it so--perished with him. He was to remember, as I perceived later on, many things that I didn't, impressions I sometimes wished, as with a retracing jealousy, or at least envy, that I might also have fallen direct heir to; but he professed amazement, and even occasionally impatience, at my reach of reminiscence--liking as he did to brush away old moral scraps in favour of new rather than to hoard and so complacently exhibit them. If in my way I collected the new as well I yet cherished the old; the ragbag of memory hung on its nail in my closet, though I learnt with time to control the habit of bringing it forth. And I say that with a due sense of my doubtless now appearing to empty it into these pages.|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{left the}} letters behind him and, on {{withdrawing}} from the editorial presence, took a long walk on the Embankment. His impressions were at war with each other--he was flurried by possibilities of which he yet denied the existence. He had consented to trust Mr. Locket with the papers {{a day or two}} longer, till he should have thought out the terms on which he might--in the event of certain occurrences--be induced to dispose of them. A hundred pounds were not this gentleman's last word, nor perhaps was mere unreasoning intractability Peter's own. He sighed as he took no note of the pictures made by barges--sighed because it all might mean money. He needed money bitterly; he owed it in disquieting quarters. Mr. Locket had put it before him that he had a high responsibility--that he might vindicate the disfigured truth, contribute a chapter to the history of England. [...] "You haven't a right to suppress such momentous facts," [...] the hungry little editor had declared, thinking how the series (he would spread it into three numbers) would be the talk of the town. If Peter had money he might treat himself to ardour, to bliss. Mr. Locket had said, no doubt justly enough, that there were ever so many questions one would have to meet should one venture to play so daring a game. These questions, embarrassments, dangers--the danger, for instance, of the cropping-up of some lurking litigious relative--he would take over unreservedly and bear the brunt of dealing with. It was to be remembered that the papers were discredited, vitiated by their childish pedigree; such a preposterous origin, suggesting, as he had hinted before, the feeble ingenuity of a third-rate novelist, was a thing he should have to place himself at the positive disadvantage of being silent about. He would rather give no account of the matter at all than expose himself to the ridicule that such a story would infallibly excite. Couldn't one see them in advance, the clever, taunting things the daily and weekly papers would say? Peter Baron had his guileless side, but he felt, as he worried with a stick that betrayed him the granite parapets of the Thames, that he was not such a fool as not to know how Mr. Locket would [...] "work" [...] the mystery of his marvellous find. Nothing could help it on better with the public than the impenetrability of the secret attached to it. If Mr. Locket should only be able to kick up dust enough over the circumstances that had guided his hand his fortune would literally be made. Peter thought a hundred pounds a low bid, yet he wondered how the Promiscuous could bring itself to offer such a sum--so large it loomed in the light of literary remuneration as hitherto revealed to our young man. The explanation of this anomaly was of course that the editor shrewdly saw a dozen ways of getting his money back. There would be in the [...] "sensation," [...] at a later stage, the making of a book in large type--the book of the hour; and the profits of this scandalous volume or, if one preferred the name, this reconstruction, before an impartial posterity, of a great historical humbug, the sum [...] "down," [...] in other words, that any lively publisher would give for it, figured vividly in Mr. Locket's calculations. It was therefore altogether an opportunity of dealing at first hand with the lively publisher that Peter was invited to forego. Peter gave a masterful laugh, rejoicing in his heart that, on the spot, in the <b>repaire</b> he had lately quitted, he had not been tempted by a figure that would have approximately represented the value of his property. It was a good job, he mentally added as he turned his face homeward, that there was so little likelihood of his having to struggle with that particular pressure.|$|E

[...] Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, [...] 70 [...] Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd [...] Divine Interpreter, by favour sent [...] Down from the Empyrean to forewarne [...] Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, [...] Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: [...] For which to the infinitly Good we owe [...] Immortal thanks, and his admonishment [...] Receave with solemne purpose to observe [...] Immutably his sovran will, the end [...] Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf't [...] 80 [...] Gently for our instruction to impart [...] Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd [...] Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, [...] Deign to descend now lower, and relate [...] What may no less perhaps availe us known, [...] How first began this Heav'n which we behold [...] Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd [...] Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills [...] All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd [...] Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause [...] 90 [...] Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest [...] Through all Eternitie so late to build [...] In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon [...] Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould [...] What wee, not to explore the secrets aske [...] Of his Eternal Empire, but the more [...] To magnifie his works, the more we know. [...] And the great Light of Day yet wants to run [...] Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n [...] Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, [...] 100 [...] And longer will delay to heare thee tell [...] His Generation, and the rising Birth [...] Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: [...] Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon [...] Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring [...] Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, [...] Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song [...] End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. [...] Thus Adam his illustrous Guest besought: [...] And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. [...] 110 [...] This also thy request with caution askt [...] Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works [...] What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, [...] Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? [...] Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve [...] To glorifie the Maker, and inferr [...] Thee also happier, shall not be withheld [...] Thy hearing, such Commission from above [...] I have receav'd, to answer thy desire [...] Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain [...] 120 [...] To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope [...] Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King, [...] Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, [...] To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: [...] Anough is left besides to search and know. [...] But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less [...] Her Temperance over Appetite, to know [...] In measure what the mind may well contain, [...] Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns [...] Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. [...] 130 [...] Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav'n [...] (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host [...] Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) [...] Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep [...] Into his place, and the great Son returnd [...] Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father from his Throne beheld [...] Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. [...] At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought [...] All like himself rebellious, by whose aid [...] 140 [...] This inaccessible high strength, the seat [...] Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, [...] He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud [...] Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; [...] Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, [...] Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines [...] Number sufficient to possess her Realmes [...] Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent [...] With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: [...] But least his heart exalt him in the harme [...] 150 [...] Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n, [...] My damage fondly deem'd, I can <b>repaire</b> [...] That detriment, if such it be to lose [...] Self-lost, {{and in a moment}} will create [...] Another World, out of one man a Race [...] Of men innumerable, there to dwell, [...] Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd [...] They open to themselves at length the way [...] Up hither, under long obedience tri'd, [...] And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, & Heav'n to Earth, [...] 160 [...] One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. [...] Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n, [...] And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee [...] This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: [...] My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee [...] I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep [...] Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth, [...] Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill [...] Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. [...] Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire, [...] 170 [...] And put not forth my goodness, which is free [...] To act or not, Necessitie and Chance [...] Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. [...] So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake [...] His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. [...] Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift [...] Then time or motion, but to human ears [...] Cannot without process of speech be told, [...] So told as earthly notion can receave. [...] Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n [...] 180 [...] When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; [...] Glorie they sung to the most High, good will [...] To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: [...] Glorie to him whose just avenging ire [...] Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight [...] And th' habitations of the just; to him [...] Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd [...] Good out of evil to create, in stead [...] Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring [...] Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse [...] 190 [...] His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. [...] So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son [...] On his great Expedition now appeer'd, [...] Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd [...] Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love [...] Immense, and all his Father in him shon. [...] About his Chariot numberless were pour'd [...] Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, [...] And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, [...] From the Armoury of God, where stand of old [...] 200 [...] Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd [...] Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, [...] Celestial Equipage; and now came forth [...] Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, [...] Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide [...] Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound [...] On golden Hinges moving, to let forth [...] The King of Glorie in his powerful Word [...] And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. [...] On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore [...] 210 [...] They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss [...] Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, [...] Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes [...] And surging waves, as Mountains to assault [...] Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. [...] Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, [...] Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: [...] Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim [...] Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode [...] Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; [...] 220 [...] For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine [...] Follow'd in bright procession to behold [...] Creation, and the wonders of his might. [...] Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand [...] He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd [...] In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe [...] This Universe, and all created things: [...] One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd [...] Round through the vast profunditie obscure, [...] And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, [...] 230 [...] This be thy just Circumference, O World. [...] Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, [...] Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound [...] Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme [...] His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, [...] And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth [...] Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd [...] The black tartareous cold infernal dregs [...] Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd [...] Like things to like, the rest to several place [...] 240 [...] Disparted, and between spun out the Air, [...] And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. [...] Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light [...] Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure [...] Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East [...] To journie through the airie gloom began, [...] Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun [...] Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle [...] Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; [...] And light from darkness by the Hemisphere [...] 250 [...] Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night [...] He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: [...] Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung [...] By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light [...] Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; [...] Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout [...] The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, [...] And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd [...] God and his works, Creatour him they sung, [...] Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. [...] 260 [...] Again, God said, let ther be Firmament [...] Amid the Waters, and let it divide [...] The Waters from the Waters: and God made [...] The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, [...] Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd [...] In circuit to the uttermost convex [...] Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, [...] The Waters underneath from those above [...] Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World [...] Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide [...] 270 [...] Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule [...] Of Chaos farr remov'd, least fierce extreames [...] Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: [...] And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n [...] And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. [...] The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet [...] Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, [...] Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth [...] Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme [...] Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, [...] 280 [...] Fermented the great Mother to conceave, [...] Satiate with genial moisture, when God said [...] Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n [...] Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. [...] Immediately the Mountains huge appeer [...] Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave [...] Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: [...] So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low [...] Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, [...] Capacious bed of Waters: thither they [...] 290 [...] Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld [...] As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; [...] Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, [...] For haste; such flight the great command impress'd [...] On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call [...] Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) [...] Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, [...] Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, [...] If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, [...] Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, [...] 300 [...] But they, or under ground, or circuit wide [...] With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, [...] And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; [...] Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, [...] All but within those banks, where Rivers now [...] Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. [...] The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle [...] Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: [...] And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth [...] Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, [...] 310 [...] And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; [...] Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. [...] He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then [...] Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, [...] Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad [...] Her Universal Face with pleasant green, [...] Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd [...] Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay [...] Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, [...] Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept [...] 320 [...] The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed [...] Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, [...] And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last [...] Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred [...] Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd [...] Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, [...] With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, [...] With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now [...] Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, [...] Or wander with delight, and love to haunt [...] 330 [...] Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd [...] Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground [...] None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist [...] Went up and waterd all the ground, and each [...] Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth [...] God made, and every Herb, before it grew [...] On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: [...] So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. [...] Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights [...] High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide [...] 340 [...] The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, [...] For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, [...] And let them be for Lights as I ordaine [...] Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. [...] And God made two great Lights, great for thir use [...] To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, [...] The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, [...] And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n [...] To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day [...] 350 [...] In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, [...] And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, [...] Surveying his great Work, that it was good: [...] For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun [...] A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, [...] Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon [...] Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, [...] And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: [...] Of Light by farr the greater part he took, [...] Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd [...] 360 [...] In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive [...] And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine [...] Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. [...] Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs [...] Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, [...] And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; [...] By tincture or reflection they augment [...] Thir small peculiar, though from human sight [...] So farr remote, with diminution seen. [...] First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, [...] 370 [...] Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round [...] Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run [...] His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray [...] Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc'd [...] Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, [...] But opposite in leveld West was set [...] His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light [...] From him, for other light she needed none [...] In that aspect, and still that distance keepes [...] Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, [...] 380 [...] Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign [...] With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, [...] With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd [...] Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd [...] With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, [...] Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. [...] And God said, let the Waters generate [...] Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: [...] And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings [...] Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. [...] 390 [...] And God created the great Whales, and each [...] Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously [...] The waters generated by thir kindes, [...] And every Bird of wing after his kinde; [...] And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, [...] Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas [...] And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; [...] And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. [...] Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay [...] With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales [...] 400 [...] Of Fish that with thir Finns & shining Scales [...] Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft [...] Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate [...] Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves [...] Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance [...] Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, [...] Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend [...] Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food [...] In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, [...] And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk [...] 410 [...] Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate [...] Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan [...] Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep [...] Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, [...] And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles [...] Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. [...] Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares [...] Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon [...] Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd [...] Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge [...] 420 [...] They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime [...] With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud [...] In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork [...] On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: [...] Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise [...] In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way, [...] Intelligent of seasons, and set forth [...] Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's [...] Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing [...] Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane [...] 430 [...] Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire [...] Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes: [...] From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song [...] Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings [...] Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal [...] Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes: [...] Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd [...] Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck [...] Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes [...] Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit [...] 440 [...] The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre [...] The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground [...] Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds [...] The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine [...] Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue [...] Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus [...] With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, [...] Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day. [...] The Sixt, and of Creation last arose [...] With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, [...] 450 [...] Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, [...] Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, [...] Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait [...] Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth [...] Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, [...] Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose [...] As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns [...] In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; [...] Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd: [...] The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: [...] 460 [...] Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks [...] Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: [...] The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd [...] The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free [...] His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, [...] And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, [...] The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale [...] Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw [...] In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground [...] Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould [...] 470 [...] Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav'd [...] His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose, [...] As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land [...] The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. [...] At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, [...] Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans [...] For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact [...] In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride [...] With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: [...] These as a line thir long dimension drew, [...] 480 [...] Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all [...] Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde [...] Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd [...] Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept [...] The Parsimonious Emmet, provident [...] Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd, [...] Pattern of just equalitie perhaps [...] Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes [...] Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd [...] The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone [...] 490 [...] Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells [...] With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless, [...] And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names, [...] Needlest to thee repeated; nor unknown [...] The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field, [...] Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes [...] And hairie Main terrific, though to thee [...] Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. [...] Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld [...] Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand [...] 500 [...] First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire [...] Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth, [...] By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt [...] Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd; [...] There wanted yet the Master work, the end [...] Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone [...] And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd [...] With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect [...] His Stature, and upright with Front serene [...] Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence [...] 510 [...] Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n, [...] But grateful to acknowledge whence his good [...] Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes [...] Directed in Devotion, to adore [...] And worship God Supream, who made him chief [...] Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent [...] Eternal Father (For where is not hee [...] Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. [...] Let us make now Man in our image, Man [...] In our similitude, and let them rule [...] 520 [...] Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, [...] Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, [...] And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. [...] This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man [...] Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd [...] The breath of Life; in his own Image hee [...] Created thee, in the Image of God [...] Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul. [...] Male he created thee, but thy consort [...] Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said, [...] 530 [...] Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, [...] Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold [...] Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, [...] And every living thing that moves on the Earth. [...] Wherever thus created, for no place [...] Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st [...] He brought thee into this delicious Grove, [...] This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, [...] Delectable both to behold and taste; [...] And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food [...] 540 [...] Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds, [...] Varietie without end; but of the Tree [...] Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, [...] Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st; [...] Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware, [...] And govern well thy appetite, least sin [...] Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. [...] Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made [...] View'd, and behold all was entirely good; [...] So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day: [...] 550 [...] Yet not till the Creator from his work [...] Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd [...] Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode, [...] Thence to behold this new created World [...] Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd [...] In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, [...] Answering his great Idea. Up he rode [...] Followd with acclamation and the sound [...] Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd [...] Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire [...] 560 [...] Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst) [...] The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung, [...] The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood, [...] While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. [...] Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, [...] Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in [...] The great Creator from his work returnd [...] Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; [...] Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne [...] To visit oft the dwellings of just Men [...] 570 [...] Delighted, and with frequent intercourse [...] Thither will send his winged Messengers [...] On errands of supernal Grace. So sung [...] The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n, [...] That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led [...] To Gods Eternal house direct the way, [...] A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold [...] And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, [...] Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way [...] Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest [...] 580 [...] Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh [...] Eev'ning arose in Eden, for the Sun [...] Was set, and twilight from the East came on, [...] Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount [...] Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne [...] Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, [...] The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down [...] With his great Father (for he also went [...] Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge [...] Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd, [...] 590 [...] Author and end of all things, and from work [...] Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day, [...] As resting on that day from all his work, [...] But not in silence holy kept; the Harp [...] Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, [...] And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, [...] All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire [...] Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice [...] Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds [...] Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. [...] 600 [...] Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, [...] Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite [...] Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue [...] Relate thee; greater now in thy return [...] Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day [...] Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create [...] Is greater then created to destroy. [...] Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound [...] Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt [...] Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine [...] 610 [...] Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought [...] Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw [...] The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes [...] To lessen thee, against his purpose serves [...] To manifest the more thy might: his evil [...] Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good. [...] Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n [...] From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view [...] On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; [...] Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's [...] 620 [...] Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World [...] Of destind habitation; but thou know'st [...] Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, [...] Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd, [...] Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, [...] And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't, [...] Created in his Image, there to dwell [...] And worship him, and in reward to rule [...] Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, [...] And multiply a Race of Worshippers [...] 630 [...] Holy and just: thrice happie if they know [...] Thir happiness, and persevere upright. [...] So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, [...] With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. [...] And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd [...] How first this World and face of things began, [...] And what before thy memorie was don [...] From the beginning, that posteritie [...] Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst [...] Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

There was a place, [...] Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, [...] 70 [...] Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise [...] Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part [...] Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; [...] In with the River sunk, and with it rose [...] Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought [...] Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land [...] From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole [...] Maeotis, up beyond the River Ob; [...] Downward as farr Antartic; and in length [...] West from Orantes to the Ocean barr'd [...] 80 [...] At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes [...] Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam'd [...] With narrow search; and with inspection deep [...] Consider'd every Creature, which of all [...] Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found [...] The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. [...] Him after long debate, irresolute [...] Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose [...] Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom [...] To enter, and his dark suggestions hide [...] 90 [...] From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, [...] Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, [...] As from his wit and native suttletie [...] Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd [...] Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r [...] Active within beyond the sense of brute. [...] Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe [...] His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd: [...] O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd [...] More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built [...] 100 [...] With second thoughts, reforming what was old! [...] For what God after better worse would build? [...] Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns [...] That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, [...] Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, [...] In thee concentring all thir precious beams [...] Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n [...] Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou [...] Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee, [...] Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers [...] 110 [...] Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth [...] Of Creatures animate with gradual life [...] Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man. [...] With what delight could I have walkt thee round [...] If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange [...] Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, [...] Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd, [...] Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these [...] Find place or refuge; and the more I see [...] Pleasures about me, so much more I feel [...] 120 [...] Torment within me, as from the hateful siege [...] Of contraries; all good to me becomes [...] Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state. [...] But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n [...] To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame; [...] Nor hope to be my self less miserable [...] By what I seek, but others to make such [...] As I though thereby worse to me redound: [...] For onely in destroying I finde ease [...] To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, [...] 130 [...] Or won to what may work his utter loss, [...] For whom all this was made, all this will soon [...] Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, [...] In wo then; that destruction wide may range: [...] To mee shall be the glorie sole among [...] The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd [...] What he Almightie styl'd, six Nights and Days [...] Continu'd making, and who knows how long [...] Before had bin contriving, though perhaps [...] Not longer then since I in one Night freed [...] 140 [...] From servitude inglorious welnigh half [...] Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng [...] Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd, [...] And to <b>repaire</b> his numbers thus impair'd, [...] Whether such vertue spent of old now faild [...] More Angels to Create, if they at least [...] Are his Created or to spite us more, [...] Determin'd to advance into our room [...] A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow, [...] Exalted from so base original, [...] 150 [...] With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed [...] He effected; Man he made, and for him built [...] Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, [...] Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie! [...] Subjected to his service Angel wings, [...] And flaming Ministers to watch and tend [...] Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance [...] I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist [...] Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie [...] In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde [...] 160 [...] The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds [...] To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. [...] O foul descent! that I who erst contended [...] With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind [...] Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, [...] This essence to incarnate and imbrute, [...] That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd; [...] But what will not Ambition and Revenge [...] Descend to? who aspires must down as low [...] As high he soard, obnoxious first or last [...] 170 [...] To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, [...] Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; [...] Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd, [...] Since higher I fall short, on him who next [...] Provokes my envie, this new Favorite [...] Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, [...] Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd [...] From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. [...] So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, [...] Like a black mist low creeping, he held on [...] 180 [...] His midnight search, where soonest he might finde [...] The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found [...] In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd, [...] His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles: [...] Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, [...] Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe [...] Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth [...] The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, [...] In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd [...] With act intelligential; but his sleep [...] 190 [...] Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn. [...] Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne [...] In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd [...] Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, [...] From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise [...] To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill [...] With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair [...] And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire [...] Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake [...] The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: [...] 200 [...] Then commune how that day they best may ply [...] Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew [...] The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. [...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E
