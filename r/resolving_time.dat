40|$|When pulse-height spectra are {{measured}} by a nuclear detection system at high counting rates, the probability that two or more pulses will arrive within the <b>resolving</b> <b>time</b> {{of the system is}} significant. This phenomenon, pulse pile-up, distorts the pulse-height spectrum and must be considered in the interpretation of spectra taken at high counting rates. A computational technique for the simulation of pile-up is developed. The model is examined in the three regimes where (1) the time between pulses is long compared to the detector-system <b>resolving</b> <b>time,</b> (2) the time between pulses is comparable to the <b>resolving</b> <b>time,</b> and (3) many pulses occur within the <b>resolving</b> <b>time.</b> The technique is used to model the solar hard X-ray experiment on the OSO- 7 satellite; comparison of the model with data taken during three large flares shows excellent agreement.

40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} how effective are {{the influences of}} detector sizes, types of gas field, and the changes of operation temperature on detector characteristics of Geiger Muller viewed from threshold voltage, plateau, slope, and the <b>resolving</b> <b>time.</b> The determination of detector characteristics {{was obtained from the}} detector enumeration with diameter variation, types of gas field, and temperature operation changes on Cs- 137 radiation. Data obtained from detector characteristics’ determination were the data count. Geiger Muller detector manufacturing process was started from the preparation of materials, the cathode tube and tube cap manufacture, installation of the detector and anode cap, vacuum tubes, gas fill, detector characteristic test, and data acquisition. The detector was made of stainless steel, the anode of tungsten wire with the length of 100 mm and diameters of 11 mm, 16 mm, 24 mm, and the anode diameter of 0. 08 mm. The gas field used alcohol argon and bromine argon, while for the temperature variation was increased from the temperature of 30 ºC to 70 ºC. Data obtained from the detector test were in the form of counts per minute (cpm) as a function of operating voltage (V) of the detector. From data of the test, it was illustrated the counting-per-minute graph on the detector’s operation voltage, so that the plateau, slope and <b>resolving</b> <b>time</b> of the detector could be determined. Research results obtained showed that the volume of the detector tube was influential on the detector characteristic curve. When the detector tube was varied, the initial voltage also changed. The change of gas field types also affected the detector characteristic curve. If the gas field type used argon gas having low ionization potential, the initial voltage of the detector would be smaller. Meanwhile, the increment of the detector’s temperature affected the detector’s count number and only slightly affected the length of the plateau while for the slope was relatively the same.
