40|$|The {{dissertation}} aims {{to investigate}} the possibility of substituting stripping steam with an alternative gas, which will be recycled in a closed loop at the process, without changing physical state. This modification of the atmospheric distillation process increases the revenues of the unit, compared with the conventional. The increases are justified as a 2 - 4 % wt. increase of the unit’s yield in distillates. The utilization of an alternative stripping medium has also some side advantages, as the sparing of the enthalpy of vaporization and condensation of the medium in the unit, {{the reduction of the}} demineralized water consumption and the elimination of the water dew point corrosion of the atmospheric column’s top. The proposed modification is more environmentally friendly, because it does not produce water / hydrocarbon emulsions. The alternative stripping medium that was used {{for the purposes of the}} dissertation is the <b>refinery’s</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gas,</b> which is made mainly of H 2, C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4. Ethane is found in the crude oil and it is produced mainly by the atmospheric distillation itself. Other sources are the naphtha reformer and the hydrocracker units. Hydrogen is a product of the naphtha reformer. Most of it is used at the refinery’s hydrotreaters and the surplus is mixed with the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas.</b> Ethylene is not a constituent of the crude oil. It is produced by cracking processes, mainly by the Fluid Catalytic Cracker Unit, (FCC). In order to simplify the calculations, the make - up stripping medium is considered to be pure C 2 H 6. The other reasons for its selection are: • It is incondensable at the operating conditions of the atmospheric distillation. • It is abundant at any refinery. • It is not corrosive, because it is treated at amine absorber units, in order to remove the H 2 S. • A big amount is produced by the atmospheric distillation itself. • It does not condense and dissolve corrosive agents, as Η 2 Ο steam does. The conclusion of the dissertation is that “dry” stripping is feasible not only for new units, but it can also be applied to the existing ones as a revamp. The same principle can be utilized also at different processes. In fact, the conclusions of the study were utilized at the design of a new stripper column, for a lubricating oil hydrotreating unit. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet DOE's goals of {{developing}} low-emissions coal-based power systems, PCI has further developed and adapted it's Rich-Catalytic Lean-burn (RCL{reg_sign}) catalytic reactor to a combustion system operating on syngas as a fuel. The technology offers ultra-low emissions without the cost of exhaust after-treatment, with high efficiency (avoidance of after-treatment losses and reduced diluent requirements), and with catalytically stabilized combustion which extends the lower Btu limit for syngas operation. Tests were performed in PCI's sub-scale high-pressure (10 atm) test rig, using a two-stage (catalytic then gas-phase) combustion process for syngas fuel. In this process, the first stage consists of a fuel-rich mixture reacting on a catalyst with final and excess combustion air used to cool the catalyst. The second stage is a gas-phase combustor, where the air used for cooling the catalyst mixes with the catalytic reactor effluent to provide for final gas-phase burnout and dilution to fuel-lean combustion products. During testing, operating with a simulated Tampa Electric's Polk Power Station syngas, the NOx emissions program goal of less than 0. 03 lbs/MMBtu (6 ppm at 15 % O{sub 2 }) was met. NOx emissions were generally near 0. 01 lbs/MMBtu (2 ppm at 15 % O{sub 2 }) (PCI's target) over a range on engine firing temperatures. In addition, low emissions were shown for alternative fuels including high hydrogen content <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> and low BTU content Blast Furnace Gas (BFG). For the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> increased resistance to combustor flashback was achieved through preferential consumption of hydrogen in the catalytic bed. In the case of BFG, stable combustion for fuels as low as 88 BTU/ft{sup 3 } was established and maintained {{without the need for}} using co-firing. This was achieved based on the upstream catalytic reaction delivering a hotter (and thus more reactive) product to the flame zone. The PCI catalytic reactor was also shown to be active in ammonia reduction in fuel allowing potential reductions in the burner NOx production. These reductions of NOx emissions and expanded alternative fuel capability make the rich catalytic combustor uniquely situated to provide reductions in capital costs through elimination of requirements for SCR, operating costs through reduction in need for NOx abating dilution, SCR operating costs, and need for co-firing fuels allowing use of lower value but more available fuels, and efficiency of an engine through reduction in dilution flows...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPre-combustion CO 2 Capture {{applied to}} {{industrial}} sources {{is an alternative}} for achieving low CO 2 emissions at a moderate cost. The potential of the technology {{to be used as}} retrofit would further expand its possibilities and could be a real benefit to the industry in terms of achieving CO 2 emission reduction at relatively low cost. The retrofitting of a boiler to hydrogen fuel bears some difficulties due the significant differences in gas and combustion properties between hydrogen and gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. The present investigations by CFD simulations revealed that the effect on the overall performance of the fired heater when the fuel is switched to hydrogen is likely to be minimal. The simulations also showed that the NOx-emissions with pure hydrogen fuel is in fact lower than with the <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> on mass basis, or similar on ppm basis. This is due to the rather large contribution from the prompt-NO mechanism that obviously is absent in the hydrogen case. Similarly, the effect of switching fuel from methane to hydrogen was investigated experimentally on a lab scale model low NOx burner. The burner, first characterized for methane in terms of emissions and stability, was operated with hydrogen without modification and then by applying a first development modification. The later version of the burner allowed first to solve an overheating issue recognized when in the direct switch configuration. Furthermore, the NOx performance revealed to be even better than with methane as fuel, which contradicts most of the previous studies found on this topic, but confirms the CFD analysis of the full refinery heater simulation. Energetic requirements for post-combustion capture using MEA as solvent, an auto-thermal reformal based pre-combustion scheme with aMDEA as solvent and steam methane reformer with pre- and post-combustion capture using MEA and aMDEA were evaluated. Post-combustion capture has the least energy requirements followed by auto-thermal reformer based pre-combustion route.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real industrial example {{in which the}} steam utility network of a refinery is modelled in order to evaluate potential heat integration retrofits proposed for the site. Total site heat integration techniques have previously been used for the refinery to identify a number of possibilities for heat saving retrofits. However, the profitability and actual primary energy saving {{will depend on the}} configuration and operation of the utility system. The supply of utilities such as fuel, steam and electric power re{{presents a}} significant operating cost for many process industries. A reduced use of utilities can improve process economics and reduce the environmental footprint of the process. Heat integration, within and between the refinery process units, is one way to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the use of steam and fuels. Such heat integration measures will affect steam consumption and generation at different steam pressure levels within the network. A refinery, typically, has flexibility in their operation of the steam network from a number of switchable steam turbine-driven or motor-driven pumps and compressors. Furthermore, due to seasonal variations the amount of internally generated <b>refinery</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> will vary, leading to periods of steam over-production as well as periods with a demand for additional purchased fuel. Consequently, the optimum operating strategy concerning steam production and the switchable mechanical drives is a trade-off between the cost of fuel and electricity. * Corresponding author 0258 - 1 2 This paper presents a few examples of heat integration retrofit measures from a case study of a large oil refinery. In order to evaluate expected changes in fuel and electricity imports to the refinery after implementation of the proposed retrofits, a steam system model has been developed using commercial software. The model enables an analysis of how the operation of boilers and turbines could be changed in effect of a proposed change. The steam system model has been tested and validated with real steady state data from three different operating scenarios. It can be used for simulation or optimization to answer how changes to steam balances at different pressure levels will affect the overall steam balances, generation of shaft power in turbines and electricity demand for pumps and compressors, and the consumption of fuel gas...|$|E
