The optical system includes a source of vertically polarized light such as laser and a beam splitter for receiving the light and directing the light toward the target. A <b>retardation</b> <b>plate</b> is affixed to a target-facing surface of the beam splitter and a vertical polarizer is disposed along a common optical path with the beam splitter between the <b>retardation</b> <b>plate</b> and the target. A horizontal polarizer disposed in the common optical path, receives light passing through a surface of the beam splitter opposed to the target-facing surface. An image detector is disposed {{at one end of}} the optical path. A band pass filter having a band pass filter characteristic matching the frequency of the vertically polarized light source is disposed in the path between the horizontal polarizer and the image detector. The use of circular polarization, together with cross polarizers, enables the reflected light to be passed to the detector while blocking thermal radiation...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{formation}} and structure of liquid crystalline phase of F-actin solutions by polarized light photometry, assuming that a small domain of the liquid crystalline phase works as a linear <b>retardation</b> <b>plate.</b> Transmittance of polarized light due to the birefringence of liquid crystalline phase appeared above a threshold concentration of F-actin. The threshold increased with a decrease in filament length, which was regulated by calcium-activated gelsolin. The intensity increased linearly with increasing concentrations until it reached a stationary value. The deviation of optical axis direction of the putative <b>retardation</b> <b>plate</b> was estimated 7 - 15 degrees. These results indicate that:(a) the liquid crystalline phase is formed above a threshold concentration of F-actin; (b) the threshold {{is proportional to the}} inverse of filament length; (c) the ordered phase coexists with the isotropic one, increasing the volume fraction with increasing concentrations until all filaments take the liquid crystalline structure; (d) the filaments in liquid crystalline phase take a highly ordered array.

It realizes the decorrelation to the incident field like the traditional diffuser, and scrambles the polarization state simultaneously like a depolarizer. For various surface-roughness plate models, the comprehensive and rigorous analysis of its modulation behaviour is achieved. On {{the basis of}} the 2 × 2 beam coherence-polarization matrix, the statistical properties of the modulated field are examined to reveal the dependence on the surface structure of the rough-surfaced <b>retardation</b> <b>plate.</b> Within the framework of the Complex ABCD matrix theory for general optical propagation systems under the paraxial approximation, the propagated polarization speckle on observation plane over a distance is studied. The analytical expression of its beam coherence-polarization matrix illustrating the change of degree of coherence and polarization on propagation is obtained too. It is approved that the depolarizer provides a flexible and simple method to generate the randomly de-correlated and depolarized speckle with spatially varying polarization states. In addition, the dynamic properties of polarization speckle are analysed to reveal the shape and the motion features of the polarization speckles on the observation plane. At last, a depolarizer consisting of random polarizer cells is introduced to generate polarization speckle as an attempt for a potential method different from the common phase modulation screens...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on theoretical and experimental studies of optical properties of materials and multilayer structures composing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and electrochromic (EC) devices. By applying spectroscopic ellipsometry, we have determined the optical constants of thin films of electrochromic tungsten oxide (WOx) and nickel oxide (NiOy), the films’ thickness and roughness. These films, which were obtained at spattering conditions possess high transmittance that is important for achieving good visibility and high contrast in an EC device. Another application of the general spectroscopic ellipsometry relates {{to the study of}} a photo-alignment layer of a mixture of azo-dyes SD- 1 and SDA- 2. We have found the optical constants of this mixture before and after illuminating it by polarized UV light. The results obtained confirm the diffusion model to explain the formation of the photo-induced order in azo-dye films. We have developed new techniques for fast characterization of twisted nematic LC cells in transmissive and reflective modes. Our techniques are based on the characteristics functions that we have introduced for determination of parameters of non-uniform birefringent media. These characteristic functions are found by simple procedures and can be utilised for simultaneous determination of retardation, its wavelength dispersion, and twist angle, as well as for solving associated optimization problems. Cholesteric LCD that possesses some unique properties, such as bistability and good selective scattering, however, has a disadvantage – relatively high driving voltage (tens of volts). The way we propose to reduce the driving voltage consists of applying a stack of thin (~ 1 µm) LC layers. We have studied the ability of a layer of a surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal coupled with several <b>retardation</b> <b>plates</b> for birefringent color generation. We have demonstrated that in order to accomplish good color characteristics and high brightness of the display, one or two <b>retardation</b> <b>plates</b> are sufficient...|$|R

Thin film optimization requires simple and accessible means {{to characterize the}} orientation of the constituent crystals. The standard polarized light microscopy (PLM) provides a contrast between different crystallites but fails to distinguish crystals with relative orientation of 90 °. In this paper, we discuss two methods that enable the unambiguous identification of crystal orientation in thin films of optically anisotropic materials: PLM with a full-wave <b>retardation</b> <b>plate</b> and differential interference contrast (DIC). The latter is standard on most microscopes and delivers images with high contrast and good color balance.

The basic construction of "guest-host" LCD includes one input polarizer and reveals a negative contrast.

The concentration of the dye must be optimized for the applied values of LC cell thickness and twist angle.

40|$|Radially and azimuthally {{polarized}} beams {{have attracted}} growing interest {{for use in}} a variety of applications. The most popular way to obtain these beams at relatively low power levels is to transform a linearly-polarized TEM 00 beam into a radially or azimuthally-polarised beam using an external polarisation mode converter. Traditionally, these converters were constructed from an arrangement of half-wave plates bonded together to form a segmented spatially-variant <b>retardation</b> <b>plate</b> and, as a consequence, they generally suffered from low polarization purity and low transformation efficiency. However, recent work on femtosecond laser writing of nanostructure gratings in silica glass has allowed the realization of a new type of polarization converter with improved performance. In these converters the grating structures induce birefringence with slow and fast axes aligned parallel and perpendicular to the grating direction respectively, allowing the construction of a continuously space-variant half-wave plate (S-waveplate). S-waveplate provides dramatically improved polarization purity compared to segmented retardation plates. Here we report on an S-waveplate designed for use in ~ 2 µm wavelength band for use with Tm-doped and Ho-doped solid-state lasers and fiber laser. The S-waveplate was tested with a relatively low power (~ 1. 5 W) tunable Tm fiber laser yielding a donut-shaped radially-polarized (or azimuthally-polarized) beam with a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 18 dB and a transmission efficiency of ~ 86 %.

40|$|Hyperspectral imaging holds {{great promise}} for object {{detection}} and recognition {{due to the}} richness of the spectral content in images from such objects. Ordinary broad-band imagers integrate the spectral information over the entire spectral band of coverage when used without any spectral filtering. In general, the spectral details in the images can be obtained by using an optical filtering element such as a filter wheel, a grating, or an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). Since each task of detection and object recognition may require only a limited set of specific spectral bands based on the object as well as the background, it is best to choose a filtering optical element that has high-speed spectral selectivity with high resolution. Of all the optical filtering elements available, only an AOTF offers this capability. Such capability greatly reduces the amount of data collection and processing. In this paper, we present hyperspectral images obtained in the laboratory and from field tests, using visible-to-near-IR (VNIR) AOTF imagers. The imagers use a tellurium dioxide, Te 02, AOTF cell that covers the spectral band from 450 to 1000 nm with a spectral resolution of 10 nm at 600 nm, a charged coupled device (CCD) camera, image-forming optics, frame grabber board, rf electronics, and control and processing software.

The spectral and polarimetric imaging capabilities of the AOTF imager were successfully tested to discriminate targets and backgrounds in various environments.

The fundamental wave was obtained from a flash-lamp excited dye l a se r (Chromatix CMX 4) with a peak power of x 5 kW, a repetition rate of 10 Hz, and a pulse length of 1 ps. The incident polarizatioa could be rotated continuously by using a half-wave <b>retardation</b> <b>plate.</b> By rotating crystal and polarization al l necessary configurations of input po-larization to the crystal axis could be arranged. The generated second harmonic light was detected by a solar blind photomultiplier tube with a CsTe photocathode af ter removing the fundamental beam by means of optical f i l ters. The phase-match angles (inside the crystal with respect to the c-axis) measured in this arrangement a r e plotted in Fig. 1 for different wavelengths of the incident beam. Extrapolation yields a short wavelength limit of 476 nm, and no long wave-length limit up to the IR absorption bands of the crystal which were found to s t a r t at about 1. 4 3 p m. Best efficiency (as phase matching is of type 11) for frequency doubling is achieved for a P M angle of about 45, i. e. at a wavelength near 600 nm...|$|E
40|$|A compact common path {{interferometer}} (CPI) {{system has}} been developed to measure the diffusivity of liquid pairs. The CPI is an optical technique {{that can be used}} to measure changes in the gradient of the refraction index of transparent materials. It uses a shearing interferometer that shares the same optical path from a laser light source to the final imaging plane. The molecular diffusion coefficient of liquids can be determined from the physical relations between changes in the optical path length and liquid phase properties. When the data obtained by using the CPI have been compared with similar results from other techniques, the instrument has been demonstrated to be far superior to other instruments for measuring the diffusivity of miscible liquids while staying very compact and robust (ref. 1). Because of its compactness and ease of use, the CPI has been adopted for use in studies of interface dynamics as well as other diffusion-controlled process applications (ref. 2). This progress will permit experiments in microgravity that can quantitatively answer basic science questions about mass and thermal diffusion and their effect in transport processes. This instrument is a spinoff of a diagnostic development for microgravity fluid physics experiments at the NASA Glenn Research Center that has used optics and electronics existing in the fluid physics laboratory for feasibility studies. Optical diagnostic techniques have become an integral part of many areas of measurement applications in industrial and research laboratories. Many types of interferometers and their phase-shifted versions have been used as instruments for measuring optical wave fronts for lens testing and combustion and fluid flow diagnostics. One of these, the point diffraction interferometer, is considered to be robust (see, for example, ref. 3) because it has a common-path design. The point diffraction interferometer is difficult to align and has a limited measurement range for liquid-phase applications. Interferometry and schlieren techniques have been widely used for many years for gas-flow-visualization. On the other hand, the CPI, which is basically a Wollaston prism Polarizer in combination with an analyser (crystalline quartz <b>retardation</b> <b>plate)</b> is used instead of a point diffraction interferometer unit. The advantage of using the CPI over other optical techniques is that it can make quantitative measurements in liquids with the large index of refraction variations that often occur in interface dynamics studies. This can be simply accomplished by using different prism polarizers for each particular experimental condition...|$|E
