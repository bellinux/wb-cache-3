5|$|Snake scales {{occur in}} variety of shapes. They may be cycloid as in family Typhlopidae, long and pointed with pointed tips, {{as in the}} case of the Green Vine Snake Ahaetulla nasuta, broad and leaf-like, {{as in the case}} of green pit vipers Trimeresurus spp or as broad as they are long, for example, as in <b>Rat</b> <b>snake</b> Ptyas mucosus.|$|E
5|$|The main predators of the Guianan cock-of-the-rock are harpy eagles, {{black-and-white}} hawk-eagles, black hawk-eagles, and slaty-backed forest falcons. Although {{these are}} the main predators, two species of owls, crested owls and spectacled owls, are also predators. Felines such as the jaguar, puma, and ocelot can also be predators, along with snakes such as the bird snake, tree boas, boa constrictor, tiger <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> and fer-de-lance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rat</b> <b>snakes</b> live in {{a variety}} of {{habitats}} with each subspecies preferring a slightly different one. Some of these habitats overlap with one another. <b>Rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are excellent climbers and {{spend a lot of time}} in trees. Black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> live at elevations from sea level to high altitudes. Black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> live in habitats ranging from a rocky hillside to flat farmland.|$|R
50|$|Most of the Elaphe {{start their}} {{hibernation}} in October and emerge {{again the next}} Spring. The length of the hibernation period varies among species. Elaphe longissima, or Aesculapian snake, may hibernate {{for as long as}} from October to next May as it is among the northernmost occurring <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> However, Elaphe bimaculata, or the twin-spotted <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> only need to hibernate for 2 to 3 months.Interestingly, species like black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta, like to hibernate with other <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and/or many other snake species, most notably timber rattlesnakes, racers, and bull snakes.|$|R
50|$|Euprepiophis is a genus of nonvenomous {{colubrid}} snakes, containing {{three species}} of Asian <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> which were formerly {{assigned to the}} genus Elaphe. They were separated from Elaphe in 2002 by Utiger et al. following evidence from DNA analysis. They are true <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> but are not as closely related to other European, Asian, or North American <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> as their former place in Elaphe might suggest.|$|R
5|$|The least weasel {{is small}} enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators. Least weasel remains {{have been found in}} the {{excrement}} of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b> The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
25|$|Python, cobra, king cobra, <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> marsh {{crocodile}} {{are among the}} reptiles found in the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|Though beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are {{typically}} in less accessible caves, the top predators of these serpents are birds and mammals. Currently, {{there is no}} specific information of the predators of beauty <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> available.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{of adult}} red-bellied {{woodpeckers}} include {{birds of prey}} such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's hawks, black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include red-headed woodpeckers, owls, pileated woodpeckers, gray <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> When approached by a predator, red-bellied woodpeckers either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.|$|R
50|$|Adult black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> {{one of the}} {{subspecies}} of Elaphe obsoleta, are {{shiny black}} on the dorsal side with some yellow, white and red on the skin between the scales. The anterior ventral side, the throat and the neck, is white, while the posterior ventral side of the snake is marked with black and brown.The yellow <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> a subspecies of Elaphe obsoleta, differ from the black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> in that they have four bold longitudinal dark stripes. The background color ranges from dull to bright yellow.|$|R

25|$|The cave is {{populated}} {{by both the}} brown bat and northern long ear bat. The cave stream contains fish known as sculpin. Snakes of the surrounding area include the copperhead, timber rattlesnake, <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> and kingsnake. Over 115 species of birds have been identified by researchers at Russell Cave, a site on the North Alabama Birding Trail. Although the site is now below the southern boundary of their range, porcupine bones {{have been found in}} digs at the earliest occupational levels. The peccary, also hunted by the occupants, is no longer found in this region.|$|E

50|$|Elaphe {{is one of}} {{the main}} genera of the <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> which are found in many regions of the {{northern}} hemisphere. Elaphe are medium to large constrictors by nature. All species are nonvenomous. Although all of the species in Elaphe are nonvenomous, bites from <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are still irritably painful and can potentially cause bacterial infections due to the saliva.|$|R
50|$|The {{reptiles}} {{are represented}} by bog turtles, common water <b>snakes,</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and sand lizard. Bog turtles are found in all waters. Common water snakes live {{on the banks of}} canals. <b>Rat</b> <b>snakes</b> and sand lizards are few and inhabit relatively high areas of land. Two more reptiles, Caspian whipsnake and Coluber spinalis, are extremely rare. Among amphibians common are lake frog and green frog.|$|R
500|$|Sri Lanka is {{considered}} a herpetological paradise in the world. Possibly about 15 amphibian species inhabit the park. Among them are Microhyla zeylanica, Ramanella palmata, Fejervarya greenii, Rana gracilis, Philautus alto, Philautus femoralis, Philautus frankenbergi, Philautus microtympanum, Philautus schmarda, and Polypedates eques. De Silva has observed six endemic reptiles from the plains. They are Calotes nigrilabris, rhino horn lizard, Cophotis ceylanica, Lankascincus taprobanensis, [...] common rough-sided snake, and <b>rat</b> <b>snake.</b> Two fish species found in the park, common carp and rainbow trout; both are introduced species. Horton Plains {{is also home to}} many endemic crustaceans including Caridina singhalensis and Perbrinckia species. The endemic freshwater shrimp Caridina singhalensis is found only in streams that have a temperature of less than 15 degrees C and is now restricted to only a stretch of 10km of one stream.|$|E

2500|$|In each {{episode of}} Call of the Wildman, Brown is {{accompanied}} by his best friend, Neal James, and his dog, Lolly. James serves as the secretary for Brown's business, fielding telephone calls from individuals in need of his services. Lolly has been Brown's pet ever since he rescued her from wandering {{the streets in the}} aftermath of a 2009 ice storm. He doesn't know her exact breed, but he believes her to be part Border Collie and part Australian Cattle Dog. Some episodes also feature other friends who help Brown [...] "Turtle Team" [...] including handyman Jake Ison and David [...] "Squirrel" [...] Brady. [...] In some cases involving rats and the like, Brown also enlisted the help of a <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> that lived on or near his property, Sir Lancelot.

40|$|Based on our findings, {{we suggest}} that <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> {{represent}} not only a major predator of kites, but also of other canopy and mid-story nesting species in the southeastern United States. For example, <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> are the most dominant snake nest predator of bird nests throughout the Southeast (DeGregorio et al. 2014) and are skilled tree climbers that often occupy arboreal habitats (Jackson 1976, Keller and Heske 2000, Sperry et al. 2009), particularly in bottomland forests (Mullin et al. 2000, Carfagno and Weatherhead 2009). Thus, the role of <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> as predators of nests above the understory is likely underappreciated because of the paucity of information on causes of failure among mid-story and canopy nest...|$|R

50|$|Elaphe {{live in a}} {{great variety}} of environments. The {{variation}} of habitat depends on different species and subspecies. Most are terrestrial or semi-arboreal, but some burrow in sand or loose soil. For example, the black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta, prefer heavily wooded habitats due to their excellent tree climbing ability. Their population can be distributed throughout all elevations, usually on rocky hillsides of mountains or on flat farmlands.On the other hand, the yellow <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta quadrivittata, prefer river swamps as habitats. Similarly, Everglades <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta rossalleni, live in the shrubs and trees along the water way.The Elaphe snakes are spread throughout the northern hemisphere; however, there are some in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia and Northern Australia.For instance, the black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta ssp., are well distributed from Ontario, Canada to Florida and Texas.The population of Elaphe guttata is widespread in many southeastern states of the United States including Florida, Louisiana, southern New Jersey and parts of Kentucky.|$|R

40|$|Thermoregulation {{is thought}} to be the most {{important}} factor influencing habitat selection by terrestrial ectotherms, at least in temperate climates. The cost-benefit model of thermoregulation predicts that ectotherms should invest more in thermoreg-ulation when the costs of doing so are low (when the thermal quality of the habitat is high). However, the extent to which ectotherms vary their thermoregulatory behaviour according to the thermal quality of habitats is currently unknown. We studied the relationship between habitat use and thermoregulation in 53 black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. Among the habitats available to black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> edges had the highest thermal quality, retreat sites and forest were intermediate, and open habitats had the lowest thermal quality. Black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> experienced more favourable body temperatures while in barns (retreat sites) than in edges, and in edges than in forest. During the day, the effectiveness and the extent of thermoregulation by the snakes were equal in barns and forest, but much lower in edges. In fact, black <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> selected thermally favourable microhabitats less than their availability while in edges. Therefore, more favourable body temperatures wer...|$|R
