The outage probability and the ergodic rate achieved by this C-RANs are analysed, where stochastic geometry {{is used to}} capture the randomness of BS locations. Compared to existing studies to C-RANs, more accurate analyt-ical results are developed by applying the Gaussian-Chebyshev integration, as confirmed by our simulation results.

40|$|The next {{generation}} <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> in UMTS and CDMA networks {{are expected to}} be IP-based <b>Radio</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Networks</b> (RAN). There are several benefits of IP-based RAN including lower costs, flexibility of merging wired and wireless networks, network scalability and reliability. In addition to the quality of service issues in IP-based RAN, the issue of connectivity and assignment of calls to radio network controllers is also addressed. Optimum RAN connectivity and optimum Radio Network Controller (RNC) utilisation is an important problem in the design of IP-based RAN and is solved for IPbased homogeneous <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks.</b> In this paper, we solve it for IP-based heterogeneous RAN which is a NP-hard problem.
