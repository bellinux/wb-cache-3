40|$|The {{research}} {{work in the}} EMMIS project (evaluation of Man-Machine Interface by Simulation techniques) has the main objective to specify and develop evaluation methods and tools for the human-machine interfaces of ATT (Advanced <b>road</b> and <b>Transport</b> <b>Telematics)</b> functions. The activity {{is based on the}} application and integration of simulation methods, namely driving simulators, rapid prototyping techniques and evaluation tools. Whereas a lot of useful tools exist for the domain of designing human-machine dialogues, there is a deficiency in supporting the evaluation of dialogue interfaces. The paper describes a methodology for the model-based evaluation of human-machine dialogues with regard to the specific conditions in vehicles. The methodology is based on an approach modelling the driver's task-related knowledge by means of production systems. Cognitive complexity measures of drivervehicle interactions, such as visual distraction, learning and execution time are derived. The integration o f design and evaluation is achieved by generating the production system models of the driver's tasks automatically when the tasks are executed with a prototyped dialogue system...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{can be used}} {{to create}} realistic simulations of surrounding vehicles in driving simulators. However, the use of autonomous vehicles makes it difficult to ensure reproducibility between subjects. In this paper, an effort is made to solve the problem by combining autonomous vehicles and controlled events, denoted plays. The aim is to achieve the same initial play conditions for each subject, since the traffic situation around the subject will be dependant upon each subject's actions while driving in the autonomous traffic. This paper presents an algorithm that achieves the transition from autonomous traffic to a predefined start condition for a play. The algorithm has been tested in the VTI driving simulator III with promising results. In most of the cases the algorithm could reconstruct the specified start condition and conduct the transition from autonomous to controlled mode in a non-conspicuous way. Some problems were observed regarding moving unwanted vehicles away from the closest area around the simulator vehicle, and this part of the algorithm has to be enhanced. The experiment also showed that the controlled every-day life traffic normally used in the VTI driving simulator makes subjects drive faster than in autonomous traffic.

One of the main applications of DSRC is RTTT (<b>Road</b> <b>Transport</b> and Traffic <b>Telematics),</b> especially EFC (Electronic Fee Collection) on tolled roads, bridges or tunnels. Other vehicle-related applications had been envisaged, such as car parking or fuel refilling automatic payment. These applications were successfully developed, deployed and are in current use in Portugal. Especially for EFC, medium access control is of utmost importance. In this paper it is presented an implementation scheme for the MAC-layer of the RSE (road side equipment), suitable for low-cost microcontrollers, to operate between the two equipments (as in Figure 1), and also the MAC layer of the SPI connection, of the two Microcontrollers present within the RSE. The result is interface software that controls the referred communication, embracing hardware and software into a join solution. This hardware works with both transfer rates, the LDR (Lo...|$|R

To {{make it possible}} to use other operators Road Side Equipment (RSE) to communicate with other On Board Units (OBU), elaborate standards have been invented for the communication between road side equipments and OBU’s by the institute ETSI.

This is the report of thesis in Master of Science in Electrical Engineering where the aim is to investigate the procedure and evaluating test cases for OBU’s.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{critically}} assesses procedures {{which have been}} adopted to evaluate Advanced <b>Transport</b> <b>Telematics</b> (ATT) projects. The importance of such a review at this juncture stems from the changing position of ATT in transport planning. ATT is no longer simply a field for experimentation, where technical feasibility and user acceptance are dominant concerns. Rather it is a potential mainstream contributor to the functioning of <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> systems. For this reason, ATT project appraisal needs to be developed to the same form, level of sophistication and consistency as the appraisal of conventional transport infrastructure investment. Based on the review set out here, we argue that appropriate methods {{have not yet been}} established which, in turn, poses a number of challenging questions, since current socio-economic evaluation procedures are not directly suited to either measuring or evaluating many of the impacts which ATT schemes are implemented to achieve...|$|R

We will focus our attention on those systems which provide information to various categories of users, viz. public transport users and private car users. A conceptual framework is presented that covers all variables of interest for the investigation of user responses to these technologies. An important explanatory variable for acceptance of new telematics technologies is user segmentation; it has to be recognized that the effects of respective technological innovations will vary between various groups of transport users. In analyzing in more detail the dynamics of individual behaviour, we will also present a theoretical concept of information use by...|$|R
