5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a <b>ribozyme</b> that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead <b>ribozyme,</b> an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin <b>ribozyme</b> of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
40|$|Group I intron <b>ribozymes</b> occur {{naturally}} as cis-splicing <b>ribozymes,</b> in {{the form}} of introns that do not require the spliceosome for their removal. Instead, they catalyze two consecutive trans-phosphorylation reactions to remove themselves from a primary transcript, and join the two flanking exons. Designed, trans-splicing variants of these <b>ribozymes</b> replace the 3 ′-portion of a substrate with the <b>ribozyme’s</b> 3 ′-exon, replace the 5 ′-portion with the <b>ribozyme’s</b> 5 ′-exon, or insert/remove an internal sequence of the substrate. Two of these designs have been evolved experimentally in cells, leading to variants of group I intron <b>ribozymes</b> that splice more efficiently, recruit a cellular protein to modify the substrate’s gene expression, or elucidate evolutionary pathways of <b>ribozymes</b> in cells. Some of the artificial, trans-splicing <b>ribozymes</b> are promising as tools in therapy, and as model systems for RNA evolution in cells. This review provides an overview of the different types of trans-splicing group I intron <b>ribozymes</b> that have been generated, and the experimental evolution systems that have been used to improve them...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ribozymes</b> are enzymes made of RNA {{although}} {{they can be}} also associated with auxiliary proteins. After their discovery in the early 1980 s, <b>ribozymes</b> {{have been found in}} the genomes of many species from all kingdoms of life. In addition, numerous artificial <b>ribozymes</b> were developed by in vitro evolution in the past years. All natural <b>ribozymes</b> fall into two major groups that are the small and large <b>ribozymes.</b> <b>Ribozymes</b> catalyze reactions such as RNA splicing, RNA cleavage, and protein synthesis. Catalysis is mainly achieved by forming complex tertiary structures that provide an active site with ideal geometrical restraints to perform nucleophilic substitution reactions for phosphoryltransfers. The catalytic mechanism relies on acid–base catalysis assisted by metal ions and the ribonucleosides...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic RNA molecules, or <b>ribozymes,</b> have {{generated}} significant interest as potential therapeutic agents for controlling gene expression. Although <b>ribozymes</b> {{have been shown}} to work in vitro and in cellular assays, there are no reports that demonstrate the efficacy of synthetic, stabilized <b>ribozymes</b> delivered in vivo. We are currently utilizing the rabbit model of interleukin 1 -induced arthritis to assess the localization, stability, and efficacy of exogenous antistromelysin hammerhead <b>ribozymes.</b> The matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin is believed to be a key mediator in arthritic diseases. It seems likely therefore that inhibiting stromelysin would be a valid therapeutic approach for arthritis. We found that following intraarticular administration <b>ribozymes</b> were taken up by cells in the synovial lining, were stable in the synovium, and reduced synovial interleukin 1 alpha-induced stromelysin mRNA. This effect was demonstrated with <b>ribozymes</b> containing various chemical modifications that impart nuclease resistance and that recognize several distinct sites on the message. Catalytically inactive <b>ribozymes</b> were ineffective, thus suggesting a cleavage-mediated mechanism of action. These results suggest that <b>ribozymes</b> may be useful in the treatment of arthritic diseases characterized by dysregulation of metalloproteinase expression...|$|R
5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with <b>ribozyme</b> activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
25|$|The hammerhead <b>ribozyme</b> {{is arguably}} the best-characterized <b>ribozyme.</b> Its small size, thoroughly-investigated {{cleavage}} chemistry, known crystal structure, and its biological relevance make the hammerhead <b>ribozyme</b> particularly well-suited for biochemical and biophysical investigations into the fundamental nature of RNA catalysis.|$|E
25|$|The hairpin <b>ribozyme</b> {{is a small}} {{section of}} RNA that {{can act as a}} <b>ribozyme.</b> Like the hammerhead <b>ribozyme</b> it is found in RNA {{satellites}} of plant viruses. It was first identified in the minus strand of the tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) satellite RNA where it catalyzes self-cleavage and joining (ligation) reactions to process the products of rolling circle virus replication into linear and circular satellite RNA molecules. The hairpin <b>ribozyme</b> is similar to the hammerhead <b>ribozyme</b> in that it does not require a metal ion for the reaction.|$|E
40|$|Hammerhead <b>ribozymes</b> are potent RNA {{molecules}} {{which have}} the potential to specifically inhibit gene expression by catalysing the trans-cleavage of mRNAs. However, they are unstable in biological fluids and cellular delivery poses a problem. Site-specific chemical modification of hammerhead <b>ribozymes</b> was evaluated as a means of enhancing biological stability. Chimeric, 2 '-O-methylated <b>ribozymes,</b> containing only five unmodified ribonucleotides, were catalytically active in vitro (kcat = 1. 46 min- 1) and were significantly more stable in serum and lysosomal enzymes than unmodified (all-RNA) counterparts. Furthermore, they remained undegraded in cell-containing media for up to 8 hours. Stability enhancement allowed cellular uptake properties of radiolabelled <b>ribozymes</b> to be assessed following exogenous delivery. Studies in vulval and glial cell lines indicated that chimeric <b>ribozymes</b> became cell-associated via an inefficient process, which was energy and concentration dependant. A considerable proportion of <b>ribozymes</b> remained bound to cell-surface components, however, a small proportion (< 1 %) were internalised via mechanisms of adsorptive and / or receptor mediated endocytosis. Fluorescent microscopy indicated that <b>ribozymes</b> were localised within endosomal / lysosomal vesicles following cell entry. This was confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy, which allowed the detection of biotin-labelled <b>ribozymes</b> within the cell ultrastructure. Despite the predominant localisation within endocytic vesicles, a small proportion of internalised <b>ribozymes</b> appeared able to exit these compartments and penetrate target sites within the nucleus and cytoplasm. The <b>ribozymes</b> designed in this report were directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, which is over-expressed in a malignant brain disease called glioblastoma multiforme. In order to examine the fate of <b>ribozymes</b> in the brain, the distribution of FITC-labelled <b>ribozymes</b> was examined following intra-cerebro ventricular injection to mice. FITC-ribozymes demonstrated high punctate pattern of distribution within the striatum and cortex, which appeared to represent localisation within cell bodies and dendritic processes. This suggested that delivery to glial cells in vivo may be possible. Finally, strategies were investigated to enhance the cellular delivery of <b>ribozymes.</b> Conjugation of <b>ribozymes</b> to anti~transferrin receptor antibodies improved cellular uptake 3 -fold {{as a result of a}} specific interaction with transferrin receptors. Complexation with cationic liposomes also significantly improved cell association, however, some toxiclty was observed and this could be a limitation to their use. Overall, it would appear that hammerhead <b>ribozymes</b> can be chemically stabilised to allow direct exogenous administration in vivo. However, additional delivery strategies are probably required to improve cellular uptake, and thus, allow <b>ribozymes</b> to achieve their full potential as pharmaceutical agents.

25|$|In {{the natural}} state, a VS <b>ribozyme</b> motif {{contains}} 154 nucleotides that fold into six helices. Its RNA contains a self-cleavage element which {{is thought to}} act in the processing of intermediates made through the process of replication. The H-shaped structure of the <b>ribozyme</b> is organized by two three-way junctions which determine the overall fold of the <b>ribozyme.</b> A unique feature of the structure of <b>ribozyme</b> is that even if the majority of helix IV and distal end of helix VI would be deleted there would be no significant loss of activity However, if the lengths of helix III and V were to be changed there be major loss of activity. The base bulges of the <b>ribozyme,</b> helices II and IV have very important structural roles since replacing them with other nucleotides does not affect their activity. Basically, VS ribozyme's activity is very dependent on the local sequence of the two three-way junctions. The three-way junction present in the VS <b>ribozyme</b> is very similar to the one seen in the small (23S) subunit of rRNA.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{mediated}} cleavage and ligation {{is found}} in group 1 and group 2 self-splicing RNAs. VS RNA contains many conserved sequence characteristics to group 1 introns. However VS <b>ribozyme</b> splice site is different from group 1 intron splice site and VR <b>ribozyme</b> self-cleaving site is outside of {{the core of the}} group 1 intron. In the cleavage reaction VS <b>ribozyme</b> produce 2’,3’ -cyclic phosphate and the group 1 introns produce 3’-hydroxyl.

25|$|This first {{successful}} evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could {{provide support for}} the RNA World hypothesis. In another recent study, an RNA ligase <b>ribozyme</b> was converted into a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution of the inactive deoxyribo-analog of the <b>ribozyme.</b> The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which {{had no effect on}} activity, and had a catalytic efficiency of approximately 1/10 of the original <b>ribozyme,</b> though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 it was {{discovered}} that the hammerhead <b>ribozyme,</b> as well as the VS <b>ribozyme</b> and hairpin <b>ribozyme,</b> do not require the presence of metal ions for catalysis, provided a sufficiently high concentration of monovalent cation is present to permit the RNA to fold. This discovery suggested that the RNA itself, rather than serving as an inert, passive scaffold for the binding of chemically active divalent metal ions, is instead itself intimately involved in the chemistry of catalysis. The latest structural results, described below, indeed confirm that two invariant nucleotides, G12 and G8, are positioned consistent with roles as the general base and general acid in the hammerhead cleavage reaction.|$|E
