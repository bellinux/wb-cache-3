5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd <b>Rencontre</b> Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

During the period of the Coastal Blockade (1817-31), there was an Enchantress at Rye that served as the {{headquarters}} of the organization for Kent and Sussex. This vessel began operations in 1819, but by one account was the French vessel <b>Rencontre,</b> which had grounded on the coast of Sussex and been converted to this new role.

[...] The ship was La Concorde of Saint-Malo, a large French guineaman carrying a cargo of slaves. [...] Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. [...] The crew of La Concorde were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed Mauvaise <b>Rencontre</b> (Bad Meeting), and sailed for Martinique. [...] Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of Mauvaise <b>Rencontre.</b>|$|E
