5000|$|The south wall of {{the tower}} bears the reset arch of a tympanum, carved with {{alternating}} rosettes and wheels in roundels, enclosing a row of zigzag carving. The centre shows a cross with splayed ends with a <b>raised</b> <b>band</b> just before the splay. At the top is an angel {{on the right and}} an Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) on the left, both set in roundels. The shaft of the cross shows two standing figures. Down the left hand side of the cross and below is a Latin inscription, which translates: [...] "Walter and his spouse Cecelina had this church made in honour of our Lord and of Saint Mary the Virgin and all God's saints likewise." [...] This tympanum was dated by Pevsner to the 12th century.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>raised</b> <b>band</b> {{concept was}} {{expanded}} over {{the upper body}} to a repeating circumferential pattern, incised or stamped at first, then rolled with a seal-like roller around {{the body of the}} pithos while it was still fresh clay. Some common themes are spirals, meanders, and waves. Waves in relief give the appearance of slack rope; whether they were intended to be that is debatable. Slack rope lifts nothing; moreover, a rope around the neck of the pithos for lifting would only concentrate the weight on the neck, probably shattering it. Multiple lugs, loops and handles indicate that for lifting purposes some sort of harness to distribute the weight must have been used. Rope may have been used during decoration for impressing patterns. These rope-like waves, regardless of the potter's possible intent, have been termed [...] "rope patterns" [...] or [...] "rope decoration", with a certain ambiguity of meaning as to whether actual rope was used to physically impress them, or they are merely intended to visually resemble rope.|$|E

The north aisle pointed west window opening has a chamfered reveal and a hood mould, with an inset window of two simple pointed lights. The pointed east window with hood mould is of four lights - two central lights, with cusped heads with quatrefoil device above, define a dropped section of the cill below, with a simple raised pointed light each side. All north aisle windows are clear glazed. Above the aisle runs a plain parapet which meets a raised half gable at the east and west ends.The south aisle is early 14th century. It is supported by twin-stepped clasping buttresses at the south-east and south-west corners, and an angle buttress on the south side. A moulded string course runs at the eaves, and a plinth just below the window line. There are five windows: one at the east end; one at the west end; and three at the south with two of these at the west separated by the church porch. The east window is of concave chamfered intersecting 'Y' tracery, creating three lights set within a chamfered pointed arch with hood mould. The west window is similar, but narrower, and of two lights. The south wall windows are identical: rectangular chamfered openings within which are three lights with cusped ogee heads. The parapet is of a coping set above a repeated c.17th-century cusped fretwork device.|$|E
