5|$|Despite 17th Street Productions {{holding the}} rights to The Last Dog on Earth, Dell Publishing gained {{permission}} to publish it. The company released the novel in hardcover in 2003 and in paperback in 2004.

The Last Dog on Earth was a winner of the Texas Lone Star <b>Reading</b> <b>List</b> and recognized by YALSA on a 2006 book list for young adults.

5|$|In 1999 Kelly {{formed the}} band Professor Ratbaggy with Hadley (bass guitar, backing vocals), Haymes (keyboards, organ, backing vocals) and Luscombe (drums).

Kelly's second anthology of lyrics entitled Don't Start Me Talking {{was first published in}} 1999, with subsequent songs appended in the 2004 edition.

5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a <b>reading</b> <b>list</b> for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression on each other. Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E
