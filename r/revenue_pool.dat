40|$|Current {{agricultural}} {{trade negotiations}} {{under the auspices}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) call for an elimination of export subsidies. But the current language on export subsidies in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture omits an important implicit export subsidy in the form of price discrimination with or without <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> In either case, the export subsidy can be called ‘consumer only financed’. Two recent high profile trade disputes brought before the WTO concluded that price discrimination with or without price pooling constituted an export subsidy (WTO, 1999, 2004). As a result, both Canadian dairy and EU sugar export subsidies were deemed to be above that scheduled in the Agreement on Agriculture (AOA). The WTO rulings based their decision on cross-subsidization as defined by Tangermann (1997) where price support within quotas has the effect of covering fixed costs while above-quota production can be sold even if the price received for it covers only marginal cost of production. Tangermann (1997) also includes the export subsidy effect of <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> in his definition of cross-subsidization. In this paper, we develop a general theoretical framework that identifies the elements of export subsidies with or without <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> In cases were there is no <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling,</b> w...|$|R

40|$|Cost pooling {{has been}} the most {{distinctive}} feature of the pricing policies of Australian grain handling authorities during the past 40 years. The grain handling system is characterized by extensive cost pooling in each state, both between receival points and among users at a particular receival point. The general principle is that all growers are charged the same amount per tonne, regardless of the actual cost of handling their grain. In addition, <b>revenues</b> are <b>pooled</b> across wheat lots differentiated by quality and by time and place of delivery 1. Since growers care only about net return, the effects of cost and <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> are closely intertwined. Buccola has examined distributive equity issues in <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> Similar issues arise with the pooling of costs across growers. Grain handling by statutory authorities permits the operation of a pooling system by which a uniform handling charge can be made for deliveries at any point in a given state. Several different interpretations of pooling will be examined with specific reference to its operation in the grain handling system.

50|$|Barnett was {{the sole}} state premier opposed to Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's key Health reform policy deal at the April 2010 COAG meeting. Barnett at the time led the only Liberal State Government in Australia, while all others states were led by Labor Governments. The {{reasoning}} for Barnett's strong opposition towards the reform was because it would require the State Governments to forfeit a proportion of their GST revenue. The Rudd Government's proposal was that 30 per cent of the GST <b>revenue</b> <b>pool</b> was to be dedicated towards the Commonwealth's contribution for hospital services, which had a disproportionate impact on those States receiving a less than per capita share of the GST pool (for Western Australia, this {{would have resulted in}} an estimated 64 per cent of GST revenue being forfeit). Barnett had already been angered that Western Australia was given a decreased 7.1 percent amount of the GST revenue (lower than last year's revenue amount of 8.1 percent) while Western Australia is a state that will be heavily relied upon for the nation's economic growth due to its booming resource sector. Western Australia therefore would be heavily dependent on GST revenue to fund major resource sector projects although they would not be supported by GST revenue, thus becoming extensive expenditure for the state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{three types}} of export subsidies: taxpayer, consumer only, and producer financed. A consumer only financed export subsidy involves price discrimination and <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling.</b> We show that consumer only financed export subsidies are more trade distorting than taxpayer financed export subsidies. Domestic price discrimination alone is a consumer tax. We describe {{the conditions under which}} price discrimination for a non-traded product like fluid milk but not for a traded product also constitutes an export subsidy. Price discrimination in world markets combined with <b>revenue</b> <b>pooling</b> in the domestic market is a production subsidy (like New Zealand Dairy Board practices). We show that producer financed export subsidies can only exist if a consumer only or a taxpayer financed export subsidy is in place first. Trade distortion with a producer tax on a taxpayer financed export subsidy differs from that of a tax on a consumer only financed export subsidy. The WTO Panel ruling on Canadian dairy pricing for three milk classes is shown to be inconsistent with the economic definition of export subsidies. We conclude that export subsidies are inadequately dealt with in the Agreement o...|$|R

These alternatives were: expansion of County Medical Assistance Programs, state-purchased health insurance policies, Medicaid expansion, <b>revenue</b> <b>pool</b> to redistribute charity care losses, all-payer rate system, mandated employer-purchased health insurance, and charity care districts. ^ These alternatives were subjected to both cost and sensitivity analysis, then ranked on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Qualitative criteria were: maintenance of the 1985 level of health, inclusion of preventive health measures, equity in distribution of unreimbursed medical expenses, and reduced incentives for cost-shifting. Quantitative criteria were cost, and percentage of medically indigent served. Qualitative criteria were integrated using the Delphi Method, and Saaty 2 ̆ 7 s Analytical Hierarchy via Expert Choice. ^ Impact analysis for each alternative on Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s health care delivery system was also performed, including the effect on total state disposable income. The alternatives were tested further under four scenarios representing expected future changes in the health care delivery system. These scenarios are: federal matching funds reduction, charity care reductions, state funding reduction, and increase in medical indigents. In this analysis the effects of varying factors, previously held constant at 1985 levels, were assessed for all criteria. The alternatives were then reranked, with state-purchased health insurance scoring highest most consistently. ^ It is recommended that the state adopt a combination of Medicaid expansion and state-purchased health insurance. This combination would best meet all qualitative criteria at a minimum system cost per indigent served. ^ If the recommended comprehensive program cannot be undertaken, a combination of programs is suggested for further research. These include Medicaid expansion, local health department expansion, state-paid insurance continuation, <b>revenue</b> <b>pool,</b> on-site medical teams and patient-imposed care limits. Because it is cost effective, prevention is emphasized by these programs. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2000. On October 1999 South Africa {{signed a}} {{historic}} TDCA with the European Union. The main {{objective of this}} agreement is to liberalise most trade {{between the two parties}} over time through a free trade agreement. Namibia as a member of SACU became automatically a de facto member of the SA-EU FTA. At the same time the EU concluded another 20 -year agreement with the ACP countries effectively changing its traditional trade relationship with these countries. Namibia also {{being a member of the}} ACP group of countries finds itself in the middle of these two agreements. South Africa and the EU however opted to leave some of the sectors that are considered sensitive out of the free trade agreement in order to mitigate some of the adjustment costs likely to be faced by lesser-developed partners in SACU such as Namibia. Beef is one of those sensitive sectors as it is the main Namibian agricultural export to both the EU and South Africa. The fisheries sector likewise contributes a lot to Namibia's export earnings and the fact South Africa and the EU are negotiating for a fisheries agreement could mean a change in Namibia's competitive position in this sector. The impact that these two agreements will have on the beef sector is not very significant or at least manageable at this stage. The impact on the fisheries sector is mainly uncertain at this stage in the absence of an EU-SA fisheries agreement. The major impact of the SA-EU FTA will be on government revenues, which rely heavily on receipts from the SACU common <b>revenue</b> <b>pool.</b> The SADC has also started its regional economic integration process, which the EU hopes to be a move towards a REPA with which it hopes to do business as part of the new Cotonou Agreement. However the vast disparities in economic development between the EU and SADC does not favour such a move. The benefits will most probably accrue to the EU and the costs to SADC countries, especially those countries that are not part of SACU. It is important that if the new Cotonou Agreement is to be mutually beneficial steps need to be taken to strengthen the industrial and export capacities of the ACP countries.

40|$|The $ 7 billion {{needed for}} the Federal Government to fund {{the last two years}} of the Gonski plan can be easily financed. The Government has a {{potential}} <b>revenue</b> <b>pool</b> of at least $ 34 billion a year by reducing several tax concessions to high income earners and by clamping down on rampant tax evasion by high income earners and large Australian and multinational corporations.

The funding needed to finance the average $ 3. 5 billion a year for each of {{the last two years of}} Gonski is only 10 % of the total tax revenue forgone annually. In addition, there are many more tax shelters that provide significant benefits to high income earners and corporations. The Turnbull Government should stop using the Budget deficit as an excuse not to fund the last two years of Gonski. Labor should stop dithering about committing to the plan it devised while in government. The fundamental question is whether the Turnbull Government (and the Labor Opposition) is prepared to make the rich and big business pay their fair share of tax and invest it in reducing disadvantage in education to improve the lives of the low income students, improve workforce skills and participation and increase productivity.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2000. The Trade, Development and Co-operation Agreement (TDCA) {{will create}} {{competitive}} challenges, threats and opportunities, driving out less efficient performers while bolstering more efficient enterprises and industries. This {{is in line}} with the general principles of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which promotes the reduction of trade barriers in order to liberate trade on a global basis. This dynamic process of adjustments will continue throughout the implementation of the European Union - South Africa Free Trade Agreement (EU-SA FTA) which is the main component of the TDCA. The European Union (EU) has historically been Southern Africa's most important trading partner. The main reason why South Africa entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU was to enhance exports to South Africa's largest export market, attract higher levels of investment from the EU, and gradually expose the South African industry to competition to ensure that it is restructured to become globally competitive. Since 1910 South Africa {{has been part of the}} Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which also comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BlNS). The EU-SA FTA will accordingly impact on trade relations between South Africa, the EU and the BLNS countries. Not only will SACU face increased competition from cheaper EU imports, but BLNS countries will also face reduced income from the common <b>revenue</b> <b>pool.</b> South Africa will have to remove a higher level of tariffs from a greater volume of imports than is the case for the EU. For the BLNS, the relative adjustment effort is even greater. The BLNS will have to adjust to the elimination of tariffs on 30 % of goods currently imported from the EU, while the TDCA will bring about no improvement in their current terms of access to the EU market. The BLNS products currently exported to the EU which are most likely to be affected by the EU-SA FTA are: clothing (Lesotho), preserved fish and flowers (Namibia), and grapefruit, processed pineapples, corned fruit and grapes (Swaziland). These products are under threat from South African products which can, as a result of the FTA, be exported to the EU at reduced tariffs. BLNS products which could be affected as a result of cheaper EU imports are: grain (Botswana, Namibia and Lesotho), chicken production (Swaziland), sugar (Swaziland), beef (Namibia and Botswana), and the small wheat-farming sector in Namibia and Botswana. The EU-SA FTA is further likely to have a substantial impact on South Africa's exports to the EU. The total increase in exports as a result of the FTA is estimated between 1. 3 % and 1. 4 % of the 1996 value of South Africa's exports to the EU. The main drive will come from industrial products which are less protected than agricultural products. The South African government, further, concluded that the negative effects of the direct costs to SACU would be outweighed, in the long term, by the dynamic and geopolitical benefits of an FTA with the EU. The signal that the South African government has given with signing the TDCA with the EU indicates that the Southern African economy should restructure itself to become internationally competitive. This is the only way to survive in a global trade arena which is under WTO principles becoming increasïngly more liberated...|$|E
