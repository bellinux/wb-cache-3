5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E

25|$|The <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{section of}} the city were a mixture of civilians and {{military}} personnel. In some cases, the cantonments of the troops were explicitly segregated {{from the rest of the}} populace.

Several bureaucrats, Abbasid princes and other personages also had allotments along the avenues.|$|E
25|$|The new {{ownership}} of 1520 Sedgwick {{is seen by}} public officials and housing advocates as a huge victory {{in the struggle to}} preserve affordable housing in New York City. It is a big step forward in the fight to rescue low income housing from the disastrous impact overleveraging has had on this vulnerable resource. The rescue of 1520 Sedgwick was largely made possible through a sustained organizing campaign within the tenant body. <b>Residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> iconic building fought for over 5 years to maintain the affordability of their home and rescue it from speculative landlords.|$|E

25|$|Swimming was {{not only}} a sport for the {{residents}} of Victorian East London, Eastern Cape, but due to periodic water shortages, sometimes a necessity. From 1873 the town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. These regulations were too conservative and constraining for the taste of the <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. The dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should wear suitable swimming costumes.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} negative externalities are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay. The Millennium Tower's, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has an extremely {{negative impact on the}} <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> building, who have spent millions of dollars to live in this building. In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E
25|$|The Crown {{considered}} {{the area of}} West Virginia {{to be part of}} the British Virginia Colony from 1607 to 1776. The United States considered this area to be the western part of the state of Virginia (which was commonly referred as Trans-Allegheny Virginia) from 1776 to 1863, before the formation of West Virginia. Its residents were discontented for years with their position in Virginia, as the government was dominated by the planter elite of the Tidewater and Piedmont areas. The legislature had electoral malapportionment, based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations, and the western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature. More subsistence and yeoman farmers lived in the west and they were generally less supportive of slavery, although many counties were divided on their support. The <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area became more sharply divided after the planter elite of eastern Virginia voted to secede from the Union during the Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|Hill was so {{impressed}} by the kindness showed {{to him by the}} <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> small community that he decided to place his Great Northern Railway there instead of in Caledonia.

2500|$|In 1978, {{the first}} group of members of the Healing Center and Church arrived from Mississippi began {{arriving}} in the community. [...] Initial interactions between the existing, mostly white residents and the entirely African American church members, were peaceful and friendly.

2500|$|The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CI0) was so {{impressed}} by the mutual housing program, and so frustrated by the inaction {{of the federal government}} in expanding it, that it obtained private financing to build a second mutual housing project next to Greenmont Village in Ohio. [...] This new project differed considerably from the original mutual housing concept however. [...] <b>Residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new project owned their own homes, forcing the project into the speculative housing market. The CIO believed that residents would not be inclined to sell out of the project because of the many advantages and benefits of being a member of a mutual housing corporation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} as to why this area did not remain {{at the forefront of}} technological and social development lies in the subsequent history of its geographical location. [...] At the end of the mostly peaceful Neolithic period, this area became a highway for invaders from the east moving into Europe. [...] By the time the historical written record begins to cover this area, it has already seen a number of invasions sweep over it, leaving social and political upheaval in their wake. [...] This trend was to continue on a fairly regular basis up until the 20th century. [...] With so much destruction, it was difficult for the <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area to recover from each successive invasion before encountering the next. [...] However, the few societies in this area that managed to survive for a while through these turbulent centuries left behind a culture and history that are rich and dramatic.|$|E
2500|$|Taoist alchemist Ge Hong, {{also known}} as Baopuzi (Êä±ÊâëÂ≠ê The [...] "Master Embracing Simplicity") {{was active in the}} third and fourth centuries and had great {{influence}} on later Taoism. Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The Shangqing (‰∏äÊ∏Ö [...] "Supreme Clarity") (365370) and Lingbao (ÈùàÂØ∂ [...] "Sacred Treasure") scriptures (397402) received at Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong's; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (ÂÖßËßÄ neiguan). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi's revelations consisted of visitations from the <b>residents</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> heaven (the [...] "Zhenren") many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhenren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, Tao Hongjing (456536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi's writings and allowed for the creation of Shangqing Taoism as a popular religion. The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as an emphasis on universal salvation.|$|E
