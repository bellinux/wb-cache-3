25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much closer}} to the epicenter, the states of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Michoacán {{suffered}} only mild to moderate damage. Landslides caused damage at Atenquique, Jalisco, and near Jala, Nayarit. Rockslides were reported along highways near Ixtapa, Guerrero, with sand volcanos and ground cracks in Lazaro Cardenas. Students at the Universidad de las Américas in nearby Puebla reported feeling as if the cafeteria had been lifted and <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> and forth, shattering windows and injuring some people but mostly causing panic. A small tsunami caused only mild damage to Lázaro Cárdenas and Zihuatanejo. Some fishing boats were reported missing but these reports were never confirmed. One exceptional case was in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco, where about 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 dead. Some damage also occurred as far away as the states of Mexico, Morelos and parts of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. Coastal and most inland damage was moderated by {{the fact that most of}} the west of Mexico sits on bedrock, which serves to transmit the shockwaves without amplifying them. La Villita, and Infiernillo Dams, near the coast, were superficially damaged and undamaged respectively.|$|E

500|$|Nicholas Lea {{was fitted}} with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene was horrible, and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later. The similar scene {{from the start of}} the episode with the {{submarine}} captain was accomplished with a dummy head. The depiction of the oil in this scene was originally filmed using a magnetic fluid pulled along with magnets, although the end result of this was deemed not be [...] "menacing" [...] enough, and looked [...] "a little bit comic". To fix this, the sound stage used to represent the submarine's interior was rebuilt so it could be <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> and forth, with the movement being used to guide the flow of a different liquid. This effect was then enhanced digitally in post-production. The black oil effect over people's eyes was accomplished by inserting the footage digitally in post production.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor's {{first scene}} in the episode is falling down the chimney and {{presenting}} himself to Kazran. Smith {{was pleased with the}} entrance of his character, noting similarities between the Doctor and Santa Claus. However, a stuntman performed the scene. For the scene in which a sky fish nibbles on the sonic screwdriver, the screwdriver was dangled in front of a greenscreen and tapped with a pen to create the effect of the fish nudging it. To maintain secrecy of the episode's plot, the model shark was given the codename [...] "Clive". The scenes in which the characters ride through the air in a sleigh pulled by one of the flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen. The sleigh was in fact a rickshaw which crew members <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> and forth as a wind machine created the effect of flying through the air. As it was impossible to film underneath the rickshaw, a miniature model of the sleigh was used for the shots underneath the sleigh rather than computer-generated effects.|$|E

60|$|In response, slowly, with utmost deliberation, as if {{the destiny}} of empires rested on the certitude of her act, she turned the saucer of coffee upside down on the table.

60|$|He {{threw himself}} upon {{his back and}} fairly wallowed at my feet; jumped up and sprang upon me, rolling me upon the ground by his great weight; then wriggling and squirming around me like a playful puppy {{presenting}} its back for the petting it craves. I could not resist the ludicrousness of the spectacle, and holding my sides I <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth in the}} first laughter which had passed my lips in many days; the first, in fact, since the morning Powell had left camp when his horse, long unused, had precipitately and unexpectedly bucked him off headforemost into a pot of frijoles.|$|E

They <b>rocked</b> <b>back</b> and forth in a slow and hopeless way, and regularly, once every five minutes, Ebbits emitted a low groan. It was not so much a groan of pain, as of pain-weariness. He was oppressed by the weight and the torment of this thing called life, and still more was he oppressed by the fear of death. His was that eternal tragedy of the aged, with whom the joy of life has departed and the instinct for death has not come.|$|E
