50|$|The knew-it-all-along {{effect is}} {{a variant of the}} {{hindsight}} bias. It is the tendency for people to misremember and think that they knew more in the past than they actually did. In such situations it is difficult for us to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> when we did not have an understanding of something. For example, one might have a hard time teaching a concept to another individual because they can not remember {{what it is like to}} not understand the material.|$|E

50|$|In March 2003, the Polish {{government}} {{announced that it}} would participate in a U.S.-led Iraq invasion and sent about 200 personnel. Poland also sent 54 soldiers in an elite GROM commando unit, a logistic support ship, ORP Kontradmirał Xawery Czernicki, with a FORMOZA navy commando unit, and 74 antichemical contamination troops. Polls showed that, as in other central and eastern European countries, the population was generally against the war, although not as strongly as in Spain, Italy, or the United Kingdom. One explanation given for this difference of opinion was that the populations of many of the central and Eastern European nations <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> living under Soviet Communist rule, which during stalinist times was comparable to Saddam's brutal Iraq regime.|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} {{suggests that}} adult (researchers) {{need to be}} cautious in their claims about understanding the world from a child's perspective. It is not claimed {{that there are no}} connections between these two worlds, but rather that they can be at once very connected and close and very far apart. This is a common theme in some literature which considers childhood. Ideas of the otherness of childhood have connections with some children's affinity with disordered spaces (those not managed and tidied by adult society) like waste ground in cities. They also have implications for trying to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to be a child as a form of research and knowing childhood. This is, at best, a highly complex and multifaceted process which, again, cannot be assumed to give easy access to children’s worlds. This question has raised some critical response within children's geographies (see Philo, 2003).|$|E

5000|$|... "Nurses Ball was {{something}} I {{wanted to do}} from the minute I got there. After I met with every actor I got to {{know who they were}} not only as an actor, but what their other talents were. I remember thinking, 'Geez, these people can do so much more.' So I always wanted to show off their talents beyond acting. And we did that with Claire. She loved the idea and embraced it totally! It worked for her storytelling in so many ways. Plus we got to really 'put on a show.' The work was hard, but everyone loved doing it. The actors, the entire cast, staff, and crew, all loved it." [...] —Wendy Riche on introducing the annual Nurses' Ball. April 1994 marked the first annual Nurses' Ball, a fundraiser for HIV and AIDS awareness both within the storyline and in real life. Lucy Coe, played by Lynn Herring, founded the event. There was significant social impact, one reason being the current status of the disease. Herring recalled in a 2001 interview with USA Today, [...] "Looking back on {{the early days of the}} Nurses Ball, we all <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> for people with HIV or AIDS in the early '90s, and it wasn't very encouraging. We all knew people who had died or were dying from the disease, the days before protease inhibitors and anti-viral 'cocktails' compassion was about all we had to offer, but it was sometimes in short supply." [...] The story featured the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, as well as coincided with the Day of Compassion, an annual day where all participating soap operas featured HIV or AIDS related topics.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{the more}} South Korea feels {{superior}} and confident to North Korea, the more spy films become more polished and vary {{into a form}} of “anti-North Korean film.” Korean films which did not criticize the North Korean elite, acting as extensions of the people’s government and participatory government’s Sunshine Policy, regressed to the lineage of past traditional “anticommunist films,” criticizing the North Korean elite and viewing the North Korean people used as their pawns with pity after the incoming of conservatives into power and the third generation of North Korean succession. On the contrary, if past “anticommunist films” treated the North Korean people {{as part of the}} same nation on the basis of homogeneity, the new “anticommunist films” today pity and tolerate them from the gaze of a victor from a fundamentally different existence. With {{the number of people who}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> before division and those carrying the pain of separated families decreasing, the awareness of unification by the younger generation who enjoyed accelerated economic wealth after division weakening, and the decline of nationalism as an ideology and the poverty of logic behind unification in this age, the viewpoint of North Korea in popular culture is playing a role in strengthening the 38 th parallel in our minds.|$|E

40|$|According to UNESCO estimates, {{there are}} {{approximately}} one billion {{people in the world}} who can neither read nor write. One sixth of the world population has never seen a schoolbook. In contrast, reading and writing in the industrialized nations are such commonplace objects of everyday life that they are completely taken for granted. We are taught to read and write at school, where we gain access to the cultural tool ofwriting, and it is this that forms the basis for all our further leaming activities. The teaching aids used in schools to impart us the skills of literacy are themselves based on the medium of writing. We can all <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> to write things down on paper and in exercise books, to organize our notes in files, and to read up new information in text books. By teaching literacy to the individual, the schools as an institution are laying the foundation stone of literacy skills for entire societies. Many important developmental stages of this process in Europe took place in the Middle Ages, and the schools functioned as a dual participating force in this process. First of all, they were the institution in which competence in literacy was acquired, and they were themselves involved in leaming how best to communicate this task with the aid of the instruments of literacy. These tools, as employed in the schools, have undergone transformation over the centuries. Schoolbooks themselves have also had to adapt, to cope with the demands of literacy...|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{complications}} {{related to}} unsafe abortion account {{for at least}} one in seven maternal deaths world-wide. Nearly all of these deaths occur in developing countries and most are preventable. The authors argue that to prevent abortion-related deaths, all women must have access to safe abortion and contraceptive services, and they discuss the strategies used to prevent abortion-related deaths— preventing unwanted pregnancy, pre-venting abortion, preventing unsafe abortion, and treating abortion com-plications. Some of these strategies have been effective, while others have failed. Preventing unwanted preg-nancy is a very important starting point, but evidence suggests that it alone cannot solve the problems of abortion-related deaths. Efforts to prevent abortion, whether through legal or cultural sanctions, do not significantly reduce the number of abortions, and may even increase mortality. The technology to perform safe abortions is available, but remains underused. Finally, even under the best of circumstances, women will experience abortion complications (induced or sponta-neous) and only through the prompt and effective treatment of these and other obstetric complications will deaths be averted. Many women in this country <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> before abortion was legalized in 1973 —the dread of a “missed period, ” the horror stories (often true) about women who drank caustic liquids, women who aborted themselves with coat hangers, women who developed terrible infections after visiting back alley abortionists, women who died. For us, those bad old days are virtually gone, but they are still here for {{more than one-third of the}} world’s women who live in countries where abortion is either completely illegal, or legal in very narrow circumstances. In this article we will describe both the extent of maternal mortality in developing countries and the important role that abortion can play in keeping maternal mortality high, as well as the strategies for reducing abortion-related mortality in developing countries...|$|E
