50|$|In the {{carriage}} of goods by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The bill of lading (transport document used almost exclusively for {{carriage of goods}} by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee that acts as a receipt of transfer of goods and as a negotiable instrument. The bill of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the consignee of damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership of the goods until the bill of lading is transferred to the consignee. Most bills of lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and Hamburg Rules. These rules impose minimum <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> that cannot be softened by contract. On the other hand, the United States and the United Kingdom adopted the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).|$|E

Whereas, as opposed to the framework of civil liability governed by diverse domestic rules, exclusively a standard regulation framed at an inter-state level can secure a uniform system of state liability.

Second, the primary concern of the WIM should be compensatory justice. In case of climate L&D, three aspects of compensatory justice should be kept separate: corrective liability, remedial responsibility, and with regard to the resources available, fair remedy. Third, it is crucial to distinguish between recov-erable damage and irrecoverable or at least not fully recoverable loss. This distinction is crucial because it informs the principles of fair remedy and because damage and loss may differ in their relevance for the stability and functioning of a human system...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines dynamics {{associated with}} new representational technologies in complex organizations through {{a study of}} the use of a Single Model Environment, prototyping and simulation tools in the mega-project to construct Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport, London. The ambition of the client, BAA. was to change industrial practices reducing project costs and time to delivery through new contractual arrangements and new digitally-enabled collaborative ways of working. The research highlights changes over time and addresses two areas of 'turbulence' in the use of: 1) technologies, where there is a dynamic tension between desires to constantly improve, change and update digital technologies and the need to standardise practices, maintaining and defending the overall integrity of the system; and 2) representations, where dynamics result from the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> associated with sharing of digital representations and a lack of trust in the validity of data from other firms. These dynamics are tracked across three stages of this well-managed and innovative project and indicate the generic need to treat digital infrastructure as an ongoing strategic issue...|$|E

40|$|Project alliancing {{involves}} the active collaboration of construction project owners and non owner participants (designer, contractors, and suppliers) to deliver projects {{in an atmosphere}} of shared <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Alliancingcon notes integration but in real practice, it fails to create a true alliance environment since only part of the value chain (owner, designer, main contractor) is considered for integration. Consequently subcontractors are very often left out of the key alliance. Therefore this study identifies improvement areas to current alliance practice and suggests changes that will permit critical sub-contracting processes to be integrated into a project’s main alliance. To achieve this objective the research follows a comparative study approach. Information obtained from relevant literature is used to identify current subcontractor management practices and best practices for subcontractor integration in alliances. A case study of an alliance project is used to identify improvement areas in subcontractor management practices in an alliance environment. From these findings, the study proposes a revised alliance framework that integrates subcontractors from the early stages in alliance contracts, thus enabling the realisation of benefits accruable to projects through early contractor involvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} patient record (EPR) {{is a major}} {{technological development}} within the healthcare sector. Many hospitals across Europe already use institution-based electronic patient records, which allow not only for electronic exchange of patient data within the hospital, but potentially also for sharing medical data with external healthcare providers, involved in the patient's care, such as general practitioners or pharmacists. In this article, we discuss the attempt made by the Dutch government to introduce a nationwide electronic patient record (n-EPR). Describing and analyzing the new legislation that is currently being developed to establish the infrastructure for the n-EPR and the related legal issues, we conclude that {{the introduction of a}} n-EPR give rise to some substantial concerns. These vary from technical and quality issues such as the reliability of patient data and sufficient standardization and interoperability of the systems used, to issues in the field of data security and confidentiality. For a successful introduction of the n-EPR within the healthcare sector, a condicio sine qua non is that the related legislation provides sufficient safeguards and clarity with respect to the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of its main users: the healthcare professional...|$|E

This project attempts to address those problems by creating a well-defined lesson plan and syllabus for teaching student newspaper production at San Diego City College, a public community college in southern California. The plan proposes a teaching method which attempts to meet two seemingly diverse goals: 1) to satisfy to whatever extent possible both student and administrative concerns regarding Constitutionally guaranteed press freedoms, <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> and 2) to create a positive educational experience which enables students to prepare for success in professional journalism careers.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the rights and {{liabilities}} arising under English and Chinese law in respect of the carriage of dangerous cargo. It is noted that the danger in dangerous cargoes was not necessarily something in the goods themselves, but might well lie {{in the way they}} were packaged, looked after or transported. Accordingly, the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the various parties with regards to the carriage of dangerous cargoes are usually intertwined and complex. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the dangerous cargoes liabilities in English and Chinese law, by providing suggestions for existing problems in each country based on three sources: contract, tort and statute. Moreover, the chain of causation and concept of remoteness has particular importance in order to establish liability and decide which type and what amount of damage is recoverable. This thesis compares both countries’ liability regimes and how to secure compensation for its victims, and the restoration of the environment, with reference to the EU Environmental Liability Directive and relevant international conventions. The author draws her final conclusions from four important issues: (1) the meaning of dangerous cargo, the packing and handling; (2) the scheme of liability; (3) the channelling of liability; and (4) the type of recoverable damage.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the subject of}} {{analysis}} is semantic links of the concepts <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> to other categories of ethics. When analysing semantic links of the concepts <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> to other categories of ethics, {{the aim is to}} ascertain the synonymy of the abovementioned concepts. The concept responsibility is most frequently used when a certain human feature is under discussion, <b>and</b> the concept <b>liability</b> – when the observance of legal requirements, a legal norm is under discussion. The conception of responsibility is the underlying category of ethics and law. It is close to concepts ”conscience”, “obligation”, “diligence”, „dignity“, and is related to the emotional reaction to do one’s duty. Responsibility manifests when a human being takes responsibility for own independent and sovereign actions. The concept liability made of the adverb liable is more often found in different texts than the concept responsibility, which describes a feature. It is the most general moral feature of a personality, which stimulates a careful action when doing own duties. Liability manifests as selfcontrol mechanism of a person. It implies a person‘s relationship to moral obligation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose in}} writing {{this paper is}} to {{highlight}} the lack of knowledge of many who are involved in capacity assessments, especially non-professionals such as carers of the learning disabled, and the view that current guidance for capacity assessments {{does not take into account}} issues of emotionality. Design/methodology/approach – The approach is to discuss current guidance and practice, and to offer academic criticism and explanation. Findings – The findings include the discovery that the Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice suggests that healthcare professionals and family/carers may undertake assessments of decision-making capacity, yet the guidance it provides for their doing so overlooks salient issues. Many of those involved in the daily lives of those, who may lack decision-making capacity (and thus be seen as legally incompetent) such as the learning disabled, demented, mentally ill and neurodiverse, must decide whether to respect their decisions as competent, or to disregard the decisions on the grounds of incompetence and to act in the person's best interests. As many will lack training in their clinical and legal <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities,</b> it is crucial that they, and those they care for, are protected by not only an increased knowledge of mental capacity legislation and practice, but also how it may apply to questions of emotionality and neurodiversity.
