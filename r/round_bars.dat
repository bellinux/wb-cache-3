50|$|The c. 150 torcs {{found in}} the lands of the Iberian Celts of Galicia favoured {{terminals}} ending in balls coming to a point or small buffer ("pears"), or a shape with a double moulding called scotiae. The pointed ball {{is also found in}} northern Italy, where the hoops often end by being turned back upon themselves so that the terminals face out to the sides, perhaps enabling closure by hooking round. Both of these mostly used plain <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> or thin rods wound round a core. In the terminals of British torcs loops or rings are common, and the main hoop may be two or more <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> twisted together, or several strands each made up of twisted wire. Decoration of the terminals in the finest examples is complex but all abstract. In these two types the hoop itself normally has no extra decoration, though the large torc in the Irish Broighter Gold hoard is decorated all round the hoop, the only Irish example decorated in this way.|$|E

40|$|Creating a more {{efficient}} reinforcement for Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) Walls {{is important because it}} will reduce the amount of material needed to construct MSE walls, and will reduce overall construction costs for companies and contractors. This thesis explores four main geometries of metallic crimped and metallic crossbar type reinforcement constructed with both, smooth steel and # 4 rebar steel. Metal <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> was chosen because, compared to metallic rectangular strip reinforcements, there is less surface area in contact with the soil which will then reduce the amount of corrosion loses. Throughout testing, it was found that crimped metal <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> was able to produce the required pullout resistance but created too much extensibility (the amount of length the crimps straightened). The reinforcement made with crossbars and metal <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> were found to produce the required amount of pullout resistance with little to no extensibility...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{productivity}} and quality of <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> products, the finishing area of the <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> mill was revamped at Kobe Works, Kobe Steel Ltd. in 2011. Various pieces of equipment were newly installed, such as a high-speed rotary straightener, a magnetic leakage flux testing system and an ultrasonic testing system. Among them, the straightener was the key device and was expected to soon be in actual operation. In addition, {{it was necessary for}} this straightener to correct the <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> shape of the product, widening its diameter from 17 to 80 mm more than the conventional one. To decide the proper setting of the roll gap, the roll skew angle and the rotation speed of the top and bottom rolls of the straightener, a simple 3 -point bending model was applied, and the inside of the working straightener was observed by an infrared camera. This paper describes the synergistic effect of the above mentioned three straightening factors and the applied result of these straightening conditions in actual operation...|$|R

Members of the industry began to organize the Institute, and in 1928 the first standard specifications were adopted, followed in 1929 by the first load table. The joists covered by these early standards were later identified as open web steel joists, SJ-Series.|$|E

Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned <b>round</b> <b>bars,</b> two or more bars twisted together, thin round rods (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire.

5000|$|Most Achaemenid torcs {{are thin}} single <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> with {{matching}} animal heads as the terminals, {{facing each other}} at the front.

Later Celtic torcs nearly all return to having a break at the throat and strong emphasis on the two terminals. The Vix torc has two very finely made winged horses standing on fancy platforms projecting sideways just before the terminals, which are flattened balls under lions' feet.
