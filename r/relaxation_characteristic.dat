40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigate}} analytically the process of velocity and energy relaxation in two-phase flows. We begin our exposition by considering the so-called six equations two-phase model [42, 65]. This model assumes each phase to possess its own velocity and energy variables. Despite recent advances, the six equations model remains computationally expensive for many practical applications. Moreover, its advection operator may be non-hyperbolic which poses additional theoretical diffi-culties to construct robust numerical schemes [35]. In order to simplify this system, we complete momentum and energy conservation equations by relaxation terms. When <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> time tends to zero, velocities and energies are con-strained to tend to common values for both phases. As a result, we obtain a simple two-phase model which was recently proposed for simulation of violent aerated flows [25]. The preservation of invariant regions and incompressible limit of the simplified model are also discussed. Finally, several numerical results are presented.

In this approach, the steady-state value, Vs, of the voltage <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> which is observed when a high-voltage ramp is applied in the reverse direction to a point contact diode, is related to the resistivity of the epitaxial wafer.

40|$|The {{influence}} of tonic inspiratory muscle {{activity on the}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the chest wall, rib cage (RC), and abdominal wall (ABW) has been investigated in four highly trained subjects. Chest wall shape and volume were estimated with magnetometers. Pleural pressure (Pes) and abdominal pressure were measured with esophageal and gastric balloons, respectively. Subjects were seated reclining 30 degrees from upright, and respiratory muscle weakness was produced by pancuronium bromide until RC inspiratory capacity was decreased to 60 % of control. Only minor changes were observed for Konno-Mead <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristics</b> (RC vs. ABW) between control and paralysis. Similarly, although RC relaxation curves (RC vs. Pes) during paralysis were significantly different from control (P less than 0. 05), the changes were small and not consistent. The differences between paralysis-induced changes in resting end-expiratory position of the chest wall and helium-dilution functional residual capacity (FRC) suggested changes in volume of blood within the chest wall. We conclude that 1) although tonic inspiratory activity of chest wall muscles exists, it does not significantly affect the chest wall <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristics</b> in trained subjects; 2) submaximal paralysis produced by pancuronium bromide is likely to modify either spinal attitude or the distribution of blood between extremities and the thorax; these effects {{may account for the}} changes in FRC in other studies.

THEORY AND METHODS: The technique builds upon the inhomogeneous MT (ihMT) technique that is particularly sensitive to tissue components with long T 1 D. A standard ihMT experiment was altered to introduce a variable time for switching between positive and negative offset frequencies for RF saturation. A model for the dependence of ihMT was developed and used to fit data acquired in vivo. RESULTS: Application of the method to images from brains of healthy volunteers produced values of T 1 D [*]=[*](5. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 2) ms in gray matter and T 1 D [*]=[*](6. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 4) ms in white matter regions and provided maps of the T 1 D parameter.

40|$|One of {{the general}} {{mechanisms}} that {{gives rise to the}} slow cooperative <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> of classical glasses is the presence of kinetic constraints in the dynamics. Here we show that dynamical constraints can similarly lead to slow thermalisation and metastability in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems. We illustrate this general idea by considering two simple models: (i) a one-dimensional quantum analogue to classical constrained lattice gases where excitation hopping is constrained by the state of neighbouring sites, mimicking excluded volume interactions of dense fluids; and (ii) fully packed quantum dimers on the square lattice. Both models have a Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point at which kinetic and potential energy constants are equal. To one side of the RK point, where kinetic energy dominates, thermalisation is fast. To the other, where potential energy dominates, thermalisation is slow; memory of initial conditions persists for long times, and separation of timescales leads to pronounced metastability before eventual thermalisation. Furthermore, in analogy with what occurs in the relaxation of classical glasses, the slow thermalisation regime displays dynamical heterogeneity as manifested by spatially segregated growth of entanglement.

This study employed stress relaxation technique to investigate the effects of three solvents, namely, decalin (cycloparaffin), n-decane (normal paraffin), and ShellSol T solvent (isoparaffins) on O-rings made from different materials. Results indicated that both fluorosilicone and fluorocarbon O-rings showed excellent compatibility with all 25 blends tested. The stress <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> of nitrile O-ring was highly dependent on {{the composition of the}} solvents; the more decalin (n-decane) is in the blend, the better (worse) its sealing performance becomes. Effects of the three solvents presented in the tests indicated aromatics are not the only compounds that can swell nitrile O-ring. It is also important to notice that although decalin presents good O-ring swelling ability, it does not mean all cycloparaffins have the same property. n-decane also showed certain O-ring swelling ability but its main effect during the polymer-fuel interaction process is to extract materials out of nitrile O-ring.

The XRD pattern shows that Mn–V oxide is multiphase and quantitative phase analysis was performed to determine the relative phases. Overall results indicate that with increasing temperature, the DC conductivity, AC conductivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss factor and loss tangent of Mn–V mixed oxide increases. Activation energy of AC conduction decreases with increase in frequency, confirms that the hopping conduction is the dominant mechanism. The activation energy of DC conduction ΔEdc is 0. 54 eV which is greater than ΔEdc. There are three types of dielectric constant spectrum found in the measuring temperature range 30 – 250 °C.

Four of the subjects deformed their RC to a more elliptical shape during loaded inspirations; RC anteroposterior diameter became smaller and RC lateral diameter became larger. The RC deformation increased as the load increased, but it appeared to be independent {{of the nature of the}} load. Moreover these deformations were associated with a marked increase in the inspiratory activity of the intercostals situated in the lateral parts of the RC and a striking diminution of the activity in the parasternal area. On the other hand, two subjects invariably breathed along their RC <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic,</b> and they showed an increased inspiratory activity in all regions of the intercostal musculature. These findings indicate that 1) the pattern of RC deformation during loaded inspirations is closely related to the activity and coordination of the various inspiratory intercostal muscles, and 2) the parasternal intercostals are not necessarily representative of all the inspiratory intercostals.

The equilibrium state of the spongelike membrane is instantaneously perturbed, and the kinetic response is monitored using a multi-angle light scattering setup. These measurements yield a time-dependent scattering intensity {{as a function of}} temperature, scattering vector q, and concentration. We observed a single-exponential <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> time, tau(m). The q dependence of the scattering amplitude shows an Omstein-Zernike behavior, but we can identify two concentration regimes with respect to the relaxation behavior.

At the intermediate concentrations, there is a transition from the q-independent to the q(- 2) dependence behavior. Analysis from each concentration regime reveals distinct differences in the dependence of tau(m) on temperature and concentration, with an extraordinarily strong concentration dependence of tau(m) (tau(m) approximate to Phi(- 9)) in the low concentration regime and a temperature dependence corresponding to a formal Arrhenius activation energy of 720 kJ/mol or 275 kT...|$|E

Only one relaxation process similar to that of the primary (or alpha-) <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristic</b> of glass-forming materials is found, but there is no indication of any observable secondary relaxation within the resolution of our experimental setup. The alpha-process can reasonably be described by a Havriliak-Negami (HN) shape function throughout the frequency range. However, in the case of PCNB the dielectric strength (Delta epsilon) of the above said alpha-process does not change appreciably with temperature, though interestingly, a small addition of a dopant such as pentachlorobenzene (PCB), trichlorobenzene (TCB), and chloroadamantane (CLADM) to the molten state of PCNB drastically lowers the dielectric strength by a factor of 4 to 8. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements at room temperature and DSC data do not indicate any appreciable change in the crystalline structure. It is noticed that the effect of PCB as a dopant on the magnitude of alpha-process of CNADM is moderate, whereas both PCB and TCB as dopants show a much reduced effect on the relaxation in DCTMB and TCTMB. It is suggested that the drastic changes in the dielectric strength of the alpha-process is due to the rotational hindrance caused by the presence of a small number of dopant molecules in the host crystalline lattice.

The purpose of the conductive filler is to increase the dielectric properties of the polymer composite. The carbon composition the CS and SCB was determine through carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur (CHNS) elemental analysis whereas the structural morphology of CS and SCB particles was examined by using scanning electron microscope. Room temperature open-ended coaxial line method was used to determine the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor over broad band frequency range of 200 MHz- 20 GHz. Based on this study, the results found that CS and SCB contain 48 % and 44 % of carbon, which is potentially useful to be used as conductive elements in the polymer composite. From SEM morphology, presence of irregular shape particles (size ≈ 200 μm) and macroporous structure (size ≈ 2. 5 μm) were detected on CS and SCB.

The Fourier transform of the nutation curve, which is obtained by plotting the signal amplitude {{as a function of}} the rf field application time, yields separate bands corresponding to the components of the unresolved composite signal. This can be only achieved if these components possess different <b>relaxation</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This new method is applied to the study of water in clays...|$|R
