500|$|At the German Grand Prix in July, Red Bull Racing were {{referred}} to race stewards after FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer noted that their engine maps {{had the potential to}} violate the technical regulations. Red Bull stood accused of manipulating the relationship between the torque produced by the Red Bull RB8 {{and the degree to which}} the throttle was open – particularly in medium-speed corners – thereby allowing more air to pass through the exhaust and over the diffuser, generating more downforce. Red Bull were cleared of wrongdoing, as, in the stewards' words, they had not technically broken any rules, but the FIA announced plans to rewrite the regulations governing throttle mapping so as to outlaw the practice entirely ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix one week later. The rule changes required teams to submit an engine map used during one of the first four races of the season, which became known as the [...] "reference map". Any subsequent changes to the throttle map would require the approval of the FIA, provided that the torque output above 6,000 rpm was within two percent of the output specified on the <b>reference</b> <b>map.</b> Further changes would be allowed at races with [...] "exceptional atmospheric conditions", as designated by the FIA.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{separate}} techniques, such as 2D PAGE, are limitd in {{that they}} cannot handle very high or low molecular weight protein species. [...] Alternative methods {{have been developed to}} deal with such cases. [...] These include liquid chromatography mass spectrometry along with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry run in multiple dimensions. [...] Compared to simple 2D page, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry can handle a larger range of protein species size, but it is limited in the amount of protein sample it handle at once. [...] Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is also limited in its lack of a <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> from which to work with. [...] Complex algorithms are usually used to analyze the fringe results that occur after a procedure is run. [...] The unknown portions of the protein species are usually not analyzed in favor of familiar proteomes, however. [...] This fact reveals a fault with current technology; new techniques are needed to increase both the specificity and scope of proteome mapping.|$|E

The Terra + Aqua MODIS and Terra MODIS LAI retrieved by the main algorithm and GEOV 1 LAI within the valid range were evaluated and intercompared using LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> to assess their uncertainty and seasonal variability The results showed that GEOV 1 LAI is the most similar product with the LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> (R 2 = 0. 78 and RMSE = 0. 59). The MODIS products performed well for biomes with low LAI values, but considerable uncertainty arose when the LAI was larger than 3. Terra + Aqua MODIS (R 2 = 0. 72 and RMSE = 0. 68) was slightly more accurate than Terra MODIS (R 2 = 0. 57 and RMSE = 0. 90) for producing slightly more successful observations. Both MODIS and GEOV 1 products effectively followed the seasonal trajectory of the <b>reference</b> <b>maps,</b> and GEOV 1 exhibited a smoother seasonal trajectory than MODIS. MODIS anomalies mainly occurred during summer and likely occurred because of surface reflectance uncertainty, shorter temporal resolutions and inconsistency between simulated and MODIS surface reflectances. This study suggests that further improvements of the MODIS LAI products should focus on finer algorithm inputs and improved seasonal variation modeling of MODIS observations. Future field work considering finer biome maps and better generation of LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> is still needed...|$|R

50|$|A linear {{positive}} functional on a C*-algebra {{is absolutely}} continuous {{with respect to}} another such (called reference) functional if it is zero on any positive element on which the reference positive functional is zero. This leads to a noncommutative generalization of Radon-Nikodym theorem. The usual density operator of states on the matrix algebras {{with respect to the}} standard trace is nothing but the Radon-Nikodym derivative when the reference functional is chosen to be trace. Belavkin introduced the notion of complete absolute continuity of one completely positive map with respect to another (<b>reference)</b> <b>map</b> and proved an operator variant of the noncommutative Radon-Nikodym theorem for completely positive maps. A particular case of this theorem corresponding to a tracial completely positive <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> on the matrix algebras leads to the Choi operator as a Radon-Nikodym derivative of a CP map with respect to the standard trace (see Choi's Theorem).|$|E

40|$|Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an {{important}} parameter of vegetation structure. A number of moderate resolution LAI products have been produced in urgent need of large scale vegetation monitoring. High resolution LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> are necessary to validate these LAI products. This study used a geostatistical regression (GR) method to estimate LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> by linking in situ LAI and Landsat TM/ETM+ and SPOT-HRV data over two cropland and two grassland sites. To explore the discrepancies of employing different vegetation indices (VIs) on estimating LAI <b>reference</b> <b>maps,</b> this study established the GR models for different VIs, including difference vegetation index (DVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI). To further assess {{the performance of the}} GR model, the results from the GR and Reduced Major Axis (RMA) models were compared. The results show that the performance of the GR model varies between the cropland and grassland sites. At the cropland sites, the GR model based on DVI provides the best estimation, while at the grassland sites, the GR model based on DVI performs poorly.

40|$|Using a {{combination}} of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) protein mapping and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we have established proteome <b>reference</b> <b>maps</b> of Medicago truncatula embryogenic tissue culture cells. The cultures were generated from single protoplasts, which provided a relatively homogenous cell population. We used these to analyze protein expression at the globular stages of somatic embryogenesis, which is the earliest morphogenetic embryonic stage. Over 3000 proteins could reproducibly be resolved over a pI range of 4 - 11. Three hundred and twelve protein spots were extracted from colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained 2 -DE gels and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight MS analysis and tandem MS sequencing. This enabled the identification of 169 protein spots representing 128 unique gene products using a publicly available expressed sequence tag database and the MASCOT search engine.

50|$|Choi's {{result is}} a {{particular}} case of noncommutative Radon-Nikodym theorem for completely positive (CP) maps corresponding to a tracial completely positive <b>reference</b> <b>map</b> on the matrix algebras. In strong operator form this general theorem was proven by Belavkin in 1985 who showed {{the existence of the}} positive density operator representing a CP map which is completely absolutely continuous with respect to a reference CP map. The uniqueness of this density operator in the reference Steinspring representation simply follows from the minimality of this representation. Thus, Choi's operator is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a finite-dimensional CP map with respect to the standard trace.|$|E
