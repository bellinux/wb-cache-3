500|$|In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how evil {{could exist}} in a good universe, Chrysippus replied [...] "evil cannot be removed, nor is it well {{that it should be}} removed." [...] Firstly, he argued, {{following}} Plato, that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness. Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows. Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole. Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the comedy; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, [...] "so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use." ...|$|E

[...] In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer.

500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{finally decided}} to seek the Democratic {{nomination}} in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter, {{a member of his}} own party. A midsummer 1978 poll had shown Democrats preferring Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. During spring and summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28percent approval rating, saying publicly: [...] "If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass." [...] Carter later asserted that Kennedy's constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter; Carter's approval rating slipped to 19percent. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall. He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "Why {{do you want to be}} President?" [...] during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier. The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy's campaign out of the headlines.|$|E

In the song's second half, the theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced, particularly in the lines [...] "I have no compass / And I have no map".

500|$|However, Leonard Strong, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle {{and others}} have argued that Joyce, later in life, {{reconciled}} with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, Hugh Kenner and T. S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses, is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "When did you leave the Catholic Church", Joyce answered, [...] "That's for the Church to say." [...] Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen's much noted non-serviam is qualified—"I will not serve that which I no longer believe...", and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephen's [...] "I am a servant..." [...] and Molly's [...] "yes". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Sacred Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance {{and that he did}} not seek to dissuade them.
