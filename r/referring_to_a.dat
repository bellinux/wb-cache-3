5|$|In {{the written}} {{language}} {{and more recently}} also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, sima and nikuu can be used together with adverbials <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular time in the past. That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E
5|$|During the 1860s {{the stage}} magician John Nevil Maskelyne exposed the {{trickery}} of the Davenport brothers. Wallace {{was unable to}} accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods, and stated that Maskelyne possessed supernatural powers. However, {{in one of his}} writings Wallace dismissed Maskelyne, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lecture exposing his tricks.|$|E
5000|$|In current British and Pakistan usage, a {{wardrobe}} {{can also be}} built-in, and the words [...] "cupboard" [...] or [...] "walk-in-wardrobe" [...] can be used <b>to</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> closet. In Elizabethan and Middle English, closet <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger room {{in which a person}} could sit and read in private but now <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small room in general.In Indian usage, <b>a</b> closet often <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> toilet. This probably originated from the word water closet, which <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> flush toilet.|$|R

50|$|The word 'kauna'oa' may <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few {{different}} things, any {{of which}} may have been why native Hawaiians named this beach so: the first definition <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> thin, orange vine with yellow flowers, (Cuscuta sandwichiana), which is found throughout most Hawai'i (this is the official lei vine of Lanai). However, the second definition <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mollusk (Vermetidae), and <b>a</b> third definition <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tough seaweed (Galaxaura rugosa).|$|R
5|$|Rumours also {{surfaced}} in 1900, after Albert Victor's death, of {{his association with}} another former Gaiety girl, Maude Richardson (birth name: Louisa Lancey), and that the royal family had attempted to pay her off. In 2002, letters purported to have been sent by Albert Victor to his solicitor <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> payoff made to Richardson of £200 were sold at Bonhams auction house in London. Owing to discrepancies in the dates and spelling of the letters, one historian has suggested they could be forgeries.|$|E
5|$|Such {{names have}} {{remained}} in use through tradition, each <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs {{in addition to the}} ancient City of London. The City of London is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey. However, the Widnes promontory is not particularly wide and another possible explanation is the first part derives from the Danish ved, meaning a wood and possibly <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tree-covered promontory. Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E
50|$|When {{diagnosing}} a sinus infection, one {{can identify}} which sinus cavity the infection {{is located in}} by the term given to the cavity. Ethmoiditis <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infection in the ethmoid sinus cavity/ies, frontal sinusitis <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infection occurring in the frontal sinus cavity/ies, antritis is used <b>to</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infection in the maxillary sinus cavity/ies whilst spenoiditis <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infection in the sphenoid sinus cavity/ies.|$|R

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet. Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 13thcentury, congregatio generalis ("general assembly") convoked by the monarchs or their representatives became an {{important}} organ of court system. For instance, the general assembly convoked in 1279 by Ladislaus IV for seven counties –among them Bihor, Crasna, Sătmar, and Zărand in the territory what is now Romania– ended with sentencing a despotic person to death. The first charter <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general assembly of the Transylvanian counties was recorded in 1288. A general assembly of the Transylvanian nobles, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians was convoked personally by the monarch in 1291.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

5|$|The current {{construction}} of the al-Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in Palestine. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell, <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> testimony by Arculf, a Gallic monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes {{the possibility that the}} second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Umar ibn al-Khattab, erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Mu'awiyah I, and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a garden at Little Moreton Hall comes from an early 17th-century set of household accounts <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gardener and the purchase of some seeds. Philip Moreton, who ran the estate for his older brother Edward in the mid-17th century, left {{a considerable amount of}} information on the layout and planting of the area of garden within the moat, {{to the west of the}} house. He writes of a herb garden, vegetable garden, and a nursery for maturing fruit trees until they were ready to be transferred to the orchard at the south and east of the house, probably where the orchard is today.|$|E
5|$|The name first {{appears in}} Saxon {{charters}} in around AD 880 as Cantuctun and two centuries {{later in the}} Domesday Book as Cantoctona and Cantetone. The name means settlement by a rim or circle of hills; Cantuc is Celtic for a rim or circle, and -ton or -tun is Old English for a settlement. The highest point of the hills is called Will's Neck meaning ridge of the Welshman, probably <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> time when the hills marked {{the boundary between the}} expanding Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the lands of the Britons or 'Welsh' to the West. A battle was fought locally at that time.|$|E
5000|$|The Standard Point Location Code® (SPLC™) is a 9 digit {{geographic}} code used by North American transportation industries, especially rail. SPLC {{is owned}} and {{maintained by the}} National Motor Freight Traffic Association. SPLC exist for terminals within the United States, Canada, and Mexico. For the US and Canada, the first two digits <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> state, province or territory. The second two digits <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> county or its equivalent. The third two digits <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> city or municipal region. The remaining three digits <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific location within the city.

5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while {{constituent}} quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by trying to run up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E
