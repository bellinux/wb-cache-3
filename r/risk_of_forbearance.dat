40|$|How banks {{should be}} {{regulated}} in periods of intense financial innovation? Is traditional risk-weighted capital regulation sufficient {{or should we}} consider regulatory interference {{in the form of}} restrictions to the scope of bank’s activities? To enforce regulations should we rely on discretion or should we impose rules that constrain the regulators? These questions are motivated both by the severe governance problems that arise because of the power of bankers and by the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> supervisory <b>forbearance.</b> These questions are particularly important in periods of changing economic environment and financial innovations which tend to make banks’ investment more opaque. To answer them, we develop a model where a bank’s investment decision is non-contractible, with the option to limit effort and engage in an inferior investment project. We show, first, that a regulation that restricts the scope of bank investments is of interest only when the bank engages in opaque projects in the presence of moral hazard. Second, we show how capital regulation may erode a bank’s rents and deprive it of a sufficient incentive to monitor its project. Finally we show under what conditions there is an advantage We acknowledge funding from the Italian Ministry of University and Research, and jointly from the Italian an...|$|R

40|$|Forbearance is a {{practice}} of granting concessions to troubled borrowers, typically {{in the form of}} prolongation of maturity of refinancing of the loan. While economically useful in some circumstances, it can be used by banks {{in order to reduce the}} need for provisions and conceal potential losses. If forbearance is widespread in the banking system, it may result in systemic risk, increasing uncertainty about the quality of banks’ assets and undermining trust in the banking sector’s solvency. This paper provides the first empirical analysis <b>of</b> <b>forbearance</b> in Europe, using the adjustment of nonperforming exposures due to the asset quality review (AQR) and the associated increase in required provisions as measures <b>of</b> <b>forbearance.</b> Our results highlight weak macro-economic conditions, lax bank supervision and individual bank weakness as the key factors...|$|R

50|$|When {{a lender}} offers a forbearance, they are refraining from {{enforcing}} {{their right to}} realize on securities under their agreement or contract with the Borrower. This is done to assist the Borrower in returning to a performing financial position as well as better position the Lender to realize its security should the Borrower fail to perform. The borrower is still responsible for their debt obligations, though they will accept the agreed forbearance amount and/or terms. On expiry <b>of</b> the agreed <b>forbearance</b> period the loan account reverts to its original form. In many instances, on expiry <b>of</b> the <b>forbearance</b> period, {{the difference between the}} level <b>of</b> <b>forbearance</b> granted and the full repayment (which was missed) is recalculated over the remaining term and the customers new repayment is based on the current loan balance, rate and term.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} multiperiod deposit {{insurance}} pricing model that simultaneously incorporates the capital standard {{and the possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>forbearance.</b> The model employs the recently developed GARCH option pricing technique in determining the deposit insurance value. Our model offers two distinctive advantages. First, it explicitly considers {{the implications of the}} strict enforcement on capital standard as stipulated in FDIC Improvement Act of 1991. Second, the use of the GARCH model;allows us to capture many robust features exhibited by financial asset returns. By the GARCH option pricing theory, the value of a contingent claim is a function <b>of</b> the asset <b>risk</b> premium. This unique feature is found to be prominent in determining the bank's deposit insurance value. We also examine the effects <b>of</b> capital <b>forbearance</b> and moral hazard behavior in this multiperiod deposit insurance setting. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
