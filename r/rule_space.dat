50|$|The AHM {{differs from}} Tatsuoka's <b>Rule</b> <b>Space</b> Method (RSM) with the {{assumption}} of dependencies among the attributes within the cognitive model. In other words, the AHM was derived from RSM by assuming that some or all skills may be represented in hierarchical order. Modeling cognitive attributes using the AHM necessitates the specification of a hierarchy outlining the dependencies among the attributes. As such, the attribute hierarchy serves as a cognitive model of task performance designed to represent the inter-related cognitive processes required by examinees to solve test items. This assumption better reflects the characteristics of human cognition because cognitive processes usually do not work in isolation but function within a network of interrelated competencies and skills. In contrast, the RSM makes no assumptions regarding the dependencies among the attributes. This difference {{has led to the}} development of both IRT and non-IRT based psychometric procedures for analyzing test item responses using the AHM.The AHM also differs from the RSM with respect to the identification of the cognitive attributes and the logic underlying the diagnostic inferences made from the statistical analysis.|$|E
50|$|However, at {{the last}} moment before Angus leaves, Warden {{secretly}} replaces his program with alternate orders: go to alien space, destroy the pirate shipyard, rescue Morn, and bring her safely back to Earth. Warden explains that although as a naive young man, he helped Fasner build up the UMC's power, he now believes Fasner to be irredeemably evil. Rather than continue to allow Fasner to <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> through his private police, Warden wants the government to nationalize the UMCP, making them answerable to the state. Fasner's political influence is so great that Warden doesn't think the government can be persuaded by ordinary activism, and he fears that Fasner will have him killed if he supports a reform movement openly. Warden believes {{the only thing that could}} persuade the government to reform the police would be a scandal so devastating that it utterly discredits their moral authority and implicates the CEO, Fasner, and so Warden has decided to make that happen. His plan is to manipulate Fasner into using the police for a variety of heinous crimes -- such as bribing station security, working with pirates, or murdering witnesses-- and then deliberately fail the cover-up, without allowing Fasner to realize that he is trying to fail.|$|E
40|$|Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and Dual Space Theory (DST) offer differing {{accounts}} {{of learning in}} complex settings. CLT argues that reducing processing demands on working memory (i. e. reducing cognitive load) will facilitate learning. Conversely, DST suggests that learning is improved by encouraging learners to focus on task rules (<b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search) rather than task instances (instance space search). Despite these differences, CLT researchers have proposed that the theories are complementary, suggesting that <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search is contingent on low cognitive load. Three studies were conducted to examine this proposal with particular focus on the goal free effect. Study 1 trained participants on a complex task under conditions of high or low <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search with cognitive load held constant. Results indicated that the high <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search group acquired greater knowledge despite equivalent cognitive load between the groups. However, results may have been confounded by motivational differences. Study 2 manipulated <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search and cognitive load in a 2 (goal type) x 2 (information level) between-subjects design. Manipulations were intended to create conditions where cognitive load and <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search were both high or low, contrary to their proposed dependence. Results however were mixed. Whilst cognitive load and <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search were unrelated in between-group comparisons, they were negatively related overall, consistent with CLT’s proposal. Study 3 refined the previous 2 x 2 design to clarify these findings. Results indicated that groups encouraged to search <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> did so independently of cognitive load, though results were not entirely consistent with either theory. Taken together, results tentatively suggest that cognitive load does not influence <b>rule</b> <b>space</b> search in all situations. The theories may therefore be independent explanations of learning in complex settings...|$|E
