The detection of RF-induced sounds is similar to acoustic sound detection once the cochlea is stimulated; however, the site of conversion of RF energy to acoustic energy is peripheral to the cochlea. The thermoelastic expansion theory explains the RF hearing phenomenon. RF-induced sounds involve the perception, via bone conduction, of thermally generated sound transients, that is, audible sounds are produced by rapid thermal expansion resulting from only a 5 x 10 - 6 oC temperature rise in tissue at the threshold level due to absorption of the energy in the RF pulse.

The fundamental frequency of RF induced sounds is independent of the frequency of the radiowaves but dependent upon head dimensions. The auditory response {{has been shown to be}} dependent upon the energy in a single pulse and not on average power density. The weight of evidence of the results of human, animal, and modeling studies supports the thermoelastic expansion theory as the explanation for the RF hearing phenomenon.

40|$|Low-frequency analog {{and digital}} {{electronic}} circuits {{are susceptible to}} electromagnetic interference in the <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>range.</b> This disturbance is produced when the coupled RF signal is rectified by the nonlinear behavior of the semiconductors used in the small-signal analog input stage of the electronic system. Circuits based on operational amplifiers are usually employed for such input stages. These circuits present an amplitude modulation demodulation produced by the nonlinearity of internal transistors. Such a phenomenon generates demodulated signals in the low-frequency range. In this paper, this effect is suppressed by combining the conventional printed circuit board layout with complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs).

Attaining a consensus is hindered by several problems; {{perhaps the most important}} of these is incomplete or inconsistent post-procedure follow-up to determine if atrial fibrillation has recurred, although many reasons have been considered. It has been clearly demonstrated that longer or more intensive follow-up identifies much more recurrent atrial fibrillation, hence a procedure with more careful follow-up will appear to be less successful. In addition, procedures continue to evolve rapidly, so long follow-up data do not accurately reflect current procedural methods.

Animal studies looking at the effects of early life and prenatal exposure to this source of electromagnetic fields, in the <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) <b>range,</b> on development and behavior have been considered as high priority research needs by the World Health Organization. METHODS: For the first time, our study assessed the effects of in utero exposure to a 2450 MHz Wi-Fi signal (2 hr/day, 6 days/week for 18 days) on pregnant rats and their pups. Three levels in terms of whole-body specific absorption rate were used: 0. 08, 0. 4, and 4 W/kg. The prenatal study on fetuses delivered by caesarean (P 20) concerned five females/group.

Materials and methods: Hairless female rats were exposed or sham-exposed for 2 h to GSM- 900 or - 1800 signals, using a loop-antenna located on the right part of the rats' back. The local Specific Absorption rate (SAR) at skin level was ca. 5 W/kg (5. 8 ± 0. 4 and 4. 8 ± 0. 4 W/kg at 900 and 1800 MHz, respectively).

However, this Solution requires the use of specially designed needles, which Would make the procedure relatively expensive and complicated.

In this study, an extensive measurement survey was performed on the levels of electric and magnetic fields in the IF range typically present in residences as well as emitted by a wide range of household appliances under real-life circumstances.

Six locations were chosen for monitoring based on the presence of radiation sources and/or student/staff occupancy, determined {{with the assistance of the}} Office of Occupational Safety and Health, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Three of these locations contain sources which emit radiation in the ELF range, while the remaining three emit RF radiation. Results showed that the ratio percentage between the RF and ELF exposures at these locations, in comparison to the MCMC and IRPA/INIRC exposure limits,were 0. 2 % and 2. 8 %, respectively. These results showed that for the time being, the exposures at all identified non-ionising radiation hotspots does not exceed the exposure limit suggested by both MCMC (which adopts the recommendation of ICNIRP, 1998) and IRPA/INIRC. However, a non-ionising radiation policy for UKM is still imperative, to serve as a reference and guideline for future activities that may contribute to the non-ionising radiation capacity. Subsequently, concerns were raised during the monitoring activities, especially amongst students who highlighted the necessity of a subject that introduces non-ionising radiation and its possible biological risk, as was offered by the Nuclear Science Department, before the restructuring of the Faculty of Physics and Applied Science in 2001...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the {{feasibility}} of and electrophysiologic criteria for successful radio-frequency catheter ablation of left-sided accessory pathways during atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Background. The onset of recurrent or sustained atrial fibrillation can complicate or significantly prolong accessory pathway catheter ablation procedures. Methods. We studied 19 consecutive patients (mean age [±SD] 44 ± 16 years) with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who had ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway (mean ventricular rate [±SD] 173 ± 26 beats/min, range 130 to 220) at the beginning of the localization procedure during radiofrequency catheter ablation. Localization and ablation of the accessory pathway were performed with a 7 F deflectable catheter (4 -mm tip) that was placed underneath the mitral valve annulus. The electrophysiologic criteria from unipolar and bipolar local electrograms were compared for successful (n = 18) and unseccessful (n = 39) sites. Results. The accessory pathways were localized in the left posteroseptal (n = 6), posterior (n = 1), posterolateral (n = 7) and lateral (n = 5) regions and successfully ablated during atrial fibrillation in 18 (95 %) of 19 patients with a mean of 3 ± 2 <b>radiofrequency</b> pulses (<b>range</b> 1 to 8, median 2). Presence of an accessory pathway potential (94 % vs. 44 %), early activation time of the ventricular electrogram (− 3. 2 ± 9. 2 vs. − 15. 3 ± 12. 6 ms) and recording of atrial activation (88 % vs. 61 %) from the ablation catheter were helpful in identifying successful sites (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05, respectively, compared with unsuccessful sites). In addition, the ventricular activation time in relation to the intrinsic deflection of the unipolar electrogram was significantly earlier at successful than unsuccessful sites (18. 1 ± 4. 8 vs. 24. 4 ± 6. 6 ms, p < 0. 01). A QS complex on the unipolar electrogram was observed at 96 % of successful sites and at 94 % of unsuccessful sites (p = 0. 74). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of an accessory pathway potential (p < 0. 002) and early ventricular activation time in relation to the onset of the QRS complex (p < 0. 001) were independent predictors of ablation success. Conclusions. Localization and radiofrequency catheter ablation of left-sided accessory pathways is possible in patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and rapid anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway during the ablation procedure. The electrophysiologic criteria described here can be used to reliably identify successful sites for radiofrequency ablation...|$|R
