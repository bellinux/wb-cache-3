40|$|<b>Ricin</b> is <b>a</b> potent A-B toxin that is transported {{from the}} cell surface to the cytosol, where it inactivates ribosomes, leading to cell death.

40|$|Proteins {{that fail}} to fold in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) or cannot find a pattern for assembly are often disposed of by a process named ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves transport of the substrate protein across the ER membrane (dislocation) followed by rapid proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Different ERAD substrates {{have been shown to}} be ubiquitinated during or soon after dislocation, and an active ubiquitination machinery has been found to be required for the dislocation of certain defective proteins. We have previously shown that, when expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts, the <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> of the heterodimeric toxin ricin is degraded by a pathway that closely resembles ERAD but is characterized by an unusual uncoupling between the dislocation and the degradation steps.

40|$|Inhibition {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} per se does not potentiate the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs; {{also known as}} cJun NH 2 -terminal kinases [JNKs]). The protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, however, is a potent activator of SAPKs/JNKs. The mechanism of this activation is unknown. We provide evidence {{that in order to}} activate SAPK/JNK 1, anisomycin requires ribosomes that are translationally active at the time of contact with the drug, suggesting a ribosomal origin of the anisomycin-induced signaling to SAPK/JNK 1. In support of this notion, we have found that aminohexose pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics, which bind to the same region in the 28 S rRNA that is the target site for anisomycin, are also potent activators of SAPK/JNK 1. Binding of an antibiotic to the 28 S rRNA interferes with the functioning of the molecule by altering the structural interactions of critical regions. We hypothesized, therefore, that such alterations in the 28 S rRNA may act as recognition signals to activate SAPK/JNK 1. To test this hypothesis, we made use of two ribotoxic enzymes, <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> and alpha-sarcin, both of which catalyze sequence-specific RNA damage in the 28 S rRNA. Consistent with our hypothesis, <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> and alpha-sarcin were strong agonists of SAPK/JNK 1 and of its activator SEK 1 /MKK 4 and induced the expression of the immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun.

40|$|All-trans {{retinoic acid}} can {{specifically}} increase receptor mediated intoxication of <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> immunotoxins more than 10, 000 times, whereas fluid phase endocytosis of <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> alone or <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> immunotoxins was not influenced by retinoic acid. The immunotoxin activation by retinoic acid {{does not require}} RNA or protein synthesis {{and is not a}} consequence of increased receptor binding of the immunotoxin. Vitamin D 3 and thyroid hormone T 3, that activate retinoic acid receptor (RAR) cognates, forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR), do not affect the potency of immunotoxins. Among other retinoids tested, 13 -cis retinoic acid, which binds neither RAR nor RXR, also increases the potency of the <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> immunotoxin. Therefore, retinoic acid receptor activation {{does not appear to be}} necessary for immunotoxin activity. Retinoic acid potentiation of immunotoxins is prevented by brefeldin A (BFA) indicating that in the presence of retinoic acid, the immunotoxin is efficiently routed through the Golgi apparatus en route to the cytoplasm. Directly examining cells with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) against mannosidase II, a Golgi apparatus marker enzyme, demonstrates that the Golgi apparatus changes upon treatment with retinoic acid from a perinuclear network to a diffuse aggregate. Within 60 min after removal of retinoic acid the cell reassembles the perinuclear Golgi network indistinguishable with that of normal control cells. C 6 -NBD-ceramide, a vital stain for the Golgi apparatus, shows that retinoic acid prevents the fluorescent staining of the Golgi apparatus and eliminates fluorescence of C 6 -NBD-ceramide prestained Golgi apparatus. Electron microscopy of retinoic acid-treated cells demonstrates the specific absence of any normal looking Golgi apparatus and a perinuclear vacuolar structure very similar to that seen in monensin-treated cells. This vacuolization disappears after removal of the retinoic acid and a perinuclear Golgi stacking reappears. These results indicate that retinoic acid alters intracellular routing, probably through the Golgi apparatus, potentiating immunotoxin activity indepedently of new gene expression. Retinoic acid appears to be a new reagent to manipulate the Golgi apparatus and intracellular traffic. As retinoic acid and immunotoxins are both in clinical trials for cancer therapy, their combined activity in vivo would be interesting to examine...|$|R

40|$|Following {{cellular}} uptake, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is cleaved by cellular protease which generates an enzymatically active C-terminal fragment (amino acids 280 - 613). This 37 kD fragment translocates to {{the cell}} cytosol where it ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 and inhibits protein synthesis. A recombinant hybrid toxin (designated PE-RTA) in which the ADP-ribosylation domain (domain III) {{was replaced by the}} RNA N-glycosidase domain of <b>ricin</b> (the <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> or RTA) has been produced in E. coli. The hybrid toxin effectively and specifically depurinated 28 S ribosomal. RNA, indicating that the <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> moiety folded into its native conformation. The cytotoxicity of PE-RTA for L 929 cells was approximately 100 -fold less than either native PE or whole ricin. However, the addition of the tetrapeptide KDEL to the C-terminus of PE-RTA (producing PE-RTA KDEL) increased cytotoxicity {{to the level of the}} native toxins. By analogy to PE, both PE-RTA and PE-RTA KDEL would be proteolytically cleaved within PE domain II during cell entry. A single amino acid substitution, believed to disrupt an essential step in the transport of the catalytically active PE fragment {{to the cell}} cytosol (Trp 281 to Ala: Zdanovsky, A. G., Chiron, M., Pastan, I., and FitzGerald, D. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21791 - 21799), reduced the cytotoxicities of both PE and PE-RTA KDEL by approximately 100 -fold. Taken together, these data show that the <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> component of the hybrid toxin requires essential PE-derived sequences at both the N- and C-termini of the translocating fragment. Clearly, in the context of this fusion protein, <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> cannot effect its own transfer to the cytosol...|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> immunotoxin, SEN 36 -ricin <b>A</b> <b>chain,</b> {{directed}} against the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) had no selective cytotoxic activity against three different small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines in tissue culture despite expression of the target antigen on more than 98 % of cells in each line detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of the SW 2 SCLC cell line with suramin and interferons alpha and gamma increased the level of N-CAM expression only slightly and had no {{significant effect on the}} cytotoxic activity of the SEN 36 immunotoxin. In the presence of the carboxylic ionophore monensin at a concentration of 0. 1 microM, the toxicity of SEN 36 -ricin <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> to the SW 2 cell line was enhanced by 12, 000 -fold. In contrast, lysosomotropic amines showed little or no potentiation of activity, suggesting that lysosomal degradation was not the major factor limiting the action of the anti-N-CAM immunotoxin. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> immunotoxins {{directed against}} N-CAM on SCLC are unlikely to have sufficient activity to be useful therapeutic agents in the absence of potentiating agents such as monensin, which can interfere with the normal intracellular pathways of antigen routing...|$|R
40|$|The high {{fluorescence}} of adenine-containing compounds after reaction with chloroacetaldehyde {{was used}} to measure the adenine released from rat liver and Artemia salina ribosomes by the action of <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> and gelonin, two ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) that share the same mechanism of action, consisting in the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of A- 4324 of 28 S rRNA. Two methods were employed: (i) h. p. l. c. of the chloroacetaldehyde-reactive material released by RIPs; h. p. l. c. associated with a fluorescence detector allows the identification of adenine and its dosage at quantities as low as 2 ng; (ii) the direct fluorimetric measurement of the material that had reacted with chloroacetaldehyde. The amount of adenine released increases when ribosomes are pretreated in conditions that lead to their dissociation into subunits. Adenine protects ribosomes from the inhibition by ricin A-chain. When ribosomes were incubated with ricin A-chain in the presence of [14 C]adenine no incorporation of radioisotope in ribosomes was observed, indicating that neither exchange nor reversal reactions occurred. A binding of [14 C]adenine to <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> was not detected by equilibrium dialysis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ricin</b> is <b>a</b> potent, plant-derived, {{ribosome}} inactivating protein. To target ribosomes in the mammalian cytosol, ricin must firstly {{negotiate the}} endomembrane {{system of the}} cell to reach the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, the toxin is reduced and the catalytic <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> is recognised by ER components that facilitate its membrane translocation to the cytosol. To be toxic, <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> must then avoid degradation, a conundrum made more tricky in that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are normally tightly coupled to the translocation process. This mini-review summarieses current understanding of these events. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> was {{coupled to}} murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies MBr 1 and MOv 2 respectively raised against human breast and ovarian carcinomas. Inhibition of protein synthesis only occurred in those cultured human tumor cells bearing the appropriate target antigens, demonstrating that both {{components of the}} conjugate were unchanged in regards to specificity and toxicity. Conjugates were 125 - 200 times more efficient in inhibiting [3 H]proline incorporation than the uncoupled <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> <b>chain.</b> They were however unable to kill {{the entire population of}} the appropriate cells even after repeated treatment. Although the two monoclonal antibodies had similar binding kinetics, the conjugates differed in their cytotoxicity kinetics. The MBr 1 -ricin <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> conjugate had slow kinetics, and about 20 hours were needed to obtain a protein synthesis inhibition above 50 % on the appropriate line (mammary carcinoma MCF- 7). In contrast, the MOv 2 -ricin <b>A</b> <b>chain</b> conjugate showed very fast kinetics, reaching 50 % inhibition after only 30 minutes of treatment on both appropriate cell lines SW 626 and HT- 29 from ovarian and colon carcinomas, respectively. Growth conditions of cell lines, i. e., adherent cells versus suspended cells, and plating time were found to greatly influence the conjugates' killing efficiencies. These studies confirm the possibility of preparing <b>ricin</b> <b>A</b> chain-antibody conjugates, which retain specific cytotoxicity against tumor cells; but they also underline the need for further in vitro studies of various parameters before one considers a therapeutic use of such conjugates...|$|R
