5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is <b>ricin,</b> an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since <b>ricin</b> is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of <b>ricin</b> to kill a cell.|$|E
5|$|Castor oil, {{with many}} {{industrial}} and medicinal uses. Castor beans {{are also a}} source of the toxin <b>ricin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{called by}} the State {{supported}} Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had been called to the home {{a month before the}} fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing castor beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of castor bean seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of <b>ricin</b> poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for <b>ricin</b> antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to <b>ricin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in November 1995 to treat an aneurism that his doctors believed had {{been caused by}} the poisoning. Before the surgery, he submitted blood samples to Johnson County's crime lab {{to be tested for}} <b>ricin</b> antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, rotenone, {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include atropine, <b>ricin,</b> hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have medicinal uses.|$|E
5|$|Skylark {{spends the}} day with Kim by playing basketball, hanging out and partying. Kim persuades Skylark that he is {{misunderstood}} as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a seizure due to the <b>ricin</b> poisoning and accidentally kills Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the <b>ricin</b> strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he threatens war with South Korea. Skylark leaves, and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely a façade and realizes that Kim has been lying to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{great variety}} of carbon {{compounds}} include such lethal poisons as tetrodotoxin, the lectin <b>ricin</b> from seeds of the castor oil plant Ricinus communis, cyanide (CN), and carbon monoxide; and such essentials to life as glucose and protein.|$|E
5|$|The next day, CIA agent Lacey {{shows up}} at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to <b>ricin</b> via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the <b>ricin</b> strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are {{introduced}} to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an UAV, {{but in order to}} smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, during {{attempted}} sexual intercourse with Rapaport, who {{still has the}} <b>ricin</b> strip in his hand, Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport, and Sook-yin form a plan to break Kim's cult of personality by causing him to cry on air. As they arm themselves for the event, Rapaport and Sook-yin have sex. Before the broadcast starts, Kim presents Skylark with a puppy to keep.|$|E
5|$|Debora Green (née Jones; born February 28, 1951) is an American {{physician}} who {{pleaded no contest}} to setting a 1995 fire which burned down her family's home and killed two of her children, and to poisoning her husband with <b>ricin</b> {{with the intention of}} causing his death. The case was sensational, and covered heavily by news media, especially in the Kansas–Missouri area, where the crimes occurred. Though Green has petitioned for a new trial twice in recent years, her requests have not been successful.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Jack Bauer waiting outside a ship in Los Angeles harbor where terrorists {{are going to}} release a <b>ricin</b> bomb in the water supply. A CTU team member {{triggers}} an alarm causing Jack and his team to storm the ship, discovering the whole ship's crew dead in a cargo hold. He later learns of an assassination attempt on Vice President Prescott through undercover agent Chase Edmunds. Foiling the attack, Jack discovers that the mastermind behind the attempt is an enemy from his past known as Peter Madsen.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's <b>ricin</b> program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while {{practicing}} as {{an emergency}} physician. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint {{the source of his}} illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, but despite the efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of accelerant in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and that the source of Michael Farrar's intractable illness had been <b>ricin,</b> a poison served to him in his food by Green.|$|E
25|$|The {{quaternary}} structure of <b>ricin</b> is a globular, glycosylated heterodimer of approximately 60–65 kDa. <b>Ricin</b> toxin A chain and <b>ricin</b> toxin B chain are of similar molecular weights, approximately 32 kDa and 34 kDa, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The profuse binding of <b>ricin</b> {{to surface}} {{membranes}} allows internalization with {{all types of}} membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle <b>ricin</b> to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of <b>ricin.</b> Because <b>ricin</b> is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against <b>ricin.</b> <b>Ricin</b> molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ricin</b> B chain binds complex {{carbohydrates}} {{on the surface}} of eukaryotic cells containing either terminal N-acetylgalactosamine or beta-1,4-linked galactose residues. In addition, the mannose-type glycans of <b>ricin</b> are able to bind cells that express mannose receptors. RTB has been shown to bind to the cell surface on the order of 106-108 <b>ricin</b> molecules per cell surface.|$|E
25|$|Modifying <b>ricin</b> may {{sufficiently}} {{lessen the}} likelihood that the <b>ricin</b> component of these immunotoxins will cause the wrong cells to internalize it, while still retaining its cell-killing activity when it is internalized by the targeted cells. However, bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, which is used in denileukin diftitox, an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for <b>ricin</b> is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells, thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity. Use of <b>ricin</b> as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ricin</b> is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of {{castor oil}} plant seeds. The <b>ricin</b> precursor protein is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the <b>ricin</b> A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the <b>ricin</b> B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature <b>ricin</b> protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E
25|$|The Wood Green <b>ricin</b> {{plot was}} a 2002 alleged bioterrorism plot {{to attack the}} London Underground with <b>ricin</b> poison. The Metropolitan Police Service arrested six {{suspects}} on 5 January 2003, with one more arrested two days later.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., <b>ricin</b> {{appears on}} the select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services, and {{scientists}} must register with HHS to use <b>ricin</b> in their research. However, investigators possessing less than 1000mg are exempt from regulation.|$|E
25|$|Under {{both the}} 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, <b>ricin</b> {{is listed as}} a {{schedule}} 1 controlled substance. Despite this, more than 1 million tonnes of castor beans are processed each year, and approximately 5% of the total is rendered into a waste containing negligible concentrations of undenatured <b>ricin</b> toxin.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{antidote}} currently available for <b>ricin</b> poisoning, vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain A. This vaccination is effective for several months due to the body's production of antibodies to the foreign protein. In 1978 Bulgarian defector Vladimir Kostov survived a <b>ricin</b> attack {{similar to the one}} on Georgi Markov, probably due to his body's production of antibodies. When a ricin-laced pellet was removed from {{the small of his back}} it was found that some of the original wax coating was still attached. For this reason only small amounts of <b>ricin</b> had leaked out of the pellet, producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{symptoms}} are caused by failure to make protein, they may take anywhere from hours to days to appear, depending on the route of exposure and the dose. When ingested, gastrointestinal symptoms can manifest within 6 hours; these symptoms do not always become apparent. Within 2 to 5 days of exposure to <b>ricin,</b> effects of <b>ricin</b> on the central nervous system, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver appear.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of <b>ricin</b> {{inhalation}} {{are different}} from those caused by ingestion. Early symptoms include a cough and fever.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ricin</b> is {{very toxic}} if inhaled, injected, or ingested. It {{can also be}} toxic if dust {{contacts}} the eyes {{or if it is}} absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. It prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger RNA in a process conducted by the cell's ribosome (the protein-making machinery)—that is, the most basic level of cell metabolism, essential to all living cells and thus to life itself. <b>Ricin</b> is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of <b>ricin</b> is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union also possessed weaponized <b>ricin.</b> There were speculations {{that the}} KGB used it outside the Soviet bloc; however, this was never proven.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ricin</b> {{has often}} {{been used as a}} plot device, such as in the {{television}} series Breaking Bad (Season 2, Season 4 and Season 5).|$|E
25|$|The toxin <b>ricin</b> {{was found}} in the {{mailroom}} of the White House in November 2003 and in the mailroom of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist in February 2004.|$|E
25|$|Following Lavy's death, the <b>ricin</b> {{was shipped}} back to Canada for destruction. Lavy's funeral {{was held at}} Kemper-Marsh Funeral Home, and he was buried at the Asbury Cemetery, in Foley, Missouri.|$|E
25|$|During World War II the United States and Canada {{undertook}} studying <b>ricin</b> in cluster bombs. Though {{there were}} plans for mass production and several field trials with different bomblet concepts, the end conclusion {{was that it}} was no more economical than using phosgene. This conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons, rather than ricin's toxicity (LCt50 ~40mg·min/m3). <b>Ricin</b> was given the military symbol W or later WA. Interest in it continued for a short period after World War II, but soon subsided when the U.S. Army Chemical Corps began a program to weaponize sarin.|$|E
25|$|A key unexplained {{issue is}} why the Porton Down laboratory, which {{analysed}} the material and equipment seized from a flat in Wood Green, said that a residue of <b>ricin</b> had been found when it had not.|$|E
25|$|When skin or {{inhalation}} exposure occur, <b>ricin</b> {{can cause}} an allergy to develop. This {{is indicated by}} edema of the eyes and lips; asthma; bronchial irritation; dry, sore throat; congestion; skin redness (erythema); skin blisters (vesication); wheezing; itchy, watery eyes; chest tightness; and skin irritation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ricin</b> toxic A chain (RTA) is an N-glycoside {{hydrolase}} {{composed of}} 267 amino acids. It has three structural domains with approximately 50% of the polypeptide arranged into alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The three domains form a pronounced cleft {{that is the}} active site of RTA.|$|E
25|$|An {{antidote}} {{has been}} developed by the UK military, although {{it has not yet}} been tested on humans. Another antidote developed by the U.S. military {{has been shown to be}} safe and effective in lab mice injected with antibody-rich blood mixed with <b>ricin,</b> and has had some human testing.|$|E
25|$|Given ricin's extreme {{toxicity}} {{and utility}} {{as an agent}} of chemical/biological warfare, it is noteworthy that the production of the toxin is rather difficult to limit. The castor bean plant from which <b>ricin</b> is derived is a common ornamental and can be grown at home without any special care.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} period, the Canadian Customs station had been cleaned and the powder in storage was rediscovered {{and sent to}} a {{military}} doctor for examination. He confirmed it was <b>ricin,</b> only 7% pure, and it was sent to Fort Detrick in the United States {{to assist in the}} prosecution of Lavy.|$|E
