5|$|Reyes' numerology {{theories}} {{do not go}} down well at the FBI, but {{the pattern}} of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to line up as the number six (6). After looking at the pictures of the victims, Scully realizes that the pattern on the victims was not three circles, but instead, three sixes, the mark of the devil. Meanwhile, Wayno has several additional <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the mysterious man, who continues to give cryptic advice.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Anderson tallied 48 {{goals and}} 56 assists {{for a total}} of 104 points to help the Oilers remain atop their division. In the playoffs, the Oilers managed to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Anderson and his team were matched up against the Islanders who were looking for a fourth consecutive Stanley Cup victory. During the Finals, Anderson had several noted <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> Islanders goaltender Billy Smith. During game one, a slash on Anderson's knee earned Smith a two-minute slashing penalty.|$|E
5|$|Under {{new coach}} Del Harris, Los Angeles {{made the playoffs}} {{each of the next}} two seasons, but was {{eliminated}} in the second and first rounds respectively. The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish. After some <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.|$|E
50|$|In his autobiography, Tomatis {{recounts the}} many <b>run-ins</b> he had <b>with</b> the medical {{establishment}} in both France and Canada, where he later worked. Eventually he left the orthodox medical community, admitting that his practice was {{beyond the scope of}} normative allopathic comprehension. He named his new field audio-psycho-phonology.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile Lady Jane, having learnt that Bo {{was really}} innocent, heads {{out to the}} Sahara {{to bring him back}} to England. Along the way she has several {{encounters}} with men who exploit {{the fact that she is}} naive and travelling alone. After several such <b>run-ins,</b> including <b>with</b> the Legion fort's Commandant Burger (who incidentally once was her fencing teacher and joined the Legion in self-imposed shame after he had inadvertently cut her finger during a lesson), she meets Sheikh Abdul Abulbul and ends up becoming a part of his harem and planned 13th wife.|$|R

5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} Vashyron doing {{battle with a}} berserk Zephyr. Despite Zephyr being shot twice in the head, he does not die. Vashyron decides to take him in {{as a partner in}} his Hunter group. Some time later, Zephyr sees and {{attempts}} to save Leanne as she jumps from a bridge, and both miraculously survive their resultant fall. The story skips forward two years—Zephyr and Vashyron are running their group with Leanne, taking on odd jobs across the city. Among their clients are the ruling Cardinals and people from lower strata of the tower. During their missions, they encounter instances of people's fates changing unexpectedly, going against the pre-determined path set by Zenith. They also have <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> Rebecca, a superhuman, mentally unstable woman from beyond Basel's borders. It is revealed that Vashyron himself faced Rebecca when she first arrived in Basel. He was fatally wounded, but was saved by Zenith, and its resultant retaliation on Rebecca broke her mind.|$|E
5000|$|Benetton {{retained}} Michael Schumacher, {{but lost}} Martin Brundle who was replaced after numerous <b>run-ins</b> and disagreements <b>with</b> team manager Flavio Briatore. Taking the second seat at Benetton {{was the most}} experienced driver in Formula One, Italian veteran Riccardo Patrese, who was released by Williams after just over five seasons with the team since 1988, despite having finished runner up to Mansell in the Drivers' Championship in 1992.|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} WWE debut on the October 30, 2003, episode of SmackDown! and was chosen with the {{returning}} Nathan Jones by then General Manager of SmackDown!, Paul Heyman, to join Team Lesnar, {{which consisted of}} Matt Morgan, Nathan Jones, Brock Lesnar, Big Show and A-Train. It was hinted that Matt Morgan and Nathan Jones would be a tag team, but their only tag team match was at the 2003 Survivor Series pay-per-view, when they took on Team Angle (not the stable introduced one year earlier, but a one-off combination of five wrestlers). They lost to Team Angle in a ten-person elimination tag team match at 2003 Survivor Series; Morgan was eliminated from the match by Kurt Angle after Angle gave Morgan an Angle Slam. Morgan was then used to make <b>run-ins</b> along <b>with</b> {{the other members of}} Team Lesnar, helping Brock Lesnar against his opponents.|$|R

25|$|Lewis {{had several}} <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> Lord Howard de Walden, his Oxford Street landlord, and in 1903 he spent {{three weeks in}} Brixton Prison for defying a court order {{obtained}} by de Walden. In 1911, de Walden sued him for libel; Lewis was found guilty, but the jury awarded damages of just a farthing.|$|E
25|$|News {{media have}} made portrayals of {{messengers}} ranging from innocuous urban libertines to reckless, cliquish nihilists. The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike messengers in collisions with other road-users or <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> authority figures. These incidents also occasionally lead to proposals for, and dispute over, new ordinances and regulations on messengers and messengering.|$|E
50|$|A no {{disqualification}} match, a no holds barred match, or an {{anything goes}} match {{tends to be}} less severe, with action taking place mostly inside the ring, despite {{most of the time}} there is a no countout stipulation. Usage of foreign objects is typically low and minimal, <b>with</b> <b>run-ins</b> (another form of disqualification) being frequently used. The match is often contested between valets (where they may lack wrestling skills), or between a wrestler and a valet (in which a wrestler is expected to run-in and defend their valets). Because of the low-key nature, few consider a no-disqualification match as hardcore, although there is no semantic difference.|$|R
5000|$|Van Mungo wasn't just {{a pistol}} off the field; {{on the field}} he was bent towards {{conflict}} with his teammates and managers. There are several stories of <b>run-ins</b> and conflict <b>with</b> his teammates and managers. Once while he was protecting a small margin of victory, outfielder Tom Winsett botched a routine fly-ball that cost Mungo a victory. Mungo retreated to the dugout and clubhouse to destroy what he could destroy and throw into the field of play what he could not destroy. Mungo sent his wife a telegram stating the following: ¨Pack up your bags and come to Brooklyn, honey. If Winsett can play in the big leagues, it's a cinch you can, too." [...] It {{is also true that}} Van Lingle Mungo probably paid more in fines than any player of his era, amassing a grand total (in his own estimation) of over $15,000.|$|R
500|$|Brundage quickly {{displayed}} what writer Roger Butterfield in a 1948 {{article for}} Life magazine termed [...] "a dictatorial temperament." [...] In 1929, American track star Charlie Paddock stated that Brundage and other sports officials were making {{money for the}} AOC by using him as a gate attraction, while treating him badly; Brundage shot back accusing Paddock of [...] "untruths" [...] and [...] "sensationalism of the rankest sort". The runner turned professional, escaping Brundage's jurisdiction. In 1932, soon after winning three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, track star Mildred [...] "Babe" [...] Didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement, and the Brundage-led AAU quickly suspended her amateur status. Didrikson objected {{that she had not}} been paid and that regardless, the rules for maintaining amateur status were overcomplex. In the first of several well-publicized <b>run-ins</b> he had <b>with</b> female athletes, Brundage replied that he had not had any problem with the rules when an Olympic athlete himself, and stated, [...] "You know, the ancient Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn't even let them on the sidelines. I'm not so sure but they were right." [...] According to Butterfield, Brundage was suspicious of female athletes, suspecting that some were actually men in disguise.|$|R
25|$|Although {{some of the}} {{obstacle}} Xuánzàng encounters are political and involve ordinary human beings, they more frequently consist of <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> various goblins and ogres, many of in whom {{turn out to be}} the earthly manifestations of heavenly beings (whose sins will be negated by eating the flesh of Xuánzàng) or animal-spirits with enough Taoist spiritual merit to assume semi-human forms.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2004 collegiate season, Vick {{had several}} <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the law which {{resulted}} in misdemeanor convictions.

Arthur's closest friends include Buster, Francine, Muffy, Binky and the Brain, with Sue Ellen, Fern and George as frequent supporting characters. D.W. often spends more time with Arthur and his older friends than her classmates, save for <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the Tibble twins and her imaginary friend, Nadine.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 {{documentary}} film maker Nick Broomfield made Juvenile Liaison about a juvenile liaison {{project in the}} town. The film examines a series of children and their <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the law, over minor wrongdoings such as theft, truancy and being abusive to parents. After its production, the film was banned by the BFI for many years; Juvenile Liaison revolved mainly around the activities of Sergeant Ray, whose preventative measures when dealing with young trouble makers fell mainly in the strong-arm category of approach. In 1990 Nick Broomfield returned to Blackburn to film a follow up. Juvenile Liaison 2 revisits some of the residents from the first film, {{in some sort of}} attempt to measure the success of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his family}} had moved to Terre Haute, Dresser {{returned}} to Sullivan after he left St. Meinrad. He stayed with family friends while working on local farms {{during the summer of}} 1871 through the summer of 1872. The fourteen-year-old Dresser then returned to Terre Haute and worked a series of odd jobs to help support his family. Dresser continued his education at the St. Bonaventure Lyceum academy in Terre Haute and took piano lessons from a local music teacher, his only formal musical training. During this time the relationship between Dresser and his father quickly deteriorated and the teen may have had <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the local police. Whatever the reason, Dresser returned to Sullivan to work on a friend's farm, away from the city.|$|E
25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E
25|$|Bieber {{had several}} <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the law {{around the world}} before his first arrest in 2014, {{including}} when {{he was accused of}} reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013. One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage. On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs. He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond, and lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt as dictated in the United States court of law. A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system {{at the time of his}} arrest.|$|E
25|$|Ol' Dirty Bastard's {{career in}} Wu-Tang {{was marked by}} erratic behavior. At the 1998 Grammy Awards, he protested the Clan's loss (to Puff Daddy in Best Rap Album) by {{interrupting}} Shawn Colvin's acceptance speech for her Song of the Year award. In addition, ODB's <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the law were well publicized—he was arrested several times for offenses including assault, shoplifting, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, and possession of cocaine, and he missed multiple court dates. In late 2000, Ol' Dirty Bastard unexpectedly escaped {{near the end of}} his rehab sentence, spending one month on the run as a fugitive before showing up on stage at the record release party for The W in New York City. He managed to escape the club but was later captured by police in Philadelphia and sent to New York to face charges of cocaine possession. In April 2001, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. Once released from prison, he signed a one million dollar contract with Roc-a-Fella Records.|$|E
25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened {{to stand up to the}} over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E

500|$|Upon Alston's death, MLB {{commissioner}} Peter Ueberroth {{referred to}} {{him as one of}} baseball's greatest managers. Former Dodgers great Duke Snider acknowledged occasional <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> Alston, but he said that Alston excelled at utilizing the specific strengths of each team that he managed. Tommy Lasorda, who played and coached under Alston and ultimately succeeded him as manager, commented on {{how easy it was to}} play for Alston. Broadcaster Vin Scully said, [...] "I always imagined him to be the type who could ride shotgun on a stage through Indian territory. He was all man and two yards tall. He was very quiet, very controlled. He never made excuses. He gave the players the credit and he took the blame. He was so solid, so American." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Hatcher, the President of LSU, {{resigned}} {{his position}} in February 1947 because of ill health. [...] The search {{went out for a}} new president, and when Middleton was asked to be considered for the job, he declined, being very content with his job as comptroller. [...] Following the search, Harold W. Stoke was brought in from the University of New Hampshire. Middleton thought Stoke had many good qualities, but he could not work well with the Board of Supervisors. [...] Stoke was sometimes doctrinaire, and his formality when working with the board members was found to be annoying by some. [...] While he was respected by most of the faculty, Stoke continued to have <b>run-ins</b> <b>with</b> the board members, and in December 1950 his differences with the board resulted in his tendering his resignation.|$|E

His average sank to [...]077. The owner of the Braves, Emil Fuchs {{purchased}} the Worcester Panthers of the Eastern League, and hired Stengel as player-manager and team president. Appel noted that in joining the Panthers, Stengel was [...] "starting out on a managing career that would eventually take him to Cooperstown." [...] With fans enjoying Stengel's on-field antics and his World Series heroics still recent, he was the Eastern League's biggest attendance draw.
