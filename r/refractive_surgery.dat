40|$|Many <b>refractive</b> <b>surgeries</b> of {{the cornea}} (radial keratotomy RK, photore- fractive keratectomy PRK, laser in situ keratomileusis LASIK) are done {{routinely}} in {{an increasing number}} of patients in many countries. However, few analyses of the cornea related to the corneal configuration change and refractive index distribution, which affect the postoperative visual outcomes, have been reported. We have analyzed the refractive index and chromatic dispersion of the cornea {{as a function of the}} temperature of pig eyes in vitro. Refractive index of various depth of the cornea was measured with a multi- wavelength Abbe refractometer at various temperatures. Experimental results show that refractive index and Abbe number are different at the corneal position (epithelium, stroma, endothelium). As the corneal temperature changes, the refractive index and Abbe number also changed significantly. It is concluded that the refractive index is depending on the axial position and the temperature. We need a further consideration of the optical properties such as refractive index and chromatic dispersion of the cornea for obtaining good visual outcomes after various kinds of recent <b>refractive</b> <b>surgeries...</b>|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of visual}} {{modeling}} is {{to predict the}} visual performance or a change in performance of an individual from {{a model of the}} human visual system. In designing a model of the human visual system, two distinct functions are considered. The first is the production of an image incident on the retina by the optical system of the eye, and the second is the conversion of this image into a perceived image by the retina and brain. The eye optics are evaluated using raytracing techniques familiar to the optical engineer. The effect of the retinal and brain function are combined with the raytracing results by analyzing the modulation of the retinal image. Each of these processes is important far evaluating the performance of the entire visual system. Techniques for converting the abstract system performance measures used by optical engineers into clinically-applicable measures such as visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are developed in this dissertation. Furthermore, a methodology for applying videokeratoscopic height data to the visual model is outlined. These tools are useful in modeling the visual effects of corrective lenses, ocular maladies and <b>refractive</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The modeling techniques are applied to examples of soft contact lenses, keratoconus, radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy and automated lamellar keratoplasty. The modeling tools developed in this dissertation are meant to be general and modular. As improvements to the measurements of the properties and functionality of the various visual components are made, the new information can be incorporated into the visual system model. Furthermore, the examples discussed here represent only a small subset of the applications of the visual model. Additional ocular maladies and emerging <b>refractive</b> <b>surgeries</b> can be modeled as well...|$|R

50|$|While <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{becoming}} more affordable and safe, {{it may not be}} recommended for everybody. People with certain eye diseases involving the cornea or retina, pregnant women, and patients who have medical conditions such as glaucoma, diabetes, uncontrolled vascular disease, or autoimmune disease are not good candidates for <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Keratoconus, a progressive thinning of the cornea, is a common corneal disorder. Keratoconus occurring after <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery</b> is called Corneal Ectasia. It is believed that additional thinning of the cornea via <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery</b> may contribute to advancement of the disease that may lead to the need for a corneal transplant. Therefore, keratoconus is a contraindication to <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Corneal topography and pachymetry are used to screen for abnormal corneas. Furthermore, some people's eye shape may not permit effective <b>refractive</b> <b>surgery</b> without removing excessive amounts of corneal tissue.
