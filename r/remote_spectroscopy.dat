40|$|International audienceUsing {{an optimal}} control {{hydrodynamic}} modeling approach and irradiation adaptive time-design, we indicate excitation channels maximizing heat load in laser ablated aluminum at low energy costs. The primary relaxation paths {{leading to an}} emerging plasma are particularly affected. With impulsive pulses on ps pedestals, thermodynamic trajectories are preferentially guided in ionized domains where variations in ionization degree occur. This impinges on the gas-transformation mechanisms and triggers a positive bremsstrahlung absorption feedback. The highest temperatures are thus obtained in the expanding ionized matter after a final impulsive excitation, as the electronic energy relaxes recombinatively. The drive relies on transitions to weakly coupled front plasmas at the critical optical density, favoring energy confinement with low mechanical work. Alternatively, robust collisional heating occurs in denser regions above the critical point. This impacts the nature, the excitation degree and the energy content of the ablated matter. Adaptive modeling can therefore provide optimal strategies with information on physical variables not readily accessible and, as experimentally confirmed, databases for pulse shapes with interest in <b>remote</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> laser-induced matter transfer, laser material processing and development of secondary sources...|$|E

Historically, most compositional analysis of small body surfaces has been done remotely by analyzing reflection or nuclear spectra. However, neither provides direct measurement that can unambiguously constrain the global surface composition and most importantly, the nature of trace composition and second-phase impurities. Recently, missions such as Deep Space 1 and Dawn have utilized electric propulsion (EP) accelerated, high-energy collimated beam of Xe+ ions to propel deep space missions to their target bodies. The energies of the Xe+ are sufficient to cause sputtering interactions, which eject material from the top microns of a targeted surface.

In it's most common incarnation, the FEL is limited by three major factors: average laser power, laser spectral purity, and laser pulse length. Some examples of the limitations that these shortcomings give rise to include limiting the range of <b>remote</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> degrading spectroscopic precision, and lowering the attainable x-ray ux, respectively. In this work, we explored three methods of improving the FEL.

This optic had {{the added benefit of}} increasing the spectral purity.

40|$|Impact {{cratering}} is {{the most}} widespread geological process in the Solar System. Impact craters can provide 'windows' into the subsurfaces of planetary bodies through excavation and uplift. By utilizing remote methods in the visible and near infrared (VNIR; 0. 4 - 1. 4 micron), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR; 1. 4 - 2. 5 micron) and thermal infrared (TIR 7 - 14 micron), subsurface mineral compositions may be identified and mapped via impact craters. Complex craters in particular, expose minerals from both the shallow and deep-seated subsurface, which may be identified spectroscopically. Complex craters have morphological features such as central peaks or peak rings, which are composed of relatively coherent lithologies tapped from deep-seated crustal components. While near-surface crustal components can be observed as coherent rocks uplifted and exposed in the rim and the crater walls, and from the ejecta deposits. Only two previously published studies using this approach have been successful on large planetary bodies. Tompkins and Pieters utilized ultraviolet and VNIR from Clementine to characterize near- and deep-subsurface materials in and around lunar craters. The work of Ramsey and Wright was the first remote spectroscopic study to successfully identify near-subsurface materials in the ejecta and crater wall of a terrestrial impact structure, namely Meteor Crater.

40|$|International audienceWith an {{interest}} in pulsed laser deposition and <b>remote</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> techniques, we explore here the potential of laser pulses temporally tailored on ultrafast time scales to control the expansion and the excitation degree of various ablation products including atomic species and nanoparticulates. Taking advantage of automated pulse-shaping techniques, an adaptive procedure based on spectroscopic feedback is applied to regulate the irradiance and enhance the optical emission of monocharged aluminum ions {{with respect to the}} neutral signal. This leads to optimized pulses usually consisting in a series of femtosecond peaks distributed on a longer picosecond sequence. The ablation features induced by the optimized pulse are compared with those determined by picosecond pulses generated by imposed second-order dispersion or by double pulse sequences with adjustable picosecond separation. This allows to analyze the influence of fast- and slow-varying envelope features on the material heating and the resulting plasma excitation degree. Using various optimal pulse forms including designed asymmetric shapes, we analyze the establishment of surface pre-excitation that enables conditions of enhanced radiation coupling. Thin films elaborated by unshaped femtosecond laser pulses and by optimized, stretched, or double pulse sequences are compared, indicating that the nanoparticles generation efficiency is strongly influenced by the temporal shaping of the laser irradiation. A thermodynamic scenario involving supercritical heating is proposed to explain enhanced ionization rates and lower particulates density for optimal pulses. Numerical one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for the excited matter support the interpretation of the experimental results in terms of relative efficiency of various relaxation paths for excited matter above or below the thermodynamic stability limits. The calculation results underline the role of the temperature and density gradients along the ablated plasma plume which lead to the spatial distinct locations of excited species. Moreover, the nanoparticles sizes are computed based on liquid layer ejection followed by a Rayleigh and Taylor instability decomposition, in good agreement with the experimental findings...|$|E

40|$|The rich {{spectral}} information {{captured by}} hyperspectral sensors {{has given rise}} to a number of remote sensing applications, ranging from vegetative assessment and crop health monitoring, to military surveillance and combatant identification. However, due to limited spatial resolution, multiple ground materials generally contribute, i. e. mix, to form the spectrum recorded for a single pixel. The unmixing problem considers the inverse problem of determining the underlying material spectra, called endmembers, from sensor measurements. While classical unmixing approaches were deterministic in nature and did not attempt to identify in-scene materials, recent methods use labeled training data to generate statistical models of endmember variabilities and perform statistical unmixing for simultaneous material identification and abundance estimation. However, the computational complexity of statistical unmixing with endmember variability is O(N 3), cubic in the number N of sensed spectral bands. This large computational demand is at odds with continuous technological improvements that are dramatically increasing the spectral resolution of <b>remote</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> methods. In particular, current sensor technology is transitioning from the hyperspectral realm (hundreds of spectral bands) to the ultraspectral realm (thousands of spectral bands) and eclipsing the ability to perform statistical unmixing. In this thesis we develop a computationally tractable statistical unmixing method. The proposed method uses Markov chains to model endmember variability and the spectral correlation properties present within endmembers. We use a probabilistic graphical model over multiple Markov chains to capture the mixing effects of the spectral sensor and employ sum-product message passing to develop an accelerated statistical unmixing algorithm. The computational complexity, O(NM 3), of the proposed algorithm is only linear in the number of bands and depends on the number of endmembers M in a cubic fashion. As M is generally small and fixed (in the 10 s), the accelerated algorithm represents a dramatic speed-up over existing methods. Examples demonstrate comparable error rates with two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time compared to existing statistical unmixing methods...|$|E

Previous studies from <b>remote</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> of the Outer Solar System showed a diverse population of macromolecular species that are likely to include aromatic and conjugated hydrocarbons with varying degrees of methylation and nitrile incorporation. In situ exploration of Titan's upper atmosphere via mass and plasma spectrometry has revealed a complex mixture of organics. Similar material is expected on the Ice Giants, their moons, and other Outer Solar System bodies, where it may subsequently be deposited onto surface ices. It is evident that the detection of organics on other planetary surfaces provides insight into the chemical and geological evolution of a Solar System body of interest and can inform our understanding of its potential habitability. We have developed a prototype two-step laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (L 2 MS) instrument by exploiting the resonance-enhanced desorption of analyte. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of the L 2 MS to detect hydrocarbons in organically-doped analog minerals, including cryogenic Ocean World-relevant ices and mixtures. The L 2 MS instrument operates by generating a neutral plume of desorbed analyte with an IR desorption laser pulse, followed at a delay by a ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse, ionizing the plume. Desorption of the analyte, including trace organic species, may be enhanced by selecting the wavelength of the IR desorption laser to coincide with IR absorption features associated with vibration transitions of minerals or organic functional groups. In this effort, a preliminary laser developed for the instrument uses a breadboard mid-infrared (MIR) desorption laser operating at a discrete 3. 475 m wavelength, and a breadboard UV ionization laser operating at a wavelength of 266 nm. The MIR wavelength was selected to overlap the C-H stretch vibrational transition of certain aromatic hydrocarbons, and the UV wavelength provides additional selectivity to aromatic species via UV resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization effects. The use of distinct laser wavelengths allows efficient coupling to the vibrational and electronic spectra of the analyte in independent desorption and ionization steps, mitigating excess energy that can lead to fragmentation during the ionization process and leading to selectivity that can aid in data interpretation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{possibility}} of choosing thermodynamic trajectories for laser excited matter is a determinant factor for controlling a typical laser ablation process, particularly when irradiation on ultrafast timescales is involved. This control specifically concerns {{the nature and}} the energetic characteristics of the ablation products subsequent to laser irradiation. In this respect, designing the energy delivery rate using programmable pulse shaping methods in the temporal domain is a powerful way for regulating excitation and thermodynamic relaxation of the material and, equally, its hydrodynamic advance. We focus here on ultrafast laser irradiation of metals, {{with the objective of}} maximizing heat load in the ablation products. Using experimental and theoretical adaptive loops [1, 2, 3] based on hydrodynamic codes we indicate the temporal shapes of optimal pulses on ultrashort and short timescales required to reach extreme thermodynamic states at limited energy input. These waveforms, particularly impulsive pulses on picoseconds pedestals, affect the excitation level and the energetic content of the ablation products, as well as the balance between thermal and mechanical energy. As the material states rapidly vary from solid to plasma phases, the optimal interaction scenario usually implies light coupling into the incipient material hydrodynamic motion. This triggers transitions to weakly-coupled front plasmas at critical optical density, favoring energy confinement with low mechanical work. Additional collisional heating occurs in denser regions above the critical point, reaching states that spontaneously decompose in excited atomic species. The consequences are manifold and are particularly visible in the formation of atomic, ionic, and cluster species, their kinetics and spectral emissivities, and in the ejection of nanoscale liquid droplets. A discussion on the nature of these resulting exotic thermodynamic states, mostly implying supercritical paths, will be given.
