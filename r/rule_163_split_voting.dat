40|$|In Mixed Member Proportional systems, {{voters are}} able to <b>split</b> their <b>vote.</b> To what extent do voters use this {{opportunity}}, which voters seem to use this opportunity most {{and what are the}} potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting?</b> These questions are answered by comparatively analyzing motives for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> and factors that facilitate such behavior and apply them to the Dutch situation. Moreover, we employ various simulations based on the last three parliamentary elections in order to assess the potential consequences of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> under different electoral system proposals. In general, these results indicate that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> will not have substantial effects on the distribution of seats in parliament. " (author's abstract...|$|R
5000|$|United Kingdom - The Highway Code discourages {{undertaking}} on motorways {{with some}} exceptions (rule 268): [...] "Do not overtake {{on the left}} or move to a lane on your left to overtake". Undertaking is permitted in congested conditions when frequent lane changing is not recommended. On other roads, the Code advises drivers [...] "should only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling to turn right" [...] (<b>rule</b> <b>163).</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>163</b> uses advisory wording and [...] "will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted", but {{may be used in}} evidence to establishing liability in any court proceedings. On all roads, undertaking is permitted if the vehicles in the lane to the right are queueing and slow moving. Undertaking in an aggressive or reckless manner could be considered Careless Driving or more seriously Dangerous Driving, both of which are legally enforceable offences.|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> in {{elections}} usually indicate either an instrumental electorate, or widespread disaffection {{from the major}} parties. Elections to the Russian lower house, the Duma, permit voters both party list options and single-member ballots; as a result, the 1993 and 1995 Duma elections recorded {{some of the highest}} levels of <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> ever recorded. Using national survey data collected just after the 1995 Duma election, we test two major explanations for <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting,</b> one based on the activities of voters, the other on the strategic behaviour of parties. The results show that <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is caused by voters, and more specifically, by their weak attachments to parties. But party strategy also plays a modest role in promoting the phenomenon. In the absence of major reform of the Russian electoral system, <b>split</b> ticket <b>voting</b> is likely to remain at high levels...|$|R

50|$|Runoff {{voting is}} less {{vulnerable}} to <b>vote</b> <b>splitting,</b> yet <b>vote</b> <b>splitting</b> can occur in any round of runoff voting. Although instant runoff voting (IRV) uses ranked ballots, secondary preferences are considered in the same sequence as in multiple rounds of voting, so this method does not reduce the vote-splitting effect (compared to runoff voting).|$|R

25|$|IRV has {{the effect}} of {{avoiding}} <b>split</b> <b>votes</b> when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters. As a simple example, suppose there are two candidates with similar views, A and B, and a third with different views, C, with first-preference totals of 35% for candidate A, 25% for B and 40% for C. In a plurality voting election, candidate C may win with 40% of the votes, even though 60% of electors prefer both A and B over C. Alternatively, voters are pressured to choose the seemingly stronger candidate of either A or B, despite personal preference for the other, in order to help ensure the defeat of C. With IRV, the electors backing B as their first choice can rank A second, which means candidate A will win by 60% to 40% over C despite the <b>split</b> <b>vote</b> in first choices.|$|R
