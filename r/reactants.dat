5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid <b>reactants,</b> which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid <b>reactants</b> {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the <b>reactants</b> are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring <b>reactants</b> can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 18th century, two laws about {{chemical}} reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the law of conservation of mass, formulated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the <b>reactants</b> have the same mass as the products). The second was the law of definite proportions. First proven by the French chemist Joseph Louis Proust in 1799, this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.|$|E

A sample of 99 male and female clients from a community mental health agency participated in this study. The predictive validity of the TRS was not supported by the findings. High <b>reactant</b> subjects as indicated on the TRS did not differ significantly from low <b>reactant</b> subjects on the outcome criteria. ^ High <b>reactant</b> subjects differed significantly from low <b>reactant</b> subjects on the number of no-shows, and length of treatment. Surprisingly, subjects who were identified as high <b>reactant</b> demonstrated a longer length of treatment than low <b>reactant</b> subjects. The Therapist Rating of Reactance Scale (TRR) was significantly correlated with the outcome criteria. Subjects identified as high <b>reactant</b> on the TRR reported less improvement from therapy than low <b>reactant</b> subjects. ^ Convergent validity for the TRS was established. The TRS was significantly correlated with the K Scale and the Locus of Control Scale. The findings also partially supported the divergent validity of the TRS when compared to the Counselor Rating Form-Short Version. ^ Support for the theory of psychological reactance was suggested and several limitations of the study were noted and discussed. Implications for further research were offered and the author argued for increased counselor training on the issue of oppositional clients. ...|$|R
40|$|This study numerically investigates methanol-steam {{reforming}} (MSR) {{in miniature}} annulus type reactors with <b>reactant</b> flow disturbance and hot gas flow heat supply. The <b>reactant</b> flow disturbance {{is created by}} placing baffle plates into an inner tube packed with catalyst particles and heated using hot gas flow in {{the gap between the}} inner and outer annulus tubes. It was found that the baffle plate increases the heat transfer area and creates flow fluctuations inside the catalyst bed, which lead to enhanced heat transfer between the hot gas and <b>reactant</b> flows and also leads to higher mass transfer inside the catalyst bed. The <b>reactant</b> flow temperature can be increased closer to the hot gas flow temperature, and the enhanced mass transfer between the catalyst particles and <b>reactant</b> flow stream leads to improved methanol conversion in the reformer. The pressure drop across the reactor was found to be not significantly influenced by the baffle plates in miniature scale reactors. It was also found that reducing the thermal resistance between the hot gas flow and <b>reactant</b> flow can further improve the methanol conversion...|$|R

25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the <b>reactants</b> (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the <b>reactants</b> or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the <b>reactants</b> and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the <b>reactants</b> and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E
