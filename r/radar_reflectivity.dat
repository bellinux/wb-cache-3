5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivity</b> at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and is almost always found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually.

5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivity,</b> in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E

40|$|Gaining {{information}} about cirrus cloud microphysics requires development of remote sensing techniques. In an earlier paper. Matrosov et al. (1992) proposed {{a method to}} estimate ice water path (IWP) (i. e., vertically integrated ice mass content IMC) and characteristic particle size averaged through the cloud from combined groundbased measurements of <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivities</b> and IR brightness temperatures of the downwelling thermal radiation in the transparency region of 10 - 12 mu m. For some applications, the vertically averaged characteristic particle sizes and IWP could be the appropriate information to use. However, vertical profiles of cloud microphysical parameters can provide {{a better understanding of}} cloud structure and development. Here we describe a further development of the previous method by Matrosov et al. (1992) for retrieving vertical profiles of cirrus particle sizes and IMC rather than their vertically averaged values. In addition to measurements of <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivities,</b> the measurements of Doppler velocities are used in the new method. This provides us with two vertical profiles of measurements to infer two vertical profiles of unknowns, i. e., particle characteristic sizes and IMC. Simultaneous measurements of the IR brightness temperatures are still needed to resolve an ambiguity in particle size-fall velocity relationships...|$|R

2500|$|A {{second problem}} is the smaller non-ambiguous radial {{velocity}} or Nyquist velocity.

Algorithms to correct for this do not always yield the proper results. NEXRAD has a threshold that is twice as high (...) and thus less processing and interpretation are needed. Because of this, the resolution of <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivity</b> for small scale features such as mesocyclones might be better in TDWR, but the velocity resolution may be worse, {{or at the very least}} incorrectly analyzed.|$|E

40|$|Although many radar {{profiles}} {{and images}} of the area within 20 deg of Mercury's equator had been obtained from 1971 to 1981, at both Goldstone and Arecibo radar facilities, surprisingly little geological analysis had been done with these data until recently.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we use {{unprecedented}} bulk measurements {{of ice water}} content (IWC) up to approximately 5 gm- 3 and 95 GHz <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivities</b> (Z 95) to analyze the statistical relationship between these two quantities and its variability. The unique aspect {{of this study is}} that these IWC – Z 95 relationships do not use assumptions on cloud microphysics or backscattering calculations. IWCs greater than 2 gm- 3 are also included for the first time in such analysis, owing to improved bulk IWC probe technology and a flight program targeting high ice water content. Using a single IWC – Z 95 relationship allows for the retrieval of IWC from <b>radar</b> <b>reflectivities</b> with less than 30 % bias and 40 - 70 % rms difference. These errors can be reduced further down to 10 - 20 % bias over the whole IWC range using the temperature variability of this relationship. IWC errors largely increase for Z 95 > 15 - 16 dBZ, due to the distortion of the IWC – Z 95 relationship by non-Rayleigh scattering effects. A non-linear relationship is proposed to reduce these errors down to 20 % bias and 20 - 35 % rms differences. This non-linear relationship also outperforms the temperature-dependent IWC – Z 95 relationship for convective profiles. The joint frequency distribution of IWC and temperature within and around deep tropical convective cores shows that at the - 50 °C ± 5 °C level – the cruise altitude of many commercial jet aircraft – IWCs greater than 1. 5 gm- 3 were found exclusively in convective profiles...|$|R
