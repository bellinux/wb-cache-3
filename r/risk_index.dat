Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami.

This vulnerability was evident when Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras in 1998 causing $4 billion in damage and claiming 7,000 lives. Yet climate change is expected to bring even greater weather variability to Honduras with less precipitation overall but more powerful storms and heavy rain during hurricane season spawning landslides and floods. Tegucigalpa and neighboring Comayagüela (which together form the Honduran capital) are the most affected, due to deforestation and the increased vulnerability to landslides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Real time <b>risk</b> <b>indexing</b> {{is one of}} the {{objectives}} of new generation environmental monitoring systems. It is a set of continuous indications, which have correlation to probable risks in time domain. Sensor fusion has an important role in <b>risk</b> <b>indexing</b> depending on multi-sensor / multi-station environmental measurements. In this study, a flexible data acquisition and processing architecture for risk management has been proposed due to experimental results of a pilot site, which is operated for an earthquake forecast project. The proposed method allows an optimized progress from sensors to decision making mechanism. A six-layered structure has been used in the proposed indexing system. It is consisted of a measurement layer where various sensors are placed in different geographical locations, station management system, communication layer, data record, data processing (pattern classification), and <b>risk</b> <b>indexing</b> calculations for decision-making. The proposed architecture has been applied for a seismic <b>risk</b> <b>indexing</b> system through a stationary network in Northwestern Anatolia. Decreasing the operational costs and the nature of <b>risk</b> <b>indexing</b> due to special placement requirements of some sensor types requires hybrid networking.

However, other systemic risk factors of OMJ remain unclear. Importantly, the possibility of risk classification based on the clinical characteristics of patients has not been explored. Here, we clarified risk factors of OMJ and evaluate the predictive accuracy of <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> in osteoporosis patients. METHODS: We performed sub-analysis using a database developed for a retrospective cohort study in patients taking medications for osteoporosis at Kyoto University Hospital. <b>Risk</b> <b>indices</b> for OMJ were constructed using logistic regression analysis, and odds ratios (OR) for OMJ cases and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Potential risk factors included in the statistical analysis were age; sex; diabetes; use of oral BPs, corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, antirheumatic drugs, and biologic agents; and their interactions. <b>Risk</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated by the sum of potential risk factors of an individual patient multiplied by the regression coefficients. The discriminatory power of the <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In analysis of all patients, oral BPs (OR: 4. 98, 95 % CIs: 1. 94 - 12. 75), age (OR: 1. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 1. 60) and sex-chemotherapy interaction (OR: 11. 70, 95 % CI: 1. 46 - 93. 64) were significant risk factors of OMJ. Areas under the ROC curves of these <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> provided moderate sensitivity or specificity regardless of group (0. 683 to 0. 718).

40|$|Dengue {{has become}} the most {{widespread}} vector borne viral diseases of human with the the rough estimates of between 60 and 100 million cases of dengue fever annually worldwide. In Malaysia, the number of dengue cases has shown a steadily increasing pattern from year 2000 to 2005. The total number of dengue cases in 2000 is about 7000 cases whereas in 2005, the number of cases mounting to 40000. Until now, the traditional approach in Controlling dengue is through visual analysis using case incidence data. This study proposed a new set of parameter which define dengue occurrence at an area according to its time characteristics. The parameter used is frequency index, duration index and intensity index. The objectives of this study were to measure the temporally defined <b>risk</b> <b>indices,</b> to map the measured temporal <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> and to statistically prove the relationship between each temporal <b>risk</b> <b>indices.</b> Measurement of the three temporal <b>risk</b> <b>indices</b> found that there are areas with significant high value for each of the temporal indices. This suggests that areas within Subang Jaya Municipality have different temporal characteristics for dengue occurrence. Value of frequency index is quite low which is below the half mark of 1. 1 indicates that dengue will occur every week throughout the year. Mean value of duration index is 1. 66 which point out that the mean duration of an epidemic wave is about 2 weeks. 5. 41 is the mean value for intensity index and its signify that during an epidemic wave, about 5 to 6 people in 1000 population will be infected by dengue fever. Mapping, which is a spatial analysis method, is utilized for the visual analysis of the three temporal indices. Mapping of the frequency index found out that the most areas with high value is found in 2008. The visual analysis of duration index shows that there is distribution pattern where areas which had history of high duration per wave will experienced it in the future. This is evident for Taman Serdang Raya in 2005 and 2007 and Taman Kinrara in 2006 and 2008. There is no significant distribution pattern for intensity index as the high value tends to stay at the same locality throughout the years. Ares with high intensity index value are Taman Subang Mas, PJS area and Kota Perdana. Spearman test is done to toest the correlation between each temporal <b>risk</b> <b>indices.</b> There are 3 types of relationship which are frequency-duration relation, frequency-intensity relation and durationintensity relation. The correlation coefficient for all the three types of relationship is above 0. 7.
