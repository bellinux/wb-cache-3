5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are <b>remembered</b> <b>in</b> street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set into the streets.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber.

There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is <b>remembered</b> <b>in</b> the name of the modern road that runs to the east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.|$|E
