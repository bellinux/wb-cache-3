5|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Game Informer and Dave Halverson of Play Magazine defended the game. Game Informer {{described it as}} ambitious and praised the graphics, story, amount of content, and replay value, though the publication still believed that only fans of the franchise would enjoy the game. Halverson initially gave the Xbox360 version a 9.5/10, praising each character's controls and abilities and calling it the best 3D Sonic game yet. In the following issue, Halverson reassessed it as 8.5/10, writing {{that he had been}} told that the load times and glitches in his <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> would not be in {{the final version of the}} game. In a later review of the PlayStation3 version, Halverson was frustrated that the problems had still not been corrected and that the performance was worse despite the extra development time; Halverson gave the PS3 version a 5.5/10.|$|E
500|$|Watership Down was {{rejected}} seven times {{before it was}} accepted by Rex Collings. The one-man London publisher Collings wrote to an associate, [...] "I've just taken on a novel about rabbits, one of them with extra-sensory perception. Do you think I'm mad?" [...] The associate did call it [...] "a mad risk" [...] in her obituary of Collings; [...] "a book as bizarre by an unknown writer which had been turned down by the major London publishers; {{but it was also}} dazzlingly brave and intuitive." [...] Collings had little capital and could not pay an advance but [...] "he got a <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> onto every desk in London that mattered." [...] Adams wrote that it was Collings who gave Watership Down its title. There was a second edition in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Wild Games Studio made a {{copyright}} claim against Bain's negative [...] "WTF Is... ?" [...] critique of their game , {{which resulted in}} the video being taken down, despite having issued Bain with a <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> for the game, and use of copyrighted material for criticism being allowed under fair use. Bain's follow-up video responding to the takedown attracted press attention and leveled further criticism against Wild Games Studio, {{which resulted in the}} studio retracting its request.|$|E
5000|$|Before the game's initial release, Sony did {{not provide}} <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> of the game for {{critical}} reviews. According to a Sony representative, {{the reason for the}} delay was [...] "due to this year's flagship Universal Rewards feature, which will require active servers to function." [...] <b>Review</b> <b>copies</b> were distributed on the public release date, March 31.|$|R

Charles Kingsley was sent a <b>review</b> <b>copy,</b> and told Darwin that he had [...] "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species." [...] Darwin was delighted that this [...] "celebrated author and divine" [...] had [...] "gradually learnt {{to see that it}} is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws." ...|$|E

2500|$|Concern {{was raised}} by the fan {{community}} when OpenCritic, a review aggregator site, stated that there {{were going to be}} no <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> of the game prior to the public release and a review embargo that would end on the date of release. The lack of <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> is a general sign within the industry that there are concerns by the developers or publishers that a game may not live up to expectations and thus indicates that they want to minimise any impact reviews may have prior to release. However, both OpenCritic and Sony later affirmed there would be pre-release <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> and that they were waiting on a pre-release patch before sending these out to journalists. Eurogamer noted that they had expected to have <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> by 5 August, but these were pushed until 8 August so as to get the day-one patch in place, a situation they attributed to the certification process required by Sony for any games on their service. Because of the late arrival of the <b>review</b> <b>copies,</b> {{and the size of the}} game, critics presented their reviews [...] "in progress" [...] over several days, omitting a final review score until they had completed enough of the game to their satisfaction.|$|R

5000|$|The {{broadcaster}} {{was unable}} to provide Ofcom with a <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> of the programme in question because of [...] "problems with its logging system".

5000|$|Sega Saturn Magazine {{gave the}} Saturn version a 70%, calling it [...] "a decent enough effort {{with what is}} a {{particularly}} sugary film, spoilt by some frustrating flaws in the gameplay and action that is too repetitive." [...] Their next issue printed a retraction, admitting that Interplay had not sent them a <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> of Casper, and that the review was actually based on an unfinished version of the game.|$|E
50|$|An Xbox {{version of}} the game was {{originally}} developed in parallel with the PlayStation 2 version. The Xbox version was completed and a press <b>review</b> <b>copy</b> {{in the shape of}} the entire finished game was circulated among gaming publications, but the game was never commercially released. A few months before Red Star was to be released, it was featured as a playable demo on Demo Disc #35 of OXM, the Official Xbox Magazine (US).|$|E

50|$|During development, Atari {{pushed the}} {{deadline}} for the game's completion further and further forward, {{to the point where}} they were giving away <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> mere months into development, and giving Bertrand no extra facilities to help finish the game. Because the <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> did not contain a finished build of the game, it sparked negative publicity for Atari, prompting them to hold back Bertrand's wages for four months. As a result, when the game was due to be completed in December 1995, Bertrand gave Atari an incomplete build of the game to release, stating that he'd give them the finished product once he was given the back payments owed to him. Atari refused and released the unfinished build.|$|R

I would certainly buy this book even if I had not been sent a <b>review</b> <b>copy,</b> and whenever I get too misty-eyed about officer-man relationships I shall reread it to remind me of how badly things could go wrong. And of just how vital it is, for any democratic society seeking to use war as an instrument of policy, to ensure that the connection between war's means and its political ends is crystal clear.

Much less common is the lettered limited edition book that could have denotations such as [...] "1 of 26" [...] or [...] "1/26" [...] or [...] "A of 26" [...] or [...] "Copy A", etc. Sometimes {{a copy of a}} limited edition book is stated as being [...] "out of series": this is an unnumbered copy, often a <b>review</b> <b>copy.</b>|$|E

However, since Penn & Teller were owed money when Absolute Entertainment went out of business, any rights pertaining to their intellectual property, likenesses and performance within the title were revoked.

In 1934 it was described by the T. S. Matthews, the literary editor of Time magazine, in The New Republic, as [...] "A story of post-war London; one of the few convincing suicide stories I remember." [...] In 2013 it was described as [...] "a story about jaded heterosexual bohemians." ...|$|E
50|$|EA did {{not provide}} <b>review</b> <b>copies</b> of the game until September 1, meaning that critics were unable to review the game before release.

[...] The book was on the Times' bestseller list for hardcover nonfiction {{as well as those}} of Publishers Weekly and the Washington Post. Simon Maloy, writing for Media Matters for America, and John Oswald, of New York Daily News, both called the book [...] "ridiculous crap."

Woolf reports one such favorable response in her diary of 7 May 1938. [...] "I am pleased this morning because Lady Rhonda writes that she is profoundly excited and moved by Three Guineas.
