5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a <b>riverine</b> <b>forest</b> along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
25|$|Mopane {{woodland}} savannah predominates in the area, {{with smaller}} areas of miombo and Rhodesian teak woodland and scrubland savannah. <b>Riverine</b> <b>forest</b> with palm trees lines {{the banks and}} islands above the falls. The most notable aspect of the area's vegetation though is the rainforest nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm {{and a number of}} creepers and lianas. Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, and so have the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syroâ€“Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a <b>riverine</b> <b>forest.</b> Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E

500|$|A snake {{of forest}} or woodland, {{it is the}} only one of Africa's cobras that will live in high forest. The forest cobras are snakes that are well adapted to many environments and the habitat of the forest cobra is {{strongly}} dependent on what part of its African range the snake originates from. Forest cobras originating in the southern African regions are typically found in savanna and grassland, but they can also be found in broken rock country. They are mainly found in the tropical and subtropical rainforest regions of west and central Africa. It also inhabits mangroves in western Africa. The banded form of forest cobra in west Africa lives in savanna and grassland (but usually along streams) and well vegetated areas, especially <b>riverine</b> <b>forest,</b> up to latitude 14 N. The species' preferred habitat are lowland forest and moist savanna where it favours coastal thickets. This snake seems to be highly adaptable and will readily move into drier areas if it can. In western Kenya, the forest cobra has been found in wide stretched grassland areas. The population of forest cobras in Uganda are almost always found close to water. The brown colour phase occurs in coastal and high altitude forest, woodland and thicket, and grassland areas (i.e. Nyanga, Zimbabwe). Due to its secretive habits, and fondness for living in holes, it often persists in quite well-inhabited areas, common in and around many central African towns, even long after most vegetation has gone. They are also found on fruit plantations where they live in the trees. It occurs through a wide altitude range, from sea-level to forested mountains at [...] above sea-level.|$|E

It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi.

40|$|The {{colonization}} and {{consolidation of}} Brazil's territory {{has been based}} mainly on predatory exploitation of natural resources, what affect specially the quality of water. The environmental degradation throughout the <b>riverine</b> <b>forests</b> is explained by {{the value of these}} areas, i. e. source of water for cattle, to timber products forest and electricity generation. Because of this, this study aimed to map the deforestation in <b>riverine</b> <b>forests</b> in Canarana - MT, Brazil, using geoprocessing techniques. Canarana has 17, 183 inhabitants with 13, 059 living in urban areas and 4, 124 living in rural areas. The economy of the municipality is basically the livestock, agriculture (soybean, corn and rice) and agro-industry. We considered the deforestation occurred in <b>riverine</b> <b>forests</b> in Canarana, over the years 2000, 2003 and 2005. The mapping was based on images of Landsat 5 and CBERS 2 satellites, using SPRING software to create the supervised classification of land in the interest areas. We also worked on the ground, using a GPS set, to check the results produced by the software. Toward set all database and delineate the <b>riverine</b> <b>forests,</b> we used ArcGis 9. 2 software. The <b>riverine</b> <b>forests</b> in Canarana comprise 130. 234 ha and we could identify five different classes of uses: clouds, water, deforestation, forest and altered areas. The deforestation increased from 24, 540 to 32, 420 ha. The main reason for that is the increase of agriculture. Thus, the landowners should plan and order their productive activities to keep the rivers and springs. To do that, we suggest the use of GIS techniques. Pages: 3439 - 344...|$|R
