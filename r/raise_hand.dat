40|$|This paper reports {{research}} on {{the implementation of a}} web-based videoconferencing tool (Interwise) for synchronous learning sessions on an industrial technology course offered through a university in northern Taiwan. The participants included undergraduate students from the same course offered in two different semesters. We investigated students’ perceptions of interactions with the instructor and fellow students, their confidence in utilizing the Internet (Internet self-efficacy), and the satisfaction level that students perceived throughout the learning process with Interwise. We also examined the effect of interactions and Internet self-efficacy on student satisfaction. Data collected through paper-based and online surveys were analyzed using correlation and multiple regression. The results revealed that overall, learners perceived Interwise as a tool that was moderately easy to use for synchronous learning. Learners seemed to prefer using the Interwise features, such as emotion icons, talk, or <b>raise</b> <b>hand,</b> to interact with their instructor. Learners had high confidence in gathering data or getting support through the Internet, but low confidence in resolving Internet related problems. Both learner-learner and learner-instructor interactions were significant predictors of student satisfaction, while Internet self-efficacy did not significantly contribute to satisfaction. Learner-instructor interaction was found to be the strongest predictor of student satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Social {{skills are}} {{important}} components of social-emotional functioning that allow {{children to be}} successful in both the social and academic spheres of school. A review of social skills intervention literature is presented including issues influencing effectiveness. Concerns associated with assessing the effects of social skills interventions are discussed and a formative assessment tool for behavioral observation is presented. The use of generalizability theory is then examined as a psychometrically based approach to developing a measure for observing social skills. Four prerequisite social skill areas were identified: (a) Attending, (b), <b>Raise</b> <b>Hand,</b> (c) Hands to Self, and (d) Transition. Transition was divided into two components for a total of five observed skills. Students in an elementary school were observed during regular classroom activities on three different occasions for each skill. The reliability of this strategy was evaluated in order to assess the optimal number of occasions and observers needed in order to obtain adequate degrees of reliability. Results identified particular skills that can be observed more reliably than others, and what combination of parameters might lead to optimal reliability. Preliminary descriptive analyses suggest that ethnicity might play a role in student performance of specific skills. Results are discussed in terms of applied use for the measure in school settings for formative assessment and in terms of directions for future research. ...|$|E

Therefore, to make the teaching and learning speaking more interesting and easy to understand, the teacher should use some techniques of teaching effectively.

In this study, the researcher used qualitative research design to describe the phenomenon in speaking class. The researcher used qualitative research design based on the purposes of study that observed phenomenon in speaking class naturally. The data of this research was collected from the class observation and interview the English teacher. In addition, the data was displayed in the form of narrative. The result of observation and interview showed that the English teacher used four teaching techniques while teaching speaking, such as: drilling, question and answer, small group, and presentation. Those techniques were used in order to make the students speak up. However, there were also some problems faced by the teacher in implementing the techniques, such as: students were lazy to <b>raise</b> <b>hand,</b> students could not catch the lesson well, students were shy to the teacher, teacher could not control the class, and students were less vocabulary. Also, the teacher had some ways to solve those problems, such as: the teacher tried to be open minded, making a study club, force the students to speak, motivate the students not to be afraid of making mistakes, asking others suggestions, and giving some new vocabulary...|$|E
