50|$|Dillinger Hütte is a steel {{producer}} in Dillingen, in the German Federal State of Saarland, {{and has a}} history stretching back {{more than three hundred}} years. The plant was founded in 1685, and was Germany's first Aktiengesellschaft, or joint stock company (1809). The first continuous-caster for slabs in the world was commissioned in Dillingen in 1962. A further machine, permitting casting of slabs of up to 400 mm in thickness - the thickest produced anywhere in the world at that time - was added, along with other new facilities, in 1998. In 2010, Dillinger Hütte successfully produced the first 450 mm thick slab - another world record. The principal equipment in the rolling mill now takes the form of two four-high stands, of which one is currently the largest in the world, with an effective <b>rolling</b> <b>width</b> of 5.5 m and a rolling pressure of 110 MN.|$|E
40|$|The {{circular}} blade {{has been widely}} used in some projects such as cutting stone, wood and other projects. Owing to its particularity and wide use, it has an important position in cutting industry. Roll tensioning is considered as an effective method {{which can be used}} to improve the stiffness and performance of the circular saw blade. The effect of rolling position and width in the roll tensioning is obvious. In this paper the calculation of the maximum stiffness at different rolling position and width in the rolling were carried out through the finite -element. The results show that three ideal points are found. And when rolling position is Ø 950 mm and <b>rolling</b> <b>width</b> is 20 mm, the maximum stiffness of the circular saw blade whose minimum deformation is 0. 028 mm is found. The roll tensioning can increase the stiffness of the saw blade. It will provide a theoretical basis and guidance for the actual production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Bendability is {{constrained}} by maximum top roller load imparting {{capacity of the}} machine. Maximum load is encountered during the edge pre-bending stage of roller bending. Capacity of 3 -roller plate bending machine is specified by maximum thickness and minimum shell diameter combinations that can be pre-bend for given plate material of maximum width. Commercially available plate width or width of the plate that can be accommodated on machine decides the maximum <b>rolling</b> <b>width.</b> Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) provide the machine capacity chart based on reference material considering perfectly plastic material model. Reported work shows the bendability analysis of heavy duty 3 -roller plate bending machine. The input variables for the industry are plate thickness, shell diameter and material property parameters, as it is fixed by the design. Analytical models of equivalent thickness, equivalent width and maximum width based on power law material model were derived to study the bendability. Equation of maximum width provides bendability for designed configuration i. e. material property, shell diameter and thickness combinations within the machine limitations. Equivalent thicknesses based on perfectly plastic and power law material model were compared for four different materials grades of C-Mn steel in order to predict the bend-ability. Effect of top roller offset on the bendability at maximum top roller load imparting capacity is reported.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve surface {{glossiness}} of stainless steel strips in cold rolling, an experiment on roughness and glossiness of SUS 430 ferrite stainless steel {{was carried out in}} laboratory. The relation between roughness and glossiness with reduction in height, roll surface roughness, emulsion parameters was investigated. Roughness and micro defects were analyzed. The effects of micro defects on lubrication oil in deformation zone and reduction were discussed. With the increasing of reduction ratio strip surface roughness Ra(s), Rp(s) and Rv(s) were decreasing along <b>rolling</b> and <b>width</b> direction, the drop value in rolling direction was faster than that in width direction. The roughness and glossiness were obtained under emulsion concentration Ce = 3 % and 6 %, temperature Te = 55 and 63 °C, roll surface roughness Ra(r) = 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1. 0 μm. The glossiness was declined rapidly when the micro defects ratio was above 23 %. When lubrication oil in micro pit of deformation zone was decreased, micro defects were decreased, and glossiness value on the surface of strip was increased...|$|R

30|$|Roll {{flattening}} is {{an important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll flattening calculation. However, the roll flattening calculated by traditional flattening models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll flattening, a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll flattening are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll flattening for different <b>rolling</b> force, flattening <b>width,</b> roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to roll end and the roll diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll flattening is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the roll end, which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R
40|$|Titanium and its alloys have {{extremely}} high {{strength to weight}} ratio and corrosion resistance. This has made titanium alloys very attractive materials for many structural applications. However, {{the high price of}} these alloys has seen their use restricted to very few high performance areas such as aerospace and bio-medical applications. The costs can be significantly reduced by directly converting titanium powder to metal products, particularly via the direct powder rolling process. This present research is based on a parametric study of powder rolling and operational effects including rolling speed, roll gap size, roll surface width and powder feeding rate on the integrity of the metal powder compacted strip that is produced from the direct powder rolling process. The objectives of this work were to predict the powder rolling compaction performance in terms of compaction pressure, roll surface force and rolling torque, and produce the highest possible relative density of CP-titanium green strips by optimized rolling variable setups, and to achieve its full density by additional hot deformation processing. In this work, a purpose-built gravity fed vertical powder rolling mill with a roller diameter of 265 mm and a roller width of 150 mm was used. Johanson's powder rolling model has been implemented to simulate performance and a series of rolling parameter setups have been conducted by the using a purpose-built powder rolling mill. Pre-alloyed, water-atomized stainless steel 316 L powder and hydride-dehydride (HDH) CP-titanium powders with a mean particle size of 100 μm were used as the experimental material to validate the simulated results in terms of relative density and strip dimensions. The powder rolling experiments were carried out based on the Johanson's powder rolling model to conduct a parametric experimental study in various setups of powder rolling parameter combinations, including roll gap, roll face <b>width,</b> <b>rolling</b> speed and powder feeding rate...|$|R
40|$|Bilge keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and {{the usage of}} them covers almost all the sea going vessels. This paper focuses on the viscous effect of the bilge keel, ignored {{the effect of the}} free surface and the effect of the ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic of the bilge keel. In order to investigate the viscous effect of the bilge keel on the total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels <b>width,</b> <b>rolling</b> periods, as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without bilge keels in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. The primary calculation of damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and the bilge keels, and when the bilge keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by the bilge keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while the width of the bilge keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the damping moment caused by the bilge keels. The present work shows an interesting problem, and it is useful for the bilge keel design...|$|R
