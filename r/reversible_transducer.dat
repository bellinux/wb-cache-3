40|$|Abstract—As an {{alternative}} to self-sensing, we propose the concept of shared-sensing for reversible transducers. In shared-sensing, reversible transducers are continuously switched between actuator and sensor modes. This results in a hybrid system, and, in this paper, we investigate stability properties of the equilibrium for linear systems and a class of nonlinear systems with a single shared-sensing transducer. Our theoretical results are validated through simulations and experiments with a dc servo motor.

40|$|Two-layer flexure beams often {{serve as}} basic {{transducers}} in actuators and sensors. In this paper a generalized description of their stimuli-influenced mechanical behavior is derived. For small deflection angles this description includes a multi-port circuit or network representation with lumped elements for a beam part of finite length. A number of coupled finite beam parts model the dynamic behavior {{including the first}} natural frequencies of the beam. For piezoelectric and piezomagnetic interactions, <b>reversible</b> <b>transducer</b> models are developed. The piezomagnetic two-layer beam model is extended to include solenoid and planar coils. Linear network theory is applied {{in order to determine}} network parameters and to simplify the circuit representation. The resulting circuit model is the basis for a fast simulation of the dynamic system behavior with advanced circuit simulators and, thus, the optimization of the system. It is also a useful tool for understanding and explaining this multi-domain system through basic principles of general system theory...|$|E
40|$|Deterministic two-way {{transducers}} {{define the}} robust class of regular functions which is, among other good properties, closed under composition. However, {{the best known}} algorithms for composing two-way transducers cause a double exponential blow-up {{in the size of}} the inputs. In this paper, we introduce a class of transducers for which the composition has polynomial complexity. It is the class of reversible transducers, for which the computation steps can be reversed deterministically. While in the one-way setting this class is not very expressive, we prove that any two-way transducer can be made reversible through a single exponential blow-up. As a consequence, we prove that the composition of two-way transducers can be done with a single exponential blow-up in the number of states. A uniformization of a relation is a function with the same domain and which is included in the original relation. Our main result actually states that we can uniformize any non-deterministic two-way transducer by a <b>reversible</b> <b>transducer</b> with a single exponential blow-up, improving the known result by de Souza which has a quadruple exponential complexity. As a side result, our construction also gives a quadratic transformation from copyless streaming string transducers to two-way transducers, improving the exponential previous bound.

We measure the temperature raise during the exothermic oxidation of H 2 by the catalyst. An appropriate formulation of about 1 mg of PdPt/Al 2 O 3 leads to reversible thermal responses of 3 °C in only 5 s.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} by which the free-field, open-circuit voltage sensitivity of a <b>reversible</b> underwater acoustic <b>transducer</b> may be obtained from measurements of its input electrical impedance in water and in air. This method, which we have termed the Delta-Z reciprocity calibration method, is being developed for the in-service calibration of sonar transducers installed in domes which can be flooded and purged. The application of the Delta-Z method to the calibration of a single tonpilz-type piezoelectric sonar transducer is described. The resulting sensitivity obtained using the Delta-Z method agrees within approximately one decibel with that obtained by a standard comparison calibration procedure over a two-octave frequency band about the nominal operating frequency of the transducer...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimiteda method {{for determining the}} free-field open circuit voltage sensitivity of a <b>reversible</b> underwater electroacoustic <b>transducer</b> from the difference in its input electrical impedance when loaded by water and air was investigated theoretically and experimentally. An equation for the sensitivity was derived using reciprocal two-port network theory. The theory {{takes into account the}} diffraction due to the finite size of the transducer, its finite mechanical impedance, and its free-field radiation impedance in water, An experiment to test the predictions of the theory was performed using a 6 " diameter, hollow, piezoelectric ceramic spherical transducer. The result of the experiment agreed within several dB with a standard comparison calibration over the frequency range for which both the electrical impedance and comparison calibration data are considered reliable. The calibration method described, which has been termed the Delta-Z method, may be useful for in-situ monitoring of transducer sensitivity in installations which can be flooded and purged.
