50|$|Chemical {{castration}} is castration via anaphrodisiacal drugs, {{whether to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>libido</b> and sexual activity, to treat cancer, or otherwise. Unlike surgical castration, where the gonads are removed through an incision in the body, chemical castration does not remove organs, {{nor is it}} a form of sterilization. Chemical castration is generally considered reversible when treatment is discontinued, although permanent effects in body chemistry can sometimes be seen, {{as in the case of}} bone density loss increasing with length of use of DMPA.|$|R
5000|$|Into the 1900s, {{homosexual}} activity remained {{illegal and}} punishable by imprisonment. In the early 1950s the police actively enforced laws prohibiting sexual behaviour between men. This policy {{led to a}} number of high-profile arrests and trials. One of those involved the noted scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker Alan Turing (1912-1954), convicted in 1952 of [...] "gross indecency". Turing was given a choice between imprisonment or probation conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to <b>reduce</b> <b>libido.</b> He accepted chemical castration via oestrogen hormone injections.|$|R
500|$|Secondary {{dysfunction}} {{results from}} factors that follow from the injury, such as loss of bladder and bowel control or impaired movement. The main barrier to sexual activity {{that people with}} SCI cite is physical limitation; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning. Spasticity, tightening of muscles due to increased muscle tone, is another complication that interferes with sex. Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function: antidepressants, muscle relaxants, sleeping pills and drugs that treat spasticity. Hormonal changes [...] that alter sexual function may take place after SCI; levels of prolactin heighten, women temporarily stop menstruating (amenorrhea), and men experience reduced levels of testosterone. Testosterone deficiency causes <b>reduced</b> <b>libido,</b> increased weakness, fatigue, and failure to respond to erection-enhancing drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms include rapid weight gain, {{particularly}} {{of the trunk}} and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity). Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the collarbone, {{on the back of}} the neck ("buffalo hump" [...] or lipodystrophy), and on the face ("moon face"). Other symptoms include excess sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs, or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or extremely dry and brittle hair. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypocalcemia. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, insomnia, inhibited aromatase, <b>reduced</b> <b>libido,</b> impotence in men, and amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhea and infertility in women due to elevations in androgens. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of GnRH release.|$|E

50|$|Antiandrogens and {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be prescribed to lower sex drive. Cyproterone acetate {{is the most}} commonly used antiandrogen, except in the United States, where it may not be available. A large body of literature has shown that it reduces general sexual fantasies. Side effects may include osteoporosis, liver dysfunction, and feminization. Case studies have found that the antiandrogen medroxyprogesterone acetate is successful in reducing sexual interest, but can have side effects including osteoporosis, diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, feminization, and weight gain. Some hospitals use leuprolide acetate and goserelin acetate to <b>reduce</b> <b>libido,</b> and while there is presently little evidence for their efficacy, they have fewer side effects than other antiandrogens. A number of studies support the use of SSRIs, which may be preferable over antiandrogens because of their relatively benign side effects.

Diabetes results in <b>reduced</b> fertility and <b>libido.</b> Medicinal plants have attracted much attention in controlling many diseases such as diabetes. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of garlic juice on testicular damage. Methods: Forty male rats (250 ± 20) were divided into 5 groups as follows: 1 - Group normal (N) 2 - Group Normal+Garlic (N+G) received garlic juice for 6 weeks. 3 - Diabetic (D) received streptozotocin (STZ), 60 mg/kg BW/i. p. 4 - Group diabetic+garlic before (D+Gb) received garlic juice for 3 weeks before STZ injection and continued for more 3 weeks. 5 - Group diabetic+garlic after (D+Ga) three days after STZ injection, they received garlic juice for 3 weeks. Garlic juice was given by gavage (1 ml/ 100 g BW). Number of leydig cells, testis weight, serum levels of testosterone and estradiol were assessed. Results: diabetic rats showed a marked {{decrease in the number}} of leydig cells, testis weight, serum levels of testosterone and estradiol. Garlic juice significantly increased the number of leydig cells, testis weight, serum levels of testosterone and estradiol in group 4 and 5 compared to group 3. The diabetic group receiving garlic before STZ injection showed more amelioration in complications than that receiving it after STZ injection. Conclusion: these results suggest that garlic juice supplementation could play both preventive and therapeutic role on testicular damage in diabetic rats...|$|R

40|$|Hyperprolactinemia can <b>reduce</b> {{fertility}} and <b>libido.</b> Although central prolactin actions {{are thought to}} contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, {{but only in the}} presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin’s signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT 5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS- 1 and - 3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS- 1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS- 3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS- 3 and CIS. Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL-R, SOCS- 3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin...|$|R
5000|$|Aging: Operating {{through the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the {{anterior}} pituitary gland also affects the reproductive system. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates {{the release of}} luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone. Then the gonads produce estrogen and testosterone. The decrease in release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) caused by normal aging {{may be responsible for}} impotence [...] and frailty [...] in elderly men because of the eventual decrease in production of testosterone.

50|$|Unlike {{testosterone}} {{and certain}} other AAS, nandrolone is not potentiated in androgenic tissues like the scalp, skin, and prostate, and hence, deleterious effects in these tissues are lessened to a degree. This is because nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase to the much weaker androgen 5α-dihydronandrolone (DHN), which has both reduced {{affinity for the}} androgen receptor (AR) relative to nandrolone in vitro and weaker androgenic activity in vivo. The lack of alkylation on the 17α-carbon drastically reduces the hepatotoxic potential of nandrolone. Estrogenic effects resulting from reaction with aromatase are also reduced due to lessened enzyme interaction, but effects such as gynaecomastia and <b>reduced</b> <b>libido</b> may still occur at sufficiently high doses.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 1982, Lothane {{published}} {{a series of}} papers on what he termed [...] "love writ large": i.e. love as a feeling, an emotion and an activity, and thus {{as the foundation of}} interpersonal relationships in couples and among people in larger social encounters and contexts. For Lothane, love and its antagonist hatred, manifesting as aggression in speech and violence in acts, are not merely feelings but also the most important actions, behaviors, or conducts in interpersonal relations. Love has been a neglected and poorly understood topic in psychiatric and psychoanalytic writings, according to Lothane. This view led Lothane to highlight a significant split in Freud: (1) one the one hand, empirically, starting in 1890, first in his practicing of suggestion and later as a psychotherapist, Freud recognized the role of interpersonal love and (2) on the other hand, theoretically, in the 1905 Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, Freud <b>reduced</b> love to <b>libido,</b> postulating that friendship and love are derivatives of the sexual instinct. It is {{as a result of the}} latter theory that Freud has been chastised by a number of critics for lacking an interpersonal approach. For example, see [...] "relational psychoanalysis". Lothane has argued the opposite thesis, claiming there to be an [...] "interpersonal Freud" [...] that has remained largely unrecognized in the psychoanalytic tradition. Whereas, Lothane maintains, Freud is monadic, i.e. focused on the intrapersonal experiences of the patient, in his theories of disorder, in his psychoanalytic method Freud is consistently dyadic, i.e., interpersonal.|$|R
40|$|Premenstrual {{dysphoria}} (PMD) afflicts 7 % of {{all women}} of fertile age, and is characterized by symptoms such as irritability, sadness, and mood swings, appearing regularly before menstruation, and being of such severity that they markedly reduce quality of life. The symptoms are dependent of sex steroids, and seem {{to be under the}} influence of serotonin, since they respond to treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Panic disorder (PD) afflicts 3 % of the population, and is characterized by anxiety attacks, often dominated by respiratory symptoms. PD is more common in women than in men, and fluctuations in levels of sex steroids have been reported to influence the symptom intensity. Like patients with PMD, subjects with PD respond to treatment with SRIs. PMD and PD also display other similarities; both diagnoses hence are associated with enhanced respiratory variability, and with an enhanced sensitivity to the anxiety-provoking effects of CO 2 and lactate. One purpose of this work was to develop an animal model of premenstrual irritability, and to use this to elucidate the role of serotonin and sex steroids for this condition. In order to shed further light on the respiratory abnormalities characterizing both PMD and PD, and the possible role of the estrus cycle in this context, we also studied respiratory rate, tidal volume and respiratory variability in freely moving rats. Finally, a third purpose, prompted by the suggestion that progesterone, by influencing respiration, is involved in the pathophysiology of PD, was to examine to what extent PMD and PD are associated with polymorphisms in the progesterone receptor gene. Results: Some but not all female Wistar rat displayed aggressive behavior in the resident intruder paradigm during the non-receptive phase of the cycle. Like the symptoms of PMD, this behavior was abolished by ovariectomy, and reinstated - in rats that had displayed aggression before gonadectomy - by exogenous sex steroids. Treatment with two different SRIs was shown to reduce estrus cycle-related aggression; this effect was observed rapidly after drug administration, unabated during long-term treatment, and partially counteracted by a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist. Tentatively corresponding to SRI-induced <b>reduced</b> in <b>libido</b> in humans, a reduction in sexual motivation was observed in SRI-treated rats. Respiratory rate was shown to be estrus cycle-dependent, but only in rats showing cycle-related aggression; these animals also displayed enhanced respiratory variability. Aggressive and non-aggressive rats also differed with respect to brain monoamine metabolism, but not with respect to sex steroids in serum. PD in women, but not PMD, was associated with a promoter polymorphism (G 331 A) in the progesterone receptor gene. Conclusion: It is suggested that estrus cycle-related aggression in a subgroup of female Wistar rats corresponds to premenstrual irritability. An enhanced brain responsiveness to sex steroids is suggested to influence both aggression and respiration, and may tentatively be due either to an increase in sex steroid receptor responsiveness or to a dysfunction in serotonergic neurons mediating or modulating the effects of sex steroids. The possible relevance of these findings and hypotheses for the biology of PD and PMD is being discussed...|$|R
