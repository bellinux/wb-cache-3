5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she {{said that she}} would not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E

25|$|Leopold {{discovered}} that {{his two children}} were musically gifted in about 1759, when he began with keyboard lessons for the seven-year-old Nannerl. The toddler Wolfgang immediately began imitating his sister, at first picking out thirds on the keyboard and then making rapid progress under Leopold's instruction. By 1762, the children were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as concert performers, and Leopold began taking the family on extensive concert tours, performing for both aristocracy and public, throughout central and western Europe. This tour included Munich, Vienna, Presburg, Paris and the Hague together with a lengthy stay in London; see Mozart family Grand Tour.|$|E
25|$|As her {{correspondence}} shows, while Barnave {{was taking}} great political risks {{in the belief}} that the queen was his political ally and had managed, despite her unpopularity, to secure a moderate majority <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with her, Marie Antoinette was not considered sincere in her cooperation with the moderate leaders of the French Revolution, which ultimately ended any chance to establish a moderate government. Moreover, the view that the unpopular queen was controlling the king further degraded the royal couple's standing with the people, which the Jacobins successfully exploited after their return from Varennes to advance their radical agenda to abolish the monarchy. This situation lasted until the spring of 1792.|$|E

500|$|Three of {{the four}} bullets that struck Lennon's back passed {{completely}} through his body {{and out of his}} chest, one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; nearly all of them would have been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact. Lynn later stated to reporters on the extent of Lennon's injuries: [...] "If he [...] had been shot this way {{in the middle of the}} operating room with a whole team of surgeons <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on him... he still wouldn't have survived his injuries".|$|E

[...] Chris Anfinsen, Richards's friend and his colleague as editors of Advances in Protein Chemistry and who recommended the Carlsberg Lab to him, was also an avid sailor, and they sometimes joined forces.

500|$|During {{his time}} at Sainte-Martine, the young priest aspired to do missionary work in the west of British North America and applied for it. In 1830, Archbishop Panet {{requested}} that the young priest accompany him on a journey to Manitoba. Following an interview in February 1831, Belcourt was enlisted {{to go on the}} trip. After spending two months learning the Algonquian language, Belcourt departed from his home town on April 27 of that year in a canoe of the Hudson's Bay Company. On June 17, the priest's party arrived at Saint Boniface, Manitoba, and Belcourt was assigned as one of three priests there. He was to assist the Bishop at the town's cathedral, and study the Anishinaabe language. [...] He was to work with the Ojibwe people to convert them to Christianity.

Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot."

500|$|The spire was {{originally}} to be enclosed with a protective radome, {{described as a}} [...] "sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels". However, the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna. Douglas Durst, {{the chairman of the}} Durst Organization, stated that the design change would save $20 million. However, the tower's architect, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, strongly criticized the change. David Childs, the lead designer, said, [...] "Eliminating this integral part of the building's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate...We stand <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the Port on an alternate design." [...] After joining the project in 2010, the Durst Organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs, but the proposal was rejected by the Port Authority's then-executive director, Christopher O. Ward. Ward was replaced by Patrick Foye in September 2011. Foye changed the Port Authority's position, and the radome was removed from the plans. In 2012, Douglas Durst gave a statement regarding the final decision: [...] "(the antenna) is going to be mounted on the building over the summer. There's no way to do anything at this point." ...|$|E
