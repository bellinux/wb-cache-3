40|$|This {{discourse}} {{deals with}} a theoretical study of the <b>radiation</b> <b>passage</b> through a diffraction screen with non-zero size in the propagation direction of the radiation, i. e. the <b>radiation</b> <b>passage</b> through a three-dimensional object. Without any loss of generality, we solve the problem for cylindrical cavity in metal. The task exceeds evidently standard scalar theory of diffraction, thus we solve the problem using a waveguiding theory. Following {{the principles of the}} electromagnetic theory, we derive required formulae to determine mode distribution at the entry of the cavity. Further, we solve numerically the radiation propagation through the cavity, then we actually seek for radiation distribution {{at the very end of}} the cavity. This yields, with a help of the discrete Fourier transform, an intensity distribution of Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, consequently compared with an intesity distribution of the radiation pattern of Fraunhofer diffraction on infinitely thin circular opening having the radius of the cylinder cavity under study. A comparison of such patterns results to a conclusion, that the cavity length has a significatn influence on the diffraction pattern and more importantly, that the scalar diffraction theory appears incorrect for a coherent light passage through cavities longer than their radius squared. Similarly, the same conclusion is inversely proportional to a wavelength of the interacting radiation. Finally, we mention an existence of the so called "focal regime", when the radiation repeatedly exhibits roughly one order increased intensity on the symmetry axis of the cavity...|$|R

Three aspects are highlighted. First, the principal steps involved in a virtual ecology approach to monitoring are laid out, using examples on fish <b>passage</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Secondly, it is argued how theoretical model specification {{as well as its}} implementation (both necessary to start a virtual ecology analysis) are merits rather than weaknesses of the approach, which help to understand and interpret subsequent field observations. And thirdly, it is shown that implementing a virtual ecology analysis to evaluate fish <b>passage</b> <b>monitoring</b> is not computationally intensive nor theoretically demanding. Hence, it can be done with rather modest means and involve e. g. field ecologists as well as decision makers to specify system properties and constraints.

Good experience in designing accelerators, storage rings and beamlines for synchrotron radiation allows presently to the LNF to be in the frontier for the construction of new X-ray generation sources, as FEL.

Prion disease can be initiated in animal models by inoculation with amyloid fibrils formed from bacterially derived recombinant prion protein. The synthetic prions that accumulated in infected organisms are structurally distinct from the amyloid preparations used to initiate their formation and change conformationally on repeated passage. To investigate the nature of synthetic prion transformation, we infected mice with a conformationally diverse set of amyloids and serially passaged the resulting prion strains.

FishXing was created at Humboldt State University through sponsorship from the US Forest Service, USDA, Stream Team, Six Rivers National Forest, San Dimas Technology and Development Center, The Watershed Stewards Project, and the Federal Highway Administration. A comparison was made between results generated using FishXing with results found by ODF in the Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) : Compliance With Fish Passage and Peak Flow Requirements at Stream Crossings monitoring project. Stream crossing culvert data from the ODF fish passage study was used to run FishXing. The ODF monitoring project investigated 74 fish passage culvert installations that were constructed following approval of Written Plans filed with ODF in 1998. (An approved Written Plan is equivalent to a permit with ODF). Information about culvert installations was analyzed using FishXing. Four different trials were run for each culvert using both adult and juvenile Coho Salmon and Cutthroat trout using the FishXing software. Three trials used the default values for swimming abilities of adult and juvenile Coho salmon and adult Cutthroat trout. Juvenile Cutthroat trout were {{also included in the}} comparison; however, FishXing did not contain a default setting for them. Therefore, a velocity of 2 feet per second (fj,), the current target velocity for stream crossings on fish 111 bearing streams in the state of Oregon, was used for juvenile Cutthroat trout (ODFW 2). After making comparisons with the preliminary ODF results, further study was done to assess the accuracy of the calculations carried out within FishXing.

The evaluation was based on information from fish <b>passage</b> effectiveness <b>monitoring</b> plans and annual reports which are filed with FERC by licensees and stored in the eLibrary database. Fish passage is one of several mitigation areas (others include shoreline management, water quality, and recreation) that were reviewed as part of the FERC strategic plan for meeting the intent of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.
