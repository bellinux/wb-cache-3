In July 2016, a Gambian opposition leader and another 18 people were sentenced to three years in jail for participation in the April demonstration.

Further negotiations resulted in an Libreville Global Peace Accord agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010. The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009.

While the financial crisis of 1997 – 98 triggered new regional cooperation initiatives, more recently several Asian political leaders have formulated proposals for the creation of a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>community,</b> suggesting the possible start of a top-down approach. Based on the results of a survey of Asia’s opinion leaders conducted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2010, this paper discusses how Asia’s institutional architecture for economic and financial integration is taking shape, suggesting the need to strengthen existing institutions that promote Asian regionalism and to create new ones. chiang mai initiative; economic cooperation; regional integration...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s {{regional}} economic communities have been increasingly {{involved in the}} development of model telecommunications policies and regulations. Through semi-independent regional regulators' associations, these communities aim to harmonize telecommunications policy and regulation across member states in hopes of stimulating cross-border investments and market development. To fully understand the role and effects of these administrative bodies, analyses are needed within and between a variety of regions.

SADC’s Tribunal (‘the Tribunal') in Windhoek had the capacity, until the summer of 2010, to hear individual applications from the SADC Member States on human rights matters. The Tribunal was meant to act in cases where an individual’s human rights were not being protected by the legal system in their home state and they had exhausted all available legal remedies. In the most high profile case to come before the Tribunal, Zimbabwean farmers were able to apply for an order preventing state forces proceeding with the removal of farm land under a government land redistribution programme that was being executed against mainly white landowners, depriving them of their property without compensation...|$|E
40|$|Without {{some level}} of {{institutionalisation}} or other means of enforcement, national commitment to regional trade integration is bound to face some challenges. Accordingly, transnational trade is obviously inhibited when the validity and enforcement of contracts, obligation and rules cannot be guaranteed beyond the term of office of an administration. Thus Member States' commitment {{to the work of}} institutions within a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>community</b> like SADC is critical for the full implementation of the SADC Treaty and its Protocols. The Protocol on Trade has been hailed as the most important for integration in SADC. This paper will indicate that institutions are essential drivers of organisations and their role in regional integration is therefore very important. However under the current legal and institutional framework, the SADC regional integration agenda faces major challenges of implementation. SADC institutions are not capable of completely fulfilling their legal obligations, although in some instances the lack of fulfilment was clearly a result of the legal instruments themselves being incomplete and needing further reform...|$|E
