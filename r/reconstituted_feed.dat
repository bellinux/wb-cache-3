40|$|The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) {{predicts that}} {{successful}} recruitment of an introduced {{species in the}} recipient region results from escaping co-evolved enemies. The success to cope with previously non-encountered grazer species represents one critical aspect for introduced seaweeds in this context. In laboratory experiments, {{the ability of the}} introduced red alga Mastocarpus stellatus to induce anti-herbivore defences against two grazer species at two seasons (spring and fall) was compared to that of the indigenous red alga Chondrus crispus. Grazers were selected by living either allopatrically (Littorina littorea) and sympatrically (Idotea granulosa) with Mastocarpus on Iceland, i. e. the donor region of the Mastocarpus population on Helgoland. Algae were exposed to each grazer species separately or left ungrazed during the induction phase and subsequently cultivated without herbivores (reduction phase). Bioassays at the end of both phases using fresh algae and reconstituted food assessed changes in algal palatability. Preference of control over grazed algae indicates an induction of anti-herbivory defences. Direct comparisons revealed that Littorina prefers Chondrus over Mastocarpus, while Idotea shows no preference between both algae. Irrespective of season, Idotea but not Littorina induced defences in fresh and reconstituted Mastocarpus feed originating from Helgoland and Iceland. In contrast, both grazer species induced anti-herbivory defences in fresh and <b>reconstituted</b> <b>feed</b> of the indigenous seaweed Chondrus in spring, but not in autumn. The differential anti-herbivory responses of the introduced Mastocarpus to allopathic and sympatric grazers represent a trait optimization, minimizing the impact of each type of herbivore, relative to their impact on the indigenous algae...|$|E

Removal of ethanol and drying of the left - over residue. Feeding trial was conducted in white albino rats before and after reconstitution of apple pomace feed in the choice and no choice study. Feeding of apple pomace feed in the rats before reconstitution indicated that neither in fermented nor in unfermented form it was acceptable. In the no choice study both in 100 % fermented and unfermented apple pomace group feed intake decreased continuously resulting in death of rats apparently due to decreased digestibility owing to high fibre content. Further, fermented or unfermented apple pomace based feed had lower digestibility and efficiency of conversion than the standard rat feed. Compared to the standard feed group, growth rates in all the feed groups were negative. The results of choice study of different feeds corroborated with the no-choice study mentioned earlier. Incorporation of fermented apple pomace into standard rat feed in the ratio of 1 : 1 gave better acceptability and digestibility. <b>Reconstituted</b> <b>feed</b> with 10 % jaggery, 2 % groundnut oil, 0. 01 % mixed flavour and 1 % salt was the most acceptable. The post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial revealed generalized oedema, probably due to some hepatotoxin in the feed. The blood glucose level in the apple pomace feed group except that was reconstituted with jaggery, showed a general hypoglycemia, though falling in the range. The increased ALT and AST levels in the serum also suggest damage to the liver. The mortality rate, post-mortem examination of the rats that died during the feeding trial and blood biochemical analysis of rat serum suggest a more elaborative study for extended period of time...|$|E

Para utilizar bagaço de maçã de uma maneira econômica e eficaz, foi desenvolvido um processo por fermentação no estado sólido (SSF) que utiliza uma co-cultura interativa seqüencial de Cândida utilis e Kloechera. Remoção do etanol foi realizado através da secagem do bagaço de maçã. Os testes com o bagaço de maçã fermentado ou não foram feitos em ratos brancos em um experimento delineado. Os resultados mostraram que o bagaço de maçã fermentado ou não se mostraram aceitáveis sendo que os mesmos apresentaram uma digestibilidade inferior a ração comum. Quando o estudo alimentando os ratos utilizando 100 % de bagaço de maçã fermentado e não fermentado e alterando a concentração progressivamente, observou-se a morte dos ratos aparentemente devido a uma redução da digestibilidade em razão da alta concentração em fibras. Em comparação com o grupo padrão, as taxas de crescimento foram negativas em todos os grupos estudados. A mistura da ração padrão com o bagaço de maçã fermentado na proporção 1 : 1, proporcionou maior aceitabilidade e digestibilidade. A mistura do bagaço de maçã fermentado com 10 % de 'jagerry', 2 % de óleo de 'groundnut', 0, 01 % de aromas e 1 % de sal foi o mais aceitável. O exame pós-morte dos ratos que receberam a dieta durante sua alimentação apresentou edema generalizado, provavelmente devido a alguma hepatotoxina na alimentação. O nível de glicose no sangue do grupo alimentado com bagaço de maçã, exceto misturado com 'jagerry', mostrou uma hypoglicemia geral. A taxa de mortalidade, o exame pós-morte dos ratos que morreram durante o experimento e a análise bioquímica do sangue e do soro sugerem um estudo mais elaborativo e mais prolongado...|$|E

40|$|Research question: 1. What is the {{prevalence}} of use of commercial feeding formula (CFF) by mothers of underthree children attending Urban Health Training Center, G. M. C. Nagpur? 2. What are the practices regarding use of CFF? Objective: 1. To assess {{the prevalence}} of use of CFF. 2. To study the practices {{regarding the use of}} CFF. 3. To study some factors associated with use of CFF. Study design : Clinic based study. Setting: Urban Health Training Centre (UHTC), Govt. Medical College, Nagpur. Participants : Consecutive 600 underthree children and their mothers attending Urban Health Training Centre. Statistical analysis: Chi- square test, Z-test. Result : Prevalence of use of CFF was found to 43 &#x 0025;. Out of 258 mothers who were using CFF. 65. 11 &#x 0025; were <b>reconstituting</b> the <b>feed</b> improperly, while 70. 54 &#x 0025; mothers were not taking proper hygienic precautions. In 80. 62 &#x 0025; cases, the practice was because of influence and advice by friends and private practitioners. Though use of CFF was more among higher socio-economic strata and higher literacy status. fairly large proportion of mothers from lower socio- economic strata and with less education were using CFF. Significantly more children fed with CFF were malnourished and also complained more about diarrhoeal diseases. Conclusion: Use of CFF is quite prevalent among urban mothers, moreover, better educational status and poverty does not have restraint on its use. Hence, specific educational programme should be developed to educate target group which would include medical professionals, mothers and even the general public from all strata of society...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{studies on}} {{inducible}} anti-herbivory responses in seaweeds focused on grazer-mediated changes in algal palatability of subsequent consumption by conspecifics. Yet, in natural systems multiple species interact, suggesting {{the existence of}} more complex, indirect interactions. Feeding-assayed induction experiments in the laboratory were conducted to test for direct and indirect induction of anti-herbivory resistance in the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus. For induction, algae were exposed for 14 d to either the isopod Idotea baltica or the periwinkle Littorina littorea. For testing effects of induced resistance, fresh and <b>reconstituted</b> Fucus <b>feed</b> were offered in 3 d long feeding assays to conspecific and non-conspecific herbivores. The experiment was simultaneously executed with organisms shared by the North and Baltic Sea to test for system-spanning patterns. Experiments revealed direct induction effects. Idotea-grazing reduced the palatability of Fucus-pieces from the North Sea for na&# 959;ve conspecifics, but not in Fucus from the Baltic Sea. Grazing by Littorina also lowered the level of palatability in Fucus-pieces for na&# 959;ve conspecifics, but only in algae from the Baltic and not from the North Sea. Moreover, indirect effects were observed. Idotea-exposed Fucus did not influence algal palatability for subsequently grazing periwinkles at both sites, while Littorina-exposed Fucus from both sites was significantly less consumed by Idotea. Palatability patterns in assays using reconstituted food matched with those using fresh Fucus-pieces, suggesting an induction of chemical anti-herbivory defences in Fucus. Furthermore, the observation of detrimental Littorina effects on Idotea-consumption at both sites suggests a system-spanning grazer-specificity of indirect. This study shows that indirect effects may commonly affect trophic interactions in and thus add a novel level of complexity {{to the development of}} macrophytobenthic communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of constituent phases and microstructure in air plasma sprayed alumina (Al 2 O 3) thirteen weight percent titania (TiO 2) coatings from <b>reconstituted</b> nanocrystalline <b>feed</b> powder (nanopowder) was investigated {{as a function}} of processing conditions and compared to a conventional coating created from micron-sized feed powder. The microstructure of the nanopowder coating was found to consist of a mixture of two distinct regions; one was completely melted and quenched as splats, and the other partially melted with a particulate microstructure retained from the starting powder. The melted regions predominantly consisted of γ-Al 2 O 3 with dissolved Ti 4 + that varied in morphology and size from a few nanometers to several microns. Based upon these experimental observations, a theory is developed that explains the mechanism behind the morphological differences observed across the melted splat structures. In addition, differences between the melted structures in the nanopowder coatings and the conventional coating are explained using this theory. The partially melted regions were found to be primarily submicrometer-sized α-Al 2 O 3 particles in an amorphous TiO 2 matrix containing small amounts of γ-Al 2 O 3 with dissolved Ti 4 +. For the nanopowder coatings, the ratio of the melted splat microstructure to the particulate microstructure and thus the ratio of the γ-Al 2 O 3 to α-Al 2 O 3 can be controlled by a plasma spray parameter, defined as the critical plasma spray parameter (CPSP). The conventional coating microstructure was insensitive to CPSP, consisting primarily of fully melted splats. The ability to vary the microstructure of the nanopowder coating through CPSP has resulted in bimodal distributions of microstructure and grain size that have allowed these coatings to significantly surpass the conventional coating in several measures of mechanical properties. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology to design feasible interventions to improve weaning food hygiene practices of families living in extreme poverty. Educational messages to promote specific behavioural changes were defined and tested by utilizing {{a combination of}} ethnographic, survey and observational methods, and integrating viewpoints and suggestions of mothers and caretakers into the decision-making process. This new approach culminated in a household trial in which five groups, each of 15 non-practising mothers, were invited to adopt defined behaviours (handwashing before and after defined events, boiling water for <b>reconstituting</b> powdered milk, <b>feeding</b> gruel by spoon rather than bottlefeeding, not storing gruels and milks, and all four together). All initiated the advocated behaviours and most (53 - 80 %) sustained the new behaviours and practised them every time during a one-month period. Of the four advocated behaviours, spoon-feeding {{was the most difficult}} to adopt wholly. The methodology was developed in response to the high priority given to reducing weaning food contamination for diarrhoeal disease control, and the lack of any existing methodology for defining appropriate educational interventions in resource-poor regions. This approach, with its combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and community focus, is recommended for future studies to design hygiene and other health education interventions in developing countries. infant feeding weaning food contamination food hygiene health education hygiene interventions...|$|R
40|$|Infant milk formula {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential source of Enterobacter sakazakii. This bacterium can cause a severe form of neonatal meningitis and necrotizing entercolitis. This study determined the effect of acid, alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stresses on the thermal inactivation of E. sakazakii in infant milk formula. Stressed cells were mixed with reconstituted powdered infant milk formula (PIMF) at temperatures between 52 and 58 °C for various time periods or mixed with PFMF prior to reconstitution with water at temperatures between 50 and 100 °C. The D- and z-values of the cells were determined using linear regression analysis. Detergent and sanitizer stresses decreased the thermal resistance of E. sakazakii in powdered and reconstituted infant milk formula. The values for Z) - acid, alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stressed E. sakazakii at 52 - 58 °C were 14. 57 - 0. 54, 12. 07 - 0. 37, 10. 08 - 0. 40 and 11. 61 - 0. 50 min, respectively. The values of alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stressed cells were significantly lower than those of unstressed cells. Only the z-value (4. 4 °C) of ethanol stressed E. sakazakii was significantly different than that of unstressed cells (4. 12 °C). Reconstitution at 60 °C did not significantly reduce the number of pre-stressed E. sakazakii cells compared with unstressed control cells, whereas significant decreases were obtained at 70 °C. Using water at 70 °C during the preparation of <b>reconstituted</b> PIMF before <b>feeding</b> infants, may be a suitable and applicable means of reducing the risk of E. sakazakii in the formula. The results of this study may be of use to regulatory agencies, infant milk producers and infant caregivers to design heating processes to eliminate E. sakazakii that may be present in infant milk formula...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to formulate two ready to reconstitute (RTR) enteral formula feeds with whole some nutritional approach and ease of administration. A cohesive survey work was done to collect the information about commercially available enteral formulas as well as „home made ‟ blenderized feeds preferred by some medical institutions. On the basis of the gathered information, few food ingredients from the basic food groups were selected and analyzed for their nutritional values by using standard analytical techniques. Various trials of the processing techniques were carried out in the laboratory to achieve the feasible digestibility as well as shelf life qualities in the developing feeds. The RDA of a reference man was taken as a basis to formulate the standard (Nutriagent Std) and High Protein (Nutriagent Protein Plus) Ready to <b>Reconstitute</b> Enteral Formula <b>Feeds.</b> The first standard feed (Nutriagent Std) was estimated to deliver about 2000 kcal energy and 75 g protein (15 % of total energy content) from the total amount of the feed (490 g). The percentages of major energy constituents i. e. total carbohydrates and fats were accounted as 278 g (53 % of total energy content) and 65 g per (30 % of total energy content) from the total feed. The micro nutrient levels of the sample were detected to be sufficient in amount. The second high protein feed (Nutriagent Protein Plus) was intended to possess high protein along with the sufficient amount of energy for protein sparing. The 530 g sample of this feed was fabricated to supply 2004 kcal energy and 101 g protein (20 % of total energy content). The carbohydrates and fat contents were found as 257 g (50 % of total energy) and 67 g (30 % of total energy) from the total feed. The micro nutrient composition was also found to be sufficient in the feed sample. The developed feeds were checked for their reconstitution behavior, pH as well as their flow behavior through Ryle‟s tube. The shelf life quality of the developed formula feeds were also checked for the period of 90 days on the basis of the nutritional parameter...|$|R
