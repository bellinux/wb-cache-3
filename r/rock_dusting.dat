50|$|Ignited {{methane gas}} {{is a common}} source of explosions in coal mines, which in turn can {{initiate}} more extensive coal dust explosions. For this reason, rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of coal dust explosions {{as well as to}} limit the extent of potential explosions, in a process known as <b>rock</b> <b>dusting.</b> Coal dust explosions can also begin independently of methane gas explosions. Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and coal dust. For this reason, water is often used to cool rock-cutting sites.|$|E
50|$|More than a mini ice age in 2013-2041, Hamaker's {{immediate}} {{concern was the}} shortening of the growing season from the coming glacial period, which he believed could be forestalled through <b>rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> resulting in more abundant yields at harvest. He believed the coming glacial period would preceded by an interglacial-to-glacial transition phase already underway since the 1970s, and strongly advocated an intensive global co-operative soil remineralization effort to maintain the quantity of food while improving its quality. To achieve this, he recommended simultaneous remineralization of dying forests and soils, also needed to grow bio-fuels, {{as part of a}} goal to return excessive carbon dioxide to stable interglacial levels of 280 ppm.|$|E
50|$|Hamaker {{conducted}} {{the groundwork for}} a mass movement of people concerned about the health of the world’s soils, sustainable forests, climate change and improved nutrition from food. His proposal, <b>rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> known to enhance plant growth by nourishing biological and chemical aspects of the rhizosphere, resulted in soil regeneration to boost global plant cover. This assisted Earth's self-regulation and offered a more natural geoengineering solution to the climate crisis not dependent on high technology, or on-going climate manipulation by man. Some scientists have postulated that technological solutions may exist to assist the remineralization process, such as converting carbon dioxide into organic carbon to be mineralized as sediment before being weathered to soil.|$|E

30|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} {{different}} <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{standards in the}} mine safety regulations established by the major coal producing countries. It shows the difference in explosion intensities between the methane only explosions and methane–coal–dust explosions. The evidences of applying <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> to the control of coal mine explosions are also shown. The {{main part of the}} paper is placed on gaining a basic qualitative and quantitative understanding about the mechanism of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in preventing and controlling coal mine explosions. With a better understanding, the strategy and effectiveness of using <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> as an important safety measure in underground coal mines can be improved.|$|E
40|$|Proper <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means of preventing coal dust explosions. Rock dust (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the preheating of unburned coal particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities of dispersible rock dust must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application of rock dust dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to rock dust application methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities of rock dust are applied to the roof, ribs, and floor throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period. These surveys included obtaining the following from each of the nine mines: 1. Mine dust samples to assess the incombustible content (IC) for determining any rock dust deficient areas common to all nine mines, 2. Information and issues related to <b>rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> and 3. <b>Rock</b> <b>dusting</b> sampling practices. This report discusses research that was conducted in the NIOSH laboratories, experimental mine, and in operating mines to evaluate the potential explosion hazard associated with excessive coal dust accumulating on elevated surfaces, the efficacy of wet <b>rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> and the need for mines to develop comprehensive <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> programs. Taken as a whole, this report provides proactive approaches to current <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> practices that will improve the application of rock dust in all underground areas of a coal mine.

30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{has been}} used in many major coal {{producing}} countries as the primary means of defense against coal dust explosions in underground coal mines. A proper <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> should maintain adequate incombustible content in the mine dust mixtures of float coal dust and rock dust. The rock dust applied can function as isolator, physical heat sink and chemical energy absorber that prevent the settled coal dust from participating into explosion and reduce the total thermal energy contained in the explosion event. Through such functions, the rock dust can either stop a coal mine explosion process or reduce its intensity.|$|E
30|$|As shown early, the TIC in <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} quality factor for preventing the propagation of mine explosion. Laboratory experiments show that different <b>rock</b> <b>dusts</b> (i.e., limestone, dolomite and magnesite) have similar inerting effectiveness for coal dust. However, tests with dolomite show that a decrease in <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> particle size could significantly lower the amount required to inert (Amyotte et al. 1992). Limestone or other <b>rock</b> <b>dusts</b> could easily cohere to form a cake when wetted and then dried making dispersion more difficult in an event of a light blast of air. Hence, the effectiveness of the alternative inerting agents has been experimentally investigated in countries including Germany, US, South Africa, etc. Fly ash and calcium sulphate (CaSO 4) may be the good candidates but more testing works are required to prove this.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} use the <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> in controlling coal mine explosions, the {{mechanism for the}} applied <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> to control explosion should be qualitatively identified and the effectiveness should be quantitatively evaluated. To control an on-going coal mine explosion, the first important step is to lower the air temperature {{as fast as possible}} for the purpose of lowering the explosion pressure. The second important step is to prevent coal dust from participating into explosion so that the total thermal energy produced and the intensity of an explosion can be controlled. Properly applied <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> can achieve both the control steps.|$|R
3000|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the effectiveness of <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> lies {{in its ability to}} be simultaneously dispersed with coal dust, and, by serving as a heat sink, thus prevent flame propagation. The regulatory requirements on <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> are various, some are more and some less stringent among the countries (Cashdollar et al. 2010): [...]...|$|R
30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{has been}} widely used in major coal {{producing}} countries. However, {{the quality and quantity}} standards for the rock dust vary to some degree. The bases for the variations could be related to the coal dust size, methane concentration in mine air, rank of coal, etc.|$|E
30|$|Canadian {{coal mines}} follow {{different}} <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> criteria {{according to their}} locations. In Alberta and British Columbia, the minimum total incombustible content is 65 % in intake airways while 75 % is required {{in the province of}} Nova Scotia (Cain 2003). However, 80 % TIC is needed for all return airways.|$|E
30|$|Due to such thermal {{inhibitive}} ability, applying rock dust (or <b>rock</b> <b>dusting)</b> {{to prevent}} or mitigate mine explosions is wildly used in US coal mines nowadays. Mine operators routinely cover the floor, rib and roof areas of mine entries with a generous application of inert rock dust (Man and Teacoach 2009).|$|E

30|$|Explosions are {{the most}} feared hazards in {{underground}} mines. A coal mine explosion generally starts with the ignition of methane first with the possibility for the coal dust to participate in and to intensify the explosion. Mining coal generates 40  g, on average, of float coal dust per ton of coal mined. Most of this float coal dust is deposited {{at or near the}} working sections. The possibility of methane ignition is also high at the working faces due to methane liberated from newly exposed coal face and possible frictional sparks generated in mining process. The effective control of coal dust on the working section is critical to prevent small methane ignitions at or near the working face from transitioning to a large coal dust explosion. Methane explosion can ignite the suspended coal dust, intensify the explosion event and produce more devastating consequences. <b>Rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{has been used as a}} primary explosion prevention and intensity reduction measure in many major coal producing countries. Even though with different standards, <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> is mandated in underground coal mines in the USA, Australia, South Africa, India, Russia, Germany, Poland,… Apparently, the frequency and severity of coal mine explosions are much smaller in these countries after this mine safety measure was in place than those in countries without mandating the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> measure.|$|E
30|$|South African mine {{researchers}} {{started the}} needs assessment of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in later 1980 s. The last major coal mine explosion occurred in 1993 with 53 deaths. Currently, 80 % TIC (both in intakes and returns) {{is required by}} the government regulations which were established as law {{in the year of}} 2002 (Cain 2003).|$|E
30|$|Initially, the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{standard}} in US coal mines was mandated that 65 % incombustible content (IC) in non-return airways and 80 % IC in return airways (Harris et al. 2010). When methane {{is present in}} any ventilating current, it requires adding an extra 1 % of incombustible material per 0.1 % methane for air in intakes and adding 0.4 % incombustible per 0.1 % methane in the returns (Man and Teacoach 2009). To face the finer coal dust particle size produced by modern coal mining machines, MSHA increased the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> standard on September 23, 2010. The new regulations require the total incombustible content (TIC) of combined coal dust, rock dust, and other dust {{to be at least}} 80 % in underground bituminous coal mines with an additional requirement to raise the incombustible content by 0.4 % for each 0.1 % of methane present in the ventilation air.|$|E

30|$|The recent two {{explosions in}} the US coal mines (Sago in 2006 and Upper Big Branch in 2010) show the {{importance}} of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in reducing the intensity of mine explosion. In the Sago mine explosion, the mine was properly rock dusted. The methane explosion was originated from a newly sealed mine area that completely destroyed the mine seals. The back calculated explosion pressures at the mine seals was about 641  kPa (Gates et al. 2007). The immediate impact of the explosion caused one death to a mining crew of 13 located about 123  m from the destroyed mine seals (about 34.5  kPa explosion pressure). The other 11 fatalities in this accident were caused by CO poisoning. Another crew of 13 miners located about 344  m away from the destroyed mine seals (about 14  kPa explosion pressure) escaped from the accident unharmed. The sharp decrease of the explosion pressure within {{a short distance from}} the explosion source implies the effectiveness of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in reducing the explosion intensity.|$|E
30|$|As an {{explosion}} control measure, <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{has been used}} in underground coal mines in many major coal producing countries with different standards.
