40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an integrated}} model of strategic decision-making rationality. The model {{is informed by}} <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> that respectively identify decision, environmental and firm characteristics as influences on the rationality of decision processes. The results of a study in Egypt indicate that the rationality of strategic decision-making processes is shaped by variables identified by all <b>three</b> <b>perspectives,</b> and that such decision processes cannot adequately be modelled {{in terms of a}} single perspective only. However, the study also suggests that the <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> do not contribute in equal measure to explaining strategic decision making, and that the national setting is relevant for the extent to which strategic decision-makers take account of environmental characteristics. The location of the investigation in Egypt highlights some deviations from previous research that could be attributed to nation-specific factors, both cultural and institutional.

40|$|Abstract The paper {{explores the}} {{innovative}} performance of 9 high and medium-high technology manufacturing industries across 29 countries based on patent and R&D expenditure data. The {{purpose of this}} study is to evaluate whether the benefits of particular forms of collaboration have a significant positive effect on innovative performance at the national level. The study considers <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> connected to innovative cluster performance: open innovation, the Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations, and the presence of global pipelines (international ties) as being of influence on innovation performance. The <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> are evaluated using co-patenting analysis. The findings of the study suggest that patents and R&D expenditure are highly correlated and that the <b>three</b> <b>perspectives</b> appear to have varying significance depending on the industry being considered. In science-based industries international ties tend to have a positive effect on innovative performance, while in most engineering-based industries such ties tend to weaken innovative performance. Open innovation and the Triple Helix perspective do not show as clear a distinction, and so the differentiation across industries merits further research. ...|$|R
