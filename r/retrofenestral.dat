Otosclerosis is {{categorised}} into two types, fenestral and <b>retrofenestral.</b> Imag-ing {{plays an important role}} in the diagnosis and management of otosclerosis. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the temporal bone using 1 -mm (or less) thick sections is the modality of choice for assessment of the labyrinthine windows and co-chlear capsules. MRI has limited application in the evaluation of the labyrinthine capsules but is useful for assessment of the cochlear lumen prior to cochlear implantation in patients with profound hearing loss. The treatment of fenestral otosclerosis is primarily surgical with stapedectomy and prosthesis inser-tion. Patients with <b>retrofenestral</b> otosclerosis and profound hearing loss are treated medically using fluorides, but may derive significant benefit from cochlear implantation. This pictorial review aims to acquaint the reader with the pathology and clinical features of otosclerosis, the classical imaging appearances on CT and MRI, a radiological checklist for preoperative CT evaluation of otosclerosis, imaging mimics and a few examples of post-stapedectomy imaging and complications.

30|$|<b>Retrofenestral</b> or {{cochlear}} otosclerosis is {{much less}} common; however, it is nearly always associated with fenestral otosclerosis. Patients typically present with bilaterally symmetrical SNHL or MHL. Pulsatile tinnitus is also known to occur. Cochlear otosclerosis represents a continuum of the fenestral otosclerotic process. Histologically, foci of demineralised spongy vascular bone are seen in the cochlear capsule, which may extend around the vestibule, semicircular canals and internal auditory canal. The promontory may show a pink hue when seen through the tympanic membrane, called the Schwartze sign. Direct injury to the cochlea and spiral ligament due to the lytic process or release of proteolytic enzymes is implicated as a possible cause for the SNHL [1 – 4].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an autosomal-dominant connective-tissue disorder, {{predominantly}} {{characterized by}} bone fragility. Conductive hearing loss develops in {{half of the}} OI patients and often progresses to mixed loss. Findings of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{of the temporal bone}} in the largest series of OI patients to date are presented and correlated with the audiograms. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: CT images and audiograms of 17 hearing-impaired OI patients, aged 9 to 67 years, were analyzed retrospectively. In four patients, MR imaging was performed as well. Imaging abnormalities were correlated with type and severity of hearing loss deduced from the audiograms. RESULTS: CT revealed fenestral hypodense foci in the fissula ante fenestram (25 of 33 ears), oval window (23 of 33 ears), and round window (20 of 33 ears). <b>Retrofenestral</b> hypodensities were observed, affecting the cochlear turns (16 of 33 ears), facial nerve canal (10 of 33 ears), or semicircular canals (6 of 33 ears), or appearing like the fourth turn of the cochlea (11 of 33 ears). The site of hypodensities corresponded to the type of hearing loss in 72. 2 % of the OI ears. The air-bone gap and bone-conduction thresholds showed significant positive associations with the number of affected fenestral (P <. 05) and <b>retrofenestral</b> structures (P <. 01), respectively. Gadolinium-enhanced MR images demonstrated active lesions in three patients with mixed hearing loss or deafness. CONCLUSIONS: The site of hypodensities on temporal bone CT images in OI corresponds to presence and type of hearing loss determined by audiometry. The more severe the hearing loss, the more affected temporal bone structures in OI...|$|E
30|$|Otosclerosis is {{a unique}} {{autosomal}} dominant otodystrophy of the otic capsule. It is also called ‘otospongiosis’ as {{it is characterised by}} replacement of the normal ivory-like enchondral bone by spongy vascular bone. The decalcified foci tend to recalcify, becoming less vascular and more solid. Patients typically present in the 2 nd- 4 th decades of life with conductive hearing loss (CHL), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or mixed hearing loss (MHL) and/or tinnitus. Otosclerosis is commoner in Caucasians as compared to blacks, Native Americans and Asians. The disease is more common in women and commonly bilateral (85  %). Otosclerosis is categorised into two types, fenestral and retrofenestral/cochlear. <b>Retrofenestral</b> otosclerosis rarely occurs without fenestral involvement; hence these manifestations are considered to be a continuum rather than two separate entities [1 – 4].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{collect data}} from {{a large number of}} {{cochlear}} implant recipients with otosclerosis and to make an assessment of these patients' clinical characteristics, computed tomographic scans, surgical findings, and complications, and to quantify the occurrence of postoperative facial nerve stimulation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with otosclerosis from four cochlear implant centers in the United Kingdom and The Netherlands were reviewed. Sixty surgical procedures were performed in these patients: 57 devices were placed in 56 ears. RESULTS: The computed tomographic imaging demonstrated <b>retrofenestral</b> (cochlear) otosclerotic lesions in the majority of patients. Although not statistically significant, the extent of otosclerotic lesions on the computed tomographic scan as categorized in three types tends to be greater in patients with rapidly progressive hearing loss, in patients in whom there is surgically problematic insertion of the electrode array, and in patients with facial nerve stimulation. In four patients, revision surgery had to be performed. Twenty of 53 (38 %) patients experienced facial nerve stimulation at various periods postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Cochlear implant surgery in patients with otosclerosis can be challenging, with a relatively high number of partial insertions and misplacements of the electrode array demanding revision surgery. A very high proportion of patients experienced facial nerve stimulation mainly caused by the distal electrodes. This must be discussed with patients preoperatively...|$|E
