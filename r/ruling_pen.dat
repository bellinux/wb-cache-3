50|$|In the 17th century, a stylus {{that could}} {{draw a line}} with a {{specific}} width called a <b>ruling</b> <b>pen</b> was developed. The stylus had two curved metal pieces which were joined by a screw. Ink was trickled between the blades, from which it flowed evenly across the paper. The basic model was maintained for a long time, with minor modifications, until the 1930s when the German technical drawing pens came to the market.|$|E

50|$|Early {{technical}} <b>pens</b> (<b>ruling</b> <b>pens)</b> {{consisted of}} a small pair of calipers, having one flat and one bowed leg holding ink between them. By adjusting {{the gap between the}} legs the width of the line drawn by the pen could be adjusted. Such pens, kept at a constant angle to the paper, were used for ruling lines, but not for cursive handwriting, nor for off-hand flourishes. The Graphos technical pen introduced in 1934 miniaturized the caliper principle and made the points easily interchangeable. The Sheaffer company produced an expensive drafting set which included such pens for use on linen prints. These sets were often presented to a draftsperson upon completing 'time served', which marked the end of the apprenticeship.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{tools of}} the architect were the drawing board or draughting table, T-square and set squares, protractor, compasses, pencil and drawing pens of different types. Drawings were made on vellum, coated linen, and on tracing paper. Lettering would either be done by hand, mechanically using a stencil, {{or a combination of}} the two. Ink lines were drawn with a <b>ruling</b> <b>pen,</b> a relatively sophisticated device similar to a dip-in pen but with adjustable line width, capable of producing a very fine controlled line width. Ink pens had to be dipped into ink frequently. Draughtsmen worked standing up, and kept the ink on a separate table to avoid spilling ink on the drawing.|$|E

Work on this map highlighted {{the disparity between}} the Victoria and New South Wales state survey triangulation networks. The grid on this sheet was most likely the first instance of cartographic scribing in Australia, done by Warrant Officer Harry Raisbeck engraving the emulsion of a glass plate negative using one tip of a broken <b>ruling</b> <b>pen</b> for the thicker 10,000 yard grid lines and a steel needle to scribe the 1,000 yard grid. This was 23 years before the first map was fully scribed.|$|E
40|$|The {{examination}} of any current type specimen book invariably discloses {{a large number}} of faces designed to imitate some form of handwriting. Strictly speaking, such designs are known as script types. It is a matter of opinion which typefaces should be classified as scripts, especially since all early type designs were derived from written forms. Today, we typically label a typeface as a script if it retains the look of having been written with a pen or other writing implement. Type specimen catalogues of the nineteenth century list numerous examples of such written forms, though these are mostly restricted to styles developed by the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writing masters. Modern scripts differ from those of the last century because of a bewildering variety of structures derived from forms created by different writing instruments, including the broad-edged pen, the steel pen, and the brush. In addition to such traditional sources, more recent scripts have been inspired by the felt-tipped marker, pencil, <b>ruling</b> <b>pen,</b> ball point pen and even the spray paint can. For this thesis project, the author prepared a historical introduction and then attempted to classify as many historic and contemporary script faces as possible in order to determine how type designers are breaking new ground in the structure of these fascinating letterforms. Many recent script faces are radically different from traditional models, while some explore the very limits of style, legibility, and technical fit. Such experimentation would have been much more difficult in the days when types were cast from metal or even when types were made for photocomposition devices. Today, the number and variety of script faces are increasing at a rapid rate due to improvements in computer type design software. Therefore, this thesis project also reviews some of the powerful type design software and digital technology now available which allow designers to create types of great originality. Also included are the results of a questionnaire sent to selected contemporary designers of script faces...|$|E

He made his debut two days later as a late substitute in the Baggies' 3-1 win over Leeds United in the FA Cup 3rd round. Koren scored his first goal for the club in a 7-0 home win against Barnsley on 6 May 2007, {{the last day of}} the league season. The victory ensured Albion's place in the Championship promotion play-offs.

50|$|In May 2008, the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} 2003 federal law Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) of Title 18, United States Code that criminalizes the pandering and {{solicitation}} of child pornography, in a 7-2 <b>ruling</b> <b>penned</b> by Justice Antonin Scalia. The court ruling dismissed the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit's finding the law unconstitutionally vague. Attorney James R. Marsh, {{founder of the}} Children's Law Center in Washington, D.C., wrote that although the Supreme Court's decision has been criticized by some, he believes it correctly enables legal personnel to fight crime networks where child pornography is made and sold. Child pornography is illegal in the US and is not looked at {{in terms of the}} typical guidelines of the First Amendment, due to the assumption that it always harms children when it is made, sold, and/or owned.|$|R
5000|$|From 1989 to 1996, {{a series}} of suits were brought before U.S. courts against Marcos and his {{daughter}} Imee, alleging that they bore responsibility for executions, torture, and disappearances. A jury in the Ninth Circuit Court awarded USD2 billion to the plaintiffs and to a class composed of human rights victims and their families. On June 12, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court (in a 7-2 <b>ruling</b> <b>penned</b> by Justice Anthony Kennedy in Republic of the Philippines v. Mariano Pimentel) held that: [...] "The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the interpleader action." [...] The court dismissed the interpleader lawsuit filed to determine the rights of 9,500 Filipino human rights victims (1972-1986) to recover USD35 million, part of a USD2 billion judgment in U.S. courts against the Marcos estate, because the Philippines government is an indispensable party, protected by sovereign immunity. The Philippines government claimed ownership of the funds transferred by Marcos in 1972 to Arelma S.A., which invested the money with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., in New York.|$|R
40|$|Black-letter law {{has it that}} “duty”—the first {{element of}} a prima facie case of {{negligence}} in tort—is a nonissue in most cases. “Duty” fixes the legal standard applicable to the conduct in question and that standard is generally the tort obligation to exercise reasonable care {{for the protection of}} those who might foreseeably be endangered by one’s actions. Commentators from Oliver Wendell Holmes to the drafters of the pending Restatement Third of Torts have recognized a general duty not to subject others to unreasonable risk of physical harm as the very foundation of modern negligence law. From the time of Heaven v. Pender and MacPherson v. Buick forward, courts have issued <b>rulings</b> and <b>penned</b> rhetoric establishing the general duty that commentators have recognized. Because the obligation to take reasonable care is a highly general and pervasive one, “duty” is only an issue in special cases—in exceptional circumstances where the legal standard applicable to the kind of conduct at issue must be tightened, relaxed, or suspended. Contemporary California courts, however, {{are in the midst of}} unsettling a century’s worth of doctrine by making “duty” a live issue in every case. This article explores and criticizes their efforts. We argue that the contemporary use of “duty” doctrine by the California courts has three pernicious effects. First, it reconfigures the division of labor among tort, contract and property in a way which is both haphazard and undesirable. Haphazard because the reconfiguration is fact-specific ruling by fact-specific ruling. Undesirable because these decisions chip away at the twin revolutions of Buick v. MacPherson Motor Co., and Rowland v. Christian. To the extent that the rash of “no duty” decisions in contemporary California form a larger figure in the carpet of California tort law, they give the free use of property and freedom of contract priority over the safety and physical integrity of the person. This is exactly backwards: No sane person values her property or her economic interests more than her life, and it is indefensible partiality to value one’s own property or economic interests more than someone else’s life. Second, the contemporary use of “duty” doctrine by the California courts upsets the division of labor between judge and jury in an arbitrary and incoherent way. Traditional “duty: doctrine assigns the task of law articulation to judges and task of law application to juries. Making “duty” a live issue in every case makes hash of this coherent and principled division of labor, puts nothing in its place and, indeed, precludes a principled division of labor between judge and jury. Third, the practice of making “duty” a contestable issue in every case involves a conceptual contradiction. “Duty” cannot be up for grabs in every case, because the legal standard governing conduct cannot be up for grabs in every case. Legal norms guide conduct—give reasons for action. General legal norms cannot guide if they are perpetually up for post hoc revision. The cure for what ails California law is to return “duty” doctrine to its proper, categorical role of fixing the legal standard applicable to the conduct at hand. “Duty” should be a nonissue in most cases of physical injury because, as the California legislature long ago decreed, “the general rule” is and ought to be that “all persons have a duty to use ordinary care to prevent others from being injured as a result of their conduct. ...|$|R
