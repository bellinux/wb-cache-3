40|$|This paper studies {{forward and}} reverse {{projections}} for the Rényi divergence of order α∈ (0, ∞) on α-convex sets. The forward projection {{on such a}} set is motivated by some works of Tsallis et al. in statistical physics, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>projection</b> is motivated by robust statistics. In a recent work, van Erven and Harremoës proved a Pythagorean inequality for Rényi divergences on α-convex sets {{under the assumption that}} the forward projection exists. Continuing this study, a sufficient condition for the existence of forward projection is proved for probability measures on a general alphabet. For α∈ (1, ∞), the proof relies on a new Apollonius theorem for the Hellinger divergence, and for α∈ (0, 1), the proof relies on the Banach-Alaoglu theorem from functional analysis. Further projection results are then obtained in the finite alphabet setting. These include a projection theorem on a specific α-convex set, which is termed an α-linear family, generalizing a result by Csiszár for α≠ 1. The solution to this problem yields a parametric family of probability measures which turns out to be an extension of the exponential family, and it is termed an α-exponential family. An orthogonality relationship between the α-exponential and α-linear families is established, and it is used to turn the <b>reverse</b> <b>projection</b> on an α-exponential family into a forward projection on a α-linear family.

40|$|An {{instrument}} that provides real-time wavefront analysis in combina-tion with automation algorithms {{can meet the}} high-volume demands of lens production for mobile camera phones. Equipping massive numbers of mobile phones with built-in dig-ital cameras has scaled up demand for miniature lenses resid-ing on wafers. A new ultrafast, automated wavefront analyzer can reliably test such microlens wafers, {{at a rate of}} several sec-onds per lens, assuring quality control for this disruptive tech-nology in micro-optics manufacturing. Assessment of lens imag-ing quality is ordinarily carried out by computing the modula-tion transfer function (MTF). 1 However, this method offers only limited information when testing individual lenses. More detail can be obtained from wavefront measurements that provide a spatially resolved map of the refraction properties of the lens, which can be readily compared with design data. To implement such rapid in-line testing, we employ wave-front sensing technology that makes use of a Shack–Hartmann (SH) -based measurement system. The high dynamic range (> 1000 λ) of the sensor enables measurement and analysis of spherical and aspherical optics over the entire aperture. For test equipment in a wafer-level production environment, we use fully automated lens-positioning procedures, including lateral positioning, autofocus, and error compensation. In our configuration, we employ the WaveMaster PRO Wafer instrument in a <b>reverse</b> <b>projection</b> setup that uses a high-resolution SH sensor. 2 The sample lens is illuminated by a point light source, and the pupil is imaged on the sensor by a telescope system that, in addition, magnifies the wavefront for maximum use of the sensor area and dynamic range (see Figure 1).

The cube map projection is accelerated by graphics hardware in a wide variety of computer systems manufactured over the last decade. Furthermore, by integrating a multi-resolution tile partitioning into the cube map we can provide on-demand tile streaming, level-of-detail rendering and hierarchical visibility culling, enabling researchers to visually explore essentially unlimited resolution geophysical raster data attached to tectonic plates and reconstructed through geological time. This capability forms the basis for interactively building and improving plate reconstructions in an iterative fashion, particularly for tectonically complex regions...|$|E

In this work, we examine the statistical behaviour of the <b>reverse</b> <b>projection</b> method, an alternative phase retrieval approach and compare the results to the conventional phase retrieval technique. We investigate the noise levels in the projections as well as the image quality and quantitative accuracy of the reconstructed tomographic volumes.

40|$|A novel, but by now, well {{tried and}} tested {{approach}} to the mathematical modelling of the extraction life-cycle of any depleting fossil-fuel resource has been developed. It is a bottom-up technique for energy planning, whereby an integrated summation of the outputs from the various producing fields in the considered region is obtained. As the present paper will show, {{in the absence of}} political interference, this means for predicting the resulting future availabilities of the mineral fuels has been validated. Even {{in the event of a}} fiscal change, the model can be adjusted to take account of the new scenario. The evolved [`]skewed-normal profile for the rate-of-extraction' supply model (i) yields a better representation than has been achieved with earlier approaches and (ii) is appropriate for use with rate-of-extraction data, that rise with time to a plateau, and then decline more slowly, but is unsatisfactory for use when the profile exhibits more than a single rate-of-extraction peak. Also, in many circumstances, the profile is less systematic in shape, often as a result of temporary political, economic or on-stream changes. Thus, for these situations, it is proposed that a [`]skewed-normal profile extraction' supply model be used in conjunction with what is here described as the reverse-projection technique. The application of the model, without and with <b>reverse</b> <b>projections</b> for the UK crude-oil and natural-gas extraction-rates data, is demonstrated. Reasonable predictions, for both crude-oil and natural-gas rates of demand, can be achieved only for a country that is politically and economically stable. Even then, because of uncertainties and social factors, it is often difficult to formulate a wise policy concerning long-term fuel requirements. Nevertheless, it is only by understanding the implications of changing fuel-demands that a long-term strategy can be evolved for a country's economy. Thus, it is desirable to try to predict the future requirements for crude oil and natural gas, and so, as an additional tool, a [`]modified logit-function' demand model has been developed for use with the usually readily-available historic consumption data. It is based on extrapolations, using reasonable-trend assumptions, for the appropriate energy-intensity (i. e. annual fuel consumptionl/annual gross domestic product (GDP)), population and GDP/capita likely future behaviours. ...|$|R

Compared to WARP method which stagnates rapidly, the proposed hybrid method gives better SLL and XPL after adequate iterations. In addition, as 2 LB-MOPSO offers a set of optimum solutions (Pareto front) instead of a single solution, this method provides more degrees of freedom in selection of proper practical arrays.

Network measures (e.g., node degree, betweenness, closeness) can be calculated from individuals or average of a population. Different measures may characterize {{different aspects of the}} brain connectivity [51]. In order to visualize these network attributes, we propose a surface texture-based approach. The main idea is {{to take advantage of the}} available surface area of each ROI and encode the attribute information in a texture image, and then texture-map this image to the ROI surface. Since the surface shape of each ROI (as a triangle mesh) is highly irregular, it becomes difficult to assign texture coordinates for mapping the texture images. We apply a simple projection plane technique. A projection plane of an ROI is defined as the plane with a normal vector that connects the center of the ROI surface and the centroid of the entire brain. The ROI surface can then be projected onto its projection plane, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>projection</b> defines the texture mapping process. Thus, we can define our attribute-encoded texture image on this project plane to depict a visual pattern on the ROI surface. Visually encoding attribute information onto a texture image is an effective way to represent multiple attributes or time series attributes. Below we will demonstrate this idea in two different scenarios: time series data from rs-fMRI and multi-class disease classification.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the non-iterative {{computation}} of a homography matrix is described. Rearrangement of the equations {{leads to a}} block partitioned sparse matrix, facilitating a residualization based on orthogonal matrix projections. This improves {{the handling of the}} error structure of the linear system of equations. The vanishing line is treated as the principal component in the estimation process. This estimate is more robust, since the position of the vanishing line depends only on the relative position and orientation of the camera to the observed plane, and is invariant to the structure of the points observed on the plane. A flop-count indicates that the new method is 11 times faster for four point correspondences, and converges to a factor of 5 for a large number of points. Furthermore, a new non-iterative method of treating error in both images is derived. Combining the forward H and <b>reverse</b> G <b>projections</b> in a suitable manner eliminates the systematic bias of the estimation, and the first order error: a strict bound on the error reduction is derived. This can be achieved faster than a classical DLT due to the improved numerical efficiency. Results of Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to verify the performance. ...|$|R

The projection is defined on the entire sphere, except at one point—the projection point. Where it is defined, the mapping is smooth and bijective. It is also conformal, meaning that it accurately represents angular relationships (i.e., local angles on a sphere are mapped to the same angles in the projection). On the other hand, it does not accurately represent area, especially near the projection point. Stereographic projection finds usage in many fields including cartography, geology, and crystallography. Sarkar et al. [9] first applied stereographic projection in wireless networks.

40|$|We present new {{excess risk}} bounds for general {{unbounded}} loss functions including log loss and squared loss, where {{the distribution of}} the losses may be heavy-tailed. The bounds hold for general estimators, but they are optimized when applied to η-generalized Bayesian, MDL, and ERM estimators. When applied with log loss, the bounds imply convergence rates for generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification in terms of a generalization of the Hellinger metric as long as the learning rate η is set correctly. For general loss functions, our bounds rely on two separate conditions: the v-GRIP (generalized <b>reversed</b> information <b>projection)</b> conditions, which control the lower tail of the excess loss; and the newly introduced witness condition, which controls the upper tail. The parameter v in the v-GRIP conditions determines the achievable rate and is akin to the exponent in the well-known Tsybakov margin condition and the Bernstein condition for bounded losses, which the v-GRIP conditions generalize; favorable v in combination with small model complexity leads to Õ(1 /n) rates. The witness condition allows us to connect the excess risk to an 'annealed' version thereof, by which we generalize several previous results connecting Hellinger and Rényi divergence to KL divergence.
