40|$|Purpose: SpineCor is a {{relatively}} innovative brace for non-operative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, the effectiveness of SpineCor still remains controversial. The objective {{of the current study}} was to compare the treatment outcomes of SpineCor brace with that of <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> following the standardized Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) criteria on AIS brace study. Methods: Females subjects with AIS and aged 10 - 14 were randomly allocated into two groups undergoing treatment of SpineCor (S Group, n =  20) or <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> (R Group, n =  18). During SpineCor treatment, patients who had curve progression of > 5 ° would be required to switch to <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> treatment. The effectiveness of the two brace treatments was assessed using the SRS standardized criteria. Results: Before skeletal maturity, 7 (35. 0  %) patients in the S Group and 1 (5. 6  %) patient in the R Group had curve progression > 5 ° (P =  0. 026). At skeletal maturity, 5 of the 7 (71. 4  %) patients who failed with SpineCor bracing showed control from further progression by changing to <b>rigid</b> <b>bracing.</b> At the latest follow-up with a mean duration of 45. 1  months after skeletally maturity, 29. 4  % of patients who were successfully treated by <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> showed further curve progression beyond skeletal maturity, versus 38. 5  % of patients in the SpineCor group (P >  0. 05). For both groups, the primary curves were slightly improved at the time of brace weaning, but additionally increased at the latest follow-up, with a rate of 1. 5 ° per year for post-maturity progression. Conclusions: Curve progression rate was found to be significantly higher in the SpineCor group when compared with the <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> group. Changing to <b>rigid</b> <b>bracing</b> could control further curve progression for majority of patients who previously failed with SpineCor bracing. For both SpineCor and <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> treatments, 30 - 40  % of patients who were originally successfully treated by bracing would exhibit further curve progression beyond skeletal maturity. The post-maturity progression rate was found to be 1. 5 ° per year in the current study, which was relatively greater than those reported before.

40|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis is {{a common}} condition found in adolescents. A <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> is often prescribed as the treatment for this spinal deformity, which negatively affects user compliance due to the discomfort caused by the brace, and the psychological distress resulting from its appearance. However, the latter, which {{is the impact of}} visual aesthetics, has not been thoroughly studied for scoliosis braces. Therefore, a qualitative study with in-depth interviews has been carried out with 10 participants who have a Cobb angle of 20 degrees- 30 degrees to determine the impact of visual aesthetics on user acceptance and compliance towards the brace. It is found that co-designing with patients on the aesthetic aspects of the surface design of the brace increases the level of user compliance and induces positive user perception. Therefore, aesthetic preferences need to be taken into consideration in the design process of braces.

40|$|Introduction. SpineCor is {{a dynamic}} brace that showed good results in {{scoliosis}} treatment. But data suggest that its efficacy is reduced as curves magnitude increase, and no comparisons exist versus exercise alone. The objective of this double study is to compare the short term results of the SpineCor versus SEAS exercises and versus <b>rigid</b> SpoRT <b>brace</b> for AIS. Methods. Study design: 2 retrospective controlled studies. Population 1 : 56 consecutive AIS patients (39 female; age 13 ± 1, Cobb 21 ± 4 °; ATR 11 ± 4 °) : 28 patients (19 females; age 13 ± 1; TRACE 6; Cobb angle 22 ± 4 °; ATR 12 ± 4 °, Risser 0 - 3) treated by SpineCor 20 / 24 hours; 28 patients (20 females; age 13 ± 1; TRACE 5; Cobb angle 20 ± 4 °; ATR 9 ± 3 °, Risser 0 - 3) treated by SEAS exercises. Population 2 : 103 consecutive AIS patients from our prospective database (85 females; age 13 ± 1, Cobb 24 ± 5 °; ATR 8 ± 4 °) : 29 patients (19 females; age 13 ± 1; TRACE 6; Cobb angle 22 ± 5 °; ATR 9 ± 3 °, Risser 0 - 3) treated by SpineCor 20 / 24 hours per day; 74 patients (66 females; age 13 ± 1; TRACE 5; Cobb angle 25 ± 4 °; ATR 8 ± 4 °, Risser 0 - 3) treated by SPoRT Brace 18 to 23 hours per day. The short term results of treatment, both clinical and radiographic, were evaluated after 18 months. Outcome measures: N° of <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> prescribed, TRACE, Cobb angle (changes > ± 5), ATR (changes > ± 2). Results.

40|$|An {{analytical}} and numerical investigation is {{conducted for the}} lateral torsional buckling analysis of wooden beam with a mid-span lateral brace subjected to symmetrically distributed loading. Two models are developed; one for {{the case of a}} <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> and another one for the case of a flexible brace. The analytical solutions are based on the principle of stationary potential energy and a Fourier expansion of the buckling displacement fields and bending moments. The validity of both models are verified against 3 D finite element analyses in ABAQUS. Where applicable, verifications were also conducted against available solutions from previous studies. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effect of geometric and material parameters on the critical moments. The results indicate the presence of two separate groups of potential buckling modes, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with fundamentally different behavioural characteristics. The governing buckling mode is shown to depend on the <b>bracing</b> height, <b>load</b> height and lateral brace stiffness. The study shows that beyond a certain threshold bracing height, the critical moment is governed by the antisymmetric mode of buckling.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{conservative}} orthopaedic {{treatment of}} adult scoliosis is very disappointing. In {{a series of}} 144 patients; only 25  % (33 cases) were monitored at 2  years of treatment. (Papadopoulos 2013). Thereby the literature typically focuses on {{a small number of}} patients, which limits the usefulness and relevance of its results. The brace effect on pain has been systematically described, but there is no publication on the effect of treatment on the Cobb angle and main clinical parameters. Methods From a prospective database started in 1998, we selected all 158 consecutive patients effectively treated conservatively with the Lyon management treatment and controlled five years after brace fitting. Lyon management includes a lordosing bivalve polyethylene overlapping brace in association with specific physiotherapy. The brace can either be short with anterior support under the chest or long with sterno-clavicular support when there is a high thoracic kyphosis. Results 1. For the rate of scoliosis controlled after 5  years, the follow-up was 24  % of the 661 patients accepting the treatment. Pain is almost the main reason for the medical consultation, generally correlating with an increase of the scoliotic angulation. 2. The descriptive data can be superimposed on general group with age (m= 56  years, SD= 13) but initial Cobb angulation is significantly higher (m= 40 °, SD= 17). Ratio Female/Male= 0. 91. Generally, the scoliosis is stabilized at (m= 39. 74 °, SD= 19. 40), 8  years after the beginning of the treatment. 38 improvements of more than 5 °= 24  %; 88 stable = 56  %; 32 worsening of more than 5 ° = 20  % The rib hump is improved of by 3  mm, (modelling effect of the brace). The occipital axis is improved by more than 6  mm. But the T 1 plumb line distance is worsening by 7  mm (most braces are short without sterno-clavicular support).

40|$|Ankle sprains {{are among}} the most common {{injuries}} in sports. The majority involve the lateral ligaments of the ankle following a rapid inversion of the weight bearing joint. The ability of prophylactic stabilization to minimize the impact of these forces has been studied extensively. An innovative device designed to evoke a 20 º inversion perturbation was used to demonstrate that application of ankle prophylaxis is effective in improving muscular response in healthy individuals. Forty one volunteers (21 males, 20 females) underwent EMG analysis of the peroneus longus (PL) and tibialis anterior (TA), measuring reflex latency (RL) and time to peak amplitude (TPA) while performing a dynamic task. Data were collected while subjects were fitted with two types of ankle braces (lace-up and semi-rigid) and standard closed basketweave ankle taping, each compared with a no support control. In addition, a comparison of PL and TA was conducted to determine muscle differences on measures of RL and TPA. Significantly shorter RL in the PL were observed in the lace-up and semi <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> conditions compared to the no brace (p= 0. 004, p less than 0. 001) control. Similarly, the semi-rigid brace was significantly shorter than the tape (p less than 0. 001) condition. In the TA, RL were significantly shorter for the lace-up than the no brace (p less than 0. 008) control. TPA values were significantly shorter for the lace-up and semi <b>rigid</b> <b>brace</b> conditions in the TA compared to the no brace (p= 0. 007, p= 0. 001) control; and the semi-rigid brace TPA was significantly shorter than tape (p less than 0. 001). No significant differences were observed in either RL or TPA measurements (p greater than 0. 05) between the PL and TA. The dynamic task in this study better replicates the conditions which often precipitate ankle injury. Results indicate the application of ankle support may be beneficial in heightening the sensitivity of dynamic restraints, thus minimizing the effects of a rapid inversion mechanism. In particular, the lace-up and semi-rigid braces appeared to be the most effective in hastening muscular responses observed during a dynamic task. The implications for these findings would be of particular interest to the clinician when recommending the type of prophylactic support to be employed during sport activity...|$|R

5000|$|The AC was {{conceived}} in mid-1916, being {{derived from the}} Type N via the unbuilt Type U. It differed from earlier single-seat Morane-Saulnier aircraft in that it had ailerons for lateral control rather than wing warping, and because of its <b>rigid</b> wing <b>bracing,</b> with a wire braced truss of steel tubes supporting the wings from below. [...] It appeared in autumn of that year, and {{was found to be}} aerodynamically clean.|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{scoliosis}} predominantly afflicts adolescents. Adolescents {{with mild}} curvatures do not generally have any symptoms. However spinal fusion is indicated when the deformity exceeds 45 o. Treatment is thus {{necessary to prevent}} and/or reduce the progression of curvatures to that below which surgery is indicated. Conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis includes observation, scoliosis-specific exercises (SSE) and bracing. There is increasing evidence suggesting that SSE and brace treatment can significantly limit the progression of spinal curvatures. In growing adolescents with curvatures more than 20 o, bracing is indicated and {{should be used in}} conjunction with SSE. The effectiveness of bracing varies according to the type of brace applied to the patient. In general <b>rigid</b> <b>braces</b> are preferable to soft flexible braces, as the latter falls short of halting curvatures progression. Also, preliminary evidence suggests that asymmetric braces which enable over-correction provide more correction when compared with symmetrical braces. Recently it has also been reported that high quality bracing can also reduce curvatures exceeding 45 o in over 70 % of growing adolescents. This new knowledge might possibly increase the threshold of surgical indications to beyond 50 o or above in the near future...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new <b>rigid</b> <b>brace,</b> the Sforzesco brace, {{according to a new}} concept SPoRT (Symmetric, Patient-oriented, Rigid, Three-dimensional, active). The aim {{of this study is to}} verify the first results of the SPoRT concept compared to a classical 3 point system. DESIGN: A pair-controlled retrospective study. POPULATION: 15 Patients (22 females), 14. 0 +/- 1. 7 years, 39. 8 +/- 9. 8 degrees Cobb (degrees C). We examined for differences between the two groups, at the start with SPoRT worst than LY. All degrees C and degrees B parameters (maximal, average and single localizations) decreased significantly in both groups, apart from thoracic degrees C in LY. SPoRT had better results than LY (P< 0. 05) for maximal degrees C and average degrees C. Moreover, degrees C clinical results were better (P< 0. 05) in SPoRT than LY. SPoRT had better results than LY in aesthetic (P< 0. 05) of the shoulders and waists. Brace is effective in the short term also in high degree curves, and SPoRT obtained statistically significant 80 % better degrees C results than LY in the worst scoliosis curve, and 40 % in the average of all curves, as well as better aesthetic...|$|R
