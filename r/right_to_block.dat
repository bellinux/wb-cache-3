5|$|Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland {{to lunch}} on 30 October, {{immediately}} preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating {{the threat of}} a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> supply, refused any compromise.|$|E

Chanticleer Holdings LLC, which had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> the sale after a $5million loan made in 2006, did so in a December 1, 2010, letter to the court. As a result, Chanticleer and other investors bought the company.|$|E

25|$|On the 7th Masséna turned {{south and}} {{attacked}} Auffenberg at Chur. He sent his light infantry around the Austrian <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> escape by the Plessur valley. One source asserted that Auffenberg lost 3,000 prisoners, 16 guns and his supply magazines. Another source {{stated that the}} Austrians lost 1,000 prisoners and four guns {{out of a total}} of 2,400 men. The French suffered only 100 killed and wounded out of 9,600 soldiers. Meanwhile, Oudinot's brigade crossed the Rhine on a wagon bridge and moved north toward Feldkirch. Hotze attacked Oudinot outside Feldkirch with a numerically equal force. The battle hung in the balance until Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge arrived with reinforcements sent by Masséna. Toward evening Oudinot led a cavalry charge which flung Hotze back into the town. The French captured 1,000 Austrian soldiers and four guns. Another authority gave French casualties as 200 out of 9,000 and Austrian casualties as 1,100 out of 6,000. Not all the French forces were successful. Marching from the Saint Gotthard Pass, Louis Henri Loison's brigade was mauled by an Austrian-Swiss force near Disentis.|$|E

500|$|Two nights after San Diego Padres {{management}} informed Nevin that Xavier Nady {{would replace}} {{him as the}} starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005. Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises, {{one of which was}} the Orioles. He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the non-waiver trade deadline, to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump. In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1–12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting average under [...]200, known as the [...] "Mendoza Line". The Rangers benched Nevin in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrian Gonzalez after the team was eliminated from playoff contention. In his first game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to [...]182. He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.|$|E

New York Giants owner Tim Mara used his {{territorial}} <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> the move. He had good reason: the Yankees had displaced the Giants as New York's premier baseball team after moving into The House That Ruth Built, three rival football leagues had planted teams there hoping to duplicate that feat, and Topping (of Anaconda Copper) was significantly wealthier than Mara.|$|R
500|$|In {{accordance}} with its Acceptable Use Policy, Valve retains the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> and unblock customers' {{access to their}} games and Steam services when Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional price differences. Blocking such users initially removed access {{to his or her}} other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions of the AUP. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts' Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in offline mode and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam's end user license agreements; this occurred in August 2012. In April 2015, Valve added Game Bans to its service, allowing developers to set bans on players for their games but enacted and enforced at the Steam level, allowing developers to police their own gaming communities in customizable manner.|$|E
500|$|On 22 October, Whitlam {{had asked}} the Attorney-General, Kep Enderby, to have a paper drafted rebutting the Ellicott opinion for {{presentation}} to Kerr. Enderby delegated this task to the Solicitor-General, Maurice Byers, and other officials. On 6 November, Enderby was to see Kerr {{to give him a}} legal opinion regarding the Government's alternative plans in case supply ran out. Vouchers were to be issued to Commonwealth employees and contractors instead of cheques, to be redeemed from banks after the crisis ended—transactions which were to be rejected by major banks as [...] "tainted with illegality". Enderby decided to present Kerr with the rebuttal to Ellicott. When Enderby reviewed the document, he found that, while it argued for the Government's position, it recognised both that the Senate had the constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> supply, and that the reserve powers were still extant—matters with which Enderby did not agree. He presented Kerr with the rebuttal, but crossed out Byers' signature on it and told Kerr of his disagreement. Enderby told Kerr that the Byers rebuttal was [...] "background" [...] for formal written advice, to be presented by Whitlam. Later that day, Kerr met with Fraser again. The Opposition leader told him that if Kerr did not dismiss Whitlam, the Opposition planned to criticise him in Parliament for failing to carry out his duty.|$|E

He said that the Murfreesboro project was [...] "not a mosque for religious purposes". His remarks were strongly criticized by commentators. Stephen Fotopulos of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition said Cain's comments [...] "demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the U.S. Constitution." [...] The ICM's imam Ossama Bahloul said it was [...] "sad to hear these words coming from a GOP presidential candidate, who is not only supposed to believe in but should also uphold the US constitution. Mr. Cain is encouraged to educate himself about the first amendment and learn more about our peaceful and productive Muslim community in Murfreesboro." ...|$|E

[...] Megaupload requested an apology from UMG, and {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on December 12, 2011. UMG denied that the takedown was ordered {{under the terms of the}} Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and said that the takedown was [...] "pursuant to the UMG-YouTube agreement", which gives UMG [...] "the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> or remove user-posted videos through YouTube's CMS (Content Management System) based on a number of contractually specified criteria."

50|$|Autodesk counter {{claimed that}} copies of its {{software}} were licensed, not {{sold to the}} original parties. Thus, in Autodesk's view, the first-sale doctrine did not apply - the original parties were never owners of their copies and so had no authority to resell the software to Vernor. Thus Vernor was infringing Autodesk's copyright and Autodesk was within their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> such sales. Autodesk also contended that, as the CD was a mechanism for making {{a copy of the}} software, Vernor enabled his clients to make unlicensed copies of Autodesk software and Vernor was liable for contributory copyright infringement. Finally, Autodesk claimed that in purchasing the software from a licensee, Vernor was bound by the terms of that license - despite never having agreed to it. This last claim was dismissed by the court.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the likely combinatorial effects of U. S. deregulatory broadband {{policies and the}} evolution of law as applied to corporations as a general matter. It explains how legal developments in both areas have dismantled bodies of law or doctrines that had developed to address corporate power in both commercial and political spheres and to protect consumers from vulnerability in commercial activities. Moreover, the coexistence of these developments enables an unprecedented transfer of corporate power between economic and policymaking institutions. With the decline in regulatory constraints, as well as the rise in constitutional <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> attempts <b>to</b> impose regulatory constraints, there is a resurgent rise of corporate power. The result may be a phase transition undermining the rule of law so critical to sustainable democracies.

5000|$|Fortunately, however, it {{happened}} {{that each of the}} ground-leases of the row of detached and semi-detached residences called Ravenscourt Park, extending southwards from No. 23 (then occupied by Mr Ebenezer Stanley Burchett, as owner of the unexpired term of the ground-lease) and including the late Mr. Frank Dethbridge's picturesque house called [...] "The Hermitage", (also held on a ground-lease), contained a proviso giving the ground-tenants the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> forbid any building on the width of the park, opposite their frontages, extending almost halfway to the fine avenue of elms running north and south on {{the eastern side of the}} estate. The new freeholder immediately took discreet steps to remove this obstacle to the complete building over of the property, by buying out, for small sums of cash down, the rights of prohibition attaching to the several ground-leases and in two or three cases ground-tenants were tempted into waiving their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>block</b> any building opposite their respective frontages, in return for a certain money payment.|$|R
