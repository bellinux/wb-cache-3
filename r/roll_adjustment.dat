40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This <b>roll</b> <b>adjustment,</b> however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the amount of <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment</b> that compensates wear, a model for <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment,</b> which reduces the increased exit cross-sectional area owing to wear up to a base exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit cross-sectional area calculated by the <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment</b> model is in good agreement with the exit cross-sectional area measured. It has been found from the pilot hot rolling test that variation in exit cross-sectional area is almost linearly proportional to roll gap change while the roll gap decreases from a datum roll gap to about half of the datum one...|$|R

40|$|A {{next-generation}} in-water profiler {{designed to}} measure the apparent optical properties (AOPs) of seawater was developed and validated across a wide dynamic range of in-water properties. The new free-falling instrument, the Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS), {{was based on a}} cluster of 19 state-of-the-art microradiometers spanning 320 – 780 nm and a new kite-shaped backplane design. The kite-shaped backplane includes tunable ballast, a hydrobaric buoyancy chamber, plus pitch and <b>roll</b> <b>adjustments,</b> to provide unprecedented stability and vertical resolution in near-surface waters. A unique data set was collected as part of the development activity and the first major field campaign that used the new instrument, the Malina expedition to the Beaufort Sea {{in the vicinity of the}} Mackenzie River outflow. The data were of sufficient resolution and quality to show that errors &ndash; more correctly, uncertainties &ndash; in the execution of data sampling protocols were measurable at the 1 % and 1 cm level with C-OPS. A sensitivity analysis as a function of three water types established by the peak in the remote sensing reflectance spectrum, Rrs(&lambda;), revealed which water types and which parts of the spectrum were the most sensitive to data acquisition uncertainties. Shallow riverine waters were the most sensitive water type, and the ultraviolet and near-infrared were the most sensitive parts of the spectrum. The sensitivity analysis also showed how the use of data products based on band ratios significantly mitigated the influence of data acquisition uncertainties. The unprecedented vertical resolution provided high quality data products at the spectral end members, which subsequently supported an alternative classification capability based on the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd(λ). The Kd(320) and Kd(780) data showed how complex coastal systems can be distinguished two-dimensionally and how near-ice water masses are different from the open ocean. Finally, an algorithm for predicting the spectral absorption due to colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), denoted aCDOM(&lambda;), was developed using the Kd(320) /Kd(780) ratio, which was based on a linear relationship with respect to aCDOM(440), with over 99 % of the variance explained. The robustness of the approach was established by expanding the use of the algorithm to include a geographically different coastal environment, the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight, with no significant change in accuracy (approximately 98 % of the variance explained). Alternative spectral end members reminiscent of next-generation (340 and 710 nm) as well as legacy satellite missions (412 and 670 nm) were also used to accurately derive aCDOM(440) from Kd(λ) ratios (94 % or more of the variance explained) ...|$|R
40|$|Strip thickness, a key quality {{variable}} in rolling process, must be controlled {{to within a}} narrow tolerance to meet the increasingly commercial demand for more accurate and consistent dimensional requirements. Therefore, {{a great variety of}} automatic gauge control systems have been introduced to rolling process since the mid-fifties, among which, the gaugemeter control plays an essential and critical role, since all other gauge controls are normally applied in conjunction with the gaugemeter control to obtain accurate quality. The gaugemeter control has been successfully applied in industry to satisfy the thickness requirements to a certain extent, particularly when it is implemented in combination with other controls. However, the competitive markets request so ever-increasingly stringent thickness quality that the conventional gaugemeter control can not catch up. This {{is due to the fact}} that the conventional gaugemeter control is based on linear models whereas rolling is so complex that it can not be described as a linear process with a satisfied accuracy. This study proposes an intelligent control by using neural networks and fuzzy systems to improve the thickness control performance. Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks are investigated and applied to model the non-linear relationship between roll gap, rolling force and exit thickness, which replaces the linear gaugemeter equation employed in the gaugemeter control. Meanwhile, a newly adaptive fuzzy controller is developed to produce control signals. This fuzzy controller dynamically approximates the relationship between the exit thickness error and the required <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment</b> control signal by adapting itself based on the evaluation of its previous control performance, rather than requiring accurate values of mill elastic modulus and material plastic modulus. A computer simulation based on a dynamic mathematical model of rolling process verifies the feasibility of this neurofiizzy control scheme. The simulation also confirms that an application of neural networks and fuzzy systems to a rolling process is feasible in extended ways by investigating an integral neural control and an integral fuzzy control. The neurofiizzy control is developed on an experimental rolling mill to embody a real-time application, which is fully implemented in C/C++ Language. To provide an intuitive input and output interface for this system, an interactive graphical user interface is developed. Experiments are conducted to test the neurofiizzy control and to compare its performance with the gaugemeter control. Experiments with the gaugemeter control confirm that the control performance is improved as the compensation coefficient C increases, but over-compensation will occur when C = 1. 0, which might result in an unstable control. Experiments with the neurofiizzy control indicate that this control scheme improves strip quality significantly in terms of exit thickness standard deviation compared with the gaugemeter control. From the experimental results with different values to adaptation coefficient for the adaptive fuzzy controller, the following conclusions are obtained. • The neural model possesses the non-linear capability to estimate exit thickness more accurately. • The adaptive fuzzy controller successfully determines the relationship between the exit thickness error and required <b>roll</b> gap <b>adjustment</b> by adapting itself to produce an accurate control signal. The above two mechanisms are beneficial to the improvement of thickness control. Therefore, combining them, the neurofuzzy control is an improved control scheme which is demonstrated both by theory and experiments...|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} on the porcine eyeball is conducted in several steps. The first step “translation” is implemented {{to locate the}} sclerotomy site and align the instrument tip point with the sclerotomy site. In this mode, only the PC host computer is active to control the robot, and only the SCARA stages are actuated during this mode. The next step “pose adjustment’’ is applied to obtain a suitable pose of the instrument for further passing through the trocar, the robot is still controlled only by the PC host computer in this step, and {{the movements of the}} RCM mechanisms contribute to the tilt and <b>roll</b> pose <b>adjustment</b> of the end-effector. Then, the robotic system in the following steps is manipulated by the main surgeon with the master controller. Firstly, the step “insertion” is conducted to insert the instrument into the eye model, the instrument is moved into the eye model along its axial direction consecutively or intermittently without damage to the scleral insertion point. Then, the instrument tip is moved to a desired location and touches the target point on the retina to accomplish particular tasks such as stenting or endodiathermy. When the surgical operation is completed, the “retreat” mode is activated to remove the instrument from the eyeball by pressing the exit button on the master controller. Finally, the robot joints return to the initial site in “return-to-zero” mode controlled by the PC host computer. The experiments have demonstrated the possibility of the clinical use of the robot assisted RVBS in the future.|$|R

UPMC McKeesport had an outdated and unreliable system for paging medical residents, which placed unnecessary stress and added work on the residents and nurses. A multidisciplinary process improvement team formed {{to find a solution}} to meet the needs and desires of all stakeholders. To find the ideal solution to the problem, the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) framework was used to guide the team along the way.

After <b>roll</b> out, minor <b>adjustments</b> were made based on feedback from end users. Ultimately, the system that is currently in place is operating at a much higher reliability level and complaints have significantly reduced from the residents and the nurses. Continual evaluation and adjustment will keep the system functioning at a high level into the future. This project impacts public health in that it improves the resident physician training experience, which helps the hospital recruit these physicians to the area.

40|$|Retrofitting of commercially {{available}} vehicles, which includes mostly sports utility vehicles, to bullet proof vehicle {{is a common}} practice. Retrofitting of {{commercially available}} vehicle into bullet proof vehicle increases overall weight of the vehicle which is unevenly distributed on different portions of the vehicle. This additional weight after installation of bullet proof material in the vehicle, affects not only acceleration and braking performance but also has serious implication on {{the stability of the}} vehicle. Handling response of bullet proof vehicle after retrofitting of commercially available vehicle needs investigation especially with respect to increase in weight and its distribution. Rollover is an important research area of vehicle dynamics which is instigated primarily due to steer input given to the wheels. Roll dynamics of a vehicle is dependent on many vehicle parameters mainly, overall weight of the vehicle, stiffness of the suspension, forces developed during braking and acceleration, variation of center of gravity location of the vehicle and coefficient of friction of road surface. This work offers a preliminary analysis and study of rollover tendency in bullet proof vehicle and offer a suitable solution to avoid expected bullet proof vehicle rollover due to uncertain driving maneuvers. Experimental tests have been performed on converted bullet proof Land Rover 110 to predict rollover propensity present in the vehicle. Specialized apparatus "vehicle roll analyzer" has been developed for real time measurement of different parameters like accelerations in x,y and z direction, displacement of sprung mass during cornering to approximate dynamic load shifting and roll,pitch and yaw angles of the vehicle. Real time vehicle data of the vehicle during testing has been further validated by using software "kinetics". These parameters along with other measured parameters have been utilized for load transfer, CG analysis and skid pad testing. Prevention is suggested by applying hybrid control strategy that is by uniform distribution of weight in the first phase and then subsequently application of active <b>roll</b> angle <b>adjustment</b> in the later stage. After application of suggested control strategy improvement in the rollover behavior of the vehicle has been achieved while attaining improvement in load shifting during cornering and also optimally locating center of gravity of the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Small {{sailboat}} kinetics {{are significantly}} affected by bodyweight {{motions of the}} sailor. Highly dynamic motions of the boat lead to unsteady aerodynamics around the sail. These unsteady flows are studied using a two-part approach. First, on-the-water tests in a modified Laser sailboat capture {{the motion of the}} boat and sail. Subsequently, these characteristic motions are the basis for towing tank experiments exploring fundamental 2 D flows around representative sail sections. The “Sail-Flicking”, “S-Turn”, and “Roll-Tacking” kinetic techniques are explored in depth. Each technique is used by racing sailors to improve the performance during specific portions of a race and are most effective in select wind conditions. Sail Flicking consists of repeated small amplitude sail pulses which increase straight-line speed in upwind and cross-wind sailing. In the 2 D case, a vortex pair is shed during each individual “flick”. The benefit in driving force is maximized at apparent wind angles near 45 °. Sail Flicking effectiveness scales with the non-dimensional parameters reduced frequency and heave-to-chord ratio, making the technique most effective in light wind. The S-Turning technique uses coordinated turns, <b>rolls,</b> and sail <b>adjustments</b> while sailing downwind. It is named after the boat's “S” shaped path through the water. On-the-water tests show a measurable increase in downwind Velocity Made Good, VMG, while laboratory experiments indicate constructive interaction between the sail and vortices shed during each motion period. Sailboats tack back and forth to make progress into the wind. During a Roll-Tack, sailors allow the boat to reach a high heel angle during the turn. An aggressive bodyweight shift then rolls the boat upright, sweeping the sail through the air and increasing driving force. On-the-water tests show that Roll-Tacking in light wind increases windward VMG relative to straight-line sailing and relative to tacks which do not roll the boat. 2 D laboratory experiments representing a slice of the sail show the formation of a strong vortex pair associated with a six fold increase in driving force. 2019 - 02 - 0...|$|R
