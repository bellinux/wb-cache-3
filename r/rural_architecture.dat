25|$|From {{the period}} between early {{agricultural}} settlements {{and up to the}} late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style <b>rural</b> <b>architecture</b> and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as Valdivia, Frutillar, Puerto Varas, Osorno, Temuco, Puerto Octay, Llanquihue, Faja Maisan, Pitrufquén, Victoria, Pucón and Puerto Montt.|$|E

They have a stone foundation and first floor and a wooden second storey. The walls, floors and ceilings are constructed from oak timber. The houses often follow an elongated plan — all rooms are arranged one after another. An important architectural element is the fireplace, built in stone, up to [...] wide in its foundations and [...] deep. It narrows in height and takes the shape of a truncated pyramid. Examples of Strandzhan houses have been preserved in Malko Tarnovo, Brashlyan and Kosti.|$|E

2500|$|Cape Dutch {{architecture}} {{is a traditional}} South African Afrikaner architecture {{and is one of}} the most distinctive styles of 'settler' architecture in the world. It is known as the 'Cape Dutch' style, because it developed during the century and a half that the Cape was a Dutch colony. Even at the end of that period, at the beginning of the 19th century, the colony was inhabited by fewer than fifty thousand people, mostly of white and brown complexion. This number was spread over an area roughly the size of the United Kingdom. Yet despite their small number, over such a vast area, the Cape Dutch style was of an amazing consistency, clearly related to <b>rural</b> <b>architecture</b> in northwestern Europe, but equally clearly with its own unmistakable African character and features.|$|E
2500|$|The {{visitor center}} and gardens were {{designed}} by GWWO, Inc., Architects, an architectural design firm based in Baltimore. Chris Elcock was the lead architect. The buildings were located on the site and oriented to face north, {{the direction in which}} Tubman led slaves to freedom. Plans called for four buildings, three dedicated to exhibits and one to house administrative offices. Each of the buildings is shaped like a barn, since Tubman and the slaves she was leading to freedom often slept in barns at night and barns are evocative of the <b>rural</b> <b>architecture</b> of the area. The three exhibit buildings are clad in a light green zinc siding which will dull with time. Zinc was chosen because it is a self-healing material which the architects felt reflected the healing which has gone on since the American Civil War. The administration building is clad in wood. Construction of the buildings utilized a number of craftsman. Building materials included stone and reclaimed wood, and the architectural style featured exposed beams and timbers. [...] The buildings were designed to have windows which featured views of the surrounding wildlife refuge, little of which had changed since Tubman's day. All the structures were designed to be green buildings with at least a LEED Silver certification. The buildings feature geothermal heating and cooling, green roofs, permeable paving in parking areas and on pathways, and solar-powered external lighting.|$|E

40|$|Banca del fare” is {{an ambitious}} project {{proposed}} by “Cultural Park Alta Langa”. It is born to hand ancient knowledges down to young people, as meeting place useful to exchange {{the development of}} new construction techniques {{and at the same time}} the traditional ones. A program of educational workshops, which constitute the summer school, was organized for increasing communication among different generations. Indeed, the last local craftsmen or artisans are coming out from their employment and there is no training process to ensure the migration of knowledge to young architects. The activities of the school took place for the first time during summer of 2016 in Alta Langa, the southern part of Langhe in Piedmont. The landscape of this area is marked by small <b>rural</b> <b>architectures</b> called “ciabòts” shed all over the countryside. Artisans and students work together to recover these buildings every year. The aim of this landscape heritage’s valorization is to relate the restored ciabòt into a network, in order to create a widespread hotels system. Therefore, the essay wants to present the results of “Banca del fare” and to suggest a GIS project that can gather information about numerous “ciabòt” widespread in this territory. The interaction between land development and networking process can ensure the optimal reuse of these <b>rural</b> <b>architectures...</b>|$|R

60|$|Miss Dunstable did {{not look}} like a love-lorn maiden, as she stood in a small ante-chamber {{at the top of her}} drawing-room stairs, {{receiving}} her guests. Her house was one of those abnormal mansions, which are to be seen here and there in London, built in compliance rather with the rules of <b>rural</b> <b>architecture,</b> than with those which usually govern the erection of city streets and town terraces. It stood back from its brethren, and alone, so that its owner could walk round it. It was approached by a short carriage-way; the chief door was in the back of the building; and the front of the house looked on to one of the parks. Miss Dunstable in procuring it had had her usual luck. It had been built by an eccentric millionaire at an enormous cost; and the eccentric millionaire, after living in it for twelve months, had declared that it did not possess a single comfort, and that it was deficient in most of those details which, in point of house accommodation, are necessary to the very existence of man. Consequently the mansion was sold, and Miss Dunstable was the purchaser. Cranbourn House it had been named, and its present owner had made no change in this respect; but the world at large very generally called it Ointment Hall, and Miss Dunstable herself as frequently used that name for it as any other. It was impossible to quiz Miss Dunstable with any success, because she always joined in the joke herself. Not a word further had passed between Mrs. Gresham and Dr. Thorne on the subject of their last conversation; but the doctor as he entered the lady's portals amongst a tribe of servants and in a glare of light, and saw the crowd before him and the crowd behind him, felt that it was quite impossible that he should ever be at home there. It might be all right that a Miss Dunstable should live in this way, but it could not be right that the wife of Dr. Thorne should so live. But all this was a matter of the merest speculation, for he was well aware--as he said to himself a dozen times--that his niece had blundered strangely in her reading of Miss Dunstable's character.|$|E
