She also said: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the hospital (in Dhaka), I treated so many seven- or eight-year-old girls who were raped by their male relatives, some 50 or 60 years old.

[...] "I just wrote that song then and handed it {{over to her and}} sung a little bit of it, just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown." [...] Toussaint captured solitude that remains possible in a depths of a rain sodden night.|$|E
2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City.

I would probably say I dedicated my high school years to politics when I guess I should have been more into school activities. My classmates would call me 'mayor'. But I always believed it's vitally important for young people to get involved. We are the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The third track, [...] "Runaway Lover", is a trance/house rave track. It {{is one of}} Madonna's collaborations with William Orbit for the album. The {{following}} track, [...] "I Deserve It", is an acoustic-framed {{track that}} is anchored by a hip-hop inflected groove. Madonna said the track [...] "has the strangest juxtaposition of this folky, simple song and this high-tech, ominous synth line." [...] The song lends weight to rich, introspective lyrics, such as the chorus lines: [...] "Many miles, many roads I have traveled, fallen down of the way/Many hearts, many years have unraveled, leading up to today." [...] "Amazing", the fifth track, is a vibrant tempo-shifter that opens with a soft, music-box-like keyboard/string flourish. The song has been compared by Madonna to [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] (1999), saying the reason she fought with her record company to cancel the release as a single {{was because of the}} similarity. The sixth track, [...] "Nobody's Perfect", includes ethereal vocals and a dreamy keyboard. The following track and second single, [...] "Don't Tell Me", was written by Joe Henry, Madonna's brother-in-law. He performed and released the track, originally named [...] "Stop", on his 2001 album Scar. His wife Melanie sent a demo of the track to her sister, who liked it and recorded her version. It is framed by soft acoustic guitars and subtle keyboard lines. The eighth track and third single, [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl", comments on female role-playing in society. The following track, [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)", has lyrics sung in French, and the lyric [...] "I can't <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young, I can't explain if it was wrong" [...] reflected an artistic palette, [...] "encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics." [...] Musically, it draws influence from Edith Piaf. The song was also included on Mirwais Ahmadzaï's album Production. The tenth and final track on the album, [...] "Gone", contrasts acoustic guitars with electronic elements. Soulful vocals give depth to such striking, cautionary lyrics as [...] "Turn to stone, lose my faith, and I'll be gone." ...|$|E

The French woman-servant whom <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Monsieur Bonnefoy's pupil, made her appearance, and conducted me to her young mistress's dressing-room.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Stack Magazine in May 2017, Lewis explained “A {{lot of people think}} it's about relationships, but it's more about how with every year that passes, life gets a little bit less exciting. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in London a year ago and a few music things were happening, and I'm like “Why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> not really enjoying my life?
