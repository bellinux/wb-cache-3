Jean-Paul Sartre: loving sado-masochistically [...] 5. Simone de Beauvoir: loving authentically [...] 6. Conclusion"This {{thesis is}} an existential study of <b>romantic</b> <b>loving.</b> Its central thesis is that existential philosophies emphasise the {{importance}} of freeing oneself from misplaced expectations and flawed ideals about the nature of, and behaviour associated with, <b>romantic</b> <b>loving.</b> Existentialists have argued that if romantic lovers free themselves from these problematic ideas {{they are free to}} reinvigorate <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> in a way that allows for authentically meaningful relationships. Five existential philosophers - Max Stirner, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir - are studied because they provide narratives by which roots of dissatisfactions and frustrations within our everyday ideas about <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> can be examined, and possibilities for resolution can be explored. An analysis of such existential notions as freedom, power, choice, authenticity and anxiety, challenges our assumptions regarding the nature and meaning of <b>romantic</b> <b>loving.</b> Stirner argued that <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> characterised by obligations and unselfishness is hypocritical and unsatisfying. Instead he proposed self-loving and the creation of relationships which one finds enjoyable and interesting. Kierkegaard suggested that <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> was inherently disappointing due to its unstable and finite nature and advocated marriage and religious love as more secure foundations for relationships. Nietzsche proposed that the problems in <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> often stem from out-dated Christian values, inappropriate social conventions, and petty power dynamics. His medley of suggestions to resolve such issues is underpinned by the fundamental goal of striving towards the ideal of the Übermensch. Sartre argued that <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> is inherently frustrating because relationships descend into sadomasochistic dialectics in an attempt to attain an unrealisable ideal, and was sceptical about possible solutions. Beauvoir argued that dissatisfaction in <b>romantic</b> <b>loving</b> stems from possessive behaviours and more harmonious relationships can be achieved through reciprocal recognition of two freedoms.

5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, <b>romantic</b> <b>love</b> was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E

Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career.

Most of the songs were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah.

5|$|Although <b>romantic</b> <b>love</b> was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

5|$|In post-classical times, Myrrha has had {{widespread}} {{influence in}} Western culture. She was {{mentioned in the}} Divine Comedy by Dante, was an inspiration for Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri, and was alluded to in Mathilda by Mary Shelley. In the play Sardanapalus by Byron, a character named Myrrha appeared, whom critics interpreted {{as a symbol of}} Byron's dream of <b>romantic</b> <b>love.</b> The myth of Myrrha was one of 24 tales retold in Tales from Ovid by English poet Ted Hughes. In art, Myrrha's seduction of her father has been illustrated by German engraver Virgil Solis, her tree-metamorphosis by French engraver Bernard Picart and Italian painter Marcantonio Franceschini, while French engraver Gustave Doré chose to depict Myrrha in Hell as a part of his series of engravings for Dante's Divine Comedy. In music, she has appeared in pieces by Sousa and Ravel. She was also the inspiration for several species' scientific names and an asteroid.|$|E
5|$|The group battles Fei-Wang who {{destroys the}} Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure <b>romantic</b> <b>love</b> for each other as they hope to meet again.|$|E
