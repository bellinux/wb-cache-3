5|$|Despite the Netherlands {{being the}} seat of Philips, one of Europe's largest {{producers}} of radio equipment, the Dutch army mostly used telephone connections; only the Artillery had been equipped with the modest number of 225 <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Only {{one of the}} Do 17s {{delivered}} {{was fitted}} out complete with German equipment. The rest of the Dorniers were equipped with Belgian FN 7.9mm (.31in) machine guns, Czech camera equipment and eventually Telefunken <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> Altogether, 70 Do 17s were produced by Yugoslav factories.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional <b>radio</b> <b>sets,</b> mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E

50|$|The AN/TRC-97 <b>Radio</b> <b>Set,</b> or TRC-97, is a <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> {{that has}} 12 {{multiplex}} channels and 16 telegraph channels connected to an analog <b>radio.</b> The <b>radio</b> <b>set</b> is a mobile terminal that can transmit up to 40 miles straight line-of-sight {{at up to}} 1 watt, using a traveling wave tube amplifier, or 96 miles in tropospheric scatter at up to 1 kilowatt, using a tunable klystron amplifier, at a frequency range of 4.4 to 5 gigahertz and 1.2 to 2.2 gigahertz. The set has been manufactured by RCA, Camden, N.J.|$|R

5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and we started the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was educated}} at Cooma Public School {{until the age}} of twelve, when the family moved to Haberfield in Sydney; his father was by then working as a labourer. He {{attended}} Petersham Boys' School, becoming a prefect in 1932 and vice captain the following year. As well as playing sport, he was a keen aircraft modeller and built crystal <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b> Having attained his intermediate certificate, Hughes entered Fort Street High School in February 1934. He left after eight months to take up employment at Saunders' Jewellers in George Street, Sydney, and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 20January 1936. Hughes had also applied to, and been accepted by, the Royal Australian Navy, but chose the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|The Allied advance was {{severely}} hampered by poor communications in these crucial initial phases. The paratroopers' <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> range was instantly {{limited by the}} wooded terrain and as the battalions advanced they lost contact with Divisional HQ at the landing zones. Over the coming nine days, radio communication within the division, with Browning's HQ at Nijmegen, with XXX Corps and with the United Kingdom would be intermittent and unreliable, severely hampering the British units. Carrier pigeons were even used {{to make contact with}} Britain. Partly as a consequence of this limitation, Urquhart decided to follow the 1st Parachute Brigade and make contact with Lathbury. When he found the Brigade HQ on Lion route, he was informed by Major Hibbert, who, at that time, was still en route to the bridge, that Lathbury himself was visiting the 3rd Battalion. Urquhart followed Lathbury there but subsequently {{would not be able to}} return to Divisional HQ for two days.|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 <b>radio</b> <b>sets,</b> with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfu√ü Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|E

25|$|DAB started {{being tested}} by the BBC in the London area in 1990, and was rolled out fully in 1995. At that time, DAB <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> were {{confined}} to Hi-Fi Tuner separates, and were comparatively expensive (around GBP 800).|$|E
25|$|Due to a drive {{given by}} Dr. Lawrence from 1976, {{as many as}} 31,800 schools were {{supplied}} with <b>radio</b> <b>sets</b> by the public to listen to School broadcasts. All India Radio appreciated this effort as unique {{in the whole of}} India.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression of the 1930s {{nearly killed}} the {{phonograph}} industry. RCA, which bought the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1929, introduced an inexpensive turntable called the Duo Jr., {{which was designed}} to be connected to <b>radio</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|E

25|$|If {{people had}} more than one radio, they might hold one back, or just hand in an old broken set.
