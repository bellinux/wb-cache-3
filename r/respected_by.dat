5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As {{a result of the}} al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad's {{descendants}} through Fatimah {{are known}} as sharifs, syeds or sayyids. These are honorific titles in Arabic, sharif meaning 'noble' and sayed or sayyid meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> both Sunni and Shi'a, though the Shi'a place much more emphasis and value on their distinction.|$|E

5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lithuanian nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because he took the offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> both sides.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|When Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce {{was under}} orders to make best {{possible}} speed.

He was a man of the sea, a man of sobriety and kindness and was well <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> his fellow sea captains.|$|E

5|$|While the Constitution of Congress Poland was {{relatively}} liberal in theory, {{and gave the}} Sejm significant powers (wider {{than those of the}} Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw), in practice those competences were limited, as they were often not <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> the tsar. Jews and peasants lost rights they had previously enjoyed under the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no {{interest}} in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over referee appointments. The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded by threatening to cancel the fixtures if their referee choices were rejected. The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> the New Zealanders.|$|E

5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. He urged delegates to stand as a united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E
5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, especially on the topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, especially {{on the issue of}} science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> many of his academic colleagues.|$|E
5|$|In July 1938, {{at the age}} of 23, Dundas was {{commissioned}} as a pilot officer in No. 609 Squadron RAF, a Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron. Hugh and John's godfather had set up the unit. At that time, the squadron was manned by part-time civilians and was equipped with Hawker Hind bombers. It was converted from a bomber to a fighter aircraft squadron and later, in August 1939, re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire. John Dundas was well <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> his peers and he frequently flew his commanding officer's Hind.|$|E

5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because it was unusual for the cardinals to elect friars, since they were seen by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|Philitas was {{the first}} major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet. His {{reputation}} continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in elegiac meter. His vocabulary Disorderly Words described the meanings of rare literary words, including those used by Homer. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem Demeter, was highly <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Since 1983 Chad was {{de facto}} partitioned, with the {{northern}} half controlled by the rebel Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) headed by Goukouni Oueddei and supported on the ground by Libyan forces, while the south was held by the Western-backed Chadian government guided by Hissène Habré. This partition on 16th parallel (the so-called Red Line) into Libyan and French zones of influence was informally recognised by France in 1984, following an accord between France and Libya to withdraw their forces from Chad. The accord was not <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> Libya, which maintained at least 3,000 men stationed in northern Chad.|$|E

5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E
5|$|Until the end {{of their}} collaboration, Turunen's singing was a {{trademark}} of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish's success. She is <b>respected</b> <b>by</b> other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band.|$|E
