40|$|The design <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> {{origin in}} free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) arouses spirited lobbying campaigns that mostly escape public attention. This article {{argues that the}} domestic groups generally most favorable to FTAs differ in their preferences over <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin: industries with large returns to scale favor strict <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin to gain scale economies in an FTA, while industries with multinational supply chains prefer lenient <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin to accommodate offshore procurement. An econometric analysis <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin in the North American Free Trade Agreement finds tougher <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin the higher the external trade protection and the larger the returns to scale, and more permissive <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin the greater the involvement in foreign sourcing. The results suggest that <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin may be critical to building domestic coalitions for FTAs. Industry preferences toward <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> origin therefore {{have important implications for}} the politics of FTA ratification.

5|$|Democracy, or the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> {{the many}} over themselves. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> the masses is positive, {{in that it}} is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
