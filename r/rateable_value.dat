5|$|In December 1933, Sale Urban District {{submitted}} {{a petition to}} the Privy Council {{in an attempt to}} gain a charter of incorporation. At the time, Sale UD had the largest population and highest <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of any urban district in the country. The petition was successful and on 21 September 1935 Sale UD was granted borough status, and became the Municipal Borough of Sale. Following the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the Municipal Borough of Sale was abolished. Sale became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The town's education, town planning, waste collection, health, social care and other services are administered by Trafford Council.|$|E
25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether {{residential}} or commercial, {{was given a}} <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> which estimated the annual rent it would bring in. In the budgeting process the council would work out the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> within its boundaries to produce {{the proportion of the}} <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.|$|E
25|$|For each {{property}} in the rating list for their area, the local authority calculates and issues a bill, which it is responsible for collecting, with powers to pursue payment. The <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate, referred to in legislation as the non-domestic rating multiplier, to arrive at an annual bill. For example, a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of £10,000 and a multiplier of 40p would produce an annual bill of £4000. The bill usually requires payment in instalments over the financial year.|$|E
5000|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended numerous times to expand these rights, to homeowners having higher <b>rateable</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{dwellings}} {{not already}} subject to control, and with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> {{that did not}} exceed £100 in London, £90 in Scotland and £75 elsewhere were brought back into control.|$|R
50|$|The {{new form}} of control was {{relatively}} simple and inflexible. The Act applied to separate dwellings with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> or standard rents not exceeding £35 in London, £30 in Scotland and £26 elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|In Wales, small {{business}} rates relief was not introduced until 2007. It replaced rural property relief, but included similar provisions, with 50% relief for most properties with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> below £2,000, and 25% relief for rateable values between £2,000 and £5,000. Post offices with rateable values {{of up to}} £9,000 are eligible for 100% relief; while those over £9,000 and up to £12,000 receive 50%. It also authorises local authorities to set up local schemes of relief for properties up to a limit of £12,000 <b>rateable</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
25|$|Assessing a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> {{requires}} a valuation {{that follows the}} above process, but the matters to be considered are constrained by legislation. So the physical properties are considered not at the present day, but at the Material Day, and are constrained by the valuation assumptions. The economic conditions are considered at the Antecedent Valuation Date. The valuation {{is based on a}} hypothetical lease laid down in the valuation assumptions. The Secretary of State may make regulations for certain classes of property that give a statutory formulae for the <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> instead of the rental value. These classes include large ports and public utilities.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary {{relief of}} up to 100% is {{available}} for the previous properties, and for any others up to a current limit of £12000 <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> provided they are judged to be of benefit to the local community.|$|E
50|$|The {{valuation}} list {{contains the}} descriptions and <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> of all tenements {{that have been}} assessed to rates. The Commissioner of Rating and Valuation has the duty to maintain and update the list by means of deletions, interim valuations and corrections.|$|R
2500|$|To {{fund the}} relief in England, a {{supplement}} {{is added to}} the Uniform Business Rate multiplier. However, this supplement is only applied to properties with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> of £15,000 or higher (£21,500 in London), so properties between £12,000 and £18,000 receive neither the relief, or the supplement ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the long}} lapse {{of time between}} revaluations had {{resulted}} in large increases in <b>rateable</b> <b>values.</b> In November 1998, the Government announced that new valuation lists {{would be prepared to}} take effect from 1 April 1999 and revaluations would thereafter be conducted on an annual basis.|$|R
25|$|A rating list is {{required}} to identify each relevant non-domestic property in the area, and assign a <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> based on a rental valuation of the property. Some types of property, such as public utilities, are valued using a statutory formula instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rateable</b> <b>value</b> is an {{estimate}} of the annual rent that would be paid for the property at a fixed date two years prior {{to the beginning of the}} list (known as the antecedent valuation date), incorporating certain assumptions laid down in the legislation.|$|E
25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall increase in liability across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise in liability. Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> would have a significant change in liability. To smooth these jumps in liability, schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. Transitional relief applies only to changes in liability between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> had risen by 20%, the rise in liability would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1999, revaluations were {{normally}} {{carried out}} {{every three years}} or longer. Since 1999, general revaluations have been conducted {{on an annual basis}} to ensure that all <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> in the valuation list are up-to-date and rates are charged equitably according to prevailing market rentals.|$|R
5000|$|To {{fund the}} relief in England, a {{supplement}} {{is added to}} the Uniform Business Rate multiplier. However, this supplement is only applied to properties with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> of £15,000 or higher (£21,500 in London), so properties between £12,000 and £18,000 receive neither the relief, or the supplement ...|$|R
50|$|Rating {{assessments}} (<b>rateable</b> <b>values)</b> {{are made}} on all non-domestic properties. As well as business, this includes village halls and other non-business occupations. The exception to this is where a hereditament is exempt by virtue of Schedule 6 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which specifies exempt classes.|$|R
25|$|The {{tariff system}} used by GWI is highly complex, {{consisting}} of 27 different water tariffs and 4 sewer tariffs in 2007. Water tariffs are differentiated between metered and un-metered customers; domestic, commercial, institutional and industrial customers; whether customers are former customers of GUYWA (outside the capital) or GS & WC (in Georgetown); and the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of {{properties in the}} case of domestic customers.|$|E
25|$|As of 1 April 2008, empty {{relief was}} altered, {{removing}} the previous total relief for industrial properties, and removing the 50% relief for other properties. The three-month period of total relief for non-industrial properties was retained, and a six-month period instituted for industrial properties. In the Pre Budget Report 2008, the Chancellor increased the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> for full relief to £15,000 {{for the period}} 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010.|$|E
25|$|What is {{commonly}} known as an appeal is more correctly known as a proposal to alter the rating list. Proposals can be made on a number of grounds, including challenging the basic <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> an alteration to the property, or proposing a reduction from a specific date due to a particular event (such as changes to a street affecting traffic). When an appeal is made, it will first be discussed with the Valuation Office Agency, who will attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached, and the proposal is not withdrawn, it will be heard by an independent valuation tribunal.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time, in {{defining}} {{the application of the}} Act, there was no reference to rent limits. Because <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> were now the sole criterion for the continued applicability of the Acts, the result was decontrol {{of a large number of}} houses where the recoverable rent would have kept them in control.|$|R
2500|$|For 2016/17 the {{multiplier}} is 49.7 pence and {{the small}} business rate multiplier is 48.4 pence.The multiplier for 2017/18 is 47.9 pence, which means that this tax has increased in real terms by 37.6% {{since its inception in}} 1990. [...] The <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> are updated to current market values, but the multiplier has increased from 34.8p (or 34.8%) to 47.9p (47.9%).|$|R
50|$|The 1965 Act had {{previously}} provided the power by Ministerial Order for the progressive conversion of existing controlled tenancies to regulated tenancies. This power was never exercised and the Housing Act 1969 introduced a phased programme of conversion, determined by <b>rateable</b> <b>values,</b> and the qualification certificate procedure outlined below, for those controlled tenancies in good repair and equipped with standard amenities.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher began {{preparations}} for a Community Charge {{to replace the}} council rates. Instead of one payment per household based on <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of the property, the poll tax was to be paid by all people who were 18 or over. While the Labour Party conference, {{in the autumn of}} 1988, had rejected a campaign of non-payment, Militant argued for a strategy of non-payment and supporting Anti-Poll Tax Unions, beginning in Scotland. Grant had opposed this option, arguing that Militant's MPs should pay the poll tax, partly for the group's self-protection, but was overruled.|$|E
25|$|To give {{relief to}} {{properties}} considered vital to rural communities, {{a combination of}} compulsory and discretionary reliefs exist in England. The Welsh scheme was incorporated into small business rates relief from 1 April 2007. Properties of a given <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> (£7000 in England from 2005) can receive the relief {{if they are in}} a rural settlement (defined as a population of 3000 or less, within designated rural areas), and are the only general store or post office, or a food store. The only public house or petrol station (with rateable values of up £10500, as of 2005) may also receive the relief, which is a mandatory 50%.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{may also}} be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities. Reliefs are {{administered}} by the local authority {{and they do not}} affect the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of a property. While some are mandatory, others are at the discretion of the local authority, who also have to bear, in whole or in part, the costs of some reliefs. In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority. A relief on non-agricultural business on agricultural land or former agricultural buildings has been removed with effect from 14 August 2006.|$|E
50|$|The borough {{covered the}} same area of the parish of Deptford St Paul, which had been {{separated}} from the neighbouring parish of Deptford St Nicholas to its north in 1730. The <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> of the two parishes had been roughly equal when they were separated, but St Paul contained all the farmland to the south, the majority of which was built on over the next 170 years.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on the usage of property <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> {{in an analysis of}} the central parts of Umeå. The purpose of the study has been to localise certain spatial patterns in the <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> and however the dispersion of levels of value can bee linked with the distance to the central point. The hypothetical presumptions has been suggesting that the central point most likely ought to be localised in {{the central part of the}} area. Based on William Alonso´s bid-rent curve, the analyse of Umeå should not indicate on a complete linear relation between value and distance from the central point, but the nearness to this point should influence on the pattern. The pattern should demonstrate higher values in the central and east parts due to a business district in the centre and a university-hospital area in the eastern parts. The result of the analyse is partly corresponding to the hypothesis. The <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> show their highest levels in the central part of Umeå, where also the central point is localised. The assumption that the eastern part of the area should be higher assessed than the western part corresponds with a light overstatement. The type of usage of the property has proved to be of importance for the size of the value. It is though clear that the bid-rent relationship don’t act freely in a free market situation. The Swedish planning tradition forms a strong fundament of control and leadership acting in the benefit of everyone. This results in a complex relationship where the market and the community works side by side and both influence one another. Inom EU-finansierade projektet Urban Design...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{detailed}} patterns of British property valuation and local revenue raising under the council tax are {{compared with those}} prevailing under the domestic rates. The results of matching individual council-tax valuations with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> for the 47000 domestic properties {{that make up the}} Inner Area of Cardiff, Wales, are reported. A geographical information system is used to identify the disaggregate pattern of properties which have been assigned higher or lower relative values after the abolition of the domestic rates. The findings are seen as significant in describing the intraurban geography of property values in Britain: properties constructed by local authorities now attract significantly lower relative valuations; pre- 1919 private-sector housing is now more highly valued; and different construction types (for example, purpose-built flats, converted flats, and ends of terraces) attract quite different valuations under the two regimes. Overall, the distribution of <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> vis-�-vis that of council-tax bands is likely to have had a multi faceted effect upon local revenue raising, and the authors begin to explore its changed geography in some detail. ...|$|R
25|$|Little {{remains of}} early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the {{surrounding}} villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times {{there were a number}} of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was Henry's Principal Secretary of State Ralph Sadleir, a resident of Bryck Place, Homerton.|$|E
25|$|Each rating list {{runs for}} five years, and may change within that time. The value {{from the very}} start of the list can be altered, or events within the life of the list (such as an extension) can be {{reflected}} by changes within the list, leading to different values at different times. For example, a property is entered in a rating list at 1 April 2005 with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of £10,000, and a year later the property is extended causing an increase to £12,000 from 1 April 2006; the original entry of £10,000 remains unchanged for the first year. A successful proposal could alter this original value of £10,000 to £9000 from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, but the second entry from 1 April 2006 would remain unchanged at £12,000.|$|E
25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E
