25|$|Water is a polar molecule, {{where the}} centers of {{positive}} and negative charge are separated; so molecules will align with an electric field. The extensive hydrogen bonded network in water tends to oppose this alignment, and the degree of alignment is measured by the <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity.</b> Water has a high <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> of about 80 at room temperature; because polarity shifts are rapidly transmitted through shifts in orientation of the linked hydrogen bonds. This allows water to dissolve salts, as the attractive electric field between ions is reduced by about 80–fold. Thermal motion of the molecules disrupts the hydrogen bonding network as temperature increases; so <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> decreases with temperature to about 7 at the critical temperature. At 205°C the <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> falls to 33, the same as methanol at room temperature. Thus water behaves like a water / methanol mixture between 100°C and 200°C. Disruption of extended hydrogen bonding allows molecules to move more freely (viscosity, diffusion and surface tension effects), and extra energy must be supplied to break the bonds (increased heat capacity).|$|E

2500|$|Figures 1 and 2 show {{projections}} of a phase diagram. In the pressure-temperature phase diagram (Fig. 1) the boiling separates {{the gas and}} liquid region and ends in the critical point, where the liquid and gas phases disappear to become a single supercritical phase. This {{can be observed in}} the density-pressure phase diagram for carbon dioxide, as shown in Figure 2. At well below the critical temperature, e.g., 280K, as the pressure increases, the gas compresses and eventually (at just over 40 bar) condenses into a much denser liquid, resulting in the discontinuity in the line (vertical dotted line). The system consists of 2 phases in equilibrium, a dense liquid and a low density gas. As the critical temperature is approached (300K), the density of the gas at equilibrium becomes higher, and that of the liquid lower. [...] At the critical point, (304.1 K and 7.38 MPa (73.8 bar)), there is no difference in density, and the 2 phases become one fluid phase. Thus, above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure. At slightly above the critical temperature (310K), {{in the vicinity of the}} critical pressure, the line is almost vertical. A small increase in pressure causes a large increase in the density of the supercritical phase. [...] Many other physical properties also show large gradients with pressure near the critical point, e.g. viscosity, the <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> and the solvent strength, which are all closely related to the density. At higher temperatures, the fluid starts to behave like a gas, as can be seen in Figure 2. For carbon dioxide at 400 K, the density increases almost linearly with pressure.|$|E
