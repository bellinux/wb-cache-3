40|$|Appraisal {{and design}} of {{small-scale}} hydro power plants requires a knowledge of hydraulics, hydrology, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering, and basic economics. Further, small hydro is site specific in nature and marginal from an economic view point. Methods of appraisal and design are required therefore that will keep engineering fees to a minimum and yet still achieve a reliable evaluation <b>of</b> <b>scheme</b> potential and economics. In this context it should be appreciated that small hydro is not large hydro scaled down, and that small hydro needs its own experts (Ref. 1). This thesis considers techniques for appraisal <b>of</b> small hydropower <b>schemes,</b> the selection and specification <b>of</b> <b>scheme</b> components, their costing and economic evaluation. These appraisal techniques are subsequently applied to regional assessment of small-scale hydro-electric potential in the U. K, and to the development and application of {{a new type of}} ultra low-head hydropower generator called the Salford Transverse oscillator (STO). Although this work is predominately concerned with assessment <b>of</b> <b>scheme</b> potential in the U.

As a result of which, the existing road network {{has been subjected to}} severe deterioration leading to premature failure of the pavements. There is a dire need of developing a meaningful approach towards implementing the maintenance and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>schemes</b> <b>of</b> the road network. In such a scenario, development of the effective pavement management strategies would furnish useful information to ensure the compatible and cost- effective decisions so as to keep the existing road network intact. The optimum maintenance and rehabilitation strategies applied in this study would be useful in planning pavement maintenance strategies in a scientific manner and ensuring rational utilization of limited maintenance funds. Once this strategy for urban road network is implemented and made operational; this would serve as window to the other urban road network of different regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ecological <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> {{rivers and}} streams has become a common {{practice}} in environmental planning and water management throughout Europe. With regard to rehabilitation projects public participation and bottom-up planning processes are favoured by state and local regulations alike. However, there are mixed experiences about public support <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>schemes.</b> Whereas people support environmental improvements on a general level, acceptance is dwindling when conflicts of use arise or access to certain areas {{is going to be}} restricted. This study focuses on the assessment of public attitudes to rehabilitation and on improving the understanding of people’s preferences. The results of a representative questionnaire survey conducted in three villages along a rehabilitated creek in a densely populated suburban area near Cologne show that local support for rehabilitation is generally high. More than two thirds of all residents support the rehabilitation scheme even when considering the costs involved. This support, however, varies between different age groups, with young adults being more sceptical than older people. The reasons {{for the fact that the}} younger generation is less supportive with regard to rehabilitation schemes might be related to their lesser interest in local affairs in general as well as their involvement in leisure activities that cannot be performed in rehabilitation sites along a small creek. Moreover, the findings reveal that many people want to have unlimited access to rehabilitated areas for recreational activities. This reflects a trend towards the perception of nature as an individual consumer goo...|$|R

Hypothetical catchments based on the aggregation of (20 Ha) sub-modules derived from analysis of combined sewer networks in the UK were used as the basis for assessment. Source Control, distributed storage and conventional techniques <b>of</b> sewerage <b>rehabilitation</b> were assessed in a staged approach regarding levels of service provision. The study also reviewed impacts resulting from a general increase in catchment impermeability from 30 to 40 % for flat and steeply sloping catchments. The results show a general trend of decreasing costs for alleviating flooding, the further upstream the rehabilitation measure is effected within the drainage system. Cost savings in the region of 25 to 80 % compared to conventional solutions, are realised depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>scheme</b> adopted.

40|$|Environmental {{goals of}} the European Water Framework Directive (hereinafter called: WFD) (The European Parliament and the Council, 2000), adopted by the European Community in 2000, foresee the {{achievement}} of the Good Ecological Status of all surface water bodies by the year 2015. Goals should be achieved by the way of applying the measures, such as restoration or rehabilitation works. In the context of the modern care of the river environment, rivers in urban environment areas should be considered as a special category. European project URBEM (Urban River Basin Enhancement Methods), funded by the European Commission in the 5 th Framework Programme for the implementation of the WFD and developed in co-operation of partners from 5 EU countries (Great Britain, Germany, Austria, Portugal and Slovenia), has aimed to prepare a tool for the needs of municipal administration in the decision-making process in relation to renewal and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>schemes</b> <b>of</b> urban corridors. As a part of the project, the partner from Portugal has in co-operation with other partners in the project drawn up a draft method for a combined expert and survey assessment of the aesthetic value of urban rivers (URBEM, 2004). The aim of the method is to provide an assessment of the visual environment of urban rivers in order to facilitate decision-making when prioritising the approach to <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> urban rivers. In comparison to the existing methods for valuation of the hydromorphological state of rivers, which are based on the assessment of the anthropogenic alterations or ecological deficit of the hydromorphological process in the river corridor, the URBEM method provides an assessment of the river corridor in a wider sense: ecological, spatial and social. In Slovenia, the method was tested on three urban rivers in the capital city of Ljubljana. In the course of testing, several strengths as well as weaknesses of the proposed method were identified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} water management of large scale irrigation systems, specifically the estimation of the project water requirement for the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> the irrigation system in the Yamato Plain Land Improvement District (abbreviated to YPD) of Nara prefecture. YPD was organized {{to be responsible for}} the operation and maintenance of the major subdivision of the Totsugawa-Kinokawa Integrated Development Project (abbreviated to TKP) in 1961. 30 years have passed since the completion <b>of</b> TKP. <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>of</b> the whole irrigation system is needed due to degradation of irrigation efficiency caused by superannuation and the change of water users' situations caused by increasing part-time farmers and aging farmers. The purpose <b>of</b> the system <b>rehabilitation</b> is basically to save labor costs and increase irrigation efficiency. On the other hand, {{to meet the needs of}} increment of municipal water use in expanding urban areas, implementation <b>of</b> the system <b>rehabilitation</b> is necessary, in addition, it is needed to provide water front parks and recreation facilities. The water source of this system consists of water developed by TKP and old local water resources i. e. water diverted from natural streams, many ponds and ground water. The water distribution system is also divided into two systems: the YPD system and the local irrigation system, including natural streams. The simplification and unification of the distribution system is also required for the rehabilitation. At first, the project water requirement must be estimated based on the existing water supply system and the water users' situation. The estimation of the project water requirement by using the CB method is useful in this case. Then, comparing with the estimated values and data of existing water supplied, an appropriate project water requirement is determined. The rahabilitation scheme will be composed, based upon the appropriate water requirement...|$|R
