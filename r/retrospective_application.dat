Section 8C was repealed after all appeals to the Privy Council from Singapore were abolished in 1994.

Article 11(1) of the Constitution states: [...] "No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law {{at the time it was}} committed." [...] Though the 1989 amendments to the ISA did not retrospectively introduce any criminal offences, the legislature saw fit to amend Article149(1) by inserting a reference to Article11 to forestall any possible arguments on section8D's inconsistency with the Article. As the Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said in Parliament: [...] "The reference to Article 11 is necessary to ensure the <b>retrospective</b> <b>application</b> of the Internal Security (Amendment) Bill is not challenged." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an extensive}} {{treatment of the}} principle of legality, and more specifically the “No punishment without preexisting law” doctrine in the canons of the Ecumenical Synods. Only six from the seven Synods, recognized by the Orthodox as Ecumenical, decreed canons. After a meticulous examination of all these canons we reached to the following conclusion: There is not a single violation of the “no punishment without law” doctrine in law-making and law application. The sanctions for a particular crime are never increased with retrospective effect. The prohibition of retroactivity in penal provision is a general, fundamental principle of orthodox canon law. Retroactive force is given to those sacred canons that introduce a more lenient to the defendant or to the lawbreaker regulation. Furthermore, hermeneutic canons that interpret former ones may be retrospective, giving authentic definitions of their true meaning. Incorporated into the former canon they interpret, they might seem to increase retroactively the rank of the imposed penalty of the formerly established ecclesiastical crime, but they never amount to the institution of a new penal offense. The principle of legality is not violated in the judicial holy canons, whereas the Synod acts as Supreme Court. The Fathers of the Synods are definitely bound by the preexisting laws and creeds rather than acting upon them. However, no credit can be given to any attempt of identification of their juridical methods with either the so called “legal formalism” of the past two centuries or its very opposite, “instrumentalism”. Orthodox canon law is a sui generis legal system which was produced during the first eight Christian centuries, but still remains in force. Orthodox canon law {{is considered to be a}} sort of an early “case law” legal system. Therefore, even the judicial canons can be applied as non-retrospective rules of law, without undermining the principle of legality. Historical and theoretical paradigms occur in the texts of the holy canons in order to clarify the meaning of their penal provisions. Τhey do not establish <b>retrospective</b> <b>applications.</b> The same stands for the “present” abnormal situations that the Fathers of the Synod describe, so as to take measures against them. If the Synod introduces new law, the threaten of the respective sanctions refers to crimes expected to be committed. However, as long as there is a special provision, the penalty is imposed at a further point of the future transgression, that of the confirmed disobedience to the “επιφώνηση” (= admonition, warning) of the Bishop. The sacred canons apply and follow the “no punishment without preexisting law” principle, which was firstly introduced in ecclesiastical law by Paul the Apostle. They also service the admissible exceptions of the nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege doctrine, in almost the same way they are instituted in contemporary public penal law. ...|$|R
40|$|Required to {{negotiate}} a transcultural present in which their rights and opportunities are circumscribed by the pleadings of multicultural others, Indigenous peoples have attracted attention for their approaches to alliance-building, responsible co-existence and self-determined care. In this second report on Indigenous geographies 1, we associate those projects with the geographies of hope but, recognizing that a futuristic gaze on allegedly progressive cases can lapse into naivety, we call for further postcolonial critique of the influences on those cases. We distinguish <b>retrospective</b> and prospective <b>applications</b> of postcolonial theory, suggesting that while geographers initially disregarded the latter they now exaggerate that outlook in hopeful advocacy for Indigenous alternatives. Nonetheless, we conclude with examples of reconciliation and Indigenous service provision which attest to the social significance and aspirational character of Indigenous responses, both from the margins and in the focus of everyday politics. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Software image {{registration}} {{is a powerful}} and versatile tool that allows the fusion of molecular and anatomic information.

40|$|Emergency {{detention}} of elderly psychiatric inpati-ents {{appears to have}} attracted very little or no attention in published studies. In this <b>retrospective</b> review, all <b>applications</b> of sections 5 (2) and 5 (4) of the Mental Health Act 1983, detaining elderly inpatients in North Cheshire between 1985 and 1997 were reviewed. Forty-three percent of elderly inpatients under 5. 5 (2) regained their voluntary status, while 57 % were detained under another section {{by the end of}} the 72 hours (p< 0. 05). Duration in hospital prior to applying s. 5 (2), clinical diagnosis of functional mental illness and use of s. 5 (4) appear to increase the likelihood of converting s. 5 (2) into other sections. The high rate of non-conversion of s. 5 (2) in the elderly to s. 2 or 3 may imply that in almost halfofthe cases, emergency detention may have been used to control isolated incidents of disturbed behaviour in otherwise co-operative patients.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 2 (DM 2, OMIM # 602688) is a multisystemic hereditary {{degenerative disease}} {{caused by a}} tetranucleotide CCTG expansion in the ZNF 9 gene. Routine testing strategies for DM 2 {{require the use of}} Southern blot or long-range PCR, but the presence of very large expansions and wide somatic mosaicism greatly reduce the sensitivity of these reference techniques. We therefore developed and validated a tetraplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) method to detect the DM 2 mutation by testing 87 DM 2 -positive and 76 DM 2 -negative previously characterized patients. The specificity of this technique was evaluated including DNA samples from 39 DM 1 -positive patients. We then attempted a prospective analysis of 50 patients with unknown genotype who referred to our center for diagnostic or presymptomatic tests. Results show that TP-PCR is a fast, reliable, and flexible technique, whose specificity and sensitivity is almost 100 %, with no false positive or negative results either in <b>retrospective</b> and prospective <b>applications.</b> We therefore conclude that using this technique, in combination with the short-range PCR, is sufficient to correctly establish the presence or the absence of ZNF 9 expanded alleles in the molecular diagnosis of DM 2...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{continuous}} glucose monitoring (CGM) {{has proven to}} be a very resourceful tool for diabetes management. To date, CGM devices are employed for both <b>retrospective</b> and online <b>applications.</b> Their use allows to better describe the patients' pathology as well as to achieve a better control of patients' level of glycemia. The analysis of CGM sensor data makes possible to observe a wide range of metrics, such as the glycemic variability during the day or the amount of time spent below or above certain glycemic thresholds. However, due to the high variability of the glycemic signals among sensors and individuals, CGM data analysis is a non-trivial task. Standard signal filtering solutions fall short when an appropriate model personalization is not applied. State-of-the-art data-driven strategies for online CGM forecasting rely upon the use of recursive filters. Each time a new sample is collected, such models need to adjust their parameters in order to predict the next glycemic level. In this paper we aim at demonstrating that the problem of online CGM forecasting can be successfully tackled by personalized machine learning models, that do not need to recursively update their parameters...|$|R
