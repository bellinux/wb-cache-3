Using computer simulations, I investigate the ability of adaptive cluster sampling to reduce sampling variance for <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle</b> surveys of rockfish. In general, adaptive cluster sampling was less precise than simple random sampling in surveys of equivalent sampling effort. Adaptive cluster sampling was only more precise (for equivalent sample size) for highly clustered rockfish populations, large initial sample sizes, and small numbers of adaptively sampled units, conditions which are not likely met for ROV surveys of rockfish, based on my analyses. Adaptive cluster sampling is not recommended for remotely operated vehicle surveys of rockfish and other strategies should be investigated to increase the precision of abundance estimates...|$|E

40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in autonomous vehicle technologies, humancontrolled ROVs (<b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicles)</b> continue to fill {{an important role}} in underwater work. To perform effectively, however, the human operator requires meaningful cues for spatial orientation, good workspace visibility, and tight feedback about manipulator behavior. These needs can be hard to support in actual undersea operations. Telerobot designers for space missions have addressed these challenges by presenting a graphic, virtual reality model of the workspace to the operator, who then performs tasks on this representation of the actual work site. Real-time graphic modeling can (1) maintain a continuous, clear depiction of the workspace that is largely independent of communications bandwidth, (2) allow arbitrary shading and perspective of the workspace, (3) provide integrated navigation and orienting cues, and (4) support a rich, multisensory feedback environment.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} a stabilizing feedback controller for an underactuated {{system is a}} challenging one since a nonlinear system is not stabilizable by a smooth static state feedback law. A necessary condition for the asymptotical stabilization of an underactuated vehicle to a single equilibrium is that its gravitational field has nonzero elements corresponding to unactuated dynamics. However, global asymptotical stability (GAS) cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a robust proportional-integralderivative (PID) controller on actuated dynamics is proposed and unactuated dynamics are shown to be global exponentially bounded by the Sørdalen lemma. This gives a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the URV system.

The last·decade's advances in computer· processor capability and speed, component miniaturization, signal processing, and high-energy-density power supplies have made <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (ROVs) a reality. These reliable, long-range, highendurance vehicles now perform a number of tasks in research, industrial, and military applications, but they are still incapable of truly autonomous behavior. The U.

The mission controller for the NPS AUV is a knowledge-based artificial intelligence (AI) system requiring thorough analysis and testing before the AUV is operational. Rapid prototyping of this software has been demonstrated by developing controller code on a LISP machine and using an Ethernet link with a graphics workstation to simulate the controller's environment.

40|$|Limitations {{of access}} have long {{restricted}} exploration and {{investigation of the}} cavities beneath ice shelves to {{a small number of}} drill holes. Studies of sea-ice underwater morphology are limited largely to scientific utilisation of submarines. <b>Remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (ROVs), tethered to a mother ship by umbilical cable, have been deployed to investigate tidewater-glacier and ice-shelf margins, but their range is very restricted. The development of free-flying autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with ranges of tens to hundreds of kilometres enables extensive missions to take place beneath sea ice and floating ice shelves. Autosub 2 is a 3600 kg, 6. 7 m long AUV, with a 1600 m operating depth and range of 400 km. A single direct-drive DC motor and five-bladed propeller produce speeds of 1 to 2 m s- 1. Rear-mounted rudder and stern-plane control yaw, pitch and depth. Autosub has three sections. The front and rear sections are free-flooding, built around aluminium extrusion space-frames covered with glass-fibre reinforced plastic panels. The central section has seven 3 m long carbon-fibre reinforced plastic pressure vessels. Four tubes contain batteries powering the vehicle. The other three house vehicle control systems and sensors. The rear section houses sub-systems for navigation, control actuation and propulsion and scientific sensors (e. g. digital camera, upward-looking 300 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), 200 kHz multibeam receiver).

40|$|This study investigates {{a way to}} {{characterize}} the geology and biology of the seafloor in two 		 Marine Protected Areas on the West Florida Shelf. Characterization of benthic habitats needs to 		 include sufficient detail to represent the complex and heterogeneous bottom types. 		 Characterizations can be interpreted from multiple data sets and displayed as benthic habitat 		 maps. Multibeam sonar bathymetry and backscatter provide full spatial data coverage, but 		 interpretation of such data requires some form of ground truth ({{to characterize}} the habitat). 		 Imagery from towed underwater video provides continuous transects of seafloor data, which 		 provide a more efficient method than data from sediment grabs, stationary cameras, or video from 		 slow-moving <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicles</b> while a ship is on station. Two Marine Protected Areas, Steamboat Lumps and Madison-Swanson, were previously mapped by 		 the USGS using a 95 kHz multibeam sonar system. Researchers at the University of South Florida, 		 using a 300 kHz high-resolution multibeam sonar in 2002 and a 400 kHz high-resolution multibeam 		 sonar in 2016, filled in the northeast triangular portion of Madison-Swanson. Bathymetry and 		 backscatter data were compared to towed underwater-video observations. A modified version of 		 the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS), utilizing a scale-based 		 hierarchy, was used for habitat characterization of video images. Identifiers from the geoform 		 and substrate components of CMECS, as well as substrate-influencing biologic components, were 		 characterized using still images at 15 -second intervals from towed underwater video collected 		 using the Camera-Based Assessment Survey System (C-BASS). These characterizations were then 		 georeferenced (located in three-dimensional space) for comparison with bathymetry and 		 backscatter data. In Steamboat Lumps, eight substrate variations were identified from video, while in 		 Madison-Swanson 27 substrate variations were identified, including many combinations of hard and 		 soft substrate types. Four new hard-bottom textures are identified from video in 		 Madison-Swanson: exposed high-relief, moderate-relief, and low-relief hard bottom, as well as 		 covered low-relief hard bottom identified {{by the presence of}} attached biota. Hard- and 		 mixed-bottom substrate types identified from video are more heterogeneous than can be resolved 		 from 95 kHz Kongsberg EM 1002 multibeam sonar bathymetry and beam-averaged backscatter.

The method comprises image coding, transmission, and reconstruction. It is assumed that the transmission bandpass is the limiting factor rather than encoding/decoding schemata; that image coding and reconstruction will be done within the general abilities of the NASA/TI Programmable Remapper; and that the ratio of retained local detail to the operator's visual resolution is held constant throughout the large-field image that is seen. Novel features include that the compression and reconstruction address certain characteristics of the human visual system, that two-way communication controls a moving 'fovea' in the transformation, and that resolution varies over the image. Conventional motivations accommodated include the Cartesian raster-scan nature of available imagers and display devices and a need for low bandwidth in the image transmission.

Since it has both {{the characteristics of}} autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and remote operated underwater vehicle (ROV), {{it is able to}} achieve precision fix station operation and manual timely intervention. In the paper the initial design of basic components, such as vehicle, propulsion, batteries etc. and the control design of motion are introduced and analyzed. ROV’s conventional cable is replaced by a fiber optic cable, which makes it available for high-bandwidth real-time video, data telemetry and high-quality teleoperation. Furthermore, with the aid of the manual real-time remote operation and ranging sonar, it also resolves the AUV’s conflicting issue, which can absolutely adapt the actual complex sea environment and satisfy the unknown mission need. The whole battery system is designed as two-battery banks, whose voltages and temperatures are monitored through CAN (controller area network) bus to avoid battery fire and explosion. A fuzzy-PID controller is designed for its motion control, including depth control and direction control. The controller synthesizes the advantage of fuzzy control and PID control, utilizes the fuzzy rules to on-line tune the parameters of PID controller, and achieves a better control effect.

40|$|It {{may seem}} {{surprising}} that {{probably one of}} the largest and most long-lived deep-water bivalves, the gryphaeid Neopycnodonte zibrowii Gofas, Salas & Taviani in Wisshak et al. (2009) [1], experienced a taxonomic description as late as in the early 21 century. Previously N. zibrowii oyster findings were informally treated as ‘large oyster’, Ostrea sp. or they were admixed with the cosmopolitan gryphaeid Neopycnodonte cochlear (Poli, 1795). Thus, a taxonomic re-evaluation of some N. cochlear and Ostrea sp. samples from unusual depths and/or sizes led to additional records for N. zibrowii. A large number of dead N. zibrowii records were accidental findings deriving from dredging and contributing to the fact that just some records of the data compilation have previously been published in the literature. The ever increasing number of in situ recordings and direct sampling of N. zibrowii in its specific biotopes over the last 2 - 3 decades is related to the systematic reconnaissance of cold-water coral habitats as biodiversity hotspots and their environmental controls along the continental margins of Europe and Africa, and jointly with the increase in applying advanced marine technologies, such as manned submersibles and <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (ROVs). This study is based on geographical N. zibrowii records retrieved from cruises, non-shipbased submersible expeditions and terrestrial field trips, carried out between June 1882 and January 2016. The revealed geographical distribution of live N. zibrowii occurrences spans latitudinally from 48 ° N (Whittard Canyon, Celtic Sea) to 9 ° S (Anna Ridge off Angola, South Atlantic Ocean), and longitudinally from 28 ° W (Faial Channel, Azores, North Atlantic Ocean) to 13 ° E (Urania Bank, Sicilian Channel, central Mediterranean Sea). Late Pleistocene submerged occurrences further extent this distribution to 26 ° E (southeast off Crete, eastern Mediterranean Sea). Bathymetrically, live N. zibrowii are found between 234 m (off Mauritania, North Atlantic Ocean) and 983. 5 m water depth (Emile Baudot Escarpment, western Mediterranean Sea), usually between 500 and 700 m. Within suitable physical limits and nutritional settings, N. zibrowii grows on hard substrates and shows the highest colonisation densities in sedimentprotected and current-exposed zones, such as rocky overhangs and (sub-) vertical rock exposures on seamounts, escarpments and in canyons. Nowadays, also anthropogenic items, like shipwrecks, serve as substrate. The lifespan of the thick-shelled N. zibrowii can exceed 500 years, thus belonging to the longest-living non-colonial animals; the largest valves with up to 30 cm length were reported from the Azores. Live N. zibrowii and their post-mortem remains serve as substrate for their own larvae, generating over several generations a built-up, formed as chaotic clusters or stacks. Also, they provide a suitable ecospace for a diverse associated community of attached/excavating sclerobionts, mobile organisms and for demersal benthopelagic fishes, and therefore configure a well-defined deep-sea habitat. Neopycnodonte zibrowii often co-occurs with scleractinians, such as Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum dianthus. Based on video and image material from ROV and submersible dives, we characterise the N. zibrowii biotopes, following the “Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard”. Fossil N. zibrowii can be preserved in situ (double valved) and contribute to a lithified oyster-Desmophyllum framestone, as reported off Crete, but more commonly, the non-cemented right valve falls off and is accumulated at or near the base of the steeply inclined substrate. The oldest geological record dates back to the Early to Mid-Pleistocene and is based upon shells putatively attributable to N. zibrowii occurring on outcrops at Capo Milazzo (Sicily, Italy) and St. Paul’s Bay Limestone (Rhodes, Greece). The present database contains 261 entries and provides valuable sitespecific metadata, including standardised describers for the variety of observed deep-sea oyster biotopes...|$|R
40|$|In the Fall of 1993, NASA Ames {{deployed}} {{a modified}} Phantom S 2 <b>Remotely-Operated</b> underwater <b>Vehicle</b> (ROV) into an ice-covered sea environment near McMurdo Science Station, Antarctica. This deployment {{was part of}} the antarctic Space Analog Program, a joint program between NASA and the National Science Foundation to demonstrate technologies relevant for space exploration in realistic field setting in the Antarctic. The goal of the mission was to operationally test the use of telepresence and virtual reality technology in the operator interface to a remote vehicle, while performing a benthic ecology study. The vehicle was operated both locally, from above a dive hole in the ice through which it was launched, and remotely over a satellite communications link from a control room at NASA's Ames Research Center. Local control of the vehicle was accomplished using the standard Phantom control box containing joysticks and switches, with the operator viewing stereo video camera images on a stereo display monitor. Remote control of the vehicle over the satellite link was accomplished using the Virtual Environment Vehicle Interface (VEVI) control software developed at NASA Ames. The remote operator interface included either a stereo display monitor similar to that used locally or a stereo head-mounted head-tracked display. The compressed video signal from the vehicle was transmitted to NASA Ames over a 768 Kbps satellite channel. Another channel was used to provide a bi-directional Internet link to the vehicle control computer through which the command and telemetry signals traveled, along with a bi-directional telephone service. In addition to the live stereo video from the satellite link, the operator could view a computer-generated graphic representation of the underwater terrain, modeled from the vehicle's sensors. The virtual environment contained an animate graphic model of the vehicle which reflected the state of the actual vehicle, along with ancillary information such as the vehicle track, science markers, and locations of video snapshots. The actual vehicle was driven either from within the virtual environment or through a telepresence interface. All vehicle functions could be controlled remotely over the satellite link...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an Internet-Like Protocol (ILP) {{to coordinate the}} formation of n second-order agents in a two dimensional (2 D) space. The trajectories are specified trough via points and a desired formation at each point. A basis for the proof of convergence is given using Lyapunov second method. Simulink is used to verify {{the response of the}} agents in the desired trajectories. The proposed algorithms are robust {{in the sense that they}} can accommodate changes in the formation of the agents and more importantly, changes in the umber of agents as some of them drop of or join the formation. The coordination and formation of multiple agents is a problem of particular interest to numerous research groups [1], [3], [4], [5]. Applications of such research abound in space (satellite formation), military (<b>remotely-operated</b> clusters of <b>vehicles)</b> and civilian applications The problem of distributed coordination and control of such agents has been theoretically studied using various approaches. In [1], a graph-theoretic approach was presented to explain the behavior of n particles in the plane in an attempt to justify the model presented in [2], which had proposed a discrete-time model illustrating the heading alignments of the n particles. Graph theory was also utilized in [3] to define cost functions that govern the movement of the n systems/agents. In [4], virtual potentials were discussed as an analysis tool, while in [5], local sensing an...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} first {{detailed}} geochemical characterization of Kolumbo submarine volcano {{in order to}} investigate the role of source heterogeneity in controlling geochemical variability within the Santorini volcanic field in the central Aegean arc. Kolumbo, situated 15 km to the northeast of Santorini, last erupted in 1650 AD and is thus {{closely associated with the}} Santorini volcanic system in space and time. Samples taken by <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle</b> that were analyzed for major element, trace element and Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope composition include the 1650 AD and underlying K 2 rhyolitic, enclave-bearing pumices that are nearly identical in composition (73 wt. % SiO 2, 4. 2 wt. % K 2 O). Lava bodies exposed in the crater and enclaves are basalts to andesites (52 – 60 wt. % SiO 2). Biotite and amphibole are common phenocryst phases, in contrast with the typically anhydrous mineral assemblages of Santorini. The strong geochemical signature of amphibole fractionation and the assimilation of lower crustal basement in the petrogenesis of the Kolumbo magmas indicates that Kolumbo and Santorini underwent different crustal differentiation histories and that their crustal magmatic systems are unrelated. Moreover, the Kolumbo samples are derived from a distinct, more enriched mantle source that is characterized by high Nb/Yb (> 3) and low 206 Pb/ 204 Pb (< 18. 82) that has not been recognized in the Santorini volcanic products. The strong dissimilarity in both petrogenesis and inferred mantle sources between Kolumbo and Santorini suggests that pronounced source variations can be manifested in arc magmas that are closely associated in space and time within a single volcanic field...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes of}} the seabed {{environment}} caused by a natural disaster or human activities dramatically affect {{the life span of}} the subsea buried cable. It is essential to track the cable route in order to inspect the condition of the buried cable and protect its surviving seabed environment. The magnetic sensor is instrumental in guiding the <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle</b> (ROV) to track and inspect the buried cable underseas. In this paper, a novel framework integrating the underwater cable localization method with the magnetic guidance and control algorithm is proposed, in order to enable the automatic cable tracking by a three-degrees-of-freedom (3 -DOF) under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without human beings in the loop. The work relies on the passive magnetic sensing method to localize the subsea cable by using two tri-axial magnetometers, and a new analytic formulation is presented to compute the heading deviation, horizontal offset and buried depth of the cable. With the magnetic localization, the cable tracking and inspection mission is elaborately constructed as a straight-line path following control problem in the horizontal plane. A dedicated magnetic line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is built based on the relative geometric relationship between the vehicle and the cable, and the feedback linearizing technique is adopted to design a simplified cable tracking controller considering the side-slip effects, such that the under-actuated vehicle is able to move towards the subsea cable and then inspect its buried environment, which further guides the environmental protection of the cable by setting prohibited fishing/anchoring zones and increasing the buried depth. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed magnetic guidance and control algorithm on the envisioned subsea cable tracking and the potential protection of the seabed environment along the cable route...|$|E
40|$|The {{continental}} margin off the northeastern United States (NEUS) contains numerous, topographically complex features that increase habitat heterogeneity across the region. However, {{the majority of}} these rugged features have never been surveyed, particularly using direct observations. During summer 2013, 31 <b>Remotely-Operated</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ROV) dives were conducted from 494 to 3271 m depth across a variety of seafloor features to document communities and to infer geological processes that produced such features. The ROV surveyed six broad-scale habitat features, consisting of shelf-breaching canyons, slope-sourced canyons, inter-canyon areas, open-slope/landslide-scar areas, hydrocarbon seeps, and Mytilus Seamount. Four previously unknown chemosynthetic communities dominated by Bathymodiolus mussels were documented. Seafloor methane hydrate was observed at two seep sites. Multivariate analyses indicated that depth and broad-scale habitat significantly influenced megafaunal coral (58 taxa), demersal fish (69 taxa), and decapod crustacean (34 taxa) assemblages. Species richness of fishes and crustaceans significantly declined with depth, while there was no relationship between coral richness and depth. Turnover in assemblage structure occurred on the middle to lower slope at the approximate boundaries of water masses found previously in the region. Coral species richness was also an important variable explaining variation in fish and crustacean assemblages. Coral diversity may serve as an indicator of habitat suitability and variation in available niche diversity for these taxonomic groups. Our surveys added 24 putative coral species and three fishes to the known regional fauna, including the black coral Telopathes magna, the octocoral Metallogorgia melanotrichos and the fishes Gaidropsarus argentatus, Guttigadus latifrons, and Lepidion guentheri. Marine litter was observed on 81 % of the dives, with at least 12 coral colonies entangled in debris. While initial exploration revealed the NEUS region to be both geologically dynamic and biologically diverse, further research into the abiotic conditions and the biotic interactions that influence species abundance and distribution is needed...|$|E
40|$|Under the Department of Energy`s Robotics Technology Development Program (RTDP) Tank Waste Retrieval (TWR) program, a {{major effort}} is under way to develop {{technology}} for remediating the waste in underground storage tanks that contain radioactive and hazardous waste. A {{large part of the}} program`s effort has gone towards development of remotely operable robotics equipment, including the Houdini Vehicle and the Position and Orientation Tracking System (POTS). Since planned operation of this equipment is to be completely remote, a significant effort is needed to ensure that operators have sufficient system information to operate the equipment efficiently and safely. ORNL developed POTS and RedZone Robotics, Inc. developed Houdini which can be operated together to provide both position and orientation descriptions of the Houdini vehicle, relative to a world reference frame, while operating inside an underground storage tank. The Houdini vehicle has been outfitted with an optical detection system that houses infrared detectors. The infrared detectors are part of the POTS tracking system. The sensors provide a set of timing pulses to the POTS control computer whenever a laser beam from one of the four POTS laser scanners strikes a detector. Using the pointing angle information from each POTS laser scanners, the POTS control computer is able to compute the pose of the Houdini vehicle at a rate of approximately 25 Hz. This information, along with the orientation of the Houdini`s Schilling Titan II robot arm, is used to present the pose information to the operator in a 3 -D graphical user interface using software that has been developed by this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). The graphical display presents the data to the operator in a format that is readily understood. The equipment operators are able to use the information in real-time to enhance the operator`s ability to safely and efficiently control the <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tectonic {{windows are}} faulted escarpments that expose {{extensive}} sections of in situ oceanic crust, providing valuable opportunities to examine upper crustal architecture from a perspective unmatched by other approaches. Recent investigations of tectonic windows by submersible (Alvin, Nautile) and <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle</b> (Jason II) have recovered an unprecedented suite of dikes and lavas. We focus on compositions of dikes and lavas from intermediate- and super-fast rate crust exposed, respectively, in the Western Blanco Transform (BT) fault and the Pito Deep Rift (PD), {{to better understand}} accretionary processes at mid-ocean ridges. In the BT, the upper lavas are generally more primitive than the lower lavas, supporting geophysical and geological studies that suggest off-axis volcanism {{plays an important role}} in constructing the upper crust at intermediate-rate spreading centers. The wide range in lava compositions exposed along the BT scarp also lends caution to studies that rely on surface lavas to determine the evolution of sub-axial magmatic conditions. The PD suite allows us to examine accretionary processes over an impressive temporal range, including long-term (millions of years) changes in mantle composition and medium-rate (100 s of ka) changes in magmatic regime. Compositions of adjacent dikes reveal that the ocean crust is heterogeneous on short time (ka) and spatial (meters) scales, reflecting along-axis transport of magma from chemically heterogeneous portions of the melt lens. High compositional variability was also observed in adjacent dikes from Hess Deep (HD), a tectonic window into fast-rate crust, suggesting that lateral dike intrusion occurs at all mid-ocean ridges. PD lavas are offset to lower density compositions compared to dikes, an observation previously made in HD, but made here for the first time in other dike-lava populations, suggesting that buoyancy plays a major role in partitioning magma between dikes and lavas. A model for intrusion of a single dike shows that crustal density, magma pressure, and tectonic stress affect the intensity of density-based magma partitioning in a systematic way that can be related to compositions of dike-lava populations.

40|$|Distribution of soft {{sediment}} benthic fauna {{and the environmental}} factors affecting them were studied, to investigate changes across spatial and temporal scales. Investigations took place at Lough Hyne Marine Reserve using a range of methods. Data on the sedimentation rates of organic and inorganic matter were collected at monthly intervals for one year {{at a number of}} sites around the Lough, by use of vertical midwater-column sediment traps. Sedimentation of these two fractions were not coupled; inorganic matter sedimentation depended on hydrodynamic and weather factors, while the organic matter sedimentation was more complex, being dependent on biological and chemical processes in the water column. The effects of regular hypoxic episodes on benthic fauna due to a natural seasonal thermocline were studied in the deep Western Trough, using camera-equipped <b>remotely-operated</b> <b>vehicle</b> to follow transects, on a three-monthly basis over one year. In late summer, the area below the thermocline of the Western Trough was devoid of visible fauna. Decapod crustaceans were the first taxon to make use of ameliorating oxygen conditions in autumn, by darting below the thermocline depth, most likely to scavenge. This was indicated by tracks that they left {{on the surface of the}} Trough floor. Some species, most noticeably Fries’ goby Lesueurigobius friesii, migrated below the thermocline depth when conditions were normoxic and established semi-permanent burrows. Their population encompassed all size classes, indicating that this habitat was not limited to juveniles of this territorial species. Recolonisation by macrofauna and burrowing megafauna was studied during normoxic conditions, from November 2009 to May 2010. Macrofauna displayed a typical post-disturbance pattern of recolonisation with one species, the polychaete Scalibregma inflatum, occurring at high abundance levels in March 2010. In May, this population had become significantly reduced and a more diverse community was established. The abundance of burrowing infauna comprising decapods crabs and Fries’ gobies, was estimated by identifying and counting their distinctive burrow structures. While above the summer thermocline depth, burrow abundance increased in a linear fashion, below the thermocline depth a slight reduction of burrow abundance occurred in May, when oxygen conditions deteriorated again. The majority of the burrows occurring in May were made by Fries’ gobies, which are thought to encounter low oxygen concentrations in their burrows. Reduction in burrow abundance of burrowing shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Callianassa subterranea (based on descriptions of burrow structures from the literature), from March to May, might be related to their reduced activity in hypoxia, leading to loss of structural burrow maintenance. Spatial and temporal changes to macrofaunal assemblage structures were studied seasonally for one year across 5 sites in the Lough and subject to multivariate statistical analysis. Assemblage structures were significantly correlated with organic matter levels in the sediment, the amounts of organic matter settling out of the water column one month before macrofaunal sampling took place as well as current speed and temperature. This study was the first to investigate patterns and processes in the Lough {{soft sediment}} ecology across all 3 basins on a temporal and spatial scale. An investigation into the oceanographic aspects of the development, behaviour and break-down of the summer thermocline of Lough Hyne was performed in collaboration with researchers from other Irish institutions...|$|E
