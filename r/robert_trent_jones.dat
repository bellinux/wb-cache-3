500|$|Strong's {{architectural}} work {{was to be}} commended as praise worthy for its originality. He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting features such as multi-tiered greens and deep, cavernous bunkers. Strong managed to advance his art form {{to a higher level}} not always approached by other architects. Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design, Strong said, [...] "the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play." [...] He believed in the need for good shot-making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results. [...] His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers. [...] He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach, from the ideal side of the fairway, to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond. [...] Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States. [...] Strong designed this oft-copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. [...] The course was scheduled to host the 1939 Ryder Cup matches if World War II had not intervened. [...] The island itself, lying 157 yards from the tee, is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers; the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes. The Ocean Course was redesigned by <b>Robert</b> <b>Trent</b> <b>Jones</b> Sr. in 1947, then again by Bobby Weed in 1998. The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong's design features.|$|E

5000|$|North Brookhaven: North Brookhaven {{refers to}} the area that is bounded by I-285 to the north, the Fulton County line to the west, Chamblee to the east, and Windsor Parkway to the south. More specifically, the term {{describes}} the area that makes {{up the majority of}} District 1 of the city of Brookhaven. From 1924 to 1965, the area was incorporated as the city of North Atlanta, which included all of North Brookhaven as well as areas south to Peachtree Road. Largely suburban in character, the area is home to various residential subdivisions; two large parks, Blackburn Park and Murphey Candler Park, and the Nancy Creek PATH trail; the historic Peachtree Golf Club, which was founded by Bobby Jones and designed by <b>Robert</b> <b>Trent</b> Jones; and top rated public and private schools, including Marist School, Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic School, St. Martin's Episcopal School, Montgomery Elementary School, and the Kittredge Magnet School. [...] The area also boasts two major lakes: Silver Lake (surrounded by the Brittany, Cambridge Park, and Hampton Hall neighborhoods) and Murphey Candler Lake. A restaurant and retail district, located at the intersection of Ashford Dunwoody and Johnson Ferry Roads, forms the commercial heart of North Brookhaven, occupying an area that was once known as Old Cross Keys, one of the earliest antebellum settlements in DeKalb County. Also located in North Brookhaven is Perimeter Summit, a commercial area that represents one third of Perimter Center. North Brookhaven, due to its proximity to Perimeter Center, has often been subjected to encroachment, resulting in the razing of Lake Hearn subdivision in 1989, a proposed extension of the Glenridge Connector in 1999, and the construction of a power station in 2007.|$|R
