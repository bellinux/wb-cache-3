5|$|When {{the actual}} <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the {{perceived}} <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14. This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and perigee moons {{of the same}} phase.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{transitive}} closure, the transitive <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a {{directed graph}} {{that is not}} acyclic, there can {{be more than one}} minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{appropriate}} notion of reduction {{depends on the}} complexity class being studied. When studying the complexity class NP and harder classes such as the polynomial hierarchy, polynomial-time <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> used. When studying classes within P such as NC and NL, log-space <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> used. <b>Reductions</b> <b>are</b> also used in computability theory to show whether problems are or are not solvable by machines at all; in this case, <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> restricted only to computable functions.|$|R
40|$|<b>Reductions</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} and time-consuming operations in many scientific codes.

5|$|Most often, {{musicians are}} {{concerned}} not to produce noise, but to minimise it. Noise <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> {{of particular concern}} in sound recording. This is accomplished by many techniques, including use of low noise components and proprietary noise reducing technologies such as Dolby.|$|E
5|$|Reduction of TiCl4 with {{aluminium}} {{results in}} one-electron reduction. The trichloride (TiCl3) and tetrachloride have contrasting properties: the trichloride is a solid, being a coordination polymer, and is paramagnetic. When the <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> conducted in THF solution, the Ti(III) product converts to the light-blue adduct TiCl3(THF)3.|$|E
5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise <b>reduction,</b> <b>is</b> practised in various ways.

40|$|Industrial {{development}} {{results in}} the generation of industrial effluents, and if untreated results in water, sediment and soil pollution. (Fakayode and Onianwa, 2002 ; Fakayode, 2005). Industrial wastes and emission contain toxic and hazardous substances, {{most of which are}} detrimental to human health (Jimena et al., 2008 ; Ogunfowokan et al., 2005 ; Rajaram et al., 2008). The key pollutants include heavy metals, chemical wastes and oil spills etc. Heavy metal resistant bacteria have significant role in bioremediation of heavy metals in wastewater. The objective of this work is to study the role of bacteria in removing the heavy metals present in the industrial effluent. Five effluent samples out of nine were selected for this study due to high content of heavy metals. The heavy metals Hg and Cu were removed by Bacillus sp. The average Hg <b>reduction</b> <b>was</b> 45 % and Cu <b>reduction</b> <b>was</b> recorded as 62 %. The heavy metals Cd, As and Co were removed by Pseudomonas sp. The average Cd <b>reduction</b> <b>was</b> 56 %, average As <b>reduction</b> <b>was</b> 34 % and average Co <b>reduction</b> <b>was</b> recorded as 53 %.

50|$|Log-space <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} used on languages in P, {{in which case}} it usually does not matter whether many-one reductions or Turing <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> used, since it has been verified that L, SL, NL, and P are all closed under Turing reductions, meaning that Turing <b>reductions</b> can <b>be</b> used to show a problem is {{in any of these}} classes. However, other subclasses of P such as NC may not be closed under Turing reductions, and so many-one <b>reductions</b> must <b>be</b> used.|$|R

5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E

For primary air defence, a pair of two 3S-90 launchers (one forward of the bridge and the other atop the dual helicopter hangar) are fitted with the Shtil SAM system. The system consists of 24 Russian Shtil missiles in a below-deck magazine. The launchers elevate up to 70°, with a firing arc of 30° within the centreline. The launcher groups, which require a 20-man crew, weigh about 50 tons.|$|E
40|$|In practice, some of {{information}} systems are based on dominance relations, and values of decision attribute are fuzzy. So, it is meaningful to study attribute reductions in ordered decision tables with fuzzy decision. In this paper, upper and lower approximation <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> proposed {{in this kind of}} complicated decision table, respectively. Some important properties are discussed. The judgement theorems and discernibility matrices associated with two <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> obtained from which the theory of attribute <b>reductions</b> <b>is</b> provided in ordered decision tables with fuzzy decision. Moreover, rough set approach to upper and lower approximation <b>reductions</b> <b>is</b> presented in ordered decision tables with fuzzy decision as well.

5|$|Where {{the dive}} site and {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout the dive. A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure <b>reduction,</b> <b>is</b> a good decompression practice. When using a dive computer {{this type of}} profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during the dive and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the clavicle <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this <b>reduction</b> <b>is</b> mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E

40|$|In computability and in {{complexity}} theory <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> widely used for mapping sets into sets {{in order to}} prove undecidability or hardness results. In the study of the approximate solvability of hard discrete optimization problems, suitable kinds of reductions, called approximation preserving <b>reductions,</b> can also <b>be</b> used to transfer from one problem to another either positive results (solution techniques) or negative results (non-approximability results). In this paper various kinds of approximation preserving <b>reductions</b> <b>are</b> surveyed and their properties discussed.
