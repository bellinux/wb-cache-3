5000|$|The picture (above) of a TXE2 Supervisory <b>relay-set</b> {{gives an}} idea of the {{technology}} involved. Designed in the 1960s, it consisted of discrete components mounted on circuit boards. These relay sets were of double width. On the face-plates there were two built-in lamps (for call-tracing and fault indication) and a block of test points, which gave test access to the circuits inside. All TXE2 units had such test points. Three [...] "candles" [...] can be seen protruding from units: these were simple indicator-bulbs which were used as required to show when the relay sets were in use. These [...] "candles" [...] or [...] "busy indicators" [...] were used throughout the exchange as part of fault-finding.|$|E
40|$|Cooperative {{relaying}} enables nodes {{to actively}} cooperate to deliver packets to their destination. The bestselect protocol (BSP) implements {{a type of}} cooperative relaying that generalizes single path routing with sets of nodes (relay-sets) replacing {{the concept of a}} single node relay. Thus, while in traditional single path routing, packets hop from node to node, in BSP, packets hop from <b>relay-set</b> to <b>relay-set.</b> Through the exchange of channel gain information between relay-sets, the best node within a <b>relay-set</b> is selected to transmit the data packet on behalf of the entire <b>relay-set.</b> The node selected depends on the metric used. Any metric that can be posed in a dynamic programming framework can be used. In this paper, performance gains from a number of selection metrics are investigated. Specific selection metrics include maximizing the minimum channel gain along the path, minimizing end-to-end delay, minimizing the total power, and minimizing the total energy. It will be shown that BSP can achieve significant gains in all of these metrics. ...|$|E
