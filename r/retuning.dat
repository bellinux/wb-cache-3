25|$|The major {{development}} {{taking place}} in Bach's time, and to which he contributed in no small way, was {{the development of a}} temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed to use these in all available keys (12 major and 12 minor), and which allowed modulating without <b>retuning.</b> Already his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation incomparable to any contemporary work this composition has been compared to, but the full expansion came with The Well-Tempered Clavier, using all keys, which Bach seems to have been developing from around 1720, with the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach as one of its earliest witnesses.|$|E
500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, <b>retuning</b> and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a pain in the ass, but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thain {{told the}} station engineer, Bill Black, {{about the problem}} with the boost surging in the port engine, and Black {{suggested}} that since opening the throttle more slowly had not worked, the only option was to hold the plane overnight for <b>retuning.</b> Thain was anxious to stay on schedule and suggested opening the throttle even more slowly would suffice. This would mean that the plane would not achieve take-off velocity until further down the runway, but with the runway almost [...] long, he believed this would not be a problem. The passengers were called back to the plane 15 minutes after leaving it.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{widespread}} use of synthesizers, in order to pick up stations on different frequencies, radio and television receivers relied on manual tuning of a local oscillator, which used a resonant circuit composed of an inductor and capacitor, or sometimes resonant transmission lines; to determine the frequency. The receiver was adjusted to different frequencies by either a variable capacitor, or a switch which chose the proper tuned circuit for the desired channel, such as with the turret tuner commonly used in television receivers prior to the 1980s. [...] However the resonant frequency of a tuned circuit is not very stable; [...] variations in temperature and aging of components caused frequency drift, causing the receiver to drift off the station frequency. Automatic frequency control (AFC) solves some of the drift problem, but manual <b>retuning</b> was often necessary. Since transmitter frequencies are stabilized, an accurate source of fixed, stable frequencies in the receiver would solve the problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first person}} to publish a {{collection}} of music for the vihuela was the Spanish composer Luis de Milán, with his volume titled Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El maestro of 1536 dedicated to King John III of Portugal. [...] The notational device used throughout this and other vihuela music books is a numeric tablature (otherwise called [...] "lute tablature"), {{which is also the}} model from which modern [...] "guitar tab" [...] was fashioned. [...] The music is easily performed on a modern guitar using either standard guitar tuning (44434), sometimes called [...] "new lute tuning", or by <b>retuning</b> slightly to Classic lute and vihuela tuning (44344). The tablature system used in all these texts is the [...] "Italian" [...] tablature, wherein the stopped frets are indicated by numbers and the lowest line of the staff represents the highest-pitch course (or string), resembling the neck of the instrument in playing position; Milán's book also uses numbers to indicate the stopping of the courses but exceptionally it is the top line of the staff that represents the highest-pitch course, as in [...] "French" [...] tablature.|$|E

2500|$|The primary coil's {{resonant}} frequency is tuned {{to that of}} the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and <b>retuning</b> if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a [...] "breakout bump") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive 'loading' by the streamers tends to lower the {{resonant frequency}} of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its minor diameter.|$|E
