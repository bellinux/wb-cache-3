25|$|Over the 20th century, {{reform efforts}} focused on three main issues. The first {{concerned}} setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon {{the ability of}} powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created {{over the use of}} floating charges, the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>fund</b> for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge. At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>fund</b> should be taken from fixed security interests. The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982, the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties, or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for wrongful trading. If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when they ought to have known insolvency was inevitable, they would {{have to pay for the}} additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.|$|E
40|$|Sir David Cooksey {{was asked}} by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to review {{publicly}} funded healthcare research across the UK (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). This followed the Chancellor’s decision to create a single <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>fund</b> from several government sources for such research. It is important to note that, while this newly <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>fund</b> was heralded for it sheer size – approximately £ 3 billion; the largest ever fund for healthcare research in the UK – it neither represented new money nor additional funding. The Cooksey report (Cooksey, 2006) was not about research priorities either as these had already been decided in such strategies as Best research for best health (Department of Health, 2006). Priorities had also been previously identified within the strategies of the funding streams which have been incorporated into the single fund, such as the Medical Research Council and the Health Technology Assessment and the Service Delivery and Organisation programmes...|$|E

40|$|Climate shocks {{contribute}} to a significant share of the humanitarian burden, and are {{a key factor in}} increasing poverty and food insecurity. Social protection is increasingly recognised as an instrument to help build resilience to climate risks through long-term, large-scale national systems. However, most experiences to date have focused on social protection’s role for chronic needs, or at best, shock-response, rather than on anticipation and prevention. This article argues that social protection can support more effective resilience building at scale by integrating early action and preparedness. We propose a concrete solution, namely linking a Forecast-based Financing mechanism to a social protection system to enable anticipatory actions based on forecast triggers and guaranteed funding ahead of a shock. Such a system may enhance scalability, timeliness, predictability and adequacy of social protection benefits. Key considerations for success of this emerging approach include sound analysis of forecast, risks, cost and benefits, and <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funding...</b>|$|R

It details {{the start of the}} transformation. Once the clinicians had embraced the co-location of mental health and addiction services this afforded an opportunity to advance the assessment and treatment of dual diagnosis, and the progress to joint-working, assessment and intervention. The authors mention the Irish Mental Health Act (2001), a Vision for Change (2006) and the Transformation Programme (2007 - 2010), with the latter outlining the radical reformation of health service delivery in Ireland with reference to integration of services, engagement of staff in facilitating change and their attitudes to service provision, and a remapping of staff and resources towards community settings with co-locations preferred. The National Drugs Strategy is quoted making reference to developing specialist expertise in both mental health and addiction. Three service models, serial, parallel and integrated are described and compared in use in other countries including USA, England, Scotland, Wales and Australia. These authors discuss the Irish experience of implementation by quoting verbatim four positive comments from clients, to complement supporting words from previously published literature on this topic.

40|$|Canada Health Infoway (CHI) was {{established}} as an arms-length body {{by the federal}} government in 2001 to provide funding to provinces for the development of interoperable e-health systems. CHI {{was established}} in response to a number of reports calling on the government to act to make use of technological advances to improve health care quality and provide more rigorous data. In addition to these explicit goals, through establishing CHI the federal government also sought to avoid potential criticism if the implementation of e-health failed, increase its own popularity ahead of the 2000 election and subtly redistribute wealth between the provinces. The paper suggests that the major influence behind the policy to establish CHI came from Canadian institutions {{and the fact that the}} federal government was hamstrung by the Canadian Constitution and Canada Health Act. Evaluation of the reform shows that progress has been made by CHI in implementing e-health solutions, but that Canada still lags behind other comparable health systems in the use of technologies. SWOT analysis of the CHI implementation highlights the criticism that CHI could stifle provincial innovation but recognizes that it also offers the opportunity for best practice dissemination across Canada and ensures that <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funding</b> is available for e-health implementation across the provinces. In conclusion, the paper suggests that, because of constitutional constraints, the federal government was limited in options to implement e-health and that CHI represents a fair compromise...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{not well}} {{understood}} how economic crises affect infectious disease incidence and prevalence, particularly among vulnerable groups. Using a susceptible-infected-recovered framework, we systematically reviewed literature {{on the impact of}} the economic crises on infectious disease risks in migrants in Europe, focusing principally on HIV, TB, hepatitis and other STIs. Methods: We conducted two searches in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, websites of key organizations and grey literature to identify how economic changes affect migrant populations and infectious disease. We perform a narrative synthesis in order to map critical pathways and identify hypotheses for subsequent research. Results: The systematic review on links between economic crises and migrant health identified 653 studies through database searching; only seven met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen items were identified through further searches. The systematic review on links between economic crises and infectious disease identified 480 studies through database searching; 19 met the inclusion criteria. Eight items were identified through further searches. The reviews show that migrant populations in Europe appear disproportionately at risk of specific infectious diseases, and that economic crises and subsequent responses have tended to exacerbate such risks. Recessions lead to unemployment, impoverishment and other risk factors that can be linked to the transmissibility of disease among migrants. Austerity measures that lead to cuts in prevention and treatment programmes further exacerbate infectious disease risks among migrants. Non-governmental health service providers occasionally stepped in to cater to specific populations that include migrants. Conclusions: There is evidence that migrants are especially vulnerable to infectious disease during economic crises. <b>Ring-fenced</b> <b>funding</b> of prevention programs, including screening and treatment, is important for addressing this vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|With {{hundreds}} of millions of pounds spent on digital technology for education every year – from interactive whiteboards to the rise of one–to–one tablet computers – every new technology seems to offer unlimited promise to learning. many sectors have benefitted immensely from harnessing innovative uses of technology. cloud computing, mobile communications and internet applications have changed the way manufacturing, finance, business services, the media and retailers operate. But key questions remain in education: has the range of technologies helped improve learners’ experiences and the standards they achieve? or is this investment just languishing as kit in the cupboard? and what more can decision makers, schools, teachers, parents and the technology industry do to ensure the full potential of innovative technology is exploited? There is no doubt that digital technologies have had a profound impact upon the management of learning. institutions can now recruit, register, monitor, and report on students with a new economy, efficiency, and (sometimes) creativity. yet, evidence of digital technologies producing real transformation in learning and teaching remains elusive. The education sector has invested heavily in digital technology; but this investment has not yet resulted in the radical improvements to learning experiences and educational attainment. in 2011, the Review of Education Capital found that maintained schools spent £ 487 million on icT equipment and services in 2009 - 2010. 1 since then, the education system has entered a state of flux with changes to the curriculum, shifts in funding, and increasing school autonomy. While <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funding</b> for icT equipment and services has since ceased, a survey of 1, 317 schools in July 2012 by the british educational suppliers association found they were assigning an increasing amount of their budget to technology.

This is both a challenge and an opportunity as it puts schools in greater charge of their spending and use of technolog...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades Classical music, as an {{established}} art form, has increasingly struggled world wide as a sustainable industry. The music preferences of the general public have been moving away from the traditional symphonic concerts, and both public and private sponsorships have been diminishing. In South Africa, orchestras moved from fully government subsidised organizations to self-sustaining companies after closure of almost all orchestras in 2000 due to new political leadership and cultural funding redirections. The South African government’s policy on Art and Culture has been completely restructured {{in the view of the}} post-apartheid government’s new priorities. The creation of a National Arts Council saw the end of separate provincial art councils and centralized the distribution of private <b>funds.</b> The annual <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funding</b> for the three orchestras in three different provinces was eventually established. The Department of Arts and Culture realized that funding of all cultural institutions in the country cannot be achieved by government alone and therefore created various companies and trusts, such as National Lottery, to generate additional funding. The private sector is also being encouraged by the ministry to provide assistance and collaborate in supporting of arts and culture. The three full-time orchestras - two established post 2000 - that have persevered in the new conditions and are functioning to this day are KwaZulu-Natal Philharmonic Orchestra, Cape Philharmonic Orchestra and Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra. All three had to adapt to new work loads and undergo a difficult transformation into money-earning business way of conducting their day-to-day operations. New concepts for the running of an orchestra, such as budgeting, advertising, planning, audience creation, outreach education, management reconstruction and fund raising, were slowly taken up and old mentalities associated with how orchestras were previously ran were finally discarded.

40|$|Background: From the mid- 1990 s, UK governments {{developed}} partnerships {{to tackle}} drugs nationally and locally. Over time, increased resources focused on communities and localities in greatest need. This reflected {{growing awareness of}} the concentration of problems in deprived areas, with social and spatial segregation being a feature of post-industrial urban areas. Methods: A review of English drug policy since the 1990 s, drawing on:- analysis of documents; a review of sociological studies; an illustrative case-study of one northern town; interviews with local policy players; statistical analysis of key indicators {{with some of these}} data presented using Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping. Results: In-depth sociological studies demonstrate interconnections between historical patterns, socio-economic change, cultural complexity, deprivation, limited opportunities and illicit drugs. At local level, there are links between concentrated multiple deprivation, poor health, acquisitive crime and problematic drug use. Partnership policies, encouraged by the provision of <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funds,</b> have been effective in containing problems. Underlying issues of inequality are however neglected in political debates. The article argues that post-industrial towns and cities are characterised by an increase in problems related to poverty and drugs. Both the real shape and perceptions of what is the problem change over time. In England, the profile of the problem drug user was described in a number of sociological studies conducted from the 1980 s onwards. Key features were the concentration of problems in certain social groups (such as the poorly educated or unemployed) and in certain areas (inner cities or outer estates). Responding to rising public concern, national drug strategies developed and the New Labour Government after 1997 prioritised the issue of drugs, directing increased resources to drug treatment with tight control over the use of these new monies through target setting and measurement of performance. The emphasis was on the most dangerous drugs and most disadvantaged areas. Conclusion: There is local variation in the pattern of problems and in implementation of national policies. In UK after 1997, New Labour policy aimed to promote a fair and cost-effective distribution of resources and improved availability and quality of treatment services and local policing. Tensions appeared between the drive to meet national targets and local perceptions of need. Ideas of localism, promoting market solutions and flexibility in provision, are now gaining ground in English social policy with the arrival of a Coalition (Conservative/Liberal Democrat) Government. These, together with an emphasis on abstinence and recovery, raise questions about the future adequacy of (a) attention to marginalised problems and stigmatised groups and (b) the distribution of resources in a context of severe fiscal restraint...|$|R
40|$|The Volcker Rule prohibits {{proprietary}} trading by banking entities - in effect, reintroducing {{to the financial}} markets {{a substantial portion of}} the Glass-Steagall Act’s static divide between banks and securities firms. This Article argues that the Glass-Steagall model is a fixture of the past - a financial Maginot Line within an evolving financial system. To be effective, new financial regulation must reflect new relationships in the marketplace. For the Volcker Rule, those relationships include a growing reliance by banks on new market participants to conduct traditional banking functions. Proprietary trading has moved to less-regulated businesses, in many cases, to hedge funds. The result is likely to be an increase in overall risk-taking, absent market or regulatory restraint. <b>Ring-fencing</b> hedge <b>funds</b> from other parts of the financial system may be increasingly difficult as markets become more interconnected. For example, new capital markets instruments - such as credit default swaps - enable banks to outsource credit risk to hedge funds and other market participants. Doing so permits banks to extend greater amounts of credit at lower cost. A decline in the hedge fund industry, therefore, may prompt a contraction in available credit by banks that are no longer able to manage risk as effectively as before. In short, even if {{proprietary trading}} is no longer located in banks, it may now be conducted by less-regulated entities that affect banks and banking activities. Banks that rely on hedge funds to manage credit risk will continue to be exposed to proprietary trading - perhaps less directly, but now also with less regulatory oversight, than before. The Volcker Rule, consequently, fails to reflect an important shift in the financial markets, arguing, at least initially, for a narrow definition of proprietary trading and a more fluid approach to implementing the Rule...|$|R

The DSDC is an independent commission, established by the Scottish Government in 2009 to monitor and assess whether Scotland's national drug strategy The Road to Recovery 1 is being successfully implemented and achieving its aims. 1. 1 Road to Recovery and Delivery Reform Process The Road to Recovery was published in 2008 and describes 59 actions and expected outcomes for the Scottish Government and its partners. These included: 10 actions on Promoting Recovery; 11 on Delivering the Recovery Model; 9 on Prevention; 12 on Enforcement and 17 on Children Affected by Substance Misusing Families. The strategy aims to improve the expectations of both services dealing with substance misuse and their clients in Scotland. In 2009, following publication of The Road to Recovery, Audit Scotland reported {{on the effectiveness of}} the current delivery system 2.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate how two UK Local Authorities (Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire), the two Universities of Hertfordshire and Northampton and public transport providers have worked in partnership to develop a smart scan-on m-ticketing solution, that integrates into a wider ???smart city??? solution delivering social good through connected value propositions. Based on the initial success of a Hertfordshire pilot, a specific objective of this work is to establish smart integrated multi-operator/modal solutions. This pilot is subsequently being collaboratively expanded upon, through the UK Department for Transport funded ???Network Northamptonshire Total Transport??? initiative, a transformative project to improve connectivity, integration and accessibility for rural transport networks. This forms part of the recently signed ???Heart of England??? economic tri-county alliance agreement, which aims to work collaboratively across three local authority regions (Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire), consolidating ?? 3 bn of spending. This provides a further future platform for innovative transport solutions being rolled out across wider geographical areas. The initial Hertfordshire demonstrator pilot project explored how a ???smart??? m-ticketing platform could provide a sustainable financial business model for implementing ticketing solutions for small and medium bus operators within rural Shires, outside of large urban settings. This unique project was the first scan-on bus mobile ticket product used in the UK (outside of London). It offers a partnership model and governance structure for local authorities, commercial operators and other stakeholders with an interest in integrated sustainable transport to take forward, and leads to the possibility of new, socially innovative models for procuring and delivering transport solutions. Initial user reactions have been positive, generating large digital data sets, analysis of which indicates rapid user uptake in comparison to other schemes. This data enables detailed analysis such as precise user geo-spatial distribution, supporting targeted marketing and route-specific promotions to encourage further service uptake. A critical success factor of the project was to target a reduction of on-bus cash handling by five per cent within the first 12 months. This would aid in reducing bus loading times, improve reliability and operator efficiencies. After an initial 16 month operational use, uptake growth in excess of 7 per cent of total revenue has been achieved, on specific routes the transfer to m-ticket has exceeded 12 per cent, with targets of 10 per cent of total cash to mobile conversion predicted by the middle of 2017, likely to be realised. The effectiveness of marketing campaigns, technical development aspects and implementation issues will be reported. These projects have a wider context. Public transport services in rural areas in England are deregulated, and have at present no effective statutory backing or <b>ring-fenced</b> <b>funding.</b> As a result, with reductions in funding to local authorities, funding for non-commercial bus services is being sharply reduced and many authorities are proposing to cease all funding for local bus services (Campaign for Better Transport, 2016). These projects may offer alternative cost-effective ways of providing local transport services in non-metropolitan areas, and thus provide the potential for unique future research opportunities. These include understanding the uptake of smart multi-modal solutions in rural areas to improve accessibility and connectivity through enhanced services for new users and for those with restricted or reduced mobility networks, whilst also offering efficiencies for operators. This research has added importance, because the UK Government is proposing legislation on bus services in England, which would confer significant extra powers on local authorities to intervene in the bus market in various ways. These projects may act as pathfinders for the use of these powers in non-metropolitan areas. Structures supporting a partnership approach involving all those with an interest in public transport are a critical part of improving rural connectivity and accessibility. Through the experience of establishing quality partnership models in Hertfordshire, this paper will go on to detail the subsequent work now underway developing a Social Enterprise model involving local government, universities, operators, health and education services in Northamptonshire, which will form the basis of the transformation of rural integrated sustainable transport delivery...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This paper {{presents}} a system dynamics computer simulation model to illustrate unintended consequences of apparently rational allocations to curative and preventive services. METHODS: A modeled population {{is subject to}} only two diseases. Disease A is a curable disease that can be shortened by curative care. Disease B is an instantly fatal but preventable disease. Curative care workers are financed by public spending and private fees to cure disease A. Non-personal, preventive services are delivered by public health workers supported solely by public spending to prevent disease B. Each type of worker tries to tilt the balance of government spending towards their interests. Their influence on the government is proportional to their accumulated revenue. RESULTS: The model demonstrates effects on lost disability-adjusted life years and costs {{over the course of}} several epidemics of each disease. Policy interventions are tested including: i) an outside donor rationally donates extra money to each type of disease precisely in proportion to the size of epidemics of each disease; ii) lobbying is eliminated; iii) fees for personal health services are eliminated; iv) the government continually rebalances the funding for prevention by ring-fencing it to protect it from lobbying. The model exhibits a “spend more get less” equilibrium in which higher revenue by the curative sector is used to influence government allocations away from prevention towards cure. Spending more on curing disease A leads paradoxically to a higher overall disease burden of unprevented cases of disease B. This paradoxical behavior of the model can be stopped by eliminating lobbying, eliminating fees for curative services, and <b>ring-fencing</b> public health <b>funding.</b> CONCLUSIONS: We have created an artificial system as a laboratory to gain insights about the trade-offs between curative and preventive health allocations, and the effect of indicative policy interventions. The underlying dynamics of this artificial system resemble features of modern health systems where a self-perpetuating industry has grown up around disease-specific curative programs like HIV/AIDS or malaria. The model shows how the growth of curative care services can crowd both fiscal and policy space for the practice of population level prevention work, requiring dramatic interventions to overcome these trends.
