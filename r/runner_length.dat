50|$|The 1993 - 1998 4-valve engines {{featured}} {{cylinder heads}} with two intake ports per cylinder (split-port) and variable <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> intake manifolds with either vacuum or electrically activated intake manifold runner controls (IMRC) depending on application. The engine was revised for 1999 with new cylinder heads featuring tumble-style intake ports (one intake port feeding two intake valves), new camshaft profiles, and fixed runner-length intake manifolds. These changes {{resulted in more}} power, torque and a broader power-band {{when compared to the}} earlier 4-valve engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airflow path}} through the engine uses a [...] "hot-vee" [...] layout, where the exhaust {{manifolds}} and turbochargers are located between the cylinder banks (on the [...] "inside" [...] of the V8) and the intake manifolds are located {{on the outside of}} the engine. This is opposite to the traditional layout for a V8, where the intake is inside the [...] "V" [...] and the exhaust manifold is on the outside. The hot-vee layout reduces the width of the engine and decreases the exhaust <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> from the exhaust valves to the turbochargers. The engine uses air-to-water intercoolers, therefore improving throttle response.|$|E
50|$|The FE-DOHC {{featured}} Mazda's VICS system, {{short for}} Variable Inertia Control System, a variable intake setup to optimize <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> and resonance at different engine speeds. Much like Toyota's Acoustic Control Induction System, it had {{two sets of}} intake runners, a long set for low-medium RPMs, and a short set for high RPMs. It was operated by a vacuum solenoid based on the engine's current speed, actuating a pair of butterflies inside the manifold to open or close the short runners past 5400 RPM. This system has been used on many Mazda engines since including the BP. The K-series V6 engines used a different principle to the same effect dubbed VRIS.|$|E
5000|$|The MR is {{a family}} of straight-4 all-aluminum {{automobile}} engines with variable valve timing co-developed by Renault and Nissan. Renault calls it the M engine. Other noteworthy features of this engine family include acoustically equal <b>runner</b> <b>lengths</b> and a tumble control valve for the intake manifold, a [...] "silent" [...] timing chain, mirror finished crankshaft and camshaft journals, and offset cylinder placement for an attempt in increased efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The racing {{career of}} Daiwa Major began on 27 December at Nakayama Racecourse where he contested a one-mile event for {{previously}} unraced horses. He finished {{second of the}} twelve <b>runners,</b> two <b>lengths</b> behind the winner.|$|R
50|$|At York Racecourse on 17 August, Solford started second {{favourite}} {{behind the}} Epsom Derby winner Teenoso in the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes. The Irish colt looked unimpressive {{before the race}} and ran poorly to finish fourth of the five <b>runners,</b> fifteen <b>lengths</b> behind the winner Seymour Hicks.|$|R
50|$|Why couldn’t we {{just use}} a shorter runner so the delay {{is not so}} great? The answer lies {{at the end of}} the cycle when that big long runner now {{continues}} to flow at full speed disregarding the rising pressure in the cylinder and providing pressure to the cylinder when it is needed most. The <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> also controls the timing of the returning waves and cannot be altered. A shorter runner would flow earlier but also would die earlier while returning the positive waves much too quickly and those waves would be weaker. The key is to find the optimum balance of all the factors for the engine requirements.|$|E
5000|$|All of the 4-cylinder engines {{available}} in the Carlton Mk II were the GM Family II units in 1.8L and 2.0L capacities. The Opel Omega A was offered with a large 2.4L Opel CIH engine in certain European markets, but this variant was never offered in the Carlton. New to the Carlton's line-up with the Mark II were two straight-6 engines with 2.6 and 3.0-litres. These were both 12-valve engines, again from the Opel CIH family, but later 3.0-liter models were offered with 24-valves, producing much more power and torque. As well, Vauxhall used the [...] "Dual-Ram" [...] intake manifold, which lets the car breathe as two separate three-cylinder engines below 4,000 rpm, but changes the intake manifold profile at 4000 rpm to increase the <b>runner</b> <b>length,</b> thus increasing total engine output.|$|E
5000|$|In some engines {{the intake}} runners are {{straight}} for minimal resistance. In most engines, however, the runners have curves...and some very convoluted to achieve desired <b>runner</b> <b>length.</b> These turns {{allow for a}} more compact manifold, with denser packaging of the whole engine, as a result. Also, these [...] "snaked" [...] runners are needed for some variable length/ split runner designs, and allow {{the size of the}} plenum to be reduced. In an engine with at least six cylinders the averaged intake flow is nearly constant and the plenum volume can be smaller. To avoid standing waves within the plenum it is made as compact as possible. The intake runners each use a smaller part of the plenum surface than the inlet, which supplies air to the plenum, for aerodynamic reasons. Each runner is placed to have nearly the same distance to the main inlet. Runners whose cylinders fire close after each other, are not placed as neighbors.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{predicting}} the <b>runner</b> <b>length,</b> that is, {{the length of}} warp yarn required to knit 480 courses on two bar tricot machine, is presented here by using {{a model of the}} critical tensile state, which was established in an analysis for the biaxial tensile deformations of warp-knitted fabrics. By comparing some calculations using this model with experimental measurements, it has been found that this method gives better result in practice than Grosberg's model. The effects of the yarn thickness on the calculation of the <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> are examined, and the result shows that a short diameter of closest packing of yarn is more adequate for the prediction...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} flow {{characteristic}} in novel cylinder head at various port size and <b>runner</b> <b>length.</b> Novel cylinder head engine is a design engine that operates in a 4 -stroke operational cycle. This engine uses a second opposed piston in designed cylinder head that moves at half the cyclical {{rate of the}} main piston, thus giving six piston movements per cycle. Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine. Intake and exhaust poppet valve is replaced with two-stroke reed valve and exhaust port similar with two-stroke engine mechanism. The flow in a pipe of an engine exhaust and/or inlet system is treated as one dimensional. This means that the pressures, temperatures and flow velocities obtained from {{the solution of the}} gas dynamic equations represent mean values over the cross-section of the pipes. 1 -d simulation tool used in this investigation is GT-power. Simulation runs with limitation of port size not exceed 70 % size of cylinder head and exhaust length is limit to length of the motorcycle. The parameters investigated are volumetric efficiency of engine at difference engine speed and mean pistons speed. The parameter to investigate is flow rate during motoring only. The engine speed is limited to 4000 rpm related to maximum torque of original engine. Volumetric efficiency is increase with bigger intake port and smaller exhaust port. Elongations of the exhaust pipes give an improvement potential of the engine efficiency. The optimal value to choose in the novel cylinder head from the simulation result is at intake port size of 24 mm and exhaust port 16 mm as it has the optimal efficiency. For <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> the optimal value at intake <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> 90 mm and exhaust <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> 1050 mm...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{passenger}} car engines have been “down-sized” for improved fuel consumption, resulting in high speeds to obtain good performance. Consumers, however, are demanding improved low-end torque for improved drivability. The target engine; a 4 valve per cylinder, 1. 6 L engine with two intake cam profiles and 2 intake runner lengths, was modeled and correlated with measured engine performance characteristics (power, torque, etc.); and pressure traces from combustion chamber, {{intake and exhaust}} manifolds to establish the confidence level in the model's prediction. The model was then optimised for low-end torque by manipulating exhaust manifold configuration, exhaust <b>runner</b> <b>length,</b> intake diameter and intake <b>runner</b> <b>length.</b> It {{was found that the}} original exhaust system is too short and gives uneven exhaust cross-charging among the cylinders.

40|$|Abstract: Gas {{dynamics}} of intake system {{plays a key}} role in deciding the performance of an engine. This dynamics are different for fuel injected and carbureted engine and vary according to type of engine, number of cylinders, temperature at inlet, valve timing, valve angle and other factors. Careful design of the manifolds enables the engineer (designer) to manipulate the characteristics to the desired level. This paper investigates the effects of intake <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> on the performance characteristics of a four-stroke, single-cylinder spark-ignited engine with electronically controlled fuel injector. In this paper basic intake tuning mechanisms were described. Engine performance characteristics such as brake torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure and specific fuel consumption were taken into consideration and virtual simulation software LOTUS ENGINE SIMULATION was used to evaluate the effects of the variation in the length of intake plenum on these parameters. It was found that change in <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> had a considerable effect on the rpm atwhich peak value of torque was obtained (occurred). Accordingly a system to adjust the manifold length (tuned adjustable intake pipe) was designed and developed. According to the simulation graphs, in order to increase the torque performance, plenum length must be extended for low engine speeds and shortened as the engine speed increases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Philippine metals {{industry}} is envisioned at transforming the Philippines into a world-class and a reliable supplier of metal components, machineries and parts and other finished metal products. Development of other applications of spin casting {{could be of}} {{significant contribution to the}} growth of the metals industry in the Philippines. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the optimum process parameters that will improve the quality of spin castings. Design parameters that have significant contributions in the improvement of the quality of spin casting products are identified which can serve as guidelines for researchers, designers and practitioners in the area of spin casting technology. A design of experiment optimization technique is applied to determine the optimal process parameters in the spin casting of zinc-based alloys. A polynomial regression model defining the relationship between the spin casting process parameters and the casting dimensions is used. An analysis of variance test was conducted to identify the process parameters that are statistically significant. The best results of the dimensional accuracy of the spin casting part were obtained when low values of <b>runner</b> <b>length,</b> runner diameter and disk closing pressure were used. The length of the mold runner as well as the interaction between the mold disk closing pressure and the <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> showed significant influence on the dimensional accuracy of the spin casting part...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} percentages of elastane and Nylon yarn on the dimensional and physical properties of elastanelNylon Locknit warp knitted fabrics are investigated. In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of elastane and Nylon. Elastane yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of elastane yarn. Then elastane yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of elastane yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in width direction. This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of elastane yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher load at extension along the length direction of the greige sample. Nylon yarn <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> influences the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it leads to reduce the load at extension along the width direction of the sample. Changing of Nylon yarn <b>runner</b> <b>length</b> influence the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it has an effect on the load at different extension in width direction and course density of the greige fabric.

40|$|Abstract: Exhausting {{fossil fuel}} and {{increasing}} concern {{of air pollution}} have brought on the change of the focus of developing new vehicles from performance to fuel economy and emission.
