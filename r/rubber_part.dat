40|$|AbstractThe {{interest}} of fatigue life evaluation for rubber component such as engine mount was increasing {{according to the}} extension of warranty period of the automotive components. A design of rubber components against fatigue failure {{is one of the}} critical issues to prevent the failures during the operation. Therefore, fatigue life prediction and evaluation are the key technologies to assure the safety and reliability of mechanical rubber components. In this study, we developed rubber material that is environment-friendly and superior in physical property and fatigue life using rubber-clay nanocomposite. We performed static and dynamic tests of rubber-clay nanocomposite synthesized by inserting nano-filler between silicate layers at the high temperature of + 70 ˜+ 100 °C, and verified that their mechanical properties were superior to the existing rubber material. In addition, a new method was developed to estimate fatigue lifetime of <b>rubber</b> <b>parts</b> in a short period in the initial stage of design, assuming that the fatigue damage parameter was Green-Lagrange strain generated at the weak points of parts. As results of estimation of fatigue durability, it was verified that the fatigue lifetime obtained by fatigue tests on actual engine mounts and the expected lifetime relatively match. With the results of finite element analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>parts</b> using the fatigue lifetime estimation method suggested in this study, the lifetime can be estimated without fatigue tests on <b>rubber</b> <b>parts.</b> Therefore, we can save development time and expense and achieve good quality and reliability of <b>rubber</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presented}} in this report has been made on behalf of Scania and their basic frame design department with the subject to solve an implementation of a weight sensing system in the chassis. The system {{is supposed to be}} implemented in the seat springs, and {{the reason for this is}} that all the force will have to go through the weight sensing transducers. With all the force going through the transducers the weight sensing system will not be sensitive for the differences in tolerances from manufacturing. The transducers could be pre-calibrated to avoid a calibration of the whole vehicle after it’s completed from the manufacturing line. Weight sensing systems is today a reality in trucks with air springs. Complete systems is also sold in the big aftermarket for trucks. None of Scanias competitors have a solution for this as of today. The thesis was from start limited to only process the BT- 301 S bogie. A system will likely be easy to adapt to the other bogies with small modifications. Through the thesis possible problems are illuminated to understand the function and make a properly working weight sensing system. In the present bogie system the main problem for a proper function is the frictional forces that appears in the surface between the spring and the spring seat.   In the report a proposition with a <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> between the spring and the spring seat is introduced, with the idea to get around the known problems with the frictional forces. The rubber itself does produce a reaction force when deformed, but the forces could through simulation be known, and hence compensated for. A <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> under the spring would result in a contact surface much higher than today. A new spring, or a new version of the spring, will be needed for this solution to work. For the work to come, Scania need to decide what precision the weight sensing system need. But smaller decisions like the size and stiffness for the <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> will also be needed. This thesis has only dealt with the bogie, but in a close future, the front axles need to be done. Much can likely be carried over from this thesis for that. A weight sensing might be possible to implement, but with what precision at uneven ground? Most likely will the variation in load on the transducers be too much. An approximation for the precision with a total span of 7 % is realistic...|$|E
40|$|A {{prediction}} {{tool for}} the crack propagation is developed by the tearing energy concept and the finite element method. The value of the critical tearing energy, at which the crack propagation starts, is determined for different initial crack sizes. It is shown, that the critical tearing energy is influenced both by the loading rate and temperature and that the time-temperature-shift-principle and the WLF-equation can be applied. A procedure is also introduced to separate the influences of geometry and material on the tearing energy. Finally, the crack propagating load can be calculated for rubber parts by the finite {{element method and the}} critical tearing energy.

40|$|The final {{objective}} of the present work is the accurate prediction of the dynamic stiffness behaviour of complex rubber parts using finite element simulation tools. For this purpose, it becomes necessary to perform a complex rubber compound material characterisation and modelling work; this needs two important previous steps. These steps are detailed in the present document together with a theoretical review of viscoelastic visco-elasto-plastic models for elastomers. Firstly, a new characterisation method is proposed to determine the degree of cure of rubber parts. It is known {{that the degree of}} cure of rubbers bears heavily on their mechanical properties. This method consists of the correlation of swelling results to rheometer data achieving a good agreement. Secondly, the influence of the strain rate used in static characterisation tests is studied. In this step, a new characterisation method is proposed. The latter characterisation method will be used to fit extended hyperelastic models in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software like ANSYS. The proposed method improves the correlation of experimental data to simulation results obtained by the use of standard methods. Finally, the overlay method proposed by Austrell concerning frequency dependence of the dynamic modulus and loss angle that is known to increase more with frequency for small amplitudes than for large amplitudes is developed. The original version of the overlay method yields no difference in frequency dependence with respect to different load amplitudes. However, if the element in the viscoelastic layer of the finite element model are given different stiffness and loss properties depending on the loading amplitude level, frequency dependence is shown to be more accurate compared to experiments. The commercial finite element program Ansys is used to model an industrial metal <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> using two layers of elements. One layer is a hyper viscoelastic layer and the other layer uses an elasto-plastic model with a multi-linear kinematic hardening rule. The model, being intended for stationary cyclic loading, shows good agreement with measurements on the harmonically loaded industrial <b>rubber</b> <b>part...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{formulated}} engineering rubber is {{a complex}} mixture involving several components {{that are involved in}} the vulcanization reactions. The life-performance of a <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> is determined in a complex, coupled manner by the vulcanization kinetics, part shape, thermal histories during part manufacture and service, and mechanical loading. Due to this complexity, the current industrial design practice is a heuristic, trial-and-error procedure. Recently, Ghosh, et al. [1] presented a kinetic model to predict the temporal evolution of crosslink density, the key parameter connecting formulation chemistry to mechanical response. However, the model is applicable only to a limited range of formulations and does not describe all features of vulcanization. The primary objective of this thesis is to critically analyze vulcanization chemistry, which involves polysulfidic species, using fundamental quantum-chemical calculations. We have performed exhaustive Density Functional Theory calculations to determine the energies and equilibrium constants for the sulfur-sulfur bond dissociations in the various polysulfidic species. Molecular orbital analyses have been carried out to obtain qualitative insights into relative reactivities of the species. Our results show that the bond dissociation energies and equilibrium constants depend upon polysulfidic chain length, bond position and the type of terminal end group. Our analyses also suggest that some reactions in the Ghosh, et al. model may need to be modified or replaced by alternative mechanisms. Our secondary objective is to predict the life-performance of a formulated <b>rubber</b> <b>part.</b> We have developed a manufacturing model that involves transient heat conduction to describe the spatially heterogeneous temperature field in the part at the end of manufacture, which is then used with the kinetic model to predict the crosslink density profile in the part. We then employ a model by Sarkar and coworkers[2] to calculate the viscous dissipation during part service, and use the resulting temperature field with the kinetic model to describe the long-term mechanical performance of the part expressed as the evolution of the elastic modulus over long times. We also present a preliminary, conceptual framework for simultaneous formulation and part design, which is based on multi-scale, hierarchical forward models and knowledge-driven inverse search. ^ [1] Ghosh, P., S.

40|$|Widespread {{adoption}} of process inspection {{is dependent on}} reduction of cost. In many applications the part geometry may not be known or may be sufficiently complex {{that it would be}} desirable to not follow all of the part contours. Fortunately, in cases where refraction of the wave between the coupling fluid and the part is low, relatively complex parts may be scanned without precisely following the part contours. This paper explores a problem where a complex part is scanned with a limited number of degrees of freedom in the scanning system. The close acoustic impedance match between the <b>rubber</b> <b>part</b> and the water coupling fluid allows this to be done efficiently. However, the refraction and attenuation of the wave in the material is still sufficiently high that {{it may be necessary to}} correct the amplitude of the received signal to account for the part geometry. Matrix propagator methods are used to create a model which will allow the effect of amplitude variation on the received signal to be explored for the curved specimen.
