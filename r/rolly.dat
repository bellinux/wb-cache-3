25|$|On February 28, 1986, {{after the}} Revolution, Geny Lopez {{returned}} to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from {{what was left of}} the station.

Aniceto, who worked as the Program Director for Radio and Television of the network and station manager of Channel 2 in the 1970s, was served as the first Vice President and General Manager of ABS-CBN upon the network's reopening from 1986 to 1987.|$|E
500|$|Three {{full-size}} pneumatically powered prop sharks—which {{the film}} crew nicknamed [...] "Bruce" [...] after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce Ramer—were {{made for the}} production: a [...] "sea-sled shark", a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a [...] line, and two [...] "platform sharks", one that moved from camera-left to -right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. The sharks were designed by art director Joe Alves during {{the third quarter of}} 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at <b>Rolly</b> Harper's Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location. In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts.|$|E

'Tasker was a maverick in every way and a trail-blazer in sport and in building a successful sail making business in Phuket, Thailand.
