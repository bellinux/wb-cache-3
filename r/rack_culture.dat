40|$|All leading {{mussel farming}} {{countries}} in the world producing annually 330000 tons (weight in the shell) of mussels depend on natural seed resources to meet their requ- ir ement of seed, whether it is for bottom culture (Netherlands), bauchot culture (France), raft culture (Spain), <b>rack</b> <b>culture</b> (Italy) or submerged pole culture (Phillippines). Hatchery system of mass seed production, therefore, has not become necessary unlike in the culture of other edible molluscs like oysters, clams a nd abalones wher in suitable techniques are employed by the industry...|$|E
40|$|Mussel Culture offers immense {{scope for}} {{development}} in our open waters for enhancing food and livelihood {{security of the}} fisherfolk, the vulnerable sections of our society. Self Help Groups (SHGs') do {{play a vital role}} in management of common property resources through community participation. Three case studies on Dynamics of Self Help Groups in Mussel Farming in open sea and estuaries in Karnataka coastal belts were explored for the present study. SHGs' were mobilised in Karnataka coastal belts and offered training through demonstration on mussel culture in open sea and estuaries at three sites namely Majali, Sunkeri and Bhatkal. Initially, training and demonstration programmes in two sites in Karwar were undertaken, one for raft culture in open sea in Majali of Dandebag and one for <b>rack</b> <b>culture</b> in Sunkeri of Kali estuary...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been {{undertaken in the}} estuaries of the south west of England since the species was introduced into commercial cultivation in the UK in the 1970 s. The industry has grown slowly following improvements to legislation and environmental conditions {{and it is now}} in a position to increase production. This study has been undertaken to assess different methods of cultivation used commercially in the south west of England for growing Pacific oysters. The two methods, the growth of oysters contained in bags placed on racks and oysters in bags placed directly onto the foreshore, were assessed at a site on the River Dart at Waddeton. The experiment set up the two methods with a replication of the five bags in two blocks. The trial was then repeated fully and partially a third time. The oysters were purchased as seed and grown within the treatments until they had reached commercial market size. Measurements were taken throughout the growing cycle and were used to assess the two growing methods. Additional environmental data was recorded in order to aid comparisons with other similar studies. Following the study it has emerged that there are no advantages in growth rates obtained from either cultivation method. Both methods produce market size Pacific oysters after 20 months, which is comparable with other study growth rates. The major difference comes from the costs associated with the two methods of cultivation; the cost of the shore based system produces an oyster at a saving of 20 % compared to the <b>rack</b> <b>culture.</b> Site selection and substrata condition are the important factors to be considered when deciding which method of cultivation best suits individual operators...|$|E

50|$|Culture {{tubes are}} test tubes used in biology and related {{sciences}} for handling and culturing {{all kinds of}} live organisms, such as molds, bacteria, seedlings, plant cuttings, etc.. Some <b>racks</b> for <b>culture</b> tubes are designed to hold the tubes in a nearly horizontal position, so as to maximize {{the surface of the}} culture medium inside.|$|R
50|$|Ambiguously and for simplicity, {{the term}} rack {{is also being}} {{used to refer to}} some support structures. In popular <b>culture,</b> <b>racks</b> usually refer to bomb racks or racks {{mounting}} bombs which covers everything from a support structure to its associated racks. A Multiple Ejector Rack (MER) usually refers to a support structure which enables the carriage of six stores. A Triple Ejector Rack (TER) refers to a support structure which enables the carriage of three stores.|$|R
40|$|A semiautomated {{method for}} {{microbiological}} vitamin assays is described, which includes separate automated {{systems for the}} preparation of the cultures and for the measurement of turbidity. In the dilution and dosage unit based on the continuous-flow principle, vitamin samples were diluted to two different dose levels at a rate of 40 per hr, mixed with the inoculated test broth, and dispensed into culture tubes. After incubation, <b>racks</b> with <b>culture</b> tubes were placed on the sampler of an automatic turbidimeter. This unit, based on the discrete-sample system, measured the turbidity and printed the extinction values at a rate of 300 per hr. Calculations were computerized and the results, including statistical data, are presented in an easily readable form. The automated method is in routine use for the assays of thiamine, riboflavine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, calcium pantothenate, nicotinic acid, pantothenol, and folic acid. Identical vitamin solutions assayed on different days gave variation coefficients for the various vitamin assays of less than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Infestation with mites {{may occur}} even in well kept laboratories. They proliferate in undessicated {{cultures}} Because they are tiny (~ 130 µ long), mites can crawl through cotton plugs and can enter covered petri dishes, carrying contaminating conidia from one culture to another. Purity of stocks is suspect {{by the time}} mites are detected. Seeing a mite with a belly full of orange conidia walking across an agar or glass surface under the microscopic is an alarming experience, signalling trouble and requiring interruption of other work while cleaning up is given top priority. Reasonable precautions can reduce the probability of infestation. At Stanford, we have reduced the frquency to less than once a decade. Effective measures have been devised {{for dealing with the}} problem when it does occur, but recovery from an infestation is laborious and requires prompt and vigorous action. Procedure Killing mites: Cultures and crosses that can be readily replaced should be autoclaved, together with exposed <b>racks</b> and containers. <b>Cultures</b> to be recovered can be freed of mites in either of two ways. Freezing at − 18 ºC or − 20 ºC for 24 hours kills both adults and eggs (Subden and Threlkeld 1966, Allison and Hilton 1994). (Refrigeration at 5 ºC slows mites but does not kill them.) Conidiashow high survival after freezing, but ascospores do not. Thus freezing is not an option for crosses...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} {{concern about the}} {{ecological}} impacts and benefits of oyster culture on estuaries and coastal waters. To {{examine the effects of}} the system-scale removal of oyster <b>culture</b> <b>racks</b> on phytoplankton and periphyton in a eutrophic tropical lagoon, a long-term study was conducted at 2 to 3 mo intervals from June 2000 to June 2004 (includes the time of complete oyster culture removal from Tapong Bay, southwestern Taiwan in June 2002). The abundances, productivities, and community structures of the inner (poorly flushed) and outer (well flushed) regions were compared before and after rack removal. Tidal flushing was an important factor regulating the responses of phytoplankton. After rack removal, mean chlorophyll a and maximum gross production (GP(max)) rate of phytoplankton increased 4 -fold in the inner region, but remained unchanged in the outer region and at the control site. Phytoplankton communities in both regions and at the control site were dominated by Bacillariophyta alone before rack removal, but shifted to a co-dominance of Bacillariophyta, Dinophyta, and Cyanobacteria after rack removal. When GP(max) rate was normalized to chl a (p(max) (B)) and expressed as maximum photosynthetic intensity, no significant difference was detected before and after rack removal in either region. Chl a accumulation rate, GP(max) rate, p(max) (B), and dominant species of periphyton did not differ significantly before and after rack removal in either region. Our results suggest the effectiveness of top-down control of phytoplankton abundances and a reduction in community diversity by cultured oysters in this eutrophic lagoon...|$|R
40|$|Economics of {{different}} aquaculture practices in India were worked out on annual basis 	 and the break-even analysis {{has been done}} to compute the price required at a given level of 	 production to cover all costs. While the shrimp-oriented aquaculture industry in India recorded 	 exceptional growth for the last three decades in spite of its high exposure to risk and uncertainties, 	 the farming/culture of various other species has not picked up to the expected level enabling the 	 optimum use of potential areas suitable for aquaculture. The break-even price for the tiger shrimp 	 through semi-intensive culture system is worked out at Rs. 161 /kg and Rs. 126 /kg by improved 	 extensive method, while it fetches market sales price of Rs. 350 to 400 /kg. White shrimp culture 	 is less risky and the break-even price worked out to Rs. 166 /kg in semi-intensive and Rs. 88 /kg 	 in improved extensive culture while it obtains market sales price of Rs. 300 - 350 /kg. Break-even 	 price of other farming systems like crab culture worked out to Rs. 107 /kg and crab fattening to 	 Rs. 173 /kg while the market sales price of crab is Rs. 250 /kg. In mussel culture, break-even 	 price worked out to Rs. 3. 35 /kg (market sales price Rs. 8 /kg) while that of seaweeds 	 (Gracilaria edulis) worked out to Rs. 7328 /tonne in dried form (market sales price of dried 	 seaweed is Rs. 6000 /tonne). The net profit varies for different systems of aquaculture from 	 Rs. 49, 060 /ha for traditional paddy cum prawn filtration system, Rs. 11. 15 lakh/ha for crab culture 	 and Rs. 14. 99 lakh/ha for crab fattening, Rs. 23. 94 lakh/ha for pearl culture, Rs. 9. 48 lakh/ha/ 	 year to Rs. 6. 03 lakh/ha/year for longline mussel culture in Karnataka and Kerala, Rs 1. 85 lakh/ 	 ha for <b>rack</b> and ren <b>culture</b> of edible oysters in Kerala and Rs. 0. 58 /ha for the rope culture of 	 Gracilaria edulis. The paper concludes that there is ample scope and feasibility for developing 	 an integrated approach in the aquaculture practices in India. Other development strategies 	 suggested for promoting aquaculture include introduction of legal framework for regulating all 	 the types of aquaculture, delineating effective marketing strategies and development of parallel 	 marketing avenues especially in the domestic market...|$|R
