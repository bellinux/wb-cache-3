50|$|A theorem due to Sidney Darlington {{states that}} any PR {{function}} Z(s) can be realised as a lossless two-port terminated {{in a positive}} resistor R. That is, regardless of how many resistors feature in the matrix Z representing the impedance network, a transform can be found that will realise the network entirely as an LC-kind network with just one resistor across the output port (which would normally represent the load). No resistors within the network are {{necessary in order to}} realise the specified response. Consequently, it is always possible to reduce 3-element-kind <b>2-port</b> <b>networks</b> to 2-element-kind (LC) <b>2-port</b> <b>networks</b> provided the output port is terminated in a resistance of the required value.|$|R
2500|$|The Scattering {{transfer}} parameters or T-parameters of a <b>2-port</b> <b>network</b> {{are expressed}} by the T-parameter matrix and {{are closely related to}} the corresponding S-parameter matrix. The T-parameter matrix is related to the incident and reflected normalised waves at each of the ports as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|The S-parameter matrix for the <b>2-port</b> <b>network</b> is {{probably}} the most commonly used and serves as the basic building block for generating the higher order matrices for larger networks. In this case the relationship between the reflected, incident power waves and the S-parameter matrix is given by: ...|$|R
5000|$|The RF Toolbox add-on to MATLAB {{and several}} books (for example [...] "Network {{scattering}} parameters") use this last definition, so caution is necessary. The [...] "From S to T" [...] and [...] "From T to S" [...] paragraphs {{in this article}} are based on the first definition. Adaptation to the second definition is trivial (interchanging T11 for T22, and T12 for T21).The advantage of T-parameters compared to S-parameters is that they may be used to readily determine the effect of cascading 2 or more <b>2-port</b> <b>networks</b> by simply multiplying the associated individual T-parameter matrices.

50|$|Symmetric <b>2-port</b> <b>networks</b> can be {{transformed}} into lattice networks using Bartlett's bisection theorem. The method is limited to symmetric networks but this includes many topologies commonly found in filters, attenuators and equalisers. The lattice topology is intrinsically balanced, there is no unbalanced counterpart to the lattice and it will usually require more components than the transformed network.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{impedance}} {{can be extended}} into the mechanical, and other domains through a mechanical-electrical analogy, hence the impedance parameters, {{and other forms of}} <b>2-port</b> <b>network</b> parameters, can be extended to the mechanical domain also. To do this an effort variable and a flow variable are made analogues of voltage and current respectively. For mechanical systems under translation these variables are force and velocity respectively.|$|R

5000|$|When {{discussing}} 4-terminal networks, {{network analysis}} often proceeds {{in terms of}} <b>2-port</b> <b>networks,</b> which covers {{a vast array of}} practically useful circuits. [...] "2-port", in essence, refers to the way the network has been connected to the outside world: that the terminals have been connected in pairs to a source or load. It is possible to take exactly the same network and connect it to external circuitry {{in such a way that}} it is no longer behaving as a 2-port. This idea is demonstrated in Figure 2.|$|R
25|$|As with S-parameters, T-parameters {{are complex}} values {{and there is}} a direct {{conversion}} between the two types. Although the cascaded T-parameters is a simple matrix multiplication of the individual T-parameters, the conversion for each network's S-parameters to the corresponding T-parameters and the conversion of the cascaded T-parameters back to the equivalent cascaded S-parameters, which are usually required, is not trivial. However once the operation is completed, the complex full wave interactions between all ports in both directions will be taken into account. The following equations will provide conversion between S and T parameters for <b>2-port</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Higher order S-parameters for {{pairs of}} {{dissimilar}} ports (...) , where [...] may be deduced similarly {{to those for}} <b>2-port</b> <b>networks</b> by considering pairs of ports in turn, in each case ensuring {{that all of the}} remaining (unused) ports are loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance. In this way the incident power wave for each of the unused ports becomes zero yielding similar expressions to those obtained for the 2-port case. S-parameters relating to single ports only (...) require all of the remaining ports to be loaded with an impedance identical to the system impedance therefore making all of the incident power waves zero except that for the port under consideration. In general therefore we have: ...|$|R
500|$|Darlington's insertion-loss {{method is}} a {{generalisation}} {{of the procedure}} used by Norton. In Norton's filter it can be shown that each filter is equivalent to a separate filter unterminated at the common end. Darlington's method applies to the more straightforward and general case of a <b>2-port</b> LC <b>network</b> terminated at both ends. The procedure consists of the following steps: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} {{equivalent}} circuits that a linear network {{can be transformed}} into is unbounded. Even in the most trivial cases {{this can be seen}} to be true, for instance, by asking how many different combinations of resistors in parallel are equivalent to a given combined resistor. The number of series and parallel combinations that can be formed grows exponentially with the number of resistors, n. For large n the size of the set has been found by numerical techniques to be approximately 2.53n and analytically strict bounds are given by a Farey sequence of Fibonacci numbers. [...] This article could never hope to be comprehensive, but there are some generalisations possible. Wilhelm Cauer found a transformation that could generate all possible equivalents of a given rational, passive, linear one-port, or in other words, any given two-terminal impedance. Transformations of 4-terminal, especially <b>2-port,</b> <b>networks</b> are also commonly found and transformations of yet more complex networks are possible.|$|R
50|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{essential}} {{parts of a}} typical <b>2-port</b> vector <b>network</b> analyzer (VNA). The two ports of the device under test (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The test port connectors provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable connector adaptors A1 and A2 respectively.|$|R
50|$|A 3-terminal network {{can also}} be used as a 2-port. To achieve this, one of the {{terminals}} is connected in common to one terminal of both ports. In other words, one terminal has been split into two terminals and the network has effectively been converted to a 4-terminal network. This topology is known as unbalanced topology and is opposed to balanced topology. Balanced topology requires, referring to Figure 3, that the impedance measured between terminals 1 and 3 is equal to the impedance measured between 2 and 4. This is the pairs of terminals not forming ports: the case where the pairs of terminals forming ports have equal impedance is referred to as symmetrical. Strictly speaking, any network that does not meet the balance condition is unbalanced, but the term is most often referring to the 3-terminal topology described above and in Figure 3. Transforming an unbalanced <b>2-port</b> <b>network</b> into a balanced network is usually quite straightforward: all series connected elements are divided in half with one half being relocated in what was the common branch. Transforming from balanced to unbalanced topology will often be possible with the reverse transformation but there are certain cases of certain topologies which cannot be transformed in this way. For example, see the discussion of lattice transforms below.|$|R
