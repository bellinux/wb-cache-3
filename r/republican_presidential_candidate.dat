5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a Whig household, Harrison {{initially}} favored that party's politics, but joined the Republican Party shortly after its formation in 1856 and campaigned on behalf of the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate,</b> John C.

5|$|Wyatt Cenac had {{a tumultuous}} tenure on the show, {{revealing}} in a July 2015 interview on WTF with Marc Maron, that his departure stemmed {{in part from}} a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about <b>Republican</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1868, Wilson toured the South giving political speeches. Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate.</b> Wilson, however, supported the Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant. During Reconstruction Grant supported Republican Congressional initiatives rather than President Johnson's, and during the dispute over the Tenure of Office Act which led to Johnson's impeachment, Grant served as temporary Secretary of War, but then returned the Department to Radical ally Edwin M. Stanton's control over Johnson's strong objection, making Grant a favorite to many Radicals.|$|E

5|$|The post-war years {{also saw}} the News-Miner {{take a more active}} role in {{territorial}} politics. Prior to the 1948 election, Lathrop believed <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Thomas Dewey would handily defeat Democratic incumbent Harry Truman. To take advantage of the anticipated governmental shift, Lathrop instructed the News-Miner to ramp up its pro-Republican editorials. In order to assist that process, he appointed William Strand, a war correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, as the News-Miner's new editor. Though Truman won the 1948 election, the News-Miner stayed politically active in endorsing Republican candidates and issues. This ended only with Lathrop's death on July 26, 1950.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to the}} campaign of the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate,</b> former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver {{grew up on}} the Iowa frontier, and was {{involved}} with the Republican Party from its early days in the late 1850s. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the Union Army. Weaver saw action at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, and Resaca, and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. After the war, he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics. Weaver sought nomination to the House of Representatives and the Governorship, but each time was defeated by candidates from the party's more conservative faction, led by William B. Allison. He campaigned for the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention as an observer.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite {{the bitterness of}} the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate</b> in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E
5|$|Republican {{president}} Dwight D. Eisenhower convinced John Sherman Cooper, {{a former}} senator and ambassador who was immensely popular in Kentucky, to challenge Wetherby, hoping his {{presence on the}} ticket would aid his own re-election bid. In the Republican primary, voters chose Thruston B. Morton to challenge Clements. With two of his factional enemies as candidates for the Senate, Governor Chandler bolted the party and supported the Republican candidates. Further complicating Clements' campaign {{was the fact that}} Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956, and as majority whip, Clements had to spend much of his time in Washington, D.C. covering Johnson's duties in the Senate. What time he was in Kentucky was usually devoted to Wetherby's campaign, since the Democrats believed Clements would be re-elected easily while Wetherby faced much stiffer odds. These factors, combined with the landslide of support for Eisenhower, the <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>candidate,</b> contributed to the defeat of both Wetherby and Clements. Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes, while Clements lost to Morton by a margin of 7,000 votes out of more than 1 million that were cast in the election. It was Clements' first defeat for elected office in a career that spanned thirty years.|$|E
