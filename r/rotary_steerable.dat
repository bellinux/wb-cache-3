A simply supported beam model is generally used to research bit side force for point-the-bit RSS tools. The greatest advantage is simplification {{in the analysis of}} the bit side force. However, for the side force solution on a point to the bit conditions, the existing literature ignore that this {{drilling tool}} system has an outward extended distance. Otherwise the bit in contact with the well wall will form a new support. According to the situation, a point to the bit tool has an outward extended distance; if we ignore this extended distance, and simplify it or just take it as the reaction force of the tool lower bearing support, or side force of the bit a great inaccuracy error will result. Because the beam has an outward extended distance related to the real bit side force, we need more research in this area.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} {{a general}} class of stationary trajectories for deep boreholes drilled using rotary systems. These solutions correspond to helical wells twisting around a vertical axis, which can degenerate into straight or circular boreholes; they arise when the forces {{acting on the}} bit, and thus the penetrations of the bit into the rock, are invariant in a basis attached to the bit. Under these stationary conditions, the deformed configuration of the bottomhole assembly (the {{lower part of the}} drillstring) is also invariant. The paper formulates the equations governing these equilibrium solutions from considerations involving the interaction between the bit and the rock, but also between the bottomhole assembly and the borehole through the contact points at the stabilizers and at the <b>rotary</b> <b>steerable</b> system (the tool used to steer the bit). It is shown that the stationary solutions are completely defined by four parameters characterizing the geometry of the wellbore: two at the scale of the bottomhole assembly (the curvature and inclination of the helical axis), and two at the scale of the bit (the bit tilts, proxies for the borehole diameter). The key dimensionless parameters that control the directional response of the drilling system are finally identified, as well as the critical values of some parameters at which a pathological change in the response takes place...|$|E

In this work, we address the problem of real time control of autonomous RSS with unknown formation friction and rock strength. The work presents an online control scheme for real time optimization of drilling parameters to maximize rate of penetration and minimize the deviation from the planned well bore trajectory, stick-slip oscillations, and bit wear. Nonlinear model for the drilling operation was developed using energy balance equation, where rock specific energy is used to calculate the minimum power required for a given rate of penetration.

40|$|This thesis proposes and evaluates {{a concept}} for {{downhole}} depth estimation by matching subsurface measurements from two sensors in a bottom hole assembly. The {{application of a}} downhole depth estimate in automated subsurface navigation has also been demonstrated. One of the key hurdles in achieving real time subsurface navigation lies in communication bottom neck between surface and downhole. Modern measurement while drilling and logging while drilling tools measure all vital information downhole except depth. Real time availability of depth estimate in the downhole can open new doors for real time automated bit steering and optimization in well drilling operations. The downhole depth estimation concept introduced in this thesis is based on correlation of gamma ray responses from two sensors to estimate average rate of penetration at the bit. This average rate of penetration of the bit is used to estimate distance travelled by the bit. An algorithm is proposed for correlation of gamma ray sensor response. Various parameters in the algorithm are investigated and discussed in detail for optimized performance. The error in the estimation {{is a result of}} difference between average and instantaneous rate of penetration as well as wrong correlation. Synthetic sensor response is created from a gamma ray data set to evaluate the algorithm for different noise levels and count rates. The error in estimated depth due to difference between average and instantaneous rate of penetration is approximately 2. 2 %. The total error is observed to be less than 4 % for lower statistical noise levels. To reduce the error associated with proposed system, a nuclear marker - detector system is proposed and evaluated using Monte Carlo based nuclear simulations.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2013. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor:Emmanuel Detournay. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 125 pages, appendices A-E. The dynamical model governing the 3 D kinematics of a drill bit is constructed for rotary drilling applications {{for which the}} bit is guided by a push-the-bit <b>rotary</b> <b>steerable</b> system. The evolution of the bit trajectory, and thus of the borehole geometry, {{is a consequence of}} the interaction between the borehole, a geometric object, and the drilling structure, a mechanical object. In this respect, the model describing this evolution consists of the association between (i) a model of the near-bit region of the drillstring, (ii) a model of the bit/rock interaction, and (iii) kinematic relationships relating the motion of the bit into the rock to geometric variables for the borehole evolution. The mathematical formulation of these three elements yields a set of functional differential equations with secular terms accounting for a delayed influence of the borehole geometry on the bit trajectory. The parameters entering these relations account for the loads and properties of the drilling structure and for the properties of the bit and rock formation. Three length scales are identified in the response of the directional drilling system; they correspond to short-, intermediate-, and long-range behaviors. The short-range response is associated with the dimensions of the bit, the small scale of the problem. It corresponds to fast variations of the bit orientation. On the intermediate-range, the wellbore trajectory converges to a quasi-constant curvature solution, if it is stable. On the long-range, the borehole curvature slowly varies and for appropriate set of drilling parameters the borehole converges toward a stationary helical path. Finally, the stability and rate of convergence on the intermediate and long range are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Oil and gas are global fuels {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} drilling wells in underground terrestrial reservoirs. Vertical drilling is preferred {{because of its}} simplicity and therefore low cost, but subsurface targets can often be procured only by directing the wellbore along predefined non-vertical trajectories. For instance, directional drilling must be employed to reach locations inaccessible to the drilling rig, to side track an existing well (multilateral drilling), or to drill multiple wells from the same offshore platform (horizontal drilling). Approach: A complete knowledge of the wellbore direction and orientation during the drilling process is essential to guarantee proper directional drilling procedure. Results: Thus, besides the conventional drilling assembly, directional drilling operations require sensors to provide azimuth, inclination and toolface angles of the drill. These sensors {{are part of the}} Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tool, which in current technology is installed several feet behind the drill bit. In such systems, values for inclination and toolface angles are determined from accelerometer measurements at predetermined stationary surveying stations; these values are then incorporated with magnetometer measurements to deliver the azimuth angle. Values for inclination and azimuth angles at the current surveying station are combined with those from the previous station to compute the position of the probe. However, there is no accurate information about the wellbore trajectory between survey stations. Additionally, the magnetic field of the magnetometers has deleterious effect on the overall accuracy of surveying measurements. Conclusion: A method to provide continuous information about the wellbore trajectory has been developed in this study. The module developed integrates a <b>Rotary</b> <b>Steerable</b> System (RSS) and MWD tool into one drilling probe utilizing Inertial Navigation System (INS) technology.

40|$|Elastomeric {{diaphragms}} {{are used}} in the Smart Stabilizer/Weatherford <b>rotary</b> <b>steerable</b> systems (RSS) used in directional drilling down hole. The diaphragms need to operate correctly for the RSS to function effectively. The diaphragm separates the mechanical parts of the RSS, operating in hydraulic oil, from the outside environment. Failure of the diaphragm can lead to failure elsewhere in the RSS. Such failure is likely to have catastrophic consequences for the RSS and, associated with these, very high costs. The diaphragms are subjected to hostile conditions including high temperature and high pressure and the presence of chemical agents. Moreover, monitoring of the behaviour of the diaphragm in service is extremely difficult {{due to the nature of}} a drilling process. There is, however, a need for understanding the behaviour and failure mechanisms of such diaphragms; especially with plans to extend the depth of the drilling borehole. In this PhD project an outline design guide is developed for failure avoidance of the diaphragm down hole. Besides proposing an outline for such a design guide and identifying hypothetical modes of failure, detailed analyses of the normal behaviour of the diaphragm down hole and the failure due to fracture are also performed. A large part of the project is focused on gaining understanding of the normal behaviour of the diaphragm down hole. This is identified as being of a great importance in failure avoidance. Analytical, numerical and physical methods are employed here to allow for prediction of such behaviour. Those are supported by forensic examination of used diaphragms. Mechanisms of failure leading to fracture are proposed. Crack growth is investigated via the strain energy release rate approach. Three “ingredients” for failure are examined in the context of the conditions down hole: stress/strain characteristics, crack growth rate as a function of the strain energy release rate (including catastrophic tearing) and intrinsic flaw size or cut.

The well trajectories are designed in Compass, hydraulic as well as torque and drag programs are simulated in WellPlan, the casing designs are built in WellCat in order to check the safety of the well models and find critical results, which can threaten the operations. Furthermore, the risks in sidetracking and drilling operations are revealed and assessed based on the field experiences, where the risk levels are also reduced to the acceptable degree. The observations of this research study indicate that the experience transfer is usually running smoothly in the same field. However, it is difficult to share the learned lessons among the different fields. Therefore, drilling organizations should be eager to incorporate and establish a simulator/experience transfer system that stores all industry standards and experiences in one database. In addition, the experience transfer system should have the capability to integrate with currently available software package in the company, which will make the system more user-friendly to find relevant standards and experiences. Obviously, there will be challenges to find appropriate information out of the huge database in the experience transfer system. Thus, the system should have the well-organized search mechanism, which is another research study of this topic...|$|E
40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is {{developed for the}} nonlinear-static, linearized-dynamic, and fully nonlinear-dynamic behavior of drillstrings in arbitrary wellbore profiles. The formulation {{is based on a}} three-dimensional nonlinear finite beam element and accounts for the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, geometric nonlinearity (large displacement, small strain), automatic determination of wellbore contact points, friction acting between the drillstring and the wellbore, stabilizer clearance, three-dimensional wellbore profiles, added fluid mass and damping effects from the hydrodynamic forces generated between the drillstring and surrounding fluid, complex tool geometry (including steerable mud motors, <b>rotary</b> <b>steerable</b> systems, and eccentric stabilizers/components), shear beam deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects. The resulting model is numerically validated through comparisons with analytical formulas and previous nonlinear models, showing that it can readily be applied {{to a wide range of}} drilling engineering problems and used for practical analysis. Additionally, individual contributions of shear deformations, lateral rotary inertias, and gyroscopic effects are definitively shown to be insignificant when calculating the static and dynamic behavior of horizontal drilling assemblies within the rotational speed range of most drilling applications. An initial comparison with field data is also provided, which shows the practicality of the developed algorithms in predicting the characteristics of real drilling scenarios. The model is then adjusted and applied to the specific case of inducing lateral vibrations in unconventional horizontal wells. It is proposed that exciting a lateral resonance in the drill pipe lying on the low side of a horizontal wellbore can induce enough movement to help overcome parasitic axial drag acting on a drillstring. This, in turn, would help to increase weight transfer to the bit while slide-drilling with a steerable mud motor in long lateral sections of a wellbore. The change in this lateral resonant behavior due to variations in weight-on-bit (WOB), inclination, well path curvature, wellbore diameter, fluid properties, and tubular dimensions are clearly shown through linearized-dynamic sensitivity studies. Nonlinear time-domain simulations are also performed to better understand the limitations of linearized-dynamic modeling and to provide a more detailed assessment of how inducing lateral vibration influences the WOB while drilling. It is shown that induced lateral vibrations provide a noticeable dynamic WOB of up to ? 250 lbf about the static value, and a slight increase in the average WOB value of up to 150 lbf. The effects on WOB are dependent on the excitation frequency of the induced lateral vibrations, with the greatest benefits being seen at resonant conditions...|$|E
40|$|Blowouts {{are one of}} {{the biggest}} threats during {{exploration}} and production of oil and gas. Losing control of a well can lead to severe consequences both economically, environmentally and put the working crew in danger. There are several blowout contingency methods which allow to regain control of the well. Last resort method is to drill one or more relief wells, intersect with the blowing well and perform a dynamic kill procedure. While relief well drilling and killing a blowing well through it is a quite well-developed concept, there are some scenarios that require a different approach. Such scenario would be when the reservoir lays very shallow below the seabed. In that case, regardless whether it is an appraisal well or producer that gets the blowout, it cannot be killed through a relief well of usual S-shaped trajectory because the depth is too small to drill such well. Such situation requires a novel relief well design approach and needs to be addressed. In this Thesis, a real-life shallow reservoir scenario located on a Barents Sea has been presented and carefully evaluated. For this scenario, 2 relief well surface locations have been chosen and a novel, Ushaped relief well trajectory has been proposed. The trajectory has been calculated and the entire situation has been presented in modelling software such as 3 Ddrill and Landmark COMPASS. Later, casing design for the relief well has been proposed based on already existing concept of a horizontal well designed for this particular location. Possible challenges associated with such relief well trajectory design have been presented and discussed. The U-shaped relief well will suffer from several obstacles that would need to be overcome, such as difficulties in cuttings transport or reduced Weight on Bit due to well friction and high well inclination. As the process of localizing, tracking and intersection will differ strongly from the typical approach in S-shaped relief wells, potential challenges will also may occur on that stage. For some of those difficulties, potential solutions have been proposed and discussed. Relief well should be drilled with <b>Rotary</b> <b>Steerable</b> System. Process of localizing and tracking could be performed with the use of such technologies as Casing Premagnetization and Surface Seismic While Drilling. To design the intersection, the approach utilized on Montara Blowout can be used. The blowing well can be bypassed, its casing can then be located and the intersection could happen in following approaches from sidetracks. The design proposed in this Thesis is only a conceptand to prove its feasibility further development is needed. Recommendations for future work include modelling of the drilling process, for example torque & drag calculations or drilling parameters calculations. Also, if the geological scenario is available, detailed casing design could be calculated and proposed. Dynamic kill procedure modelling with such tools as OLGA Software would be also a very interesting topic to cover...|$|E
3000|$|With the {{technological}} development for unconventional {{oil and natural}} gas productions, the numbers of horizontal and three-dimensional multi-target directional wells have increased significantly (Ozkan et al. 2011; Jia et al. 2014; Orem et al. 2014). Drilling equipment not only needs to meet requirements for desired drilling trajectory, but also needs to work reliably in more complex stratum and harsher operating conditions, which presents significant challenges on the drilling technology (John et al. 2000; Kaiser and Yu 2015; Ikonnikova et al. 2015). In recent decades, <b>rotary</b> <b>steerable</b> systems (RSS) have developed very rapidly, in their capability to provide continuous rotation, constant steering, and smoother boreholes (Weijermans et al. 2001; Drummond et al. 2007; Hakam et al. 2014). RSS ensure steering the borehole when drill string is rotating, and are usually used together with a logging while drilling (LWD) system. Geological parameters are analyzed in real time, and then precise control of the directional trajectory is achieved based on geological conditions (Haugen 1998; Tribe et al. 2001; Torsvoll et al. 2010). So far, Schlumberger’s PowerDrive, Baker Hughes’ AutoTrak, and Halliburton’s Geo-Pilot have been the main representative technologies (Stuart et al. 2000; Tribe et al. 2001; Bian et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014). RSS can be divided into static bias and dynamic bias according to different bias units and can also be divided into push-the-bit and point-the-bit approaches according to different directing principles. PowerDrive and AutoTrak belong to “push-the-bit,” while Geo-Pilot belongs to “point-the-bit” type. PowerDrive is of dynamic bias, while AutoTrak is of static bias (Schaaf 2000; Fontenot et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2014). This article focuses on three static push-the-bit (RSSTSP) like AutoTrak systems. RSSTSP have three stretching pads, which press against the well bore thereby causing the bit to press on the opposite side resulting in a direction change (Niu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014, Marck and Detournay 2016). Steering control algorithm {{plays an important role in}} any RSSTSP, and a robust control algorithm is the key factor to achieve the desired control effects (Seifabad and Ehteshami 2013; Hakam et al. 2014; Kremers et al. 2015).Because many of these techniques are not available to the public, the research papers for control algorithm for RSSTSP are very few in the published literature. Zhang and Yu analyzed the configuration and deviation principle of RSSSTP (Zhang 2000). Cheng and Jiang studied control method, using biasing displacement vector (Cheng et al. 2010). Du and Liu studied multi-solution and uncertainty for controlling three pad forces. Models were established with two pads and adapted to adjust and control magnitude and orientation of steering force vector, and another pad extended to wellbore without force (Du et al. 2008). Due to non-unique solutions, Li et al. (2015) proposed to use three pads working at the same time, where one pad force should have a maximum or minimum value determined by relative position of pad and steering forces. The aforementioned papers mainly deal with how to calculate steering force. However, vibrations, stability, and durability were not considered. Therefore, based on the structure and work process of RSSTSP, this work develops mechanical and mathematical models for the steering force and pad force. A new control algorithm is developed considering factors of steerability, stability, durability, “favorable area,” and “unfavorable area.” [...]...|$|E
