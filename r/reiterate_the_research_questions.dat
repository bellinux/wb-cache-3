30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{interview}} data, the FGI transcript was coded with an eye to <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> Coding in qualitative data is roughly identical to identifying underlying factors in quantitative data, in that both are procedures to reduce a {{large volume of}} data into {{a limited number of}} manageable chunks (Murray 2009). In this study, data reduction (coding) was guided by <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> in that we were looking for clues to the twin themes of barriers to LAR and teachers’ professional competencies in language assessment. In so doing, we read the transcribed versions of the FGI and took note of anything related to the themes of concern in <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> Yet, we did not shut the door on new salient themes, which were not directly relevant to <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> To enhance <b>the</b> credibility of coding, each of us coded the data independently and discrepancies were resolved through discussion.|$|R
30|$|In Sam’s class, 12 {{groups of}} {{students}} formulated their <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> during <b>the</b> peer-critique activity.
