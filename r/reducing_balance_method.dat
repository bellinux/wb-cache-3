40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a rationale for}} modelling physical depreciation under uncertainty and compares two variants of it. The first variant leads to a model, the 'gamma' model which has been discussed in the literature, while the second variant leads to a model, the 'binomial' model, {{which has not been}} investigated before. The binomial model is shown to approach a deterministic limit (the <b>reducing</b> <b>balance</b> <b>method)</b> as the depreciated asset becomes infinitely divisible. In contrast it has been demonstrated in the literature that the gamma model approaches a particular statistical distribution under these circumstances. The paper goes on to investigate the useful lives of assets under the two models, by reporting results on waiting times, none of which have appeared in the literature before.

40|$|Matrix-implicit Krylov-subspace {{methods have}} made it {{possible}} to efficiently compute the periodic steady-state of large circuits using either the time-domain shooting-Newton method or the frequencydomain harmonic <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b> However, the harmonic <b>balance</b> <b>methods</b> are not so efficient at computing steady-state solutions with rapid transitions, and the low-order integration methods typically used with shooting-Newton methods are not so efficient when high accuracy is required. In this paper we describe a Time-Mapped Harmonic <b>Balance</b> <b>method</b> (TMHB), a fast Krylovsubspace spectral method that overcomes the inefficiency of standard harmonic balance in the case of rapid transitions. TMHB features a non-uniform grid to resolve the sharp features in the signals. Results on several examples demonstrate that the TMHB method achieves several orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy compared to the standard harmonic <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b> The TMHB method is also several times faster than the standard harmonic <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> in reaching identical solution accuracy. ...|$|R

This method is called optimal-transition voltage <b>balancing</b> <b>method.</b> The {{selection of the}} optimal transition sequence is performed by minimizing a cost function and the transitions {{that would result in}} more switchings of the converter semiconductor devices are avoided.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical discussion comparing the traditional method and a newly proposed <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> to calculate percent recovery of fertilizer P applied to soils. The traditional difference method {{is defined as}} P uptake from the soil treated with fertilizer P minus P uptake from a control with no P added divided {{by the amount of}} fertilizer P applied. The <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> simply considers the ratio of P uptake from the P fertilized soil to the amount of fertilizer P applied and does not use a control to discount P taken up from soil without fertilizer application. The percentage recovery of fertilizer P calculated by the difference method normally ranges from 10 to 25 % for a given crop in a given season and is always lower than that by the <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> which ranges from 50 to 90 % and is sometimes over 100 %. The <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> is inappropriate to calculate percentage recovery of current fertilizer P applied due to its overestimation and the invalidity of the mathematical equation used. The difference method is superior to the <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> to estimate percentage recovery of fertilizer P applied. The <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> is suitable for determining a percent soil P balance to evaluate if fertilizer P applications are building up, depleting, or maintaining soil P reserves. S. H.

This method relies on Fourier analysis to derive an efficient alternative to classical time marching schemes for such flows.
