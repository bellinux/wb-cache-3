40|$|Lay {{perceptions}} {{and experiences of}} social location have been commonly framed with reference to social class. However, complex responses to, and ambivalence over, class categories have raised interesting analytic questions relating to how sociological concepts are operationalized in empirical research. For example, prior researchers have argued that processes of class dis-identification signify moral unease {{with the nature of}} classed inequalities, yet dis-identification may also in part reflect a poor fit between 'social class' as a category {{and the ways in which}} people accord meaning to, and evaluate, their related experiences of socio-economic inequality. Differently framed questions about social comparison, aligned more closely with people's own terms of <b>reference,</b> <b>offer</b> an interesting alternative avenue for exploring subjective experiences of inequality. This paper explores some of these questions through an analysis of new empirical data, generated in the context of recession. In the analysis reported here, class identification was common. Nevertheless, whether or not people self identified in class terms, class relevant issues were perceived and described in highly diverse ways, and lay views on class revealed it to be a very aggregated as well as multifaceted construct. It is argued that it enables a particular, not general, perspective on social comparison. The paper therefore goes on to examine how study participants compared themselves with familiar others, identified by themselves. The evidence illuminates social positioning in terms of constraint, agency and (for some) movement, and offers insight into very diverse experiences of inequality, through the comparisons that people made. Their comparisons are situated, and pragmatic, accounts of the material contexts in which people live their lives. Linked evaluations are circumscribed and strongly tied to these proximate material contexts. The paper draws out implications for theorizing lay perspectives on class, and subjective experiences of inequality...|$|E
40|$|As a {{genomic disease}} cancer {{is unique in}} that the entire genome can be highly unstable, with new {{mutations}} accumulating at a rapid rate and massive alterations to the chromosomal structure. Structural aberrations can be highly significant to a patient’s disease, resulting in aberrant proteins that can drive a cancer to progress faster or metastasize. Such aberrations may also have more subtle effects, enabling the cellular population to more rapidly develop drug resistance or simply generate highly diverse populations within a tumor making targeted therapies less effective. In fact it is these diverse or heterogeneous cellular populations, with highly mutated and frequently structurally aberrant genomes, that make understanding the extent of a tumor genome’s variation so challenging. Large scale sequencing efforts through the Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Cancer Genome Consortium have sequenced thousands of cancer genomes, and while small-scale variants have enabled researchers to begin to trace the evolutionary history and diversity of tumor genomes, large-scale structural variations have continued {{to be difficult to}} identify. Current methods and technologies for short-read sequencing generally rely on fitting genomes to a single reference assembly that is assumed to be representative of all individuals. Tumor genomes, which consist of heterogeneous cellular populations with unique aberrations can vary significantly from a ‘normal’ genome. This means that such single references are poor representations of a cancerous cell population, and so methods that rely less directly on the <b>reference</b> <b>offer</b> better opportunities to investigate these aberrations. In this project, a new method for large-scale structural variant identification, called MultiSieve, is proposed. This method uses prior knowledge to generate and test multiple references for each patient genome. Validation using simulated data establishes the utility of the method, and a comparison with commonly used methods demonstrates that MultiSieve is capable of finding variations often missed by traditional methods and that there {{are likely to be more}} structural variants in patients than have been identified previously...|$|E
