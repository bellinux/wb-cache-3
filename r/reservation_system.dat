40|$|In the {{technical}} track {{of a new}} remote labs project called Labs on line, {{we will look at}} the linking of two <b>reservation</b> <b>systems</b> for remote labs. Instead of integrating both systems into one new system we are exploring possibilities of designing a generic interface for remote lab <b>reservation</b> <b>systems.</b> By using this approach organizations will be able to keep and manage their own <b>reservation</b> <b>systems</b> while linking them with the labs of other organizations. This is a very flexible and scalable solution, both from a technological point of view as from an organizational point of view. Individual implementations can thus be customized and integrated with other systems without affecting existing <b>reservation</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E
5|$|Norway Airlines lost NOK32 to 33 {{million in}} 1991. Norway Airlines {{replaced}} its two 737-300 aircraft with two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft leased from Transwede, one MD-83 and one MD-87. For {{the owners of}} the Boeing aircraft the move meant that they had to find a new lessee in a marketed where leasing prices had fallen from US$250,000 to US$150–180,000 per month. An interlining agreement was signed by Norway Airlines in March with British Airways and 25 other airlines at Gatwick. Norway Airlines announced on 15 March that it would take over the 25 Sterling employees in Norway in October. TransNordic Group started negotiations in June with Braathens SAFE, Maersk Air and Conair of Scandinavia for them to join the alliance. Prior to the roll-out of Amadeus <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> in July 1992, Norway Airlines had not been included in the default searched of travel agents, who had to phone the airline to get a price quote.|$|E
25|$|The early {{standalone}} computerised <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> {{began its}} operation at Secunderabad in July 1989. But, {{with the introduction}} of the Computerized Passenger <b>Reservation</b> <b>System</b> (PRS) at Secunderabad Station by SCR, from 30 September 1989, the rail reservations at Secunderabad were made easy. This system was later linked to New Delhi, Howrah, Mumbai and Chennai in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 1999 respectively. This version was before the CONCERT system of reservation was developed to interconnect the stations. CONCERT was developed at Secunderabad in September 1994 but the first prototype of the CONCERT passenger <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> was not implemented at the station until January 1995.|$|E
