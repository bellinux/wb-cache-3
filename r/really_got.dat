5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie <b>really</b> <b>got</b> into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four. The visitors' reply never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> going, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.|$|E

One night, when Guy could not do a certain date, he suggested that Martin's band could fill in for him. The band did very well and that's how Martin's career <b>really</b> <b>got</b> started. But the band broke up and he did not form a permanent band until 1931 at the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|Modigliani's {{connection}} with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli {{was not only a}} Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint en plein air, but Modigliani never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.|$|E
25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not a}} real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she <b>really</b> <b>got</b> into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E
25|$|A {{slow start}} by openers Rajin Saleh and Javed Omar cost the Bangladeshis dearly in this warm-up match against {{a side of}} Sri Lankan fringe players at Moratuwa, along with an {{inability}} to take wickets. The pair added 59 for the first wicket, but never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> off the mark, and when Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran dismissed Omar and Aftab Ahmed in quick succession things looked tricky. The other Bangladeshis were forced to hit out quickly, and two run outs followed as a result. In the end, it was the experienced all-rounders Mohammad Rafique and Khaled Mashud who ensured that Bangladesh set a somewhat competitive target of 236. However, Avishka Gunawardene and Upul Tharanga both made centuries, the Bangladeshi bowlers were thoroughly hit around, and the Sri Lankans {{made their way to}} 236 for 0 in just 36.1 overs of the 50 possible. To add injury to insult, Mashrafe Mortaza suffered a back spasm and was ruled out of the first ODI.|$|E

25|$|As in the {{previous}} year's event, {{the battle for the}} win was between the title contenders Mikko Hirvonen of Ford and Sébastien Loeb of Citroën. Although Loeb proved faster on the opening super special stage, Hirvonen took the lead when the rally <b>really</b> <b>got</b> underway on Friday, and began building up a lead by about a second per stage. Loeb backed off and settled for second after damaging a tyre and losing 13 seconds on SS15. Hirvonen's win was his first in his home event, after finishing runner-up to Marcus Grönholm in 2007 and to Loeb in 2008. Jari-Matti Latvala, who suffered from food poisoning on day two, passed Dani Sordo to take his first podium in his home event. Petter Solberg also looked set to challenge for a podium place, but suffered a puncture and then went wide and got stuck in a ditch right {{at the end of the}} fourth stage.|$|E
25|$|As {{the tournament}} moved to Sharjah, Zalmi's first game against Quetta Gladiators was {{abandoned}} after repeated showers {{and the two}} teams shared the points from the bout. Following this, against Islamabad United, the Zalmis lost a hard-fought game that {{went down to the}} last ball. After being put in to bat by United, Zalmi could only manage a below-par score of 137 and never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> going. But the team's bowlers bowled exceedingly well to make a contest out of it. In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Zalmis continued their losing streak after being beaten by Karachi Kings in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69–6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, they couldn't see the game through as the Zalmis fell short by 9 runs.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} good start, 2 {{consecutive}} defeats against Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham and the West Indies at The Oval in London followed, {{and with other}} results going Australia's and the West Indies' way, India were once again staring at another early exit from the World Cup. Trevor Chappell scored 110 to ensure that Australia scored a mammoth 320/9, with India dishing out a listless bowling performance. Only Kapil bowled well, taking a 5-wicket haul (5/43). Australian medium-pacer Ken MacLeay took 6/39 as India were bowled all out for just 150, losing by 162 runs, {{with none of the}} Indian batsmen contributing. Against the West Indies, India, chasing 283 to win, never <b>really</b> <b>got</b> going despite Amarnath's patient knock (80 from 139 balls). A combined effort from the West Indian pace attack saw India crash to 216 all out, losing by 66 runs. To add to India's woes, Vengsarkar was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} tournament after a Malcolm Marshall bouncer injured his jaw. To reach the semifinals now, India had to beat Zimbabwe and Australia by huge margins, a daunting prospect. Should India lose even one of the matches, they would be knocked out of the tournament.|$|E
