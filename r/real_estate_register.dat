40|$|THE ABSTRACT This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} of filing legal relations and other data to real estates with recording these legal relations and other data in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>register,</b> included some problems which are in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>register</b> incident and incurred while keeping the real estate register's state of filing in accordance with reality. To better realization of a generic context, especially for comprehension of the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>register</b> principles and recent state of filed data in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>register,</b> there is also the historical evolution of registering the real estate in this thesis mentioned. It is difficult to understand some specific problems without knowledge of history because these problems result from former methods of registering the real estate and legal relations to them. Great attention is paid to keeping the state of filing in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>register</b> in accordance with reality that is why the illustrations of some particular cases and examples are shown. This was led by effort to connect theoretical principles with their practical use, the major model situations were assumed from the experience of Klatovy Real Estate Register's employees.

40|$|The {{need to set}} up {{condominium}} arose {{with the}} beginning of mass construction of multi-apartment buildings. In Slovenia, condominium has been governed by law since the middle of the 20 th century. The integral system is quite complex and is today regulated within two basic registers i. e. land register and cadaster of buildings. The registration of condominium into public <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>registers</b> in Slovenia has been systematically regulated since 1976, when the E-book i. e. the book of condominium was set up on the basis of The Law on the Rights of parts of buildings (Official Gazette of RS, Nos. 19 / 76). Since 1976 until today, legal changes in this field have been followed and tracked. They have been changing the regulations of data registration into <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>registers</b> on the procedure as well as data level. The aim of these legislation changes was to achieve sufficient legal security of condominium owners and to simplify <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market service. However, these two aims might also exclude each other. Therefore, each legislation change has brought simplifications for <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market services on one hand and new demands for higher legal security of condominium owners on the other. In the introductory part of this diploma paper, the concept of condominium is explained. Additionally, the demands which are laid down by laws and executive acts regulating this field since 1976 onward are given. The results of condominium registrations into public registers in the past {{on the basis of the}} then valid legislation are the contents of these public registers still today. Therefore, to understand the data referring to buildings, it is important to know in which time period they were constructed and how these changes are recognized by accessing public <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>registers</b> today. On the basis of the sample of more than a hundred examined buildings, which were <b>registered</b> in public <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>registers</b> in different time periods, the trust rate has been determined for the key data. Additionally, the average trust rate for the data registered on the basis of certain legislation was calculated. The aim of this paper is to establish how the trust rate for certain data changes according to the different time periods of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> registration and when certain condominium can be considered in compliance with regulations. On the basis of the sample and legislation, the lowest trust rate has been determined, which still provides sufficient legal security to condominium owners as well as simple <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market service. The percentage shall set the limit which shows whether certain condominium ownership has been finalized...|$|R
