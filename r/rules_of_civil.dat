5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E

25|$|Equity {{courts were}} widely distrusted {{in the northeastern}} US {{following}} the American Revolution.

40|$|Although {{created to}} {{encourage}} settlement, few rules have generated more collateral litigation than Florida’s proposals for settlement provisions. While Florida Statutes section 768. 79 creates a substantive right to attorney’s fees, Florida <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure 1. 442 provides a procedural enforcement mechanism. However, through its unprecedented application of strict construction to a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> procedure, the Florida Supreme Court has arguably {{made it more}} difficult to accomplish settlement by adding new requirements for valid proposals. Thus, with collateral litigation looming over proposals for settlement, burdening court dockets, and costing parties additional time and expense, {{now is the time to}} realign the court’s interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Rule</b> 1. 442 with the legislature’s intent to facilitate settlements...|$|R

25|$|Federal {{cases and}} some states follow Federal Rule 27 (a) (3) of the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure {{concerning}} {{the production of}} documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions.

25|$|Poole v.

The plaintiffs in the case were granted title to property improperly conveyed {{by the state of}} Tennessee north of this border.

25|$|Examples {{of common}} law being {{replaced}} by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most {{but not all of}} the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure in the 1930s and the Federal Rules of Evidence in the 1970s).

25|$|This {{allowed for}} {{representative}} suits {{in situations where}} {{there were too many}} individual parties (which now forms the first requirement for class action litigation, numerosity). However, this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties, which rendered the rule ineffective. Within ten years, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 48 in such a way so that it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances, but only by ignoring the plain meaning of the rule. In the rules published in 1912, Equity Rule 48 was replaced with Equity Rule 38 as part of a major restructuring of the Equity Rules, and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in 1938, Equity Rule 38 became Rule 23 of the Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure.|$|E
25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E

Previously, under the standard the Court set forth in Conley v. Gibson, a complaint need only state a [...] "conceivable" [...] set of facts to support its legal claims—that is, that a court could only dismiss a claim if it appeared, beyond a doubt, that the plaintiff {{would be able to}} prove no set of facts in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief. In Twombly, the court adopted a more strict, [...] "plausibility" [...] standard, requiring in this case [...] "enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement".|$|R

Particular attention was drawn to the draft Constitution of the Russian Orthodox Church, designed by the decision of the Presidium of the Jubilee Committee Archbishop Kirill I of Smolensk and Viazemsky (Gundyaeva). The project charter had been previously reviewed and approved by the permanent members of the Holy Synod of January 22, 1988, the editorial committee and the Bureau of the Jubilee Commission on March 14, and the plenum of the Jubilee Committee on March 26. Arhipastyri made a number of amendments. The draft charter was also presented to the Council for Religious Affairs of the USSR Council of Ministers, which stated that the project is not contrary to the charter of the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> law and can be used in the Soviet Union.

500|$|Seven {{years after}} the Santosky decision, the United States Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that Santosky's higher burden of proof is an {{exception}} to the [...] "conventional <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> litigation [...] that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence." [...] The Court later extended Santoskys finding of governmental interest in [...] "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child" [...] when it held in Reno v. Flores that children with no available guardians may be held in custody pending deportation hearings. In 2000, the right of parents to choose how to raise their child, one of the main constitutional interests at issue in Santosky, was affirmed in Troxel v. Granville when the Court struck down a Washington law that allowed for third parties to petition for visitation rights over parental objections. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens rebutted the assumption of Santosky that interests of the parent and the interests of the child do not diverge, arguing that [...] "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room for States to consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by {{the best interests of the}} child." ...|$|E
