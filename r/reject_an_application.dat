5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} two Offices is that the EPO will in general accept that any patent application relating to a computer-implemented method is [...] "an invention", whereas the UKPO will <b>reject</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> on the basis that it does not describe [...] "an invention" [...] if the only contribution provided by the inventor is a computer program. The EPO instead only consider technical features when assessing the presence or otherwise of an inventive step and will therefore normally reject the trivial computer-implementation of a non-technical method as lacking an inventive step. The UKPO, in contrast, consider any feature, technical or not, as being capable of contributing to an inventive step. (See Software patents under the European Patent Convention, which discusses the evolving position and practice of the EPO on this issue).|$|E

While Abramoff never donated directly to Reid, the lobbyist did instruct the tribe to send $5,000 to the fund. The Washington Post reported that Abramoff sent a list to the tribe titled [...] "Coushatta Requests" [...] recommending donations to campaigns or groups for 50 lawmakers. Alongside Reid's name, Abramoff wrote, [...] "5,000 (Searchlight Leadership Fund) Senate Majority Whip." [...] Reid was Democratic whip at the time.|$|E
5000|$|In France, {{the process}} for authorizing an {{adoption}} is understood as a “moment of truth” {{over the course of}} which administrative categories and social identities enter into a confrontation. Gender is a crucial aspect of this encounter, and the decision to accept or <b>reject</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> (by a single man, a woman past menopause, a homosexual person, a married couple, etc.) gives insight into what constitutes a legitimate family in France. To understand how the production of the family and the production of the state are linked, The Politics of Adoption offers a study of parliamentary debates since 1945 alongside French and European case law. It also casts light on social work through a statistical analysis of the different types of justification offered by child social welfare agents when surveyed on the topic of homosexual people who apply for adoption. Perreau’s contention is that adoption policies evidence a pastoral power: candidates are not evaluated for what they are but for what they should be. The state is considered as a guide for its citizens who wish to become parents because the state needs them to produce young citizens who fully acknowledge its authority. According to philosopher Judith Butler, Perreau offers [...] "a way of understanding adoption policy as no less than a way of rearticulating political modernity." ...|$|E

40|$|Canadian {{extradition}} law uncomfortably combines {{common law}} precepts with compromises deemed necessary {{for carrying out}} treaty obligations. In this context, for example, the substitution of affidavits for parol evidence has been an area where international courtesy has clashed with a valued means of testing an allegation, namely the cross-examination of witnesses. To <b>reject</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> for extradition because only documentary evidence is provided can amount to a censure of judicial proceedings in the state making the request; rejection may suggest that a fair trial cannot be secured. In 1922, in a sensational but hitherto uncited case, an Ontario extradition judge denied the petition of North Carolina {{for the return of}} a black suspect {{on the grounds that the}} court needed to examine at least one witness. The lynching of the suspect 2 ̆ 7 s brother, racism in the southern justice system, and the rantings of North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s governor undermined the credibility of affidavits produced by the state.

40|$|Does {{peer review}} fulfill its {{declared}} objective of identifying the best {{science and the}} best scientists? In order {{to answer this question}} we analyzed the Long-Term Fellowship and the Young Investigator programmes of the European Molecular Biology Organization. Both programmes aim to identify and support the best post doctoral fellows and young group leaders in the life sciences. We checked the association between the selection decisions and the scientific performance of the applicants. Our study involved publication and citation data for 668 applicants to the Long-Term Fellowship programme from the year 1998 (130 approved, 538 rejected) and 297 applicants to the Young Investigator programme (39 approved and 258 rejected applicants) from the years 2001 and 2002. If quantity and impact of research publications are used as a criterion for scientific achievement, the results of (zero-truncated) negative binomial models show that the peer review process indeed selects scientists who perform on a higher level than the rejected ones subsequent to application. We determined the extent of errors due to over-estimation (type I errors) and under-estimation (type 2 errors) of future scientific performance. Our statistical analyses point out that between 26 % and 48 % of the decisions made to award or <b>reject</b> <b>an</b> <b>application</b> show one of both error types. Even though for a part of the applicants, the selection committee did not correctly estimate the applicant’s future performance, the results show a statistically significant association between selection decisions and the applicants ’ scientific achievements, if quantity and impact of research publications are used as...|$|E
40|$|The {{granting}} of loans by a financial institution {{is one of the}} important decisions that require insubstantial care. The institution usually employs loan officers to make credit decisions or recommendations for that particular institution. These officers are given some hard roles in evaluating the worthiness of each application. Some researchers recognize that the capability of humans to judge the worthiness of a loan is rather poor. Since business data warehouses store historical data from previous application, it is likely that there is knowledge hidden in this data may be useful in decision making. Unfortunately the task of discovering hidden information and useful relationship from data is difficult for human. This is due the fact that the data to be examined is very large {{and the nature of the}} relationship within the data is not obvious. To this end, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be beneficial to assist the decision maker in making decisions regarding loan application. AI provides a variety of useful tool for discovering the non-obvious relationships in historical data, while ensuring those relationships discovered will generalize to the future data. This knowledge is important and can be used by the loan officer in determining whether to accept or <b>reject</b> <b>an</b> <b>application.</b> This study suggests that loan application processing system integrates two components of computer-based information system namely, office automation system and AI system that comprises of intelligent decision support system and knowledge based system. In essence, the potential use of such a system can be accelerated to promote any organizations as an efficient and effective organization that has competitive advantage...|$|E
