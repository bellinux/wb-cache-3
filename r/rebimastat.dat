50|$|<b>Rebimastat</b> {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} MMP inhibitor with a thiol zinc-binding group. It has oral bioavailability and is a collagen non-peptide mimetic. <b>Rebimastat</b> has some selectivity as it doesn't inhibit all the MMPs operations. The metalloproteinases that release TNF-alpha, TNF-II, L-selectin, IL-1-RII and IL-6 are for example not inhibited by <b>Rebimastat.</b> In phase I of clinical trials, {{there was no sign}} of dose-dependent joint toxicity and a disease stabilization. Arthralgia was noted in phase II early breast cancer trials, which was connected to MMP inhibitor toxicity. <b>Rebimastat</b> was used in a Paclitaxel/Carboplatin treatment in phase III. The results of the trial was a higher incidence of adverse reactions, without survival benefit.Clinical trials for Tanomastat, an alfa-((phenylthio)methyl)carboxylate, showed similar results. It showed good disease stability and tolerance in Phase I solid tumor trials and good tolerance in advanced cancer in combination with Etoposide. However, its efficacy was not proven to be adequate. Tanomastat showed significant hepatotoxicity in a cancer therapy combined with Cisplatin and Etoposide, although in a treatment with Doxorubicin it showed good tolerance and lowered toxicity with 5-fluorouracil and Leucovorin.Many compounds in the thiol zinc-binding groups have good water solubility and are air stable in plasma and these groups will be continued in MMP inhibitor designing.|$|E
