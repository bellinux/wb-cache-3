50|$|Traditional {{theology}} clarifies omnipotence or omni-benevolence to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>contradiction.</b> Calvinism resolves it by positing {{a doctrine}} of limited atonement, which claims that God's love is restricted. Only a select number of people are elected to be saved, which includes redemption and purification. This demonstrates a special love, and most people (the 'eternally reprobate' or non-elect) are given only common grace and tolerance. This bifurcation of grace intends to retain {{a doctrine of}} God's omnibenevolence and a doctrine of hell. In comparison, Arminianism resolves the contradiction by rejecting divine omnipotence with respect to human will. This is {{commonly referred to as}} synergism. It posits that human beings have an inviolable free will, which allows the choice of accepting or rejecting God's grace. Universalists disagree with the third claim, and argue that all people receive salvation.|$|E

5000|$|She {{is among}} the most {{prominent}} American academics who writes on the history of South Asia. In her book [...] "The Sole Spokesman" [...] (Cambridge University Press, 1985 and 1994), Jalal gives her perspective of what happened in the years between the 1937 elections and the Partition of the Indian subcontinent, identifying the factors which {{led to the creation of}} Pakistan and provides new insights into the nature of the British transfer of power in India. In particular, she focuses on the role of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the All-India Muslim League, and the main proponent of the Two Nation Theory on which the demand for Pakistan was based. Jinnah claimed to be the sole spokesman of all Indian Muslims, not only in provinces where they were in a majority but also in the provinces where they were in a minority. Yet given the political geography of the subcontinent it was clear that there would always be as many Muslims outside a specifically Muslim state as inside it. This book investigates how Jinnah proposed to <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> between assertions of a separate Muslim [...] "nation" [...] and the need for a strategy which could safeguard the interests of all Indian Muslims. It does so by identifying Jinnah's real political aims, the reasons why he was reluctant to bring them into the open, and his success or failure in achieving them.|$|E

These variously lead to approaches to QDA that I refer to as one-level, two-level, and three-level QDA.
