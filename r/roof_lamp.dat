50|$|After a year, {{the prince}} heard the troll talking with another troll, {{saying he would}} ask how long they had been there (the twelve young men having been so busy partying that the troll was certain {{they did not know}} a year had passed), what shone on the <b>roof</b> (the <b>lamp</b> that the troll had stolen from the princess as she slept), and where their food came from (the king's table).

On the way, they met an old beggar who asked for a piece of money for a poor man; the prince gave him his whole sackful. It was the troll in disguise, and he gave the prince the lamp he had stolen, telling him that the princess was in the same cave where the prince had found her.|$|R

50|$|Around 1946, {{the first}} system of traffic warning signal lights on school buses {{was used in}} Virginia. This system {{comprised}} a pair of sealed beam lights similar to those employed in American headlamps of the time. Instead of colorless glass lenses, the warning lights utilized red lenses. A motorized rotary switch applied power alternately to the red lights mounted at {{the left and right}} of the front and rear of the bus, creating a wig-wag effect. Activation was typically through a mechanical switch attached to the door control. However, on some buses (such as Gillig's Transit Coach models and the Kenworth-Pacific School Coach) activation of the <b>roof</b> warning <b>lamp</b> system was {{through the use of a}} pressure-sensitive switch on a manually controlled stop paddle lever located to the left of the driver's seat below the window. Whenever the pressure was relieved by extending the stop paddle, the electric current was activated to the relay. Plastic lenses for warning lights were developed in the 1950s, though sealed beams—now with colorless glass lenses — were still most commonly used behind them until the mid-2000s, when light-emitting diodes (LEDs) began supplanting the sealed beams.|$|R

The narration reads, [...] "Every sports sedan is supposed to do well in the fast lane. But what about these lanes...? At Lexus, we achieved extremely tight tolerances between all major body panels.

The lobby contains marble columns and elaborate ornamental molding. At one time the building featured <b>roof</b> pavilions and <b>lamp</b> standards, which were removed around 1963. It was renovated in 1981 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The building is most notable due to its connection to the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent nation. Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the founder and first President of Czechoslovakia, resided here between July and November 1918. The first Czechoslovakian national flag to be created was flown from the building on October 18, 1918.|$|R

6000|$|Here, {{somewhat}} abruptly, {{the review}} concluded, {{probably because the}} King had to send off his copy at that moment, {{as he was in}} some want of money. But the King was a very good critic, whatever he may have been as King, and he had, to a considerable extent, hit the right nail on the head. [...] "Hymns on the Hill" [...] was not at all like the poems originally published in praise of the poetry of London. And the reason was that it was really written by a man who had seen nothing else but London, and who regarded it, therefore, as the universe. It was written by a raw, red-headed lad of seventeen, named Adam Wayne, who had been born in Notting Hill. An accident in his seventh year prevented his being taken away to the seaside, and thus his whole life had been passed in his own Pump Street, and in its neighbourhood. And the consequence was, that he saw the street-lamps as things quite as eternal as the stars; the two fires were mingled. He saw the houses as things enduring, like the mountains, and so he wrote about them as one would write about mountains. Nature puts on a disguise when she speaks to every man; to this man she put on the disguise of Notting Hill. Nature would mean to a poet born in the Cumberland hills, a stormy sky-line and sudden rocks. Nature would mean to a poet born in the Essex flats, a waste of splendid waters and splendid sunsets. So nature meant to this man Wayne a line of violet <b>roofs</b> and lemon <b>lamps,</b> the chiaroscuro of the town. He did not think it clever or funny to praise the shadows and colours of the town; he had seen no other shadows or colours, and so he praised them--because they were shadows and colours. He saw all this because he was a poet, though in practice a bad poet. It is too often forgotten that just as a bad man is nevertheless a man, so a bad poet is nevertheless a poet.|$|R
