40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a conventional separate-flow exhaust system configuration, a conventional cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> configuration, and six innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> configurations. The innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> configurations consisted of a cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless thrust <b>reverser,</b> two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile thrust <b>reverser,</b> and a wing-mounted thrust <b>reverser.</b> Each of the innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> design. Testing was conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center using a 7. 9 %-scale exhaust system model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0. All tests were conducted with no external flow and cold, high-pressure air was used to simulate core and fan exhaust flows. Results show that the innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> concepts achieved thrust <b>reverser</b> performance levels which, when {{taking into account the}} potential for system simplification and reduced weight, may make them competitive with, or potentially more cost effective than current state-of-the-art thrust <b>reverser</b> systems.

5|$|<b>Reverse</b> transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. <b>Reverse</b> transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a <b>reverse</b> transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by <b>reverse</b> transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the <b>reverse</b> transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E

If we pay attention to our surrounding there are some groups of community who used strange and funny language in communication with their fellow groups, especially to the youth. This strange and funny language occurs in Malang and the name is“ Bahasa Balikan “ (<b>reversed</b> language). Sometimes, the language is difficult to be understood by others especially for non Malangese people. Malang Post is one kind of regional newspapers that established in Malang. Malang Post also involves <b>reversed</b> language especially in column “ Malangan “, there we can read many words that are <b>reversed</b> by the writer The problems discussed were : (1).

5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room <b>reverse</b> engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room <b>reverse</b> engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room <b>reverse</b> engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on <b>reverse</b> engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E
