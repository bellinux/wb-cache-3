40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to {{radiation}} that is everywhere in the environment without their knowledge and the exposure to natural background radiation is an unavoidable event on earth. An in situ measurement of the indoor and outdoor background ionizing radiation in Life hospital and Rayfield diagnostic center, Bori of Rivers State, Nigeria was carried out using two radiation meters. Each of these hospitals was divided into 10 sampling points where five readings were taken {{in order to have}} a reliable data. The mean indoor and outdoor annual effective dose of Life hospital were 0. 93 ± 0. 13 mSv/yr and 0. 23 ± 0. 01 mSv/yr respectively; and that of Rayfield diagnostic center were 1. 22 ± 0. 10 mSv/yr and 0. 26 ± 0. 02 mSv/yr respectively. The radiation levels in both hospitals were found to be slightly higher than the safe limit. The reduction coefficient calculated from the dose equivalent exceeded the limit of 1. 5 at x-ray rooms of the two hospitals. These results of in-situ indoor and outdoor background radiation of the two hospitals in Bori show that the <b>radiological</b> <b>operations</b> did enhance the natural background radiation of the area.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} US Department of Energy (DOE) is {{to conduct}} its <b>radiological</b> <b>operations</b> to ensure {{the health and safety}} of all DOE {{employees}} including contractors and subcontractors. The DOE strives to maintain radiation exposures to its workers below administrative control levels and DOE limits and to further reduce these exposures and releases to levels that are ``As Low As Reasonably Achievable`` (ALARA). The DOE Occupational Radiation Exposure Report, 1996 provides summary and analysis of the occupational radiation exposure received by individuals associated with DOE activities. The DOE mission includes stewardship of the nuclear weapons stockpile and the associated facilities, environmental restoration of DOE and precursor agency sites, and energy research. Collective exposure at DOE has declined by 80 % over the past decade due to a cessation in opportunities for exposure during the transition in DOE mission from weapons production to cleanup, deactivation and decommissioning, and changes in reporting requirements and dose calculation methodology. In 1996, the collective dose decreased by 10 % from the 1995 value due to decreased doses at five of the seven highest-dose DOE sites. For 1996, these sites attributed the reduction in collective dose to the completion of several decontamination and decommissioning projects, reduced spent fuel storage activities, and effective ALARA practices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to {{provide an overview of}} the various SLAC programs and documents that make up the SLAC Radiation Protection Program (RPP) and how they relate to Chapter 9, “Radiological Safety”. The intended audience is SLAC staff responsible for the RPP and external auditors. 2 Programs and Documents The exposure of personnel to radiation and the use, storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) are strictly controlled in accordance with a comprehensive set of regulations, principally Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, “Energy”, Chapter 3, “Department of Energy”, Part 835, “Occupational Radiation Protection ” (10 CFR 835), and directives issued by the Department of Energy (DOE). These regulations and directives are implemented through an extensive set of programs, each with its own set of detailed requirements and documents. The main program, required by 10 CFR 835, is the SLAC Radiation Protection Program (RPP). The goal of the RPP is to maintain personnel radiation doses below regulatory limits and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). RPP requirements apply to all radiological activities, facilities, and operations at SLAC and strictly control any activities that can expose personnel to radiation. Additionally, SLAC policy stemming from DOE directives is to minimize release of radioactive material into the environment and minimize the impacts to the environment from <b>radiological</b> <b>operations.</b> The implementation hierarchy for the programs that collectively comprise the SLAC radiological safety program is as follows: The top-level document is the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Radiation Protection Program Plan for Implementing 10 CFR 835, which describes how SLAC meets the requirements of 10 CFR 835.

The actions recommended are a result of interviews with about 35 individuals representing senior management through the technician level. The deficiencies identified in the LLNL Internal Assessment of the Institutional Radiation Safety Program were discussed with Radiation Safety personnel team leads, customers of Radiation Safety Program, DOE Livermore site office, and senior ES&H management. There are significant issues with the RSP. LLNL RSP is not an integrated, cohesive, consistently implemented program with a single authority that has the clear roll and responsibility and authority to assure <b>radiological</b> <b>operations</b> at LLNL are conducted in a safe and compliant manner. There is no institutional commitment to address the deficiencies that are identified in the internal assessment. Some of these deficiencies have been previously identified and corrective actions have not been taken or are ineffective in addressing the issues. Serious funding and staffing issues have prevented addressing previously identified issues in the Radiation Calibration Laboratory, Internal Dosimetry, Bioassay Laboratory, and the Whole Body Counter. There is a lack of technical basis documentation for the Radiation Calibration Laboratory and an inadequate QA plan that does not specify standards of work. The Radiation Safety Program lack rigor and consistency across all supported programs.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} short term {{clinical}} results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with autologous hamstring tendon between Rigid-fix and PINN-ACL Cross Pin for femoral side fixation. Materials and Methods: 127 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon and had been followedup for over than one year were enrolled for the present study. Rigid-fix was used in 71 cases (group 1), and PINN-ACL Cross Pin was used in 56 cases (group 2). Clinical and <b>radiological</b> results, <b>operation</b> time, and perioperative complications were compared amongst the two groups. Results: The International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score and Lysholm score were 94 and 95 in group 1 and 87 and 91 in group 2, with no statistical difference (p= 0. 892, p= 0. 833), respectively. However, significant difference was observed in one-leg hop test {{between the two groups}} (p= 0. 032). Five cases in group 1 and 40 cases in group 2 were found to be associated with perioperative complications with statistical difference (p< 0. 0001).

We report our experience on six patients with intramedullary cavernomas defining {{the spectrum of}} presenting symptoms and signs analyzing the role of surgery {{as a treatment for}} these lesions. We present our experience with 2 cervical and 4 thoracal spinal intramedullary cavernoma from 2010 to 2014 searching history, onset of clinical manifestation, neurological status, <b>radiological</b> findings, <b>operation,</b> and clinical outcome. Among 6 patients male were 2 cases; female 4 cases; mean age was 42 years (range 25 - 72 years); mean duration of symptoms were 1, 5 years (range 5 days and 2 years) with slowly progressive neurological decline. In two cases there was acute onset of neurological compromise. In all cases diagnosis was made on MRI and lesions were possible to be radically excised and gently extracted from the hemosiderin-stained bed inside of the spinal cord via a laminectomy and midline myelotomy with microsurgical techniques. The surgical outcome on a mean duration of follow up of 12 months were: for 4 cases - the patients neurological conditions remarkably improved 1 month later, for 2 cases no improvement were remarked. No recurrent hemorrhages were recorded. A follow-up MRI examination was made in all cases to confirm complete removal of the cavernous angioma. Spinal intramedullary cavernoma should be early recognized by MRI, can be positioned in a precarious position and generate significant neurologic deficits than cranial cavernomas. For symptomatic intramedullary cavernous malformations extended to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, total resection with microsurgical techniques can offer good or excellent outcome, restoring neurological status and to stop chronic deterioration and acute rebleeding.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Right iliac fossa (RIF) pain {{remains the}} commonest {{clinical}} dilemma encountered by general surgeons. We prospectively audited {{the management of}} acute RIF pain, examining the relationship between symptom duration, use of pre-operative radiological imaging and patient outcome. METHODS: Over a six-month period, 302 patients, median age 18 years, 59 % female, were admitted with RIF pain. Symptoms, clinical findings and laboratory results were documented. Patient management, timing of <b>radiological</b> investigations and <b>operations,</b> and outcome were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Non-specific abdominal pain (26 %), gynaecological (22 %) and miscellaneous causes (14 %) accounted for most admissions. Ultimately, 119 patients (39 %) had appendicitis. Anorexia, tachycardia or rebound tenderness in the RIF significantly predicted a final diagnosis of appendicitis. Patients with perforated appendicitis (n = 29) had a longer duration of pre-hospital symptoms (median 50 h) compared to those with simple appendicitis (median 17 h) (p< 0. 001). The use of pre-operative imaging resulted in an increased time to surgery but {{was not associated with}} increased post-operative morbidity or perforated appendicitis. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients presenting to hospital with RIF pain did not have appendicitis.

The radiological considerations addressed include the following: prompt secondary radiation (bremsstrahlung, giant resonance neutrons, medium and high energy neutrons, and muons) produced by electrons/positrons interacting in a beam stop or by particle losses in the component structures; skyshine radiation, which produces a radiation field in nearby areas and at the nearest off-site location; radioactive gases produced by neutron irradiation of air {{in the vicinity of}} a particle loss site; noxious gases (ozone and others) produced in air by the escaping bremsstrahlung radiation that results from absorbing particles in the components or by synchrotron radiation escaping into the tunnel; activation of the storage ring components that results in a residual radiation field in the vicinity of these materials following shutdown; potential activation of water used for cooling the magnets and other purposes in the SR tunnel; evaluation of the radiation fields due to escaping synchrotron radiation and gas bremsstrahlung. Estimated dose rates outside of the tunnel, in the early assembly area (EAA), and in the Experiment Hall for several modes of operation (including potential safety envelope beam power, normal beam power, and MCI (maximum credible incident) conditions) have been computed. Shielding in the first optics enclosur...|$|R
40|$|The Low-Energy Undulator Test Line (LEUTL) is a {{facility}} that uses the existing APS linac to accelerate electrons up to an energy of 700 MeV. These electrons are transported through the PAR into {{a portion of the}} booster synchrotron and on into the LEUTL main enclosure (MIL 97). Figure 1 shows the layout of the LEUTL building, which consists of an earth-bermed concrete enclosure and an end-station building. The concrete enclosure houses the electron beamline, test undulator, and beam dump. This facility is about 51 m long and 3. 66 m wide. Technical components and diagnostics for characterizing the undulator light are found in the end station. This building has about 111 m 2 of floor space. This note deals with the <b>radiological</b> considerations of <b>operations</b> using electrons up to 700 MeV and at power levels up to the safety envelope of 1 kW. Previous radiological considerations for electron and positron operations in the linac, PAR, and synchrotron have been addressed elsewhere (MOE 93 a, 93 b, and 93 c). Much of the methodology discussed in the previous writeups, as well as in MOE 94, has been used in the computations in this note. The radiological aspects that are addressed include the following: prompt secondary radiation (bremsstrahlung, giant resonance neutrons, medium- and high-energy neutrons) produced by electrons interacting in a beam stop o...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{functional}} and radiological outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in patients with osteoporotic vertebra fractures. Methods: The files of the patients who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebrae fractures were retrieved from the archives. Forty-three patients with complete follow-up data were included in the study group. The patients were evaluated for radiological outcomes in terms of local kyphosis angle, wedging index, compression ratio, visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results: In the study group, kyphoplasty was performed on 24 vertebrae of 22 patients (17 females, 5 males; mean age: 73 years) whereas vertebroplasty was applied on 24 vertebrae of 21 (16 females, 5 males; mean age: 74. 7 years) patients. The mean follow-up time was 26 months. When the VAS and ODI values of the groups were analyzed, both groups showed statistically significant progress after the <b>operation.</b> <b>Radiological</b> data showed that the kyphoplasty group showed statistically significant improvement in the sagittal index values whereas the vertebroplasty group did not. The overall complication ratio was 4 %. Conclusion: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment methods for functional recovery and pain relief in osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra. Although radiological outcomes of the kyphoplasty seem to be better, this does not have any clinical relevance. We suggest vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty since it is an easier method to manage. Level of evidence: Level III, Therapeutic study...|$|R
