40|$|A laboratory-based linear loading {{pavement}} test stand, the Minnesota Accelerated Loading Facility (Minne-ALF) simulates {{the passage}} of heavy traffic loads moving at speeds up to 65 kph (40 mph) over small, full-scale pavement test slabs. Hydraulic actuators control a <b>rocker</b> <b>beam,</b> which simulates loads. Researchers simulated {{the passage of}} 40 -kN (9 -kip) single-wheel loads {{at a rate of}} 172, 000 per day, although wheel loads up to 100 kN (22 kips) can be simulated at varying speeds. Full-axle simulations are possible with frame modifications. Concrete slabs were cast and dowels were installed in slots across cracks/joints. Test variables included joint fact texture, repair backfill material, and dowel material and length. Test outputs included measurements of load transfer efficiency and differential deflection across the joint/crack. The effect of joint/crack face texture was great when the joint/crack remained tight. Load carrying performance was improved using Speed Crete 2028 in place of 3 U 18 concrete backfill with similar joint and dowel bars. Load transfer was unaffected by the use of stainless steel-clad dowel bars in lieu of epoxy-coated dowel bars. Researchers recommend additional testing {{to examine the effects of}} dowel length and dowel materials. Center for Transportation StudiesMinnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E

Bats roosting in the <b>rocker</b> <b>beams</b> delayed the restoration but the pump ran again on 1 July 2010, now operated by electric power.

40|$|Abstract. In this project, {{the output}} of a Beam Engine is used to drive a {{circular}} saw to cut timber. Here, instead of the rotating fly wheel, {{it is intended to}} have a rotating circular saw. This rotating circular saw is used to cut timber. Circular saws driven with electric power are a common feature. But in places where electricity is scarce, or absent, it is difficult to operate these equipments. But since the Beam Engine powered saw runs on fuel, it can be operated even in places where electricity is totally absent. A beam engine is a design of stationary steam engine [1]. A stationary engine is an engine whose framework does not move [2]. Usually, a stationary engine is used not to propel a vehicle but to drive a piece of immobile equipment such as a pump or power tools [4]. In a beam engine, the piston is mounted vertically, and the piston rod does not connect directly to the connecting rod, but instead to a <b>rocker</b> or <b>beam</b> above both the piston and flywheel. The beam is pivoted in the middle, with the cylinder {{on one side and the}} flywheel, which incorporates the crank, on the other. The connecting rod connects to the opposite end of the beam to the piston rod, and then to the flywheel [1]. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} and test hypotheses concerning the design and construction of Beothuk birch bark canoes {{and their relationship to}} craft of other North American native groups. The study was based on data from artifacts in various museum collections and from documents. New materials resulting from a systematic archival search were used to supplement known sources. [...] Examination of the data showed that the Beothuk made at least two different bark canoe designs. The more versatile of the two had a straight keel-line, no <b>rocker,</b> and the <b>beam</b> placed abaft midlength; it combined attributes useful for travel on inland waters with those that were advantageous for open water navigation. The second canoe form was a strongly rockered deep draft type especially adapted for travel conditions on the ocean. Both designs shared a V-shaped hull form as well as stylistic attributes which differentiated them from bark canoes of other groups. This interpretation removes an area of difficulty experienced by others who tried to distill one design out of apparently conflicting data. [...] Beothuk canoes were also compared with sixty-two other native North American craft which revealed that Beothuk bark canoe construction conformed with the traditional methods used by other groups. Although Beothuk canoes have been described as unique, most of their attributes were found on other North American canoes or kayaks. The uniqueness derived from specific combinations of attributes and from the development of some of them to an unusual degree. [...] Analysis of canoes outside of Newfoundland demonstrated that several attributes were predominantly found in the North American north west including Alaska, the Yukon and the District of MacKensie but were absent or rare on the eastern seaboard and vice versa. A comparison of Beothuk canoe characteristics with those identified as preferred in north western or eastern regions showed a close association between the straight keel-line canoe and north western Athabascan canoes; the curved bottom form clearly incorporated functional attributes of eastern canoes and both designs had attributes in common with skin kayaks. [...] The evidence favours the suggestion that a prototype canoe close to the designs of Athabascan bark canoes diffused prehistorically to the Newfoundland Indians and that major elements of the ancient design persisted in both regions. The V-shaped hull form was a modification that evolved in Newfoundland, possibly in emulation of Eskimo Kayak features, and the strongly rockered design, which developed at a later stage represents an influence of eastern Indian canoe forms. [...] The investigation suggests that the two Beothuk canoe designs reflect periods of contact with and absorption of ideas from different native groups, ingenuity at developing canoe forms that met local requirements and were unique among North American bark canoes, and persistence with ancient design features as well as stylistic elements...|$|R
