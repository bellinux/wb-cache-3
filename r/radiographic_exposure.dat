40|$|Introduction: Accurate {{determination}} of skeletal maturity and remaining growth {{is crucial to}} many orthodontic, orthognathic and dental implant timing decision. Cervical vertebral stages and hand-wrist radiographs are currently used to identify peak mandibular bone growth. These are highly subjective techniques that not only involve <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposure</b> but also lack the ability to determine the intensity of growth spurt {{and the end of}} the growth. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is a circulating growth hormone-dependent factor whose level correlates with sexual maturity and is used to diagnose growth hormone deficiency and excess. IGF-I level was correlated with cervical skeletal maturity and would be highest at cervical stages that correspond to the greatest amount of facial growth. Materials and methods: Blood sample of 90 patients between the age group of 10 and 25 years of both sexes and their lateral cephalogram were taken. Results: The results showed that the IGF-I levels were low at prepubertal levels, (CS 1, CS 2, CS 3). It increased gradually, peaking during puberty, showing maximum values (CS 4, CS 5), which later dropped to reach prepubertal values (CS 6). Conclusion: Blood spot IGF-I correlates well with skeletal age as determined by radiographic techniques. IGF-I can act as a potential skeletal maturity indicator without the hazard of additional <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{plays an}} important role in evaluating wear and periacetabular osteolysis (PAO) in total hip replacements. One concern with CT is the high radiation exposure since standard pelvic CT provides approximately 3. 5 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation exposure, whereas a planar radiographic examination with three projections totals approximately 0. 5 mSv. The objective of this study was to evaluate the lowest acceptable radiation dose for dual-energy CT (DECT) images when measuring wear and periacetabular osteolysis in uncemented metal components. Materials and Methods A porcine pelvis with bilateral uncemented hip prostheses and with known linear wear and acetabular bone defects was examined in a third-generation multidetector DECT scanner. The examinations were performed with four different radiation levels both with and without iterative reconstruction techniques. From the high and low peak kilo voltage acquisitions, polychrmoatic images were created together with virtual monochromatic images of energies 100 kiloelectron volts (keV) and 150 keV. Results We could assess wear and PAO while substantially lowering the effective radiation dose to 0. 7 mSv for a total pelvic view with an accuracy of around 0. 5 mm for linear wear and 2 mm to 3 mm for PAO. Conclusion CT for detection of prosthetic wear and PAO could be used with clinically acceptable accuracy at a radiation exposure level equal to plain <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposures...</b>|$|R

Methods Seventy elderly high-risk patients with an average age of 81 years were treated surgically for intertrochanteric fracture, resulting from a low energy trauma. Patients were randomly divided in two groups regarding to the proximal pin placement technique. In Group A the proximal pins were inserted in a convergent way, while in Group B were inserted in parallel. Results All fractures healed uneventfully after a mean time of 98 days. The fixator was well accepted and no patient had significant difficulties while sitting or lying. The mean VAS score was 5. 4 in group A and 5. 7 in group B. At 12 months after surgery, in group A the average Harris Hip Score and the Palmer and Parker mobility score was 67 and 5. 8, respectively. In group B, the average Harris Hip Score and the Palmer and Parker mobility score was 62 and 5. 6, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found regarding the functional outcome.

However, a subject's sway between exposures induces inaccuracy in the 3 D reconstructions. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of patient sway between successive <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposures,</b> and to test if 3 D reconstruction accuracy can be improved by a corrective method with simultaneous Moire-X-ray imaging. Material and Methods: Using a calibrated deformable phantom perceptible by both techniques (Moire and X-ray), the 3 D positional and rotational vertebral data from 3 D reconstructions with and without the corrective procedure were compared to the corresponding data of computed tomography (CT) scans, considered as a reference. All were expressed in the global axis system, {{as defined by the}} Scoliosis Research Society. Results: When a sagittal sway of 10 degrees occurred between successive biplanar X-rays, the accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction without correction was 8. 8 mm for the anteroposterior vertebral locations and 6. 4 degrees for the sagittal orientations. When the corrective method was applied, the accuracy was improved to 1. 3 mm and 1. 5 degrees, respectively. Conclusion: 3 D accuracy improved significantly by using the corrective method, whatever the subject's sway. This technique is reliable for clinical appraisal {{of the spine}}, if the subject's sway does not exceed 10 degrees.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the treatment outcomes of a revitalization endodontic technique (RET) {{for the management}} of traumatized immature teeth with necrotic pulps in children. Methodology: Fifteen healthy children (age range = 7 – 10 years) with traumatized immature maxillary incisors with necrotic pulps treated with bi-antibiotic revitalization endodontic technique were prospectively assessed over approximately two years (mean = 22 months). One operator undertook all treatments, clinical reviews and standardized <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposures</b> with <b>radiographic</b> analysis being carried out by two calibrated experienced clinicians. Crown colour change was assessed using an objective published methodology. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare root lengths, root dentinal widths and apical foramen widths over time. Results: Interoperator measurement reliability was consistently strong for all measurements. There {{was no significant difference in}} root lengths or root dentinal wall widths following RET. A significant difference in apical foramen widths was observed after 2 years (P = 0. 013) with resolution of clinical signs of infection in all cases.

The control filter (GC) was 100 % aluminium (Al) with a thickness of 1. 5 mm. The tested filters were: G 1, 97 % Al and 3 % copper (Cu) with 1. 47 mm thickness; G 2, 96 % Al and 4 % Cu with 1. 53 mm thickness; G 3, 95 % Al and 5 % zinc (Zn) with 1. 56 mm thickness; G 4, 98 % Al and 2 % Zn with 1. 5 mm thickness; and G 5, 95 % Cu and 5 % Zn with 1. 6 Trim thickness. For formation of the image, a 12 -step Al wedge (each step with increments of 1 mm in thickness) was radiographed 10 times. Pixel values measured in digital images were converted into optical density (OD). Results: All replicates showed OD with high reproducibility (r > 0. 95) for all exposure times and tested filters. In comparison between filters, statistically significant differences in density (p < 0. 05) were observed. The OD curve of the G 5 filter in all exposure times and G 3 filter in an exposure time of 0. 05 s showed changes in shape (p < 0. 05).

Objective: This study aims to evaluate clinical and <b>radiographic</b> changes in <b>exposure</b> of maxillary central incisors occurring after orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement. Methods: A total of 17 patients who underwent orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement between September, 2010 and July, 2011 were selected. Exposure of maxillary central incisors was evaluated clinically and by lateral cephalograms. Measurements were taken {{one week before}} and three months after surgery.

There was an inverse correlation between upper lip thickness and incisors postsurgical <b>exposure</b> revealed by <b>radiographic</b> images (p = 0. 002). Conclusions: Significant changes in the exposure of maxillary central incisors occur after maxillary advancement, {{under the influence of}} some factors, especially lip thickness...|$|R
40|$|X-Radiography {{is widely}} used in the {{investigation}} of works of art and other culturally significant artefacts to reveal and record details of their construction, modification and state of preservation. Radiography {{is considered to be a}} non-destructive technique but its increasing use in the study of historic textiles has prompted the testing of this assumption as X-rays and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as light and micro-waves, cause changes in materials which may be detrimental to their physical stability. An experiment was undertaken to test the safety ofradiography for the imaging of silk fabrics as these are particularly susceptible to photodegradation. The results from a series of radiographic exposures of modern and historic fabrics show that excessive exposure to low energy X-rays produced no detectable changes in their mechanical integrity. This indicates that the customary levels of <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposure</b> used in imaging will not be detrimental to textiles...|$|E
40|$|Radiographs are an {{integral}} component of a periodontal assessment for those with clinical evidence of periodontal destruction. A close consideration of the current approach to periodontal diagnosis compatible with the current classification of periodontal diseases reveals that radiographs only inform with respect to diagnosis for {{a small proportion of}} conditions. The area in periodontal assessment in which radiographs play a pivotal role is in treatment planning. A variety of <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposure</b> types assist in the development of periodontal treatment plans. This "therapeutic yield" can be achieved by panoramic oral radiographs supplemented by selective intra-oral views. Digital panoramic oral radiographs viewed on screen appear to offer advantages over printouts or films. Newer imaging approaches, such as cone-beam computed (digital volume) tomography, may come to show some usefulness but experience has shown that digital subtraction radiography will probably remain a research tool without much clinical application. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{lenticular}} film {{system designed}} to suppress image degrading crossover during dual screen <b>radiographic</b> <b>exposure</b> is proposed and evaluated. The lenticular screen consists of two sheets of crossed cylindrical lenslets each with a frequency of 25 lenslets/mm. A numerical analysis via optical ray tracing compares the theoretical frequency response of the proposed system {{to that of a}} conventional radiographic film. It shows an enhancement in the response by a factor of two, for frequencies 1 - 4 c/mm. Experimental measurements made on simulations of the proposed system using Kodak film type, SO- 241 confirm the predicted improvement in the mid-frequency range. The proposed lenticular system reduces the need to absorb crossover illumination with a tinted film base by imaging crossover illumination with lenslets molded into the film base. By using the crossover illumination as part of the image forming exposure, a reduced radiation dose is required to obtain comparable or improved image quality...|$|E
40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides oligonucleotides {{complementary}} to c-myc mRNA inhibit {{smooth muscle}} cell proliferation in vitro and {{may reduce the}} proliferative response to vascular injury in vivo following balloon angioplasty. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the in vivo incorporation kinetics of 35 S labelled phosphorothioate antisense c-myc oligonucleotides by assessing the effect of transfection time, of lipofectin or Iipofectamin on tissue penetration and retention following transfection in the carotid artery. A total of 117 New Zealand white rabbit carotid arteries were transfected with 80 μM of c-myc antisense oligonucleotide in a 1 cm portion either alone (n = 37) or in combination with lipofectin (100 μg/ml or 500 μg/ml) (n= 50) or lipofectamin (100 μg/ml or 500 μg/ml) (n= 30) for periods of either 15, 30, 60, 120 or 240 minutes. Radiolabelled oligonucleotide incorporation level was evaluated by automated scintillation counting and tissue localisation by dot counting following <b>radiographic</b> emulsion <b>exposure</b> of histological sections. Retention evaluation was performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-transfection. A high correlation factor (r 2 = 0. 96) was obtained between the two evaluation methods. Maximal incorporation was seen after 15 min exposure (7. 84 %± 1. 59 %, P< 0. 05 vs other groups). Maximal radioactivity retained was found at 24 hours (0. 743 % incorporation ± 0. 096 %), decreasing rapidly thereafter (0. 57 % at 48 hours and 0. 247 % at 72 hours, p< 0. 05). Efficiency of transfection was not increased by lipofectin or lipofectamin. labelled oligonucleotide were located mainly in the media (3. 85 E± 07 dots± 5. 85 E + 06 dots) and significantly less in the adventia (7. 55 E± 06 dots± 1. 84 E + 06 dots). Conclusions 1 -In vivo vascular transfection of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, without specific vectors, results in good medial tissue penetration, with however a low retention level after 24 hours. 2 - This transfer modality does not appear to be enhaced with the use of Iiposomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} lung {{function}} and <b>radiographic</b> indices of <b>exposure</b> to chrysotile asbestos was investigated by cross-sectional studies in {{two groups of}} men at Havelock Mine, Swaziland. The first group consisted of 214 employees and ex-employees, mean age 52, who had been employed for at least 10 years, and whose dust exposure ranged from minimal for surface workers to very heavy {{for those in the}} grading and bagging sections of the mill. In this group 29 % had category 1 or more simple pneumoconiosis and 4. 5 % category 2 or more. For surface and mine workers, the estimated annual deterioration in FEV 1 and FVC and the increase in category of pneumoconiosis was similar to that due to age alone, while the heaviest exposure almost doubled the decline in lung function and trebled the rate of progression of pneumoconiosis. The second group consisted of 224 men, mean age 33, all currently working in the mill and having been employed there for at least a year. In this group 30 % had category 1 or more simple pneumoconiosis, and 2. 7 % category 2. Exposure in the dustiest sections of the mill more than doubled the estimated annual decline in lung function and doubled the rate of progression of pneumoconiosis...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Aluminum {{step wedge}} (ASW) {{equivalent}} radiodensity (eRD) {{has been used}} to quantify restorative material's radiodensity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of image acquisition control (IAC) of a digital X-ray system on the radiodensity quantification under different exposure time settings. Materials and Methods Three 1 -mm thick restorative material samples with various opacities were prepared. Samples were radiographed alongside an ASW using one of three digital radiographic modes (linear mapping (L), nonlinear mapping (N), and nonlinear mapping and automatic exposure control activated (E)) under 3 exposure time settings (underexposure, normal-exposure, and overexposure). The ASW eRD of restorative materials, attenuation coefficients and contrasts of ASW, and the correlation coefficient of linear relationship between logarithms of gray-scale value and thicknesses of ASW were compared under 9 conditions. Results The ASW eRD measurements of restorative materials by three digital radiographic modes were statistically different (p = 0. 049) but clinically similar. The relationship between logarithms of background corrected grey scale value and thickness of ASW was highly linear but attenuation coefficients and contrasts varied significantly among 3 <b>radiographic</b> modes. Varying <b>exposure</b> times did not affect ASW eRD significantly. Conclusions Even though different digital radiographic modes induced large variation on attenuation of coefficient and contrast of ASW, E mode improved diagnostic quality of the image significantly under the under-exposure condition by improving contrasts, while maintaining ASW eRDs of restorative materials similar. Under the condition of this study, underexposure time may be acceptable clinically with digital X-ray system using automatic gain control that reduces radiation exposure for patient...|$|R
