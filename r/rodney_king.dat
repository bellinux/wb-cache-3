5|$|Blending {{science fiction}} with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and voyeurism. Although {{the story was}} {{conceived}} by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration after incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> verdict. The film was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles riots of 1992, {{also known}} as the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> {{uprising}} or the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots, began on April 29, 1992 when a jury acquitted four LAPD police officers accused in the videotaped beating of an African American <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> following a high-speed car pursuit on March 3, 1991.|$|E

50|$|Though {{few people}} at first {{considered}} race {{an important factor}} in the case, including <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> attorney, Steven Lerman, the Holliday videotape was at the time stirring deep resentment in Los Angeles, as well as other major cities in the United States. The officers' jury consisted of Ventura County residents: ten white, one Latino, one Asian. Lead prosecutor Terry White was African American. On April 29, 1992, the jury acquitted three of the officers but could not agree on one of the charges against Powell.|$|R

50|$|In March 1991, KTLA was {{the first}} station to air the infamous video of <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> beating by three Los Angeles police officers, whose {{eventual}} acquittal sparked rioting within the city in 1992. In July 1991, KTLA debuted the Los Angeles market's first live, local morning two-hour newscast, the KTLA Morning News, {{to compete with the}} network morning shows on KABC-TV (channel 7), KCBS-TV (channel 2) and KNBC (which each started at 7:00 a.m., as KTLA's program initially did). The program suffered from low ratings at first; however, the ability to cover breaking news live (as opposed to the network morning programs, which were aired on a three-hour tape delay) attracted more viewers to the program. As time went on, the Morning News has enjoyed great ratings success, generally ranking number one in its main 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. time period. The program's success spawned rival KTTV to launch its own morning newscast, Good Day L.A., in 1993. From 1994 to 1995, the station aired gavel to gavel coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial anchored by Marta Waller (this coverage was rebroadcast by other stations such as Portland, Oregon WB affiliate future Tribune sister station KWBP (now KRCW-TV)).|$|R
2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|R

25|$|The 1992 Los Angeles riots, {{also known}} as the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots, the South Central riots, the 1992 Los Angeles civil disturbance, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, and the Los Angeles uprising, were a series of riots, lootings, arsons, and civil {{disturbances}} that occurred in Los Angeles County, California in April and May 1992. The unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department for usage of excessive force in the videotaped arrest and beating of <b>Rodney</b> <b>King.</b> It then spread throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over a six-day period following the announcement of the verdict.|$|E
5000|$|Hitherto Stenhouse {{had been}} living on a fortune {{that had been left}} to him by his father; however, in 1850 the Glasgow Commercial Exchange Company failed and his {{inheritance}} was lost. He then sought a professorship at Owens College, now the University of Manchester, but was unsuccessful. However, in February 1851 he was appointed Lecturer on Chemistry to the medical school at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. (August Kekul√© (1829-1896), who would become an eminent organic chemist, was one of his laboratory assistants during this time.) In 1857 Stenhouse suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralyzed and forced him to resign his position. He left England to convalesce with his mother in Nice (then still part of Italy) until her death in February 1860. In June of that year he returned to England and opened a laboratory in an outbuilding of an abandoned factory on <b>Rodney</b> Street, <b>King's</b> Cross, London; there he supported himself by assaying, consulting, and performing other contract work. [...] He also recommenced his researches in chemistry, even though he could not perform experiments with his own hands. He hired assistants (mainly graduates from the Royal College of Chemistry) to do the work for him. [...] These assistants included Raphael Meldola (1849-1915), who would become an eminent organic chemist, and Charles E. Groves (1841-1920), who co-authored of many of Stenhouse‚Äôs papers, which ultimately numbered in excess of 100.|$|R
25|$|In {{the week}} before the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> {{verdicts}} were reached, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates set aside $1 million for possible police overtime.

25|$|Racial {{tensions}} erupted on April 29, 1992, {{with the}} acquittal by a Simi Valley jury {{of the police}} officers captured on videotape beating <b>Rodney</b> <b>King,</b> culminating in large-scale riots. They were the largest riots in US history causing approximately $1.3 billion in damage as well as 53 deaths and over 2,000 injuries.|$|E

25|$|William Gordon Merrick {{was born}} in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. His father, <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> Merrick, was a manager of a truck company who {{eventually}} became a bank manager. His mother was the former Mary Cartwright Gordon (born Natchez, Mississippi, 26 July 1893). He had one sibling, Samuel Vaughan Merrick 3rd (1914-2000; married 1947, Eleanor Perry; three children, John Rodney, Melvin Gregory, and Thaddeus Merrick). Merrick was a great-grandson of Philadelphia philanthropist Samuel Vaughn Merrick (1801-1870).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the immediate trigger of the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> verdicts, various other factors have been cited as causes of the unrest. In the years preceding the riots, several other highly controversial incidents involving alleged police brutality or other perceived injustices against minorities were intensely scrutizined {{by the media and}} activist groups. The fatal shooting of black teenager Latasha Harlins by Korean American shop-owner Soon Ja Du, during a scuffle after Du mistakenly assumed Harlins was trying to steal a small container of orange juice, came just 13 days after the beating of <b>Rodney</b> <b>King.</b> Du's sentence of 5 years probation and 400 hours of community service but no jail time was pointed to as a potential reason for the riots, particularly for the aggression rioters expressed toward Korean Americans. Publications such as Newsweek and Time suggested that the source of these racial antagonisms was derived from perceptions amongst blacks that Korean-American merchants were 'taking money out of their community' and refusing to hire blacks to work in their shops. According to this view, these tensions were subsequently intensified by Du's light sentence for manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|In the Lake View Terrace {{district}} of Los Angeles, 200-400 protesters gathered near the Hansen Dam Recreation Center (at the site <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> was beaten in 1991) around 9:15 pm. The group marched south on Osborne Street to the LAPD Foothill Division headquarters. At that location, incidents of rock throwing, shooting into the air, and fires occurred. The Foothill division police used riot breaking techniques to disperse {{the crowd and}} arrest those responsible for rock throwing and the fires.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of March 3, 1991, <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> and two {{passengers}} were driving west on the Foothill Freeway (I-210) through the Lake View Terrace neighborhood of Los Angeles. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) attempted to initiate a traffic stop. A high-speed pursuit ensued with speeds estimated at up to , first over freeways and then through residential neighborhoods. When King finally came to a stop, CHP Officer Timothy Singer and his wife, CHP Officer Melanie Singer, ordered the occupants under arrest.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, the LAPD, {{which had}} {{followed}} a para-militaristic model since Chief Parker's {{regime in the}} 1950s, became more alienated from minority communities following accusations of racial profiling. In 1992, a jury in suburban Simi Valley acquitted white Los Angeles police officers involved in the beating of a black motorist, <b>Rodney</b> <b>King,</b> the year before. After four days of rioting, more than fifty deaths, {{and billions of dollars}} of property losses, mostly in the Central City, the National Guard and the police finally regained control.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with a consent decree. Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1965, an African-American {{motorist}} {{was arrested}} for suspicion of drunk driving. A minor roadside argument broke out, and then escalated into a fight. The community reacted in outrage to allegations of police brutality that soon spread, and six days of looting and arson followed. Los Angeles police needed the support of nearly 4,000 members of the California Army National Guard to quell the riots, which resulted in 34 deaths and over $40 million in property damage. The riots were blamed principally on police racism. It was the city's worst unrest until the <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots of 1992.|$|E
25|$|Fears grew {{that race}} riots would erupt again across Los Angeles {{and the rest}} of the country if Simpson was convicted of the murders. There were riots in 1992 after the {{acquittal}} of four police officers for the beating of black motorist <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> three years earlier (King's beating was captured on an amateur video). As a result, all L.A. police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the L.A. county courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the largest}} armed camps in Los Angeles's Koreatown was at the California Market. On the first night after the {{verdicts}} were returned {{in the trial of}} the four officers charged in the beating of <b>Rodney</b> <b>King,</b> Richard Rhee, the market owner, posted himself in the parking lot with about 20 armed employees. One year after the riots, fewer than one in four damaged or destroyed businesses reopened, according to the survey conducted by the Korean-American Inter-Agency Council. According to a Los Angeles Times survey conducted eleven months after the riots, almost 40% of Korean-Americans said they were thinking of leaving Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In March 1991, {{members of}} the Los Angeles Police Department harshly beat an African American suspect, <b>Rodney</b> <b>King,</b> while a white {{civilian}} videotaped the incident, leading to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the Los Angeles riots of 1992 commenced, causing 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing federal trial, {{two of the four}} officers were convicted and received 32 months prison sentence. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.|$|E
