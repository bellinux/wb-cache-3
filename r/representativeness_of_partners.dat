We earlier noted a qualified softening of the position of the OECD inter alia against extension agreements conditional on such factors as the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the social <b>partners</b> and the dispersion of productivity between firms. Note, however, {{that in the case of}} Portugal, the OECD (2012) flatly rejected extensions and recommended that they be abolished in their entirety. The OECD reasoned that extensions were used by dominant firms to impose higher wages and working conditions on others, reducing competition and entry in the process.|$|R

Firstly, performing artists generally do not see themselves as an employee, and secondly there is the continuing trend towards commercialisation.

30|$|Extension agreements, which {{characterize}} sectoral bargaining, {{can play}} a useful role, especially where sectors are characterized by large numbers of small firms and establishments which cannot carry firm-level bargaining. Extension agreements also reduce incentives to undercutting of reasonable employment conditions. However, the effects of extension agreements depend {{on the quality of}} the bargaining process and the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> social <b>partners.</b> At times, by allowing workers to benefit from bargaining outcomes even if they are not union members, they may decrease the representativeness, and by implication the legitimacy, of unions and, by so doing, decrease the quality of labor relations. This effect has been blamed, for example, for poor labor relations in France, where collective bargaining coverage is high but union membership is very low. Extension agreements should also provide enough flexibility when there is a wide dispersion of productivity between firms, by including top up agreements for the most profitable businesses or temporary opt-outs for firms requiring time to adjust as a result of adverse economic conditions.|$|R

40|$|Responding to {{internal}} market and social pressures that centre on the inadequate protection accorded to workers' rights, China's government has begun constructing a tripartite industrial relations regime. As this process matures, {{it is to}} be expected that it will {{have a significant impact on}} those business enterprises that elect to invest in China in order to capture the profits to be made by labour exploitation and may well change the national origin of China’s investment inflow. This paper examines the emerging tripartite consultation mechanisms that are being established by the government, trade unions and employers' organisations and explores three research questions relating to the viability of tripartism in China. It is concluded that, despite many constraints and limitations, the nascent system of tripartite consultation is becoming an integral part of China's industrial relations regime, and that gradually the tripartite mechanisms will enhance the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the social <b>partners</b> and further respect for the rights of labour in China...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] In 1998, the European Commission {{set out the}} {{framework}} for sectoral dialogue committees {{with the aim of}} promoting dialogue between sectoral social partners at European level. The committees were set up as the central fora for consultation, joint initiatives and negotiation for the given sectors. Union law does not make reference to the concept <b>of</b> <b>representativeness.</b> The Commission first used this concept in its 1993 Communication concerning the application of the Agreement on Social Policy. Representativeness became the key issue of dispute in a legal case in 1996 (UEAPME v. Council of the European Union, Case T- 135 / 96). UEAPME challenged the legality of the Parental Leave Directive and the dispute became the subject of litigation before the European Court of First Instance (CFI). The CFI asserted that agreements reached through the social dialogue – which are then incorporated into directives – may be challenged on grounds of their democratic legitimacy. CFI deemed this necessary, since the Directive was not subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. Since this ruling, it has been the legal responsibility of the European Commission to scrutinise to identify the European social partners who are eligible to engage in European social dialogue. In 2006, the European Commission mandated Eurofound to carry out studies on the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> European social <b>partner</b> organisations, with the aim of identifying the relevant national and supranational interest associations in the field of industrial relations in selected sectors. (Prior to 2006, the studies had been coordinated by the Catholic University of Louvain. ...|$|R

40|$|How {{do people}} {{determine}} which {{elements of a}} set are most representative of that set? We extend an existing Bayesian measure <b>of</b> <b>representativeness,</b> which indicates the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> a sample from a distribution, to define a measure <b>of</b> the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> an item to a set. We show that this measure is formally related to a machine learning method known as Bayesian Sets. Building on this connection, we derive an analytic expression for the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> objects described by a sparse vector of binary features. We then apply this measure to a large database of images, using it to determine which images are the most representative members of different sets. Comparing the resulting predictions to human judgments <b>of</b> <b>representativeness</b> provides a test of this measure with naturalistic stimuli, and illustrates how databases that are more commonly used in computer vision and machine learning {{can be used to}} evaluate psychological theories. ...|$|R

40|$|Both {{the amounts}} of data {{describing}} the site-scale carbon flux at a high temporal and spatial resolution collected in China {{and the number of}} eddy covariance flux towers have been increasing during the last decade. To correctly upscale these fluxes to the regional and global level, the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the current network of flux towers must be known. The present study quantifies the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the flux network for the regional carbon exchange. This analysis combined the total solar radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure and the enhanced vegetation index to indicate the environmental characteristics of each 1 -km pixel cell and flux tower. Next, the Euclidean distance from each pixel to the tower was calculated to determine the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the existing flux towers. To improve the regional representativeness, additional tower locations were pinpointed by identifying and clustering the underrepresented areas. The existing network of flux towers performed well in representing the environmental conditions of the middle and the northeastern portions of China. The well-represented areas covered 60. 9 % of the total areas. The towers in croplands and grasslands represented the vegetation types well, but the wetlands and barelands were poorly represented. The <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the flux network increased with the addition of nine towers located in forests, grasslands, wetlands and barelands. The <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> 27. 5 % of the land areas improved. In addition, the well-represented areas were enlarged by 15. 2 %. Substantial gains in representation were achieved by adding new towers on the Tibet Plateau. The <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the northwest and southwest was improved less significantly, suggesting that more towers are required to capture certain ecosystem behaviors.

Published studies involving {{different groups of}} diseases (viral, bacterial, and fungal) and conducted in different rice production ecosystems were compared to help identify research gaps, the filling of which could improve current disease management in rice and help in developing strategies that fit the management of fast-evolving rice production systems in the future. Four criteria <b>of</b> <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> yield loss information were used : representativeness over time (the proportion of studies conducted over more than one crop cycle), representativeness over space (the proportion of studies conducted {{in more than one}} location), <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> scale (the proportion of studies conducted on the scale of plots or fields), and <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> injury (the standard deviation of the proportion of studies using inoculation, spontaneous infection, or chemical control). A strong imbalance in both the number and the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> studies dealing with fungal, viral and bacterial diseases was found. Most of the few studies of yield loss due to viral diseases (mainly rice tungro disease) were conducted on the scale of individual (potted) plants or were based on one-year data sets, often reflecting strong epidemics only. Studies of bacterial diseases were conducted in single locations only, and whether such results can be extrapolated still needs to be addressed. There is an acute need to better document yield losses in rice ecosystems other than the irrigated ecosystem.

40|$|Despite of the {{existence}} of several techniques for emu-lating software faults, there are still open issues regarding <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the faults being injected. An impor-tant aspect, not considered by existing techniques, is the non-trivial activation condition (trigger) of real faults, which causes them to elude testing and remain hidden until operation. In this paper, we investigate how the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> injected software faults can be improved regarding the <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> triggers, by proposing a set of generic criteria to select representative faults from a faultload. We used the G-SWFIT technique to inject software faults in a DBMS, resulting in over 40 thousands faults and 2 mil-lion runs of a real test suite. We analyzed faults with respect to their triggers, and concluded that a non-negligible share (15 %) would not realistically elude testing. Our proposed criteria decreased the percentage of non-elusive faults in the faultload, improving its representativeness. ...|$|R

Data {{scarcity}} {{is a major}} scientific {{challenge for}} accuracy and precision of spatial interpolation of climatic fields, especially in climatestressed developing countries. Methodologies have been suggested for coping up with data scarcity but data have rarely been checked for their <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> corresponding climatic fields. Here, influences <b>of</b> number and <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> climate data on accuracy and precision of their spatial interpolation were investigated and compared. Two precipitation and temperature indices were computed {{for a long time}} series in Bangladesh, which is a data scarce region. The representativeness was quantified by dispersion in the data and the accuracy and precision of spatial interpolation were computed by four commonly used error statistics derived through cross-validation. The precipitation data showed very little and sometimes null representativeness whereas the temperature data showed very high <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding fields. Consequently, interpolated precipitation surfaces showed little accuracy and precision whereas temperature surfaces showed high accuracy and precision despite the scarce data. The results indicate that <b>representativeness</b> <b>of</b> climate data, i. e. variability of climate phenomenon, is more crucial than the number of data for accuracy and precision of spatial interpolation and should be treated with higher importance...|$|R
