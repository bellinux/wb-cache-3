He told the French art critic Michel Leiris, [...] "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as {{that would have been}} merely another kind of historical painting... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." [...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him [...] "the most exciting images, and I often read it... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> human blood smiles out at me', well what could be more amazing than that." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{characteristic}} of some grindcore songs is the [...] "microsong," [...] lasting {{only a few}} seconds.

In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song [...] "You Suffer" [...] set a new [...] "Shortest Music Video" [...] record: 1.3 seconds. Beyond the microsong, it is {{characteristic of}} grindcore to have short songs in general; for example, Carcass' debut album <b>Reek</b> <b>of</b> Putrefaction (1988) consists of 22 tracks with an average length of 1 minute and 48 seconds. It is also not uncommon for grindcore albums to be very short {{when compared to other}} genres, usually consisting of a large track list but having a total length of only 15 to 20 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Serene Lim, a {{reviewer}} for Today, labelled {{the film}} a [...] "gentle {{tale of a}} teenage romance".

Lim singled out Ko Chen-tung for praise, saying that [...] " [...] thoroughly deserves his Golden Horse nomination for Best Newcomer, given his turn as the impetuous rebel made good"; overall, she gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5.

500|$|The renewed {{interest}} in Axelrod's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue Song of Innocence in 2000. Now wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s, the songs had become [...] "a sampler's dream come true– who knew?" [...] David Keenan of The Wire attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy with producers such as DJ Premier and DJ Shadow to Palmer, [...] "the original badass drummer [...] played {{on all of these}} tracks". He facetiously critiqued that the album's songs [...] "may <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." [...] Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod's first two records were [...] "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having [...] "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for Complex, DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named [...] "Holy Thursday" [...] the greatest hip hop sample of all time.|$|E
500|$|Marc Hogan of Pitchfork {{called the}} song a [...] "so-wrong-it's-right {{collaboration}} with tastemaking Philadelphia DJ/producer Diplo." [...] Hogan wrote that [...] "It's here, dancing, with a chorus that Santigold and Gwen Stefani might kill for, that Robyn is free {{from all the}} worries that are [...] "killing" [...] her at the album's start." [...] Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] " [...] take on Jamaican music {{has the potential to}} <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> day-old Ace of Bass", but called it [...] "surprisingly solid". Noel Gardner of Drowned in Sound called it [...] "frankly peculiar", and wrote, [...] "It’s evidently laced with irony, and is possibly the most fun tune on here". Luke Lewis of NME wrote a mixed review of the song, stating, [...] "It feels less authentic, especially on ‘Dancefloor Queen’, a misfiring collaboration with Diplo that features the least convincing patois this side of a George Lamb radio show." ...|$|E

500|$|Napalm Death's seismic impact {{inspired}} other British grindcore {{groups in}} the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat. Extreme Noise Terror, from Ipswich, formed in 1984. With the goal of becoming [...] "the most extreme hardcore punk band of all time," [...] the group took Mick Harris from Napalm Death in 1987. Ian Glasper describes the group as [...] "pissed-off hateful noise with its roots somewhere between early Discharge and Disorder, with [...] Dean [...] and Phil [...] pushing their trademark vocal extremity to its absolute limit." [...] In 1991, the group collaborated with the acid house group The KLF, appearing onstage with the group at the Brit Awards in 1992. Carcass released <b>Reek</b> <b>of</b> Putrefaction in 1988, which John Peel declared his favorite {{album of the year}} despite its very poor production. The band's focus on gore and anatomical decay, lyrically and in sleeve artwork, inspired the goregrind subgenre. Sore Throat, said by Ian Glasper to have taken [...] "perhaps the most uncompromisingly anti-music stance" [...] were inspired by crust punk as well as industrial music. Some listeners, such as Digby Pearson, considered them to be simply an in-joke or parody of grindcore.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E
2500|$|If {{there is}} any word which might serve {{as a key to}} the {{philosophical}} and practical aims of Þeyr it is [...] "symmetry". They combine their belief in an inherent structure behind the manifestation of matter with intense experimental fervour that aims at unravelling at least a few practical applications of this [...] "divine proportion" [...] that determines the extent and amplitude of our aesthetic experience [...] The second study deals with the harmonic build up of music, and this has led to a study of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) whose work aimed at breaking up all classical rules of harmonic composition and ultimately at the founding of a new music that would escape the straitjacket of the 12-tone scale [...] He further sought to unite sensations such as smell, sight and hearing into one, and some of his later works were interpreted in colour as well as sound. This fascinating study is being pursued by Þeyr whose concerts have been known to <b>reek</b> <b>of</b> exotic incense and to be lighted by a certain blending of root colours. Ultimately these things will be married under the one heading which forms their third study, FOURIER. The Fourier as they jokingly refer to it is basically a machine that is being worked upon by one of the bands members who has a background in theoretical mathematics, physics and electrical engineering. However it has through time of construction (several proto-types of its main parts have already been constructed and some already discarded in favour of new ideas currently being worked on) come to represent an entirely new approach to the basic laws which underlie natural structures as ranging from the formation of crystals to harmonic scales that can be worked out of logarythmic spirals, these building in the scales 12. 17, 31, 55...n. making use of the basic laws and axioms supplied by the French mathematician and physicist J. B. Fourier. He {{has come up with a}} machine that makes use of the newest advances in computer technology but is controlled through a simple set of symbols which are ultimately part of the Fourier philosophy (as they jokingly refer to it) that is slowly but steadily being constructed by the band. The future user of the Fourier will need and extensive background in the writings of such diverse personalities as R. Buckminster Fuller, Giordano Bruno, the alchemical writings of Newton, not to mention Nyquist, Walsh and others which have worked upon the mathematics of music. See also under Life Transmission for their earlier explanation.|$|E
