40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{at low speed}} in a flat <b>plate</b> <b>rig</b> and a compressor cascade. The flat <b>plate</b> <b>rig</b> was used to optimise flow control by blowing with vortex generator jets. This study showed that a boundary layer separation could be prevented with the application of steady blowing at a jet velocity achievable in a real gas turbine compressor. Pulsed blowing was also studied, yielding {{a reduction in the}} injected mass flow rate of 40 %, but required an increase in the injected jet velocity. The recommendations of the flat plate study were applied to a cascade in order to establish the performance impact of flow control by blowing with vortex generator jets in an environment more representative of a real compressor. Together with endwall control, flow control was found to remove a separation occurring at high incidence and reduce the profile loss coefficient at midspan by 67 %. The skewed jets were, however, found to aggravate a corner separation occurring on the endwall of the cascade to which the jets were skewed, requiring additional endwall suction to be applied to yield a uniformly thin wake across the full blade span. For a blade with a representative aspect ratio, flow control by steady blowing with vortex generator jets was found to reduce the loss coefficient averaged over the full span by 20 % relative to the uncontrolled case. In addition to blowing, flow control was also applied in the cascade rig in the form of boundary layer suction. Suction was found to reduce the loss coefficient averaged over the full span by 33 % relative to the uncontrolled case. The optimal configurations identified were studied in terms of their impact on the engine cycle, when applied to reduce the solidity of a stator row. Flow control was found to enable a 35 % {{reduction in the number of}} blades at no cost to compressor efficiency. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} methodologies {{for assessing}} the friction between plantar skin and sock textiles are compared in this study. The first approach uses a custom-built friction <b>plate</b> <b>rig.</b> The rig consists of sock material mounted on a test plate attached to two load cells that measure normal and shear loads at the skin-sock textile interface. With this methodology, participants are required to slide their foot over the test plate whilst maintaining a targeted normal load and a relatively consistent sliding speed. The second approach uses a pneumatically-driven foot probe loading device. The device includes an instrumented probe with sock material on its contact surface. Participants are instructed to stand on a platform whilst the probe is applied to, and then driven across, the plantar aspect of foot. The cyclic motion of the probe is displacement-controlled and normal and shear loads are measured using load cells. Both approaches allow friction coefficients to be calculated from load data collected during the sliding phase of movement. Data from both approaches was examined, collected from friction tests using the same six participants and sliding contact between the first metatarsal head (1 MTH) region and textiles from two commercially available running socks. Both approaches were capable of measuring the friction between 1 MTH skin and sock materials and good agreement was found between them. In the dry conditions tested, the cotton-rich sock was found to provide lower friction that the anti-blister sock material...|$|R

The development of the Durham metacarpophalangeal prosthesis as it was taken from prototypes through to production samples, is described in this thesis. Testing of several Durham prostheses to over 70 million cycles {{has been carried out}} on a finger function simulator and consistent wear factors of the order of 0. 4 x 10 (^-) (^ 6) mm(^ 3) /Nm have been measured. These wear factors for the prosthesis were also significantly lower than any found previously. Production samples of the prosthesis have been manufactured together with appropriate surgical instrumentation. Tests of the prosthesis material, cross-linked polyethylene, rubbing against itself, have been undertaken on reciprocating pin on <b>plate</b> <b>rigs</b> and again show total wear factors of the order of 0. 4 x lO(^- 6) mm(^ 3) /Nm.

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the effect of}} unconstrained damping layers and an edge-supporting stiffener on the sound power radiated from a mechanically-driven honeycomb sandwich plate. The free wave equations of coupled flexural plate motion are first set up, {{taking into account the}} orthotropic core shear stiffness. Solutions of these equations have been found and computed wavespeed dispersion curves have been presented. The plate boundary conditions at an edge supported on a flexible beam have been established and the response of the plate to a point harmonic force on that beam has been analysed and computed. The sound power radiated from the baffled plate surface has been found from the pre-determined plate response by numerical evaluation of Rayleigh's integral. A computational study has shown that the orientation of the core principal axes of orthotropy relative to the edge beam can profoundly influence the level of the radiated sound power. The sound power reductions obtainable when unconstrained damping layers are added to the plate surface have been predicted and explained. Full account has been taken of the effect of the damping layers on the radiation efficiencies and total loss factors of the plates. Experiments to validate the theory have been conducted. A supporting <b>rig</b> for sandwich <b>plates</b> has been constructed which simulated three simply-supported and one stiffened edge condition. Response and radiated sound power measurements were made on three different plates. Tests were conducted with and without damping layers on the plates and the results compared favourably with those predicted from the theory and computer programmes.

These properties led to accurate predictions of the natural frequencies of simple sandwich beams, but the measured flexural loss factors of the beams were considerably different from predicted values...|$|R

The relative performance of the as-sprayed and hot isostatically pressed WC-NiCrBSi functionally graded coatings was investigated in sliding wear conditions. Results indicate that HIPing post-treatment can improve the sliding wear resistance of WC-NiCrBSi coatings. These coatings were deposited by a High Velocity Oxy-Fuel-JP 5000 system and HIPing process was carried out at two different temperatures of 850 ºC and 1200 ºC. This study shows that un-capsulated HIPing can be successfully applied to functionally graded WC-NiCrBSi coatings, which has economical as well as technical incentives for industrial applications. Sliding wear tests were carried out using a high frequency reciprocating ball on <b>plate</b> <b>rig</b> using steel and ceramic balls. Results are discussed in terms of powder manufacture method, microstructural investigations, phase transformation, mechanical properties and residual stress investigations. Phase analysis by x-ray diffraction revealed transformations, which altered the phase composition such as the elimination of secondary phase W 2 C and metallic W and the formation of new phases containing Ni, Si and B after the post-treatment. The measurements of hardness, Young’s modulus and residual stress indicate that substantial improvements can be achieved due to simultaneous application of temperature and pressure during the HIPing post-treatment. Hardness and Young’s modulus measured by indentation method, increased after the HIPing process due to the transformations in the morphology and phase composition of the coatings. The residual stress evaluations by sin 2 Ψ technique using synchrotron x-ray diffraction showed a relaxation of residual stress fields in the coating with increasing temperature of the HIPing process...|$|R
40|$|Ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear debris {{has been shown to}} be a major cause of long term failure of total joint replacements. In vitro studies have shown that not only is the size and shape of the particles important for cellular response but also the volumetric concentration of the particles. Recently, crosslinking has been extensively introduced to reduce the wear of UHMWPE. In this study the wear and wear debris of non-crosslinked and crosslinked UHMWPE were compared. The materials examined were UHMWPE GUR 1050, non crosslinked, moderately crosslinked - 5 MRad and highly crosslinked - IOMRad. The wear was examined on a multidirectional pin on <b>plate</b> <b>rig.</b> The first test looked at the wear of the UHMWPE's with different serum concentrations. The effect of counterface roughness with high multidirectionality against different counterfaces was then examined. The second test examined the effect of different counterface surfaces at lower multidirectionality. The debris produced was then analysed. The wear results from the first pin on plate study showed that serum concentration had a significant effect on the wear rate of non-crosslinked U}IMWPE. The high serum concentration resulted in a much higher wear rate than the lower serum concentration for the non-crosslinked UIHMWPE. The crosslinked UHMWPE's did not show any significant difference in wear rate with serum concentration. The results from the different counterface conditions showed that highly crosslinked UHMWPE significantly reduced wear against smooth and scratched counterfaces. The second pin on plate study showed that all the U MWPE's had lower wear rates than the previous study because of reduced cross shear frictional energy. As with the previous study the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had significantly lower wear rates against all the counterfaces, and there was no significant difference between the OMRad and 5 MRad UHMWPE. The reduction in wear rate found with the highly crosslinked UHMWPE was dependent on kinematics with less reduction with lower levels of cross shear frictional energy. The wear debris from the high multidirectional study on smooth and highly scratched plates was analysed. The use of field emission gun SEM revealed nanometre sized particles for the first time in all three materials under both counterface conditions. No significant difference was found in the percentage number and percentage area of the particles from any of the materials against any of the counterfaces although more larger wear particles were observed from the scratched counterface debris. The actual volumes of the particles showed that the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had a significantly lower volume in the 0. 1 - 1. 0 μm size range. This was an important observation as this is the most biologically active size range. The specific biological activity did not show any significant difference between the materials. The functional biological activity which takes into account the wear volume showed that the highly crosslinked UHMWPE had a lower FBA for debris from both the smooth and scratched counterfaces. The debris from the scratched tests had a higher FBA for all the materials because of the increased wear rates with the scratched counterface.

40|$|Introduction The Comecer ALCEO Metal {{system is}} {{intended}} to be a comprehensive solid targetry system, capable of all steps necessary to produce copper isotopes (60 Cu, 61 Cu & 64 Cu) from enriched nickel: plating, transfer to/from cyclotron, irradiation, and dissolution/purification. To develop plating and chemistry methods, we plate natural nickel, and irradiate with deuterons to produce 61 Cu. This alleviates the need for expensive enriched nickel isotopes, but gives a lower activity yield. We report a few issues with the ALCEO system, and some of our modifications. Material and Methods BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The ALCEO system uses cylindrical shuttles (dia 28 mm, height 35 mm) comprised of an Al body with a Pt well, onto which the Ni is plated. Shuttles are transferred pneumatically from the hot cell to the irradiation module, {{on the end of the}} cyclotron beamline. The plating and dissolution are both done at the electrochemical cell, located in the hot cell. This cell is connected by capillary tubes to the electrolytic solution reservoir (for plating), or the acid reservoir (for dissolution). These tubes form a recirculation loop, through which the fluid is propelled by an inline micropump throughout plating and dissolution. The platinum well is 16 mm in diameter, while an O-ring is used to plate only the center (6 mm in diameter). A constant DC voltage is applied. PLATING: We dissolve natural nickel nitrate (99. 999 % pure) into an electrolytic solution comprised of deionized water, ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride (pH = 9. 3). We use 30 – 100 mg of natNi in a 10 mg/mL solution. We have varied the ALCEO electrochemical cell voltage between 2. 25 – 3 VDC, and tried to maintain a low pump flow rate between 1 – 2 mL/min. The electrochemical cell uses a fixed metal tube as the anode (~ 3 mm above the plating surface). This tube also delivers the electrolytic plating solution to the Pt surface, forming part of the recirculating loop. The Pt surface is in contact with a gold-plated cathode. Due to issues discussed below, we have built a custom <b>plating</b> <b>rig</b> for the ALCEO shuttles, which does not use the pump/recirculation loop, but leaves the reservoir of electrolytic solution in place, atop the plating surface. A graphite rod is used for the anode, rotating offcenter ~ 2 mm above the plating surface. We use the same size O-ring to plate only the center 6 mm of the Pt surface, and apply a constant DC voltage. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The pneumatic transfer tube is 50 ft long between the hot cell and the cyclotron vault, and has a rise of 14 ft from under the floor to the ceiling of the cyclotron vault. IRRADIATION: The ALCEO irradiation module holds the plating surface orthogonal to the beam path. The module has a 10 -mil-thick (0. 010 ”) Al front foil, supported by a hex-grid. Once we realized the thickness, we replaced this with a 1 -mil-thick Al foil, followed by a 1 -mil-thick Havar foil. The foil is cooled by a flow of helium, while the shuttle and grid are cooled by a flow of water. The helium and water are cooled in heat ex-changers by chilled water. As initially plumbed, the chilled water flowed through the heat ex-changers in series, cooling the helium first, then the water. After initial runs, we plumbed the heat exchangers in parallel, teeing the chilled water to the supply of each heat exchanger, and teeing the returns together. Irradiation is performed with a PETtrace 800 accelerating deuterons to 8. 4 MeV on target. The beam current limit is 20 μA for the ALCEO Metal target. A set point of 19 μA is used to avoid the system tripping off. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The ALCEO system circulates 5 mL of 6 M HCl, while heating the shuttle to 100 ⁰C for 40 min. This solution is loaded onto a column containing 10 g of 200 – 400 mesh chromatographic resin in chloride form. A separation is performed yielding three solutions: The column is washed with 40 mL of 6 M HCl to obtain the Recovered Nickel Solution, then 20 mL of 4 M HCl to obtain the Cobalt Solution, then 10 mL of 0. 5 M HCl to obtain the Cop-per Product Solution. Results and Conclusion PLATING: Using the ALCEO method, the platings obtained had a tendency to mound, (up to 0. 75 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a lower density of 3 – 4 g/cm 3. This was attributed to the anode tube being fixed in place over the center of the plating surface. Using the custom rig, almost no mounding was observed, (0. 25 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a density of 7 g/cm 3, closer to nickel’s nominal density of 8. 9 g/cm 3. FIGS. 1 and 2 attempt to show the mounding from the ALCEO method, and relative flatness from the custom rig. Both methods give a rough, or “fuzzy” plated surface. FIG. 2 shows that the custom rig exaggerates this “fuzziness”. Using the ALCEO method, a slower pump speed (~ 1 mL/min) gives a smoother plating surface, but the pump has a tendency to lock up at this lower set point, stalling the plating. Using the ALCEO method, slight increases in the voltage (2. 65 V instead of 2. 25 V), can form thin stalagmites of nickel, electrically connecting the anode and the plating surface, ending the chance for a useable plating. Using the custom rig, no stalagmites are seen, adjusting the voltage from 2. 3 to 3. 0 V. This leads to the potential for a faster plating. Both the ALCEO method and the custom <b>rig</b> have obtained <b>plating</b> efficiencies of 95 %. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The shuttle typically transfers without issue in < 15 seconds. Once or twice it has remained in the transfer tube, but been retrieved by cycling the com-pressed air/vacuum a couple of times. IRRADIATION: During initial testing, the temperature of the return water rose rapidly during irradiation. This was attributed to the chilled water already gaining heat from the helium heat exchanger. Once the parallel chilled water plumbing was implemented, the water temperature rose much more slowly. Initial testing with the 10 -mil Al foils gave a very poor activity yield. The 1 -mil Al foil ruptured under the 20 psi helium pressure before beam was applied. The 1 -mil Havar foil produced 1. 57 mCi of 61 Cu at EOB, giving an activity yield of 0. 308 mCi/μAh (results summarized in TABLE 1). This compares to yields of 1. 4 obtained by [1], and 0. 29 obtained by [2] for deuterons on natNi. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The dissolution in 6 M HCl is close to 100 % efficient by weight. After purification, the three solutions were assayed by dose calibrator as summarized in TABLE 2. The purification is very efficient at removing the starting material, and long-lived Co isotopes from the Copper Product Solution, as seen with the 57 -hour EOB measurements. However, much of the desired 61 Cu is removed as well, with only 32 % remaining in the product. The lack of nuclide impurities in the Copper Product Solution was confirmed by gamma spectroscopy using a HP-Ge detector...|$|R
40|$|The drag {{developed}} on an object {{as it moves}} through a fluid comprises {{of a number of}} components arising from various and differing fluid phenomena. For aerodynamic bodies such as aircraft, one of the most dominant components of the total drag force is that arising from shear interactions between the surface of the object and the fluid. In steady, cruise conditions this shear-induced skin friction drag can account for almost 50 % of the total drag force on the body and hence this is the reason much interest surrounds the minimisation of this component. Laminar Flow Control (LFC) is the field of aerodynamics focused on minimising skin friction, or viscous drag. The viscosity of a fluid, and the shear interactions between the layers of fluid and the aerodynamic body give rise to a boundary layer, a region of fluid with diminished fluid velocity and momentum. Laminar Flow Control aims to minimise the momentum deficit within the boundary layer by manipulating the flow within and encouraging favourable flow conditions to exist and be maintained. In essence, Laminar Flow Control attempts to maintain laminar flow within the boundary layer, improving the stability of the flow, delaying the onset of turbulence and the formation of a turbulent boundary layer that develops significantly more drag than an equivalent laminar structure. A number of techniques exist for controlling and maintaining laminar flow within a boundary layer. Examples include compliant surfaces, acoustic arrays and suction, and all share the common trait of complexity, which to date has limited the application of such systems in the real world. In the search for simpler Laminar Flow Control technology, attention has been turned towards Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators as a possible alternative. Through the formation of a small volume of plasma, these actuators are capable of producing an electrostatic body force that can couple with the surrounding air and bring about a jetting effect without the addition of mass. This jetting effect, if controlled effectively, can potentially favourably augment a boundary layer flow and lead to a delay in transition. The work discussed in this thesis represents a contribution to the field of DBD-based Laminar Flow Control. The aim was to further investigate the potential of plasma actuators for improving the hydrodynamic stability of a boundary layer and hence contribute to the limited published data pertaining to this field. The research involved the development of a DBD-based LFC system in which plasma actuators were used to augment the most fundamental of boundary layer flows, the flat plate, Blasius-type. By measuring the augmentation to the velocity profile of the boundary layer brought about by the LFC system, the stability of the flow was able to be investigated and hence the feasibility of the technology determined. The plasma actuators utilised in this research were designed such that control could be achieved over the shape of the induced jetting profile. To minimise adverse interactions with boundary layer flows, the plasma actuators were designed so that the magnitude and position of the maximal induced jetting velocity could be controlled. After consultation of the literature, novel actuators utilising orthogonally arranged electrodes were conceived and tested in a parametric study. Through variation of the distance to which the exposed electrode sat proud above the surface of the actuator, in addition to variation of the applied voltage, {{it was found that the}} desired control over the induced jet could be attained, leading to the identification of two mechanisms through which the DBD-based LFC system could be tuned. The details of the design and development of these orthogonal actuators and the effect of the electrode height on the jetting characteristics of the devices can be found in Gibson et al. (2009 a) and Gibson et al. (2009 b). After identifying suitable and novel actuator arrangements, a tuning strategy was conceived to hasten the development of the LFC system. Rather than implementing the actuators and measuring the response of the boundary layer to the plasma first, Linear Stability Theory was instead used to identify desirable boundary layer augmentation objectives for the LFC system. Linear Stability Analyses (LSAs) were performed on a number of idealised boundary layer flows, obtained from curve fitting analytical functions to published DBDaugmented boundary layer data, as well as from boundary layer theory. The LSAs were conducted using an Orr-Sommerfeld Equation solver developed as part of this research, which utilises a finite differencing scheme. The outcome of this comparison process was that the developed DBD-based LFC system was used to attempt to augment the boundary layer such that the flow attained an asymptotic suction velocity profile, which would give the boundary layer a limit of stability almost two orders of magnitude greater than that of the base flow, and hence significant robustness to transition. The conceived DBD-based LFC system was implemented into a Blasiusv type boundary layer which was formed over the Flat <b>Plate</b> <b>Rig</b> (FPR) designed and developed as part of this research. Initially a single actuator was utilised, positioned just upstream of the location of the critical Reynolds Number (limit of stability) of the flow. Due to the design of the FPR and the actuators utilised, it was possible to study the response of the layer to the plasma with and without a mild suction effect, introduced through a 5 mm wide slot that was required for operation of the actuator. This mild suction effect was measured to be approximately 4 Pa, and by itself was found to be insufficiently strong enough to augment the flow such that it attained the characteristics of a boundary layer with uniform wall suction. With the FPR, measurements of the velocity profile of the boundary layer with and without flow control were made around the critical Reynolds Number location of the flow (80000 < Rex < 120000), which allowed the changes to the stability of the flow to be studied. As discussed in Gibson et al. (2012) the initial results of the DBD-based LFC system showed that the plasma was adversely affecting the stability of the flow. Subsequent tuning of the system was therefore performed through variation of the applied voltage of the actuator. From this tuning it was found that an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 19. 0 kVpp (referred to as a low-voltage actuator) in conjunction with the mild suction effect, produced boundary layer characteristics akin to those of a flow exposed to uniform wall suction. In addition, an actuator operated with an applied voltage of 21. 4 kVpp (referred to as a high-voltage actuator) was found to adversely affect the stability, even more so in the absence of the mild suction effect. The single low-voltage actuator was found to be able to maintain uniform wall suction-like characteristics for 50 mm beyond the trailing edge of the encapsulated electrode. This finding pertaining to the use of the low-voltage actuator highlighted the potential of a single DBD device to develop uniform wall suction-like characteristics with only a mild suction effect through a single slot, and hence in a less complex fashion than conventional suction systems. An attempt was made to maintain the favourable benefits of the single, low-voltage actuator by using two such actuators placed in series. However, the effect of this combined double-actuator/suction system differed only slightly from the suction-only system (with two slots instead of one), meaning that in this configuration, the use of the plasma was somewhat superfluous. Hence it could be concluded from the results of the research that a single low-voltage actuator operated in conjunction with a mild suction effect is more effective as a LFC system than a single mild-suction slot, but a combined double-low-voltage actuator/suction system is no better than a simpler and less energy consuming double-mild-suction slot system. It is, however, anticipated that through the undertaking of future works, utilising additional actuators that have undergone further tuning, a LFC even more effective than the double suction slot system tested in this research will ultimately be developed.
