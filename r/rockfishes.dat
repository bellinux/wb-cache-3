5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, <b>rockfishes,</b> lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become a major source of food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E

500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey.

Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the bluntnose sixgill shark, while adults likely face few threats.

40|$|Life-history {{information}} {{is extremely important}} in fisheries management, especially details regarding age, fecundity, growth, food habits, and so on. Such knowledge has been lacking for the principal species comprising commercial <b>rockfish</b> catches from California waters. Recent studies have furnished details on annual growth, size and age at maturity, weight-length relationship, season of spawning, fecundity, and feeding habits for 10 species of <b>rockfish</b> (genus Sebastodes) that are commonly taken off California. These are bocaccio, S. paucispinis, chilipepper, S. goodei, yellowtail <b>rockfish,</b> S. flavidus, canary <b>rockfish,</b> S. pinniger, vermilion <b>rockfish,</b> S. miniatus, widow <b>rockfish,</b> S. entomelas, dark-blotched <b>rockfish,</b> S. crameri, splitnose <b>rockfish</b> (rosefish), S. diploproa, stripetail <b>rockfish,</b> S. saxicola, and shortbelly <b>rockfish,</b> S. jordani. Although 57 varieties of scorpaenids (family Scorpaenidae) exist {{off the coast of}} western North America, only two had been studied in any detail prior to this time. Wales (1952) published a partial life history of the blue <b>rockfish,</b> Sebastodes mystinus, and Westrheim (1958), and Alverson and Westrheim (1961) published data on the biology of the Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus. The blue <b>rockfish</b> is a shallow water form, caught mainly by sportfishermen in California. Although poorly represented off California, Pacific ocean perch are abundant in offshore waters of the Pacific Northwest, where they are the primary <b>rockfish</b> sought by otter trawl fishermen. In California waters, the <b>rockfish</b> family is now represented by 50 species of Sebastodes (<b>rockfish</b> or "rock cod"), 2 species of Sebastolobus (channel <b>rockfish),</b> and 1 of Scorpaena (sculpin). This fish family {{is one of the most}} important and colorful in our waters. Most of the species are highly desirable for food and are subjected to both commercial and sportfishing pressure. Only a few are too small to be of direct value for human consumption. Even these are utilized as food by other fishes, often by larger forms of <b>rockfish.</b> Nine of the species in the present study are of considerable commercial value; the tenth, the shortbelly <b>rockfish,</b> is a small form whose greatest value probably is as food for salmon (Merkel, 1957) and similar predators. As time permits and based upon future catch composition evaluations, other prominent species will be studied in similar detail. The most important of these at present seem to be the shortspine channel <b>rockfish,</b> Sebastolobus alascanus, and flag <b>rockfish,</b> Sebastodes rubrivinctus, in northern California; the speckled <b>rockfish,</b> S. ovalis, in central California; and the bronzespotted <b>rockfish,</b> S. gilli and cow <b>rockfish,</b> S. levis, in southern California...|$|R

To better understand the site fidelity, and daily and seasonal movements of blue <b>rockfish</b> over long (> 1 -year) time scales, we placed acoustic transmitters into 21 adult blue <b>rockfish</b> (30 - 41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California. Blue <b>rockfish</b> displayed intermediate movement patterns and residency relative to other similar kelp forest <b>rockfish</b> species. Two-thirds of tagged blue <b>rockfish</b> (13 fish) exhibited high residency to the study area (> 12 mo). When in residence, mean home range of blue <b>rockfish</b> was 0. 23 km 2, however as many as 30 % of tagged blue <b>rockfish</b> shifted their core home range area during the study. Most shifts in home range occurred during upwelling season, and tagged fish moved up to 3. 1 km when in residence. Blue <b>rockfish</b> with short residence times were last detected in the study area in late winter and early spring. Blue <b>rockfish</b> were observed at shallower depths during day than night, likely indicative of diurnal feeding. However, over longer time scales, blue <b>rockfish</b> were detected at deeper depths during upwelling periods and with increased wave heights.

The best model included a negative relationship with longitude and positive relationship with bottom ruggedness. I also used large-scale spatial predictors to estimate historical landings of each species, finding that the inclusion of trap longline commercial data after 2006 caused an increase in the relative proportion of Blackspotted <b>Rockfish</b> caught (out of the total Rougheye/Blackspotted <b>Rockfish</b> landings). Finally, I examined observer accuracy in distinguishing Blackspotted and Rougheye <b>Rockfish</b> and found that while 86 % of fish were identified correctly, Blackspotted <b>Rockfish</b> {{were more likely to be}} misidentified, leading to a 55 % overestimate of the actual Rougheye <b>Rockfish</b> catch and a 14 % underestimate of the Blackspotted <b>Rockfish</b> catch.
