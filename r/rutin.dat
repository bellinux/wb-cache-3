25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are heat-stable and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, quercetin and <b>rutin,</b> have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Total {{polyphenols}} in mg per 100g {{of fresh}} weight were 14–102 in white-flesh nectarines, 18–54 in yellow-flesh nectarines, 28–111 in white-flesh peaches, and 21–61mg per 100g in yellow-flesh peaches. The major phenolic compounds identified in peach are chlorogenic acid, catechins and epicatechins, with other compounds, identified by HPLC, including gallic acid and ellagic acid. <b>Rutin</b> and isoquercetin {{are the primary}} flavonols found in clingstone peaches.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{addition}} of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked {{the effect of the}} mantle in terms of root proliferation, root hair development and dichotomous branching. Some of these exudates act synergistically upon hyphal morphology, as with <b>rutin</b> (a flavonol) and zeatin (a cytokinin). However, some other metabolites act antagonistically, demonstrated by root development stemming from the release of hypaphorine and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit root development above certain concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, <b>rutin,</b> saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E

2500|$|Vitamin C is {{available}} in tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25mg to 1500mg per serving. The most commonly used compounds are ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. Timed release versions are available, as are formulations containing bioflavonoids such as quercetin, hesperidin, and <b>rutin.</b> In some countries, vitamin C as ascorbic acid crystals {{is available}} in bottles containing 300g to 1kg of powder. The bottles are usually airtight and brown or opaque {{in order to prevent}} oxidation. Vitamin C molecules can be bound to fatty acids, creating a compound described as esterified vitamin C. This is not the same process used to create a commercial product [...] "Ester-C" [...] which neutralizes ascorbic acid with calcium carbonate to create calcium ascorbate. Lastly, commercial supplements of liposomal vitamin C are marketed, but the bioavailability of such products is not sufficiently studied to determine any difference from other forms of vitamin C.|$|E
