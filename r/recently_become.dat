But AM has <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> a nostalgic specialty interest on the shortwave ham bands.

5|$|Rossia was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} repeat of the armored cruiser , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship's side. However the design went through a number of changes during late 1892 and early 1893 and incorporated a number of technological advances that had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> available. One notable change was the deletion of Ruriks sailing rig.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Garza was a second grade teacher; she taught indigent {{students}} at an elementary school {{on the south side of}} McAllen. In a letter that Garza wrote to a friend shortly before her disappearance, Garza described herself as extremely shy, but she expressed fulfillment in her work. Noting that she had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more confident in herself. A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E

It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of}} the few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> interested in trying again.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> {{a subject of}} serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E
5|$|Oswald of Worcester (died 29 February 992) was Archbishop of York from 972 to {{his death}} in 992. He was of Danish ancestry, but brought up by his uncle, Oda, who sent him to France to the abbey of Fleury to become a monk. After {{a number of years}} at Fleury, Oswald {{returned}} to England at the request of his uncle, who died before Oswald returned. With his uncle's death, Oswald needed a patron and turned to another kinsman, Oskytel, who had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> Archbishop of York. His activity for Oskytel attracted the notice of Archbishop Dunstan who had Oswald consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. In 972, Oswald was promoted to the see of York, although he continued to hold Worcester also.|$|E

5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> threatened with extinction. It is estimated {{that there are only}} a few thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring for over a century following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore (Polynesian rats) had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total tuatara population had become extinct in the past century.|$|E
5|$|Athens had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In {{their fight}} to {{establish}} the democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E

5|$|Development on Gotcha {{began in}} July 1973, as Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. The company was {{interested}} in producing a very different game from their previous success of Pong, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. After the release of Space Race, development immediately moved on to Gotcha. The design of the game was done by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong and developer for Space Race. Alcorn had {{the idea for the}} game from a defect he sometimes saw when testing Pong machines: if part of the circuit that converted scores to images on the screens was broken, then parts of the numbers would be scattered across the screen. Alcorn thought that combining that defect intentionally with a motion circuit could create dynamically changing mazes. A prototype design was developed by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, which had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of her arrival in Aldeburgh Imogen gave {{considerable}} support and assistance to the Aldeburgh Festival, as a conductor and, from 1953, increasingly as a planner and organiser. In 1956 her position was formalised, and she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. At the 1956 festival she fulfilled a long-held ambition by arranging a performance of Gustav Holst's opera Savitri, the first of several Holst works that she introduced to the festival. Savitri was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of John Blow's 17th century opera Venus and Adonis. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts devoted to early music, and in 1962 she organised a series of evening concerts of Flemish music, in which she had more <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> interested. She also devised frequent programmes devoted to church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Imogen had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1367, William de Ufford and Thomas Beauchamp were going overseas, {{probably}} on a crusade to Prussia. On 4 November 1369, William's father died, shortly after his oldest son Robert, who was childless. William, who was now the heir of the family, was invested with the earldom of Suffolk soon after. As earl of Suffolk he participated in several campaigns in the rather unsuccessful stage of the Hundred Years' War in the 1370s, along with Beauchamp, who had <b>recently</b> <b>become</b> Earl of Warwick. They escorted King Charles II of Navarre to and from Cherbourg for his visit to England in 1370. In 1372, they were summoned by King Edward III for an abortive expedition to France, and in 1373–74, they accompanied the king's son John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, on the prince's fruitless chevauchée from Calais to Bordeaux. In 1375 or 1376, the Order of the Garter was bestowed on Suffolk. Also around this time, {{the relationship between the}} earls of Suffolk and Warwick was strengthened further. Suffolk's first wife Joan must have died at some unknown point before 1376, when he married Isabel, Warwick's sister.|$|E
