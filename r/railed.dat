5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be <b>railed</b> to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he <b>railed</b> against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E

50|$|The {{reference}} <b>rail</b> is {{the base}} <b>rail</b> {{that is used}} as a reference point for the measurement. It can vary in different countries. Most countries use one of the <b>rails</b> as the reference <b>rail.</b> For example, the United States uses the reference <b>rail</b> as the line <b>rail</b> which is the east <b>rail</b> of tangent track running north and south, the north <b>rail</b> of tangent track running east and west, the outer <b>rail</b> (the <b>rail</b> that is further away from the center) on curves, or the outside <b>rails</b> in multiple track territory. For Swiss railroad, the reference <b>rail</b> for tangent track is the center line between two <b>rails,</b> but it is the outside <b>rail</b> for curved track.|$|R
5|$|Higher-speed <b>rail</b> (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} <b>rail,</b> higher-performance <b>rail,</b> or almost-high-speed <b>rail,</b> is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger <b>rail</b> services that have top speeds of more than conventional <b>rail</b> but are not high enough to be called high-speed <b>rail</b> services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental <b>rail</b> improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high-speed <b>rail</b> networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed <b>rail,</b> or semi-high speed <b>rail</b> instead.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, <b>railed</b> against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu <b>railed</b> against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He <b>railed</b> against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.|$|E

5|$|Work {{was carried}} out between 1616 and 1733, {{bringing}} the castle back into good order. As part of this, the spine wall was rebuilt properly, and the second floor windows enlarged. The courtroom featured a chair for the Stannary court judge, additional seating for the court officials and a <b>railed,</b> public section around {{the outside of the}} room. The courtroom also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts. At the start of the 19th century, however, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, began the construction of Dartmoor Prison at Princetown. Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} slipway {{was built}} at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod, named after the city, began on 13 April. Using two shifts to speed construction, her hull was completed by 29 December, when the official keel-laying ceremony was held. Within two weeks it was disassembled, and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872. Reassembly began on a specially-prepared slipway eight days later. As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev, the components had to be <b>railed</b> to Odessa, where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers. The boilers were too large {{and had to be}} shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce's lack of experience; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873, with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance. Novgorods guns were mounted in September, and she entered service the following year, at a cost of 2,830,000 rubles.|$|E
5|$|Although Kennedy Martin's notion for {{the serial}} was {{influenced}} by real political events, he had {{for a long time}} <b>railed</b> against naturalism in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled “Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television”, in which he sought “to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera”. Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that “there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic”. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.|$|E
