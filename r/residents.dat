40|$|Background A 26 -item <b>Resident</b> Choice Scale was {{designed}} to assess service practices for promoting <b>resident</b> choice. Method The staff working with 560 UK/Irish adults with intellectual disability were interviewed. Specific examples of practices promoting <b>resident</b> choice were requested and independently rated by the interviewer. Results The interrater reliability of <b>Resident</b> Choice items {{was found to be}} acceptable (subsample n = 50). The psychometric properties of the <b>Resident</b> Choice Scale total score and scores on eight subscales were also acceptable. Consistently strong associations were found between greater <b>resident</b> choice and greater <b>resident</b> ability and, to a lesser extent, fewer <b>resident</b> challenging behaviours. Few associations were found between <b>resident</b> choice and autism or mental health problems. Even when controlling for <b>resident</b> ability and challenging behaviour, consistent associations were found between greater <b>resident</b> choice and the concurrent variables of greater community presence, fewer institutional practices, and greater user self-reported satisfaction (subsample n = 50). Conclusions Taken together, this pattern of results indicates that the <b>Resident</b> Choice Scale shows promise as a measure of the environmental opportunities available for adults with intellectual disability to exercise self-determination. Areas for future research testing {{the reliability and validity of}} the <b>Resident</b> Choice Scale are outlined...|$|R
