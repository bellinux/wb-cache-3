40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{quantitative}} model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics. New {{goods and services}} are endogenously produced through combinations of <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As soon as new goods enter the market they may compete against already <b>existing</b> <b>goods,</b> in other words new products can have destructive effects on <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As {{a result of this}} competition mechanism <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary defects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic dynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by phases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as Schumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and productivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long timescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed distributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open, non-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical system. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology of the active production networks. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{informal}} {{model is}} described {{that leads to}} multiple macroeconomic equilibria {{as a consequence of}} random variation in the relative amounts of technological change for new and <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> The novel observation is that the rate of introduction and market penetration of new goods (sometimes called product innovation) vis-à-vis technological advance for <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> (sometimes called process innovation) importantly affects the labor supply decision. A relatively rapid influx of new goods will generally increase labor supply, while relatively more technological advance for <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> will reduce labor supply to the market. These impacts are seen to provide insights into Rostow’s stages of growth. Short run variations in the relative importance of the two types of technological change are seen to imply unpredictable business cycle behavior of the type we observe. The welfare implications of national income accounting that fails to consider changes in leisure are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Market {{penetration}} {{refers to}} the successful selling of a product or service in a specific market, {{and it is a}} measure of the amount of sales volume of an <b>existing</b> <b>good</b> or service compared to the total target market for that product or service. Market penetration involves targeting on selling <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> or services in the targeted markets to increase a better market share/value (Arkolakis, 2010). It can be achieved in four different way including growing the market share of current goods or services; obtaining dominance of existing markets; reforming a mature market by monopolising the market and driving out competitors; or increasing consumptions by existing customers (Free Management Ebooks, 2013).|$|R

40|$|Several N -alkyl and N, N -dialkylaminomethanesulfonic acids were {{synthesized}} (as zwitterions and/or sodium salts) to {{be tested}} for utility as biological buffers at lower pH levels than <b>existing</b> <b>Good</b> buffer compounds (aminoalkanesulfonates with a minimum of two carbons between amine and sulfonic acid groups as originally described by Norman Good, and in common use as biological buffers). Our hypothesis was that a shorter carbon chain (one carbon) between the amino and sulfonic acid groups should lower the ammonium ion p K a values. The alkylaminomethanesulfonate compounds were synthesized in aqueous solution by reaction of primary or secondary amines with formaldehyde/sodium hydrogensulfite addition compound. The p K a values of the ammonium ions of this series of compounds (compared to <b>existing</b> <b>Good</b> buffers) was found to correlate well with the length of the carbon chain between the amino and sulfonate moeties, with a significant decrease in amine basicity in the aminomethanesulfonate compounds (p K a decrease of 2 units or more compared to <b>existing</b> <b>Good</b> buffers). An exception was found for the 2 -hydroxypiperazine series which shows only a small p K a decrease, probably due to the site of protonation in this compound (as confirmed by X-ray crystal structure).

Several of these compounds have p K a values that would indicate potential utility for buffering at pH levels below the normal physiological range (p K a values in the range of 3 to 6 without aqueous solubility problems) &# 8211; a range that is problematic for currently available Good buffers.

A logit analysis is conducted to estimate the effects of local monopoly power, cost advantages, and learning.

While the chemical similarity of products has the largest effect, results nonetheless indicate the empirical significance of potential monopoly power in influencing product introductions by multiproduct firms. ...|$|R

A discriminative scheme is exploited to gather harmonic information according to the piecewise continuity of autocorrelation peaks across different frequency channels within a time frame.

Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed system gains excellent results in veracity and integrality comparing with <b>existing</b> <b>good</b> algorithms of multi-pitch detection for co-channel speech.
