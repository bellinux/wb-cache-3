50|$|<b>Rent</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{is a form}} of {{insurance}} where, for a relatively small annual fee, landlords can protect against loss of rent. Normally, 'Landlord <b>Rent</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Insurance' is combined with 'Legal Assistance Insurance' whereby a landlord's legal costs of recovering rent and/or evicting a non-paying tenant are covered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rent</b> <b>Guarantee</b> {{insurance}} {{is different from}} a Guaranteed Rent scheme, which is a service that manages a residential property {{in return for a}} fixed portion of the rent. The owner is paid his share, even if the property is empty or tenants default on the rent: in that sense, it functions as a form of insurance.|$|E

50|$|Most lessor {{accounting}} is not substantially changed between ASC 840 and ASC 842. The {{change from}} executory costs to nonlease components, discussed above, applies equally to lessors. Leveraged leasing is discontinued, though leveraged leases entered into before the effective date of ASC 842 {{can continue to}} be accounted for under ASC 840 unless they are modified. The distinction between sales-type and direct financing leases has changed: whereas in ASC 840 the test was whether the fair value of the leased asset {{was different from the}} lessor's cost or carrying amount (if so, the lease is a sales-type lease), in ASC 842, any lessor lease that meets the lessee finance lease tests (based on <b>rents</b> and <b>guaranteed</b> residuals due from the lessee) is a sales-type lease; direct financing treatment applies if the lease is capital only because a third-party residual guarantee causes the present value test to be met.|$|R
50|$|Northwood's key {{difference}} in the lettings market is its <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Rent</b> service. With the service, Northwood essentially becomes the tenant, paying the landlord a fixed monthly rental income whilst taking away all the risk and hassle normally associated with letting out a property. Northwood then sub-let the property through an assured shorthold tenancy and manage {{all aspects of the}} same. Northwood takes on the risks and pays the landlord rent even if the tenant doesn't pay. They further cover any legal costs if action is necessary and even cover void periods. This is not done through an insurance policy and such there is no excess nor limitations of cover.|$|R
50|$|For an {{operating}} lease, a liability and a right-of-use asset {{are set up}} at lease inception, at {{the present value of}} the <b>rents</b> plus any <b>guaranteed</b> residual. To the asset is added any initial direct costs and subtracted any lease incentives (such as a tenant improvement allowance). The liability is amortized using the interest method (like a mortgage). If the lease has the same rent over its life, the net asset at any point is equal to the liability, plus the unamortized balance of initial direct costs and lease incentives. If the rents change during the lease term, the difference between the cash rent and average rent is added to or subtracted from the asset as well.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{the waiting}} list for state houses was 45,000, {{and a total of}} 30,000 houses had been built. The National Government {{increased}} rents for new tenants to make state housing less desirable compared with private renting, and an income limit of £520 per annum was set to ensure that only those on fairly modest incomes could rent a state house. A points system was introduced to decide which applicants for houses had the greatest need. This system was refined in 1973 and continued until 1992. The Government also introduced the sale of state houses to their occupants in August 1950. They offered 40-year mortgages on a 5% deposit at 4% interest, or 3% if the tenant agreed to continuously own and occupy the property. Many tenants were content to continue to <b>rent</b> with their <b>guaranteed</b> tenancies. By 1957, about 30% of the available houses had sold, which was considerably less than the government hoped.|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} and evaluation of new algorithms, architectures and technologies, {{a huge amount of}} benchmark circuits with suitable characteristic parameters are required. Synthetic circuits are a viable alternative to real circuits for compiling benchmark suites. A major advantage of synthetic benchmark circuits is that full control of the important parameters is provided. In this paper, an existing netlist generation algorithm based on bottom-up clustering of subcircuits according to Rent's rule is extended to generate circuits that are more realistic than before. The stochastic properties of the Rent behavior are taken into account, and improvements have been made to increase the accuracy of the imposed <b>Rent</b> characteristics. This <b>guarantees</b> a realistic structure of the interconnection topology, which can be adjusted in a controlled manner. A scheme for combinational loop prevention has been augmented with a delay control mechanism, such that they are truly suitable for timing-driven applications.

40|$|Tariff rate quotas (TRQs) {{have been}} {{introduced}} and legitimised as a market access instrument in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA). TRQs combine both restriction of imports, and safeguard of current or preferential agricultural trade flows. By restricting the market access through high level tariff beyond the quota, one can imagine that exporters enjoying low level tariff would take share of quota rent. Do developing exporting countries benefit from EU TRQs? Do they enjoy quota <b>rents</b> or <b>guaranteed</b> market access? What should be their interest to defend about TRQs at WTO agricultural negotiations? This article aims to present {{an analysis of the}} 87 EU's agricultural TRQs implementation from 1997 to 2002, in order to bring to the fore the effects of such an import instrument for exporting countries in competition on the import market. Some theoretical elements of the economy of TRQs are first presented in order to introduce the empirical work. The database built is then used to interpret EU agricultural TRQs implementation during the period 1997 - 2002, and the global results in terms of potential total rent that one can theoretically expect from TRQs is detailed by products grouping and export country grouping. A first examination of the database shows that while preference margin is potentially high for TRQs as a whole, potential rent is not so high. Moreover, this potential rent seems to be concentrated on only bananas and sugar, because TRQs are actually binding for those two commodities. A focus on those products indicates that only few exporting countries are susceptible to enjoy this potential rent: Latin American for bananas and ACP for sugar. However that does not signify that TRQs may be eliminated without big losses for exporters: they actually procure guaranteed EU's market shares protected from foreign competition. tariff rate quotas, quota rent, developing countries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{rights in}} Ireland remain very much underdeveloped, while the State {{suffers from a}} major {{property}} price hangover. While housing production boomed in the new century, waiting lists for social housing have grown over the decade with the category where access was blocked through affordability problems increasing to over half of those included. The State promoted home ownership and market provided housing {{for the past three}} decades, with the result that market values have pervaded all aspects of housing, including a redefinition of social housing. Housing market rescue measures and support for failed financial institutions have press-ganged social housing in Ireland to mop up the oversupply of houses built and repay the large developer loans through recycling State <b>guaranteed</b> <b>rents</b> to poor tenants. Indeed, a new scheme, known as 2 ̆ 7 incremental ownership 2 ̆ 7 promotes a new subsidised home ownership arrangement for what would have previously been rented accommodation. While, the practice of sub-prime lending to those with non-traditional working arrangments or low incomes was not prevalent in Ireland, in many ways the State is now acting as the ultimate sub-prime, encouraging those in need of social rented housing into home ownership. Significant numbers of homeowners who purchased their homes {{in the past three years}} are now in negative equity, and for those who become unemployed, the risk of losing their homes are very real. However, a number of developments have taken place which indirectly impact on housing rights in relation to public sector tenants, new forms of social housing and increased protection for private tenants and borrowers of home loans...|$|R
40|$|This thesis applies agency {{theory to}} design risk {{regulatory}} {{policies in the}} implementation of sustainable sea defences. The aim is to investigate methods to reduce the probability of an accident inflicted on the society by resolving a downstream and an upstream moral hazard problem existing in engineering problems with an emphasis on the construction of sustainable sea defences. The risk regulation aims at reducing the probability of damage cost associated with flooding by enhancing an operator's safety operational procedures. It is defined by three policies; a safety design, a transfer payment, and a fine. In the downstream moral hazard between an operator and a regulator, a risk neutral operator under full liability will implement a sea defence which is optimal from the regulator's point of view when a fine is set equal to damage cost without a cost for the regulator. However, if the operator has limited assets to cover the damage cost, a cap on the operator's fine is placed to take into account that an operator may default if damage costs are too high. Limiting the responsibility of the operator in case of an accident decreases the strength of the incentive mechanism leading to the implementation of a sea defence below the socially optimum. This second best height of the sea defence involves an informational cost to the society {{in the form of a}} liability <b>rent</b> to <b>guarantee</b> the participation of the operator in the engineering project. The more we make the operator liable for the damage cost, the higher the liability rent. The society faces a trade off between liability rent and residual risk. The higher the residual risk, the lower the liability rent. Unlike the limited liability case, an operator with averse attitude to uncertain payoffs will implement a sea defence higher than a risk neutral operator in order to reduce the weight on the upper extreme values of the tail of the fine. This is because the marginal fine decreases under risk aversion. Similarly to the limited liability case, the implementation of a second best height of the sea defence is not free for the society. The society will have to compensate the operator for participating in the project in the presence of uncertain payoffs. This compensation takes the form of a risk premium and is subject to the risk coefficient and the variance of the damage cost distribution. Due to the lack of regulatory quality and independence, a pro-industry regulator and a government may have conflicting interest about the fine cap to impose to the operator. While the regulator prefers a higher fine cap to induce a higher liability rent, the government seeks to impose a lower fine cap. The government faces a trade off problem between how much discretion should be given up and how much expert information should be used from the regulator. In the case when the government observes that any of the fine cap choices available to the regulator is higher than its ex-ante choice of the fine cap, no discretion will be granted because the cost to the society outweighs the benefits of using the regulator's expertise. Nevertheless, when the government observes that some of the fine cap choices available to the regulator are lower than its ex-ante choice of the fine cap some level of discretion can be granted. The limit on the fine caps that the regulator can announce is determined by how much the regulator is biased towards the interests of the nuclear industry. When the regulator's range of fine caps is optimally restricted, the objectives of the regulator and the operator will be aligned by encouraging the regulator to choose a fine cap that will not exceed the optimal fine cap of the government...|$|R
