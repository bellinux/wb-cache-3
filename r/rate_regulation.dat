25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive <b>rate</b> <b>regulation</b> by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of transcriptomic tools has allowed exhaustive description of stress responses. These responses always superimpose a general response associated to growth rate decrease and a specific one {{corresponding to the}} stress. The exclusive growth rate response can be achieved through chemostat cultivation, enabling all parameters to remain constant except the growth rate. Results We analysed metabolic and transcriptomic responses of Lactococcus lactis in continuous cultures at different growth rates ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 47 h - 1. Growth rate was conditioned by isoleucine supply. Although carbon metabolism was constant and homolactic, a widespread transcriptomic response involving 30 % of the genome was observed. The expression of genes encoding physiological functions associated with biogenesis increased with growth rate (transcription, translation, fatty acid and phospholipids metabolism). Many phages, prophages and transposon related genes were down regulated as growth rate increased. The growth rate response was compared to carbon and amino-acid starvation transcriptomic responses, revealing constant and significant involvement of growth <b>rate</b> <b>regulations</b> in these two stressful conditions (overlap 27 %). Two regulators potentially involved in the growth <b>rate</b> <b>regulations,</b> llrE and yabB, have been identified. Moreover it was established that genes positively regulated by growth rate are preferentially located {{in the vicinity of}} replication origin while those negatively regulated are mainly encountered at the opposite, thus indicating the relationship between genes expression and their location on chromosome. Although stringent response mechanism is considered as the one governing growth deceleration in bacteria, the rigorous comparison of the two transcriptomic responses clearly indicated the mechanisms are distinct. Conclusion This work of integrative biology was performed at the global level using transcriptomic analysis obtained in various growth conditions. It raised the importance of growth <b>rate</b> <b>regulations</b> in bacteria but also participated to the elucidation of the involved mechanism. Though the mechanism controlling growth rate is not yet fully understood in L. lactis, one expected regulatory mechanism has been ruled out, two potential regulators have been pointed out and the involvement of gene location on the chromosome has also been found {{to be involved in the}} expression regulation of these growth related genes. </p...|$|R

First, the results showed that trust is a core factor affecting willingness to lend; thus, enhancing the level of trust between borrowers and lenders is an effective measure to improve trade efficiency. Perceived information asymmetry has an important influence on trading trust, but its impact on the willingness to lend is not significant; the negative influence of perceived information asymmetry can be offset by other factors (such as a higher return on investment). Thus, relaxing lending market interest <b>rate</b> <b>regulations</b> is helpful to promote the development of the market.|$|R
