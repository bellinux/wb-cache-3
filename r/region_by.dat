5|$|Paulinus' missionary {{efforts are}} {{difficult}} to evaluate.

Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the <b>region</b> <b>by</b> Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald.|$|E
