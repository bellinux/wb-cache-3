25|$|The {{materials}} balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> to calculate the remaining oil. It assumes that, as fluids from the reservoir are produced, {{there will be a}} change in the <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder. Pressure increases in the cylinder, applying the brakes, while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|E
40|$|Big-hole {{production}} well Bulalo 100 is crossflowing while shut-in based on shut-in pressure, temperature, and spinner (PTS) survey results. The apparent crossflow is probably {{caused by a}} vertical upflow from the well’s deep, less permeable and pressure supported feedzones into its shallow, more permeable and pressure depleted entry zone. Consequently, shut-in wellbore pressures at the entry zones do not represent true static <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures.</b> Dynamic bottomhole <b>pressures</b> underestimate <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> at the deep producing zones and overestimate <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> at the shallow pressure depleted zones.

25|$|Because {{natural gas}} is not a pure product, as the <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> drops when non-associated gas is {{extracted}} from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method {{to deal with this}} problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.|$|E

In oil {{industry}} parlance, the blowout [...] "charged" [...] (i.e., fed into) the shallower geological zone, dramatically increasing <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure.</b> The direct cost of bringing this one well under control was $200 million.|$|E

50|$|Several {{enhanced}} oil recovery technologies have been employed at Midway-Sunset.

2500|$|If {{the brakes}} must be applied before {{recharging}} has been completed, a larger brake pipe reduction {{will be required}} in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort, as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure). If many brake pipe reductions are made in short succession ("fanning the brake" [...] in railroad slang), a point may be reached where car <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> will be severely depleted, resulting in substantially reduced brake cylinder piston force, causing the brakes to fail. On a descending grade, the unfortunate result will be a runaway.|$|E
2500|$|Wells are drilled into oil {{reservoirs}} {{to extract}} the crude oil. [...] "Natural lift" [...] production methods that rely on the natural <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, {{such as in the}} Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using [...] "artificial lift" [...] means. Over time, these [...] "primary" [...] methods become less effective and [...] "secondary" [...] production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [...] "waterflood" [...] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or [...] "wellbore." [...] Eventually [...] "tertiary" [...] or [...] "enhanced" [...] oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or [...] "bitumen") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using [...] "in-situ" [...] methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping out the oil-saturated liquid.|$|E
2500|$|This {{time the}} problem {{needed to be}} solved on the ocean bottom. [...] Union put a large steel cap {{over much of the}} leaking area, but leaks {{continued}} from other nearby locations. [...] The company estimated the leak rate at up to [...] per day. [...] The federal government approved reopening some wells to attempt to intercept oil underneath the sea floor, and even reopening A-21; neither method worked. [...] The next measure involved pumping oil at a maximum rate from all five wells on Platform A, on the theory that such action would reduce <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> and thus the leak rate, but this only increased the rate at which oil spewed from the rents in the ocean floor. [...] Meanwhile, the cleanup progressed with setbacks, as huge waves of newly spilled oil fouled partially cleaned beaches, and oil from the spill reached locations as distant as Pismo Beach in San Luis Obispo County, Catalina Island, and Silver Strand Beach in San Diego. [...] Despite attempts by Union to cement the cracks in the ocean floor, leaks continued, with a leak near one of the platform legs predominating on February 23. [...] By the end of the month, its flow had reduced, but oil was still seeping, at a diminishing rate, from cracks both east and west of the platform. [...] Leaking continued {{at a rate of about}} [...] a day, diminishing but never completely stopping, reaching a stable leak rate of between [...] a day by May and June 1969, a leak rate which persisted at least into 1970. [...] One last spill occurred at Platform A: [...] a release of about [...] between December 15 and 20, 1969, from a pipeline break.|$|E

50|$|For cement, {{one thing}} to note {{is that there is}} no {{correlation}} between the shear and compressive strength. Another fact to note is that cement strength ranges between 1000 and 1800 psi, and for <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> > 1000 psi; this means that the pipe cement bond will fail first. This would lead to the development of micro-annuli along the pipe.|$|R

40|$|The <b>reservoir</b> average <b>pressure</b> {{can now be}} {{evaluated}} from routinely available rate and flowing pressure production data, using {{an extension of the}} reciprocal productivity index method. Traditionally, <b>reservoir</b> average <b>pressure</b> could only be determined from an extended duration build-up test. Especially in low permeability, stimulated reservoirs, that procedure generally tends to underestimate the pressure, due to practical limitations on shut-in times. In addition, an error in the <b>reservoir</b> average <b>pressure</b> determination results in an error in the computed skin for the well. However, this new procedure provides an independent evaluation of skin and pressure so that they are not dependent on one another.

40|$|Extremely low {{permeability}} due to nano-scale pores is a distinctive feature of gas transport in a shale matrix. The permeability of shale depends on pore pressure, porosity, pore throat size and gas type. The pore network {{model is a}} practical way to explain the macro flow behavior of porous media from a microscopic point of view. In this research, gas flow in a shale matrix is simulated using a previously developed three-dimensional pore network model that includes typical bimodal pore size distribution, anisotropy and low connectivity of the pore structure in shale. The apparent gas permeability of shale matrix was calculated under different <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> corresponding to different gas exploitation stages. Results indicate that gas permeability is strongly related to <b>reservoir</b> gas <b>pressure,</b> and hence the apparent permeability is not a unique value during the shale gas exploitation, and simulations suggested that a constant permeability for continuum-scale simulation is not accurate. Hence, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> of different shale gas exploitations should be considered. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the contributions to apparent permeability of a shale matrix from petro-physical properties of shale such as pore throat size and porosity. Finally, the impact of connectivity of nano-scale pores on shale gas flux was analyzed. These results would provide an insight into understanding nano/micro scale flows of shale gas in the shale matrix...|$|R
