5|$|Exploitation {{of natural}} <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> {{a major part}} of the {{economic}} geography of Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2005 the gross domestic product (GDP) of Newfoundland and Labrador was approximately fourteen billion dollars. Service industries accounted for over $8billion and resource-based activities such as mining, oil production, fishery and forest-based industries (sawmills and paper mills) accounted for the remainder.|$|E

50|$|Renewable <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} each year, unlike non-renewable <b>resources,</b> which <b>are</b> eventually depleted. A simple {{comparison is}} a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, {{if it is}} managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> renewable <b>resources.</b> Renewable resources {{account for more than}} 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves. Annual renewable <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources. In other words, if all non-renewable <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> uniformly exhausted in 30 years, they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year, if all available renewable <b>resources</b> <b>were</b> developed.|$|R
5000|$|In Biology and Ecology, a <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> a {{substance}} or {{object in the}} environment required by an organism for normal growth, maintenance, and reproduction. <b>Resources</b> can <b>be</b> consumed by one organism and, as a result, become unavailable to another organism. For plants key <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> light, nutrients, water, and place to grow. For animals key <b>resources</b> <b>are</b> food, water, and territory.|$|R

5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> an indirect approach {{based largely on}} information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E
50|$|However, {{in certain}} cases both the dispose pattern and finalizers are used for {{releasing}} <b>resources.</b> This <b>is</b> primarily found in CLR languages such as C#, where finalization {{is used as a}} backup for disposal: when a <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> acquired, the acquiring object is queued for finalization so that the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> released on object destruction, even if the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> not released by manual disposal.|$|R

5|$|The City of Manila is {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Manila Bay, on the western edge of Luzon, 1300 km from mainland Asia. One of Manila's greatest natural <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> the protected harbor upon which it sits, regarded as the finest in all of Asia. The Pasig River flows through the middle of city, dividing it into the north and south. The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The College of Forestry and Natural <b>Resources</b> <b>is</b> {{managed by}} a dean, {{currently}} Juan M.

Prior to the college's separation from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957, the deans of the College of Forestry and its predecessors were not appointed by the board but were {{the directors of the}} Bureau of Forestry acting as ex officio heads of the college. Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school, a practice which continued until 1957.|$|E
5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across {{many parts of the}} Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local <b>resources</b> <b>is</b> intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral <b>Resources</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for general {{strategy in the}} oil and gas sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} map of Georgia (a state within the United States) is a special-purpose map made to show geological features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national geological map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific {{geologic map}} was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced geologic map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural <b>Resources</b> <b>is</b> 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey.
