5000|$|Another roof-angled glass {{alternative}} is a sawtooth roof (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical <b>roof</b> <b>glass</b> {{facing away from}} the equator {{side of the building}} to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain). The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer [...] "solar furnace" [...] skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior <b>roof</b> <b>glass</b> in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer.|$|R

Goodwin also said that it could be [...] "more accurately described as a giant roof built over a sports complex which has been neatly inserted {{into the side of the}} fill".|$|R
2500|$|Notable {{achievements}} for Oldsmobile in the 1960s {{included the}} introduction of the first turbocharged engine in 1962 (the Turbo Jetfire), the first modern front-wheel drive car produced in the United States (the 1966 Toronado), the Vista Cruiser station wagon (noted for its <b>roof</b> <b>glass),</b> and the upscale 442 muscle car. Olds briefly used the names [...] "Jetstar 88" [...] (1964–1966) and Delmont 88 (1967–1968) on its least expensive full size models in the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} restaurant contained five {{dining rooms}} and a 19-seat [...] "Surfboard Bar" [...] made of surfboards. Originally {{the roof of}} the Garden seating area was open. The constant nuisance of moving guests out of the rain caused them to enclose the <b>roof</b> with <b>glass.</b> That <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> was opened and closed until maintenance issues kept it closed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: View {{over the}} settlement, showing {{covering}} to house No. 7 and proximity to modern shore line. The <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> {{has now been}} replaced by a turf one, as the humidity and heat caused by the <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> was hindering preservation.|$|R

2500|$|The {{building}} has become notorious for an intermittent hum, or howling, which is heard in windy weather, {{emanating from the}} <b>roof's</b> <b>glass</b> blade, and first reported in May 2006 – just weeks after the tower opened. The skyscraper {{was intended to be}} 50 storeys high rather than 47, but wind load tests showed that it would sway too much because of its slender shape and the 'glass blade' façade overrun caused by the height reduction has been blamed for the noise.|$|R
50|$|The car {{features}} Nissan's V-motion grille, boomerang tail-lamps, floating <b>roof</b> {{design and}} <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> with 'X' crossing {{structure in the}} middle.

5000|$|The Targa {{version of}} the 993 was {{introduced}} in model year 1996 and saw the debut of the so-called [...] "greenhouse" [...] system: a retractable <b>glass</b> <b>roof,</b> a design continued on the 996 and 997 Targa. The <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> would retract underneath the rear window revealing a large opening. This system was a complete redesign, as previous Targa models had a removable roof section and a wide B-pillar functioning as a roll bar. The new <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> design allowed the 993 Targa to retain the same side-on profile as the other 911 Carrera variants and finish without the inconvenience of storing the removed top of the old system. The Targa has {{the body of the}} convertible with the Targa <b>glass</b> <b>roof</b> replacing the fabric roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of the entire complex is primarily post-modern, with sharp, jagged angles, canted walls, sloping <b>roofs,</b> <b>glass</b> walls, and {{a reflection of the}} local vernacular in both colors and materials. The introverted campus is inspired by a geode, and guides pedestrians from the outer concrete walls to a central space of glass, water, and color. The complex was designed by Boora Architects of Portland, Oregon in associations with DWL Architects + Planners, Inc., of Phoenix, Arizona. Martha Schwartz Inc. served as landscape architect for the project.|$|R
50|$|The bar {{area has}} a compartmented ceiling with {{cast-iron}} columns. There is a large, curved wooden {{bar with a}} stone trough at its base. The bar forms a complete rectangle serving {{all parts of the}} large space. The saloon and public bars are divided by a wooden, arched screen containing glass engraved with Art Nouveau motifs. At the rear is the former billiard room, now a function room and kitchen, with top-lit <b>roof</b> <b>glass</b> painted with a creeping vine motif. There are many elaborate engraved mirrors, some stained-glass windows and fire surrounds.|$|R

50|$|The Ottawa {{architecture}} firm of Burgess, McLean & MacPhadyen designed St. Stephen’s Church in 1953, {{which is}} representative of church architecture in the 1950s with its daring lines, sleek mass, contrasting surfaces of brick walls, metal uprights, shingle <b>roof,</b> <b>glass</b> window walls, and laminated support beams inside. The architectural drawings pertaining to Burgess, McLean & MacPhadyen architectural projects 1900-1990 are in Library and Archives Canada.

The later church addition seated a congregation of 450 to 800 persons.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternate}} {{history of}} this car {{is that it was}} ordered from the factory in 1929 with that [...] "flecked" [...] paint scheme (gold flecks over black on the [...] "canvas" [...] portion of the body) by a lady who lived in Abingdon-on-Thames, and was well-known to residents and patrons of the pub there. It was probably a model 14/18, and there are photos of it with a fashionably dressed woman in the driver's seat. And only the canvas-covered bodywork has the flecked paint. The <b>roof,</b> <b>glass,</b> fenders, wheel spokes, grill, etc. appear to have no flecks or overspray.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professional}} car (quoted from {{a leading}} trade association) [...] "is loosely {{defined as a}} custom-bodied vehicle, based on passenger car styling, and used in the funeral, rescue or livery services." [...] Such vehicles may be hearses, flower cars, service cars, ambulances, limousines, or cars specially built to combine {{two or more of}} these different functions, such as combination hearse-ambulances, sedan ambulances or invalid coaches. Using vehicles such as the Cadillac Commercial Chassis as a donor vehicle, the bodywork (including the <b>roof,</b> <b>glass,</b> and doors) was completed by coachbuilders. From the dashboard rearward, nearly all exterior and interior bodywork was manufactured by hand.|$|R
