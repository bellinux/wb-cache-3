40|$|Imposing a {{magnetic}} field on a turbulent flow of electrically conducting fluid incurs the Joule effect. A current paradigm is that the corresponding dissipation increases with {{the intensity of the}} magnetic field, and as a result turbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong. While this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying turbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex configurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the controversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent anisotropy to profoundly <b>reorganise</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of turbulence, so their net effect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here we show that when turbulence is forced in {{a magnetic}} field that acts on turbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field promotes large, nearly 2 D structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the loss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity of turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries important consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets, accretion disks and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{pertains}} to the classification of multiple Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE). We construct the pure partition functions of multiple SLE_κ with κ∈ (0, 4] and relate them to certain extremal multiple SLE measures, thus verifying a conjecture from [BBK 05, KP 16]. We prove that the two approaches to construct multiple SLEs [...] - the global, configurational construction of [KL 07, Law 09 a] and the local, growth process construction of [BBK 05, Dub 07, Gra 07, KP 16] [...] - agree. The pure partition functions {{are closely related to}} crossing probabilities in critical statistical mechanics models. With explicit formulas in the special case of κ = 4, we show that these functions give the connection probabilities for the level lines of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) with alternating boundary conditions. We also show that certain functions, known as conformal blocks, give rise to multiple SLE_ 4 that can be naturally coupled with the GFF with appropriate boundary conditions.

40|$|According {{to general}} {{accidents}} statistics a coach {{is the safest}} means of transportation with respect to fatalities per billion traveller kilometers. Reasons for this include the existing regulations related to coach safety and the self regulation of the coach building industry. Most passive safety standards are, however, more related {{to the safety of}} the passengers and less to the safety of driver and courier. Their typical position {{at the front of the}} coach and the fact that most heavy structural parts of the coach are behind their position in the coach, make the driver and courier vulnerable in case of a frontal collision. The injury risk in specific frontal collisions can be reduced by applying crash technology within <b>the</b> front <b>structure</b> of <b>the</b> coach. By redesign and <b>reorganising</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> and <b>the</b> packaging underneath the driver and courier, the kinetic energy developed in a typical coach-to-trailerback collision can be absorbed whilst maintaining a survival space for driver and courier. This paper describes the development of a procedure for improvement in the frontal crashworthiness of coaches. Starting with analyses of related accident data and heavy vehicle crash experience from truck testing, numerical simulation, component and full scale testing have been combined to create a new passive safety structural concept. The experience gained has since been used and is demonstrated in the design of a new coach...|$|R
