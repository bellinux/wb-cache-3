40|$|In {{parallel}} with liberalization, sector-specific regulation in network industries {{has become a}} widely discussed topic among academics, policy makers, industry economists and regulators themselves. The issue of these debates has usually been on whether such regulation is necessary and if so what its optimal design should be. Some argue for complete deregulation (i. e., the complete abolishment of sector-specific regulations), whereas others propose <b>reregulations,</b> that is the replacement of pre-existing (monopoly) regulations by new regulations aiming at safeguarding service levels and competition. The resulting compromise is often somewhere in between; the liberalization process usually entails the partial replacement and realignment of sector-specific regulatory intervention by the disciplining forces of competition protected by competition law. Consequently, competition law and sector-specific regulation play complementary roles. In this paper, we present a general economic framework to assess regulatory remedies in network industries. Therein, liberalization, or more generally market access regulation, can be assessed as well. It provides a foundation and explanation of current sector-specific regulations in place.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} such fundamental {{characteristics as}} {{the lack of}} ergodicity, stationarity, and independence, and it identifies the degree of initial persistence of the Chinese stock markets when they were more regulated. The index series are from the Shanghai (SHI) stock market and Shenzhen A-shares (SZI) and B-shares (SZBI) stock markets, {{before and after the}} various deregulations and <b>reregulations.</b> Accurate and complete signal processing methods are applied to the complete series and to their sub-periods. The evidence of lack of stationarity and ergodicity can be ascribed to two causes: (1) the initial interventions in these stock markets by the Chinese government by imposing various daily price change limits, and (2) the changing trading styles {{in the course of the}} development of these emerging stock markets, after the Chinese government left these equity markets to develop by themselves. By computing the markets' monofractal Hurst exponents (and its accuracy range with a new statistic), using wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA), we identify the markets' subsequent degrees of persistence. The empirical evidence shows that SHI, SZI, and SZBI are moderately persistent with Hurst exponents slightly greater than the Fickian 0. 5 of the Geometric Brownian Motion. It also shows that these stock markets were considerably more persistent before the deregulations, but that they now move much more like geometric Brownian motions, i. e., efficiently. Our results also show that the Chinese stock markets are gradually and properly integrating into one Chinese stock market. Our results are consistent with similar empirical findings from Latin American, European, and other Asian emerging financial markets.

Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate if the trends resulting from the <b>reregulation</b> of {{the pharmacy}} monopoly correspond to the goals stipulated by the government.

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate how the <b>reregulation</b> affected the decision making process of buyers of OTC drugs, and to identify determinants for how a buyer chooses to obtain OTC drugs in the reregulated Swedish pharmacy market. Furthermore this study aims to map out buyers’ purchases of OTC drugs as well as their impressions about the <b>reregulation</b> of the Swedish pharmacy market   Background The Swedish pharmacy market was opened up for competition the 1 July 2009. On 1 November 2009, private pharmacies are allowed in the market, as well non-pharmacy retailers can commercialize OTC drugs. Thus due to the <b>reregulation</b> of the pharmacy market, consumers and retailers face a different market situation, since the amount of retailer selling OTC drugs has increased. This study investigates how buyers’ purchase behavior of OTC was affected by the end of the pharmacy monopoly.   Method  The purpose of this thesis was achieved by using a mixed-method approach. The qualitative method in the form of interviews and the quantitative method by conducting a survey. The mixed-method was used in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of consumer decision-making process as well as attitude and impression about the <b>reregulation</b> of the Swedish pharmacy market.   Conclusion Buyers are in general satisfied with the <b>reregulation</b> of the Swedish pharmacy market. However, the positive attitude towards the <b>reregulation</b> does not necessarily mean a change in purchase behavior for OTC drugs. The decision making process is found to be dependent on the level of experience the buyer possesses with the needed OTC drug, as well as the type of need the buyer experiences, thus three determinants for the decision making process of OTC drugs were found. The frequency of purchase is connected to the gender and age group of the buyer. Also the majority of the researched buyers already had experienced the purchase of OTC drugs in store other than pharmacies. The buyers that never purchase OTC drugs in other retailers are in general open to the possibility of taking advantage of those stores. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how productive entrepreneurial activities, such as innovation, influence unproductive entrepreneurial activities, such as regulatory rent seeking. We {{argue that the}} former may increase the latter. Confronted with {{a situation in which}} innovation erodes their monopoly returns, legally protected producers and policymakers reregulate industry to recapture lost rents. Regulation policy under such <b>reregulation</b> tends to be more encompassing, and thus produces more unproductive entrepreneurial activity, than pre-innovation regulation policy. This reflects the greater number or variety of producers that new regulation policy must encompass for <b>reregulation</b> to recreate rents.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} contemporary {{trends in}} commercial banking, confronting {{the stages of}} deregulation and <b>reregulation</b> in this field triggered by the global mortgage crisis. Under deregulatory conditions the competitive position of banks has toughened, and they reacted to it by intensifying: marketization, i. e. globalization, concentration, securitization and conglomeration, and by turning to the profit-oriented risk management of their activity. The contraction of their interest margin was thus neutralized by the reduction of operational costs and loss provisions, and {{by an increase in}} non-interest revenues, thereby maintaining banking profitability. The recent crisis has pinpointed the necessity of firmer regulation or <b>reregulation</b> of the banking sector, aimed at reducing its systemic risk, {{the most important aspect of}} which being the stricter international banking capital and liquidity standards, along with the requirement to adequately treat systemically important banks. <b>Reregulation</b> should strengthen capitalization and liquidity; mitigate the volume, concentration, internationalization and business dispersion, hence improving the supervision of the banking sector, implying its lower, yet more stable profitability.

40|$|This thesis {{makes use}} of the unique <b>reregulation</b> of {{pharmaceutical}} monopoly in Sweden to critically examine intraindustry firm heterogeneity. It contributes to existing divestiture research as it studies the dynamism in between reconfigurations of value constellations {{and its effects on}} value creation of divested pharmacies. Because the findings showed that the predominant theory of intraindustry firm heterogeneity could not explain firm performance, the value constellation concept was applied as it captured the phenomena. A patterned finding informed how reconfigurations of value constellations in a reregulated market characterized by strict rules, regulations, and high competition did not generate additional value for firms on short term. My study unveils that value creation is hampered in situations where rules and regulations significantly affect firms’ ability to reconfigure their value constellations.

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis {{has been characterized}} as a “Minsky” moment, and as such provides the conditions required for a <b>reregulation</b> of the financial system {{similar to that of}} the New Deal banking reforms of the 1930 s. However, Minsky’s theory was not one that dealt in moments but rather in systemic, structural changes in the operations of financial institutions. Therefore, the framework for <b>reregulation</b> must start with an understanding of the longer-term systemic changes that took place between the New Deal reforms and their formal repeal under the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act. This paper attempts to identify some of those changes and their sources. In particular, it notes that the New Deal reforms were eroded by an internal process in which commercial banks that were given a monopoly position in deposit taking sought to remove those protections because unregulated banks were able to provide substitute instruments that were more efficient and unregulated but unavailable to regulated banks, since they involved securities market activities that would eventually be recognized as securitization. Regulators and the courts contributed to this process by progressively ruling that these activities were related to the regulated activities of the commercial banks, allowing them to reclaim securities market activities that had been precluded in the New Deal legislation. The 1999 Act simply made official the de facto repeal of the 1930 s protections. Any attempt to provide <b>reregulation</b> of the system will thus require safeguards to ensure that this internal process of deregulation is not repeated.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{framework}} and a specific {{proposal for the}} <b>reregulation</b> of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (hereafter F&F) {{in the aftermath of}} the subprime mortgage crisis and their conservatorship. Reforming financial regulations after a major financial crisis is the norm in US financial history, and a process with generally very positive results. Actions to reregulate have typically solved the problem at hand, while maintaining an overall efficient and innovative financial system. In this spirit, this paper develops a framework and analyses alternative proposals for the <b>reregulation</b> of F&F, and recommends one specific plan. The recommended plan continues the firms’ mortgage guarantee and securitization programs in support of middle-income borrowers. The programs, however, would now operate within government agencies, in a format parallel to the current Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and GNMA programs that support lower-income borrowers. At the same time, the remaining net assets and technology of the F&F retained mortgage portfolios are to be returned to the firms’ investors, who would operate the new entities as private firms with no government connection...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Water and Power Resources Service is {{considering}} reregulating Lake Mohave water levels {{to increase the}} net power benefit from Hoover Dam. <b>Reregulation</b> will not increase the generation capacity of the Hoover powerplant but it will enable the plant operation to be increased when the energy has greater monetary value. Energy generated {{at different times of}} the year has different market value, the highest being in January-March and July- September. By generating more power during these periods more net monetary benefit can be derived from Hoover Dam. The total volume of water released from Hoover Dam over an annual period must remain unchanged due to downstream water requirements for irrigation. To obtain this power benefit, therefore, less water for generation would be discharged during the low market value periods to enable higher discharges during the high market value periods. The discharge regime at Davis Dam would also remain unchanged in order to meet downstream water requirements. Therefore more extreme fluctuations in Lake Mohave water levels would result in order to accommodate changes in the Hoover Dam discharge regime. Water levels in Lake Mohave presently fluctuate from a maximum elevation of about 647 ft. in February-April to a minimum of 630. 5 ft. in September- November. The minimum elevation has been maintained to accommodate the marinas on the lake. To optimize power generation from Hoover Dam, water levels in Lake Mohave will fluctuate from elevations of 600 to 640 ft. The greatest power benefit would be derived from decreased Hoover Dam discharge in April-June and October-December and increased discharge in January-March and July-September… The proposed <b>reregulation</b> alternatives will alter environmental conditions in Lake Mohave because of the extreme variations in water level.

A key area of contention and struggle is likely to occur over {{the contribution of the}} RDAs to sustainable development. Although the pursuit of sustainable development is a stated goal of the RDAs, in this paper we argue that this goal is likely to be compromised by tensions and contradictions emerging in the evolving new governance landscape of England. In terms of promoting sustainable-development policy, the regional scale of the UK state is becoming materially and discursively significant, and a particular focus of struggles around economic and environmental issues. These struggles strategically intersect with wider processes of <b>reregulation</b> and rescaling in the UK state. We not only consider the practical policy implications of integrating the economy and environment at the regional scale, but also analyse emerging tensions in regional governance in the light of processes of social <b>reregulation</b> and rescaling within the UK state. We argue that theoretical approaches to the latter need to incorporate the uneven process of rescaling and the contingent nature of regional state forms and institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{extension}} of the subprime mortgage crisis to a global financial meltdown led to calls for fundamental <b>reregulation</b> of the United States financial system. However, that <b>reregulation</b> has been slow in implementation and the proposals under discussion are far from fundamental. One explanation for this delay {{is the fact that}} many of the difficulties stemmed not from lack of regulation but from a failure to fully implement existing regulations. At the same time, the crisis evolved in stages, interspersed by what appeared to be the system’s return to normalcy. This evolution can be defined in terms of three stages (regulation and supervision, securitization, and a run on investment banks), each stage associated with a particular failure of regulatory supervision. It thus became possible to argue at each stage that all that was necessary was the appropriate application of existing regulations, and that nothing more needed to be done. This scenario progressed until the collapse of Lehman Brothers brought about a full-scale recession and attention turned to support of the real economy and employment, leaving the need for fundamental financial regulation in the background.

Within the context of Information Society and other policy initiatives, policymakers as well as investors have placed an increasing stress on the economic role of the media and cultural industries. This paper deals with the de- and <b>reregulation</b> of the mass media sector, and the pros and, in particular, the cons of the market approach. The mass media sector displays typical characteristics of traditional market failure and, at the same time, provides output with strong political relevance. Therefore public policy measures are even more important than in other industries. Historically, state regulation of the media sector (at least in Europe) has been politically and economically broadly accepted. At this time media output was still a national good. This paper will show how political and economic changes led to commer-cialisation and privatisation of the media sector at an international level. This development resulted in Austria in high concentration of power and oligopoly structures. The transformation from state to market regulation did not succeed.

40|$|The speed, transparency, {{and extent}} of the <b>reregulation</b> of New Zealand society {{over the last decade}} offer many {{insights}} into issues of social change and systems of regulation and governance. The forms of <b>reregulation</b> have been embedded by the set of new regulations and reorganised state practices referred to as the 'reforms'. These have involved a major shift in the sites and exercise of power within and between economic, social, and political spheres. They have been promoted and articulated in a restructuring discourse which has dominated New Zealand's reaction to the expiry of its social democratic settlement. Reconstructions of space and democracy have been heavily implicated within the processes of change, both as explicit goals of the reform programme and as overt strategies for the achievement of other redistributions. They are also definitive outcomes of a decade of upheaval. The authors explore the spatialities of core-state reform. They develop the concept of an altered dominant representation of space to explore new configurations of space and democratic practice. They seek to inform contemporary debates over the stability of New Zealand's reconstructed social formation. The discussion is illustrated with references to the spatial reorganisation of the institutions of government and core-state activities; in particular the altered administration of education and public health, and changes in local government organisation. ...|$|E

40|$|Today, policy {{analysts and}} {{regulatory}} governance scholars are sceptical about {{the capacity of}} the regulatory state hypothesis to describe change at the institutional level. For many, the hypothesis is a convenient oversimplification that fails to account for the hybridity of institutional arrangements within individual policy sectors and also for the divergence of reform trajectories across different national and sector-based policy contexts. This article assesses the influence of the key themes of the regulatory state on the UK Labour government's <b>reregulation</b> of National Health Service (NHS) commissioning organizations. Following the critics, it argues that these themes are only partially evident in the programme. While the government has codified previously informal relationships with policies like Patient Choice and has also subjected commissioning organizations to metaregulatory techniques, its reforms have neither displaced public ownership and the direct supply of commissioning services with markets and new mechanisms for rule making and standard setting, nor have the reforms divided labour within the state by creating an independent agency to regulate NHS commissioning organizations via technocratic means. Under the reforms, NHS commissioning continues to take place within a structure of bureaucratic relationships. However, the article suggests that the hybridity of regulatory techniques at work within the UK Labour government's <b>reregulation</b> of NHS commissioning lends weight to the claim that the current era is one of regulatory capitalism. It concludes with a discussion of the consequences of this finding for the public policy and regulatory governance literatures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} state-oriented and neoliberal approaches to environmental regulation by examining simultaneous efforts to protect the endangered Steller sea lion and to privatize the fishery for Alaska pollock. Because these policies were designed and implemented {{at the same time}} and for the same industry, this case offers a unique opportunity to explore in detail not transitions from one type of policy regime to another but, rather, how these different policy regimes articulate. Rather than focusing on <b>reregulation</b> which occurs when neoliberal restructuring shifts away from traditional regulation while simultaneously developing new, market-oriented forms of regulation, this paper focuses on a different kind of <b>reregulation</b> which occurs when state-oriented and market-oriented approaches must coexist. Analysis of how regulators themselves write about the conjunction of these policies reveals that the two forms of regulation can be complementary. To the extent that neoliberal restructuring has environmental benefits, these are mediated through traditional environmental protections, and although restructuring is presented as a means of mitigating the negative economic effects of state-oriented regulation, these effects are quite consistent with the goals of restructuring. Further, this analysis also reveals the power of neoliberal discourse. Despite their own statements about the complex articulation of the policies, regulators attribute benefits to privatization and problems to state-oriented regulation. This case highlights the inability of neoliberalism to subsume its outsides—alternatives are already existing—but also highlights that these outsides can themselves come to support what they seem to oppose. ...|$|E
