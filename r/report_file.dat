50|$|Each type of LID has {{limitations}} {{on the type of}} sub process allowed by SWMM 5. It has a good report feature and you can have a LID summary report in the rpt file and an external <b>report</b> <b>file</b> in which you can see the surface depth, soil moisture, storage depth, surface inflow, evaporation, surface infiltration, soil percolation, storage infiltration, surface outflow and the LID continuity error. You can have multiple LID's per subcatchment and we have had no issues having many complicated LID sub networks and processes inside the Subcatchments of SWMM 5 or any continuity issues not solvable by a smaller wet hydrology time step. The types of SWMM 5 LID compartments are: storage, underdrain, surface, pavement and soil. a bio retention cell has storage, underdrain and surface compartments. an infiltration trench lid has storage, underdrain and surface compartments. A porous pavement LID has storage, underdrain and pavement compartments. A rain barrel has only storage and underdrain compartments and a vegetative swale LID has a single surface compartment. Each type of LID shares different underlying compartment objects in SWMM 5 which are called layers.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 23) Special reportThis {{is one of}} {{a series}} of papers presenting the results of an evaluation of the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was significantly incomplete. This report examines the sources of underreporting for the state of Michigan. In 2003, there were 5, 911 crash involvements in Michigan that were reportable to the MCMIS Crash file. 4, 926 involvements were reported for that year, for a reporting rate of 73. 7 %. 303 of the cases reported to the Crash file did not meet the reporting criteria. 92. 4 % of fatal involvements were reported, 73. 1 % of qualifying injury crash involvements, and 73. 4 % of crashes with a towed, disabled vehicle. Unlike many other states, in Michigan reporting officers are responsible to identify qualifying vehicles (trucks, buses, and vehicles placarded with hazardous cargo), but cases meeting the severity criteria are selected centrally. This system likely partially explains the overall pattern of underreporting. Underreporting also is related to the time of year, indicating delays in providing the data. Reporting rates also varied by jurisdiction, with larger communities with more cases having higher rates of underreporting. Data quality is also reviewed. In certain variables, data in the Michigan police <b>report</b> <b>file</b> differed from that in the Crash file for some cases. Some inconsistencies were also noted between cargo body and vehicle configuration in the police <b>report</b> <b>file</b> and in the MCMIS Crash file...|$|E

CLDT was designed and developed under the CCLI project, # 0737242, funded by the National Science Foundation, which aimed to develop and disseminate a novel online practice tool for on demand review and assessment in Electrical and Computer Engineering education.
