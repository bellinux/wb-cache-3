50|$|A <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or more {{commonly}} a regenerator, {{is a type}} of heat exchanger where heat from the hot fluid is intermittently stored in a thermal storage medium before it is transferred to the cold fluid. To accomplish this the hot fluid is brought into contact with the heat storage medium, then the fluid is displaced with the cold fluid, which absorbs the heat.|$|E
25|$|To {{conserve}} {{energy and}} cooling capacity in chemical and other plants, <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> can transfer <b>heat</b> from a stream {{that must be}} cooled to another stream that must be heated, such as distillate cooling and reboiler feed pre-heating.|$|R
50|$|In <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> {{the fluid}} {{on either side}} of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> can be the same fluid. The fluid may go through an {{external}} processing step, and then it is flowed back through the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in the opposite direction for further processing. Usually the application will use this process cyclically or repetitively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{are made}} up of {{materials}} with high volumetric heat capacity and low thermal conductivity in the longitudinal (flow) direction. At cryogenic (very low) temperatures around 20 K, the specific heat of metals is low, and so a regenerator must be larger for a given heat load.|$|R
50|$|We use our {{nose and}} throat as a <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> when we breathe. The cooler air coming in is warmed, {{so that it}} reaches the lungs as warm air. On the way back out, this warmed air {{deposits}} much of its heat back onto {{the sides of the}} nasal passages, so that these passages are then ready to warm the next batch of air coming in. Some animals, including humans, have curled sheets of bone inside the nose called nasal turbinates to increase the surface area for heat exchange.|$|E
50|$|Another type of {{regenerator}} {{is called}} a micro scale <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> It has a multilayer grating structure in which each layer is offset from the adjacent layer by half a cell which has an opening along both axes perpendicular to the flow axis. Each layer is a composite structure of two sublayers, one of a high thermal conductivity material and another of a low thermal conductivity material. When a hot fluid flows through the cell, heat from the fluid is transferred to the cell wells, and stored there. When the fluid flow reverses direction, heat is transferred from the cell walls back to the fluid.|$|E
40|$|The device {{described}} herein {{is designed}} primarily {{for use as}} a <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in a miniature Stirling engine or Stirling-cycle heat pump. A <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (sometimes called, simply, a "regenerator" in the Stirling-engine art) is basically a thermal capacitor: Its role in the Stirling cycle is to alternately accept heat from, then deliver heat to, an oscillating flow of a working fluid between compression and expansion volumes, without introducing an excessive pressure drop. These volumes are at different temperatures, and conduction of heat between these volumes is undesirable because it reduces the energy-conversion efficiency of the Stirling cycle...|$|E

40|$|An active {{thermal control}} system {{architecture}} has been modified {{to include a}} <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (regenerator) inboard of the radiator. Rather than using a radiator bypass valve a <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is placed inboard of the radiators.

At the lowest heat load for stable operation, the bypass flow is closed off, sending all of the flow through the regenerator. This lowers the radiator inlet temperature well below the system set-point while maintaining full flow through the radiators.

40|$|Experimental {{determination}} of transport coefficients, in particular internal heat transfer coefficients, in heterogeneous and hierarchical heat transfer {{devices such as}} compact <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> has posed a persistent challenge for designers. The goal {{of this study is}} to (1) present a new general treatment of the experimental {{determination of}} such design data, to (2) provide simple correlations for high porosity random fiber matrices for broad design applications, and to (3) illustrate how such measurements close the formidable integro-differential volume averaging theory (VAT) equations governing transport phenomena in porous media. The combined experimental and computational method employed here for determining the internal heat transfer coefficient in the porous structure is based on the VAT model and combines with simple pressure drop measurements to yield the relevant design data for eight different high porosity random fiber samples. The design data are correlated based on a porous media length scale derived from the VAT model governing equations and the transport coefficient correlations obtained are valid for gas flows over a Reynolds number range between 5 and 70. Finally, the correlations are related to explicit, rigorously derived, lower-scale expressions arising from the VAT model. With the illustration of a new experimental tool, and the production of new simple design correlations for high porosity random fiber matrices for <b>regenerative</b> <b>heat</b> transfer applications, within the context of the hierarchical VAT model, future VAT-based simulation studies of such devices may be pursued. Moreover, the nonlocal modeling provided by VAT paves the way to meaningful optimization studies due to its singular ability to provide rigorous modeling and fast numerical solutions for transport phenomena in <b>regenerative</b> compact <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R
