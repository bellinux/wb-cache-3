40|$|Phosphatidylinositol {{phosphates}} (PtdInsP n) are intracellular signalling {{molecules that}} are important in many key biological processes, in particular Ca 2 + signalling pathways. Dysfunction of these processes has been implicated in numerous diseases including diabetes and many cancers. Some aspects of PtdInsP n signalling have been heavily investigated; PTEN, PKC/Akt, PtdIns 3 K and PtdIns 4 K are all important therapeutic targets that have seen much attention in industrial endeavours. Inositol-based probes and <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> for these targets typically incorporate a fluorescent tag or photo-crosslinking group, usually at the lipid tails. It is increasingly apparent that the nature of the lipid chains {{plays a key role in}} determining the sub-cellular localisation of the PtdInsP n and hence modification of the lipids is potentially detrimental to the biological function of the <b>tool</b> <b>compounds.</b> An additional challenge in the development of inositol-based <b>tools</b> <b>compounds</b> is the difficult and lengthy syntheses that are employed to obtain the target compounds. To address this, we have developed a novel asymmetric route that allows rapid synthesis of PtdIns and PtdIns(4, 5) P 2. This route has been designed to allow incorporation of multiple deuterium atoms onto the myo -inositol ring (C -perdeuterated). To achieve this, we began with the aromatic compound quinol and built up the myo -inositol ring piecewise, allowing for deuterium incorporation. This methodology utilised a Pd-catalysed dynamic kinetic resolution on a conduritol B derivative to form optically-pure myo -inositol derivatives in high e. e. (> 99 %) toward the synthesis of D 6 -PtdIns(4, 5) P 2. The incorporation of deuterium into these compounds should be minimally disruptive to their biological activity, while the difference in molecular mass between the endogenous and <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> enables their use in a range of biological assays. In addition, the incorporation of the deuterium onto the myo-inositol ring will allow for the detection of downstream effects relating to the myo -inositol ring post-hydrolysis of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 to be observed, which is currently not possible with other probes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in {{glucocerebrosidase}} (GBA 1) cause Gaucher {{disease and}} also represent a common {{risk factor for}} Parkinson’s disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies. Recently, new tool molecules were described which can increase turnover of an artificial substrate 4 MUG when incubated with mutant N 370 S GBA 1 from human spleen.

In addition, these <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> robustly increase turnover of 4 MUG by GBA 1 derived from human cortex, despite substantially lower glycosylation of GBA 1 in human brain, suggesting {{that the degree of}} glycosylation is not important for compound binding.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{appreciated}} that G protein-coupled receptors {{have been the}} most successfully exploited class of targets for the development of small molecule medicines. Despite this, to date, less than 15 % of the non-olfactory G protein-coupled receptors in the human genome are the targets of a clinically used medicine. In many cases this is likely to reflect a lack of understanding of the basic underpinning biology of many G protein-coupled receptors that are not currently in the spotlight, as well as a paucity of pharmacological <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> and appropriate animal models to test in vivo function of such G protein-coupled receptors in both normal physiology and in the context of disease. ‘Open Innovation’ arrangements, in which pharmaceutical companies and public-private partnerships provide wider access to <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> identified from ligand screening programmes, alongside enhanced medicinal chemistry support to convert such screening ‘hits’ into useful ‘tool’ compounds will provide important routes to improved understanding.

30|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has increasingly adopted a programmatic fail-fast/fail cheap paradigm {{in an effort}} reduce costs and deploy resources in an efficient manner [1]. Early assessment of the pharmacodynamic response of a target to drug administration may facilitate an early “go” or “no go” decision for a program based upon results from an in vivo efficacy model. However, <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> or discovery screening hits often exhibit poor physicochemical properties, solubility and pharmacokinetic attributes, making in vivo activity assessment difficult due to low exposure levels. Formulation-based approaches to improve exposure to <b>tool</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as the addition of organic co-solvents, may interfere with the pharmacodynamic readout of the in vivo model {{or may not be}} tolerated if sustained systemic levels are required, {{as in the case of}} a multiple dose situation [2, 3].

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} the utility of using systematically formatted mixture based libraries as part of the drug discovery processes. While {{there are a number of}} different valid approaches for identifying hit and <b>tool</b> <b>compounds,</b> systematically formatted mixture based libraries, such as those described in this study, offer the ability to develop a significant amount of structure activity relationship data from the testing of very few samples. In support of this claim a review of recent developments in the area of systematically formatted mixture based libraries as well as three case studies are presented. The three case studies provide the detailed approach and results obtained from using systematically formatted mixture based libraries in programs focused on identifying broad spectrum antibiotics, therapeutics to treat leishmaniasis, and inhibitors of palmitoylation. In each of these three cases approximately 200 samples were utilized to survey millions of compounds in order to develop a series of hit and <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> as well as significant structure-activity relationship (SAR) data around the compounds identified. This information will be utilized in future studies to potentially uncover novel mechanisms of action for treating infections and diseases as well as developing therapeutics to treat the patients affect by them. So while systematically formatted mixture based libraries are not the only option for identifying hit or <b>tool</b> <b>compounds</b> they do provide a very efficient method that can be adapted to a variety of assay formats and therefor should be considered when conducting a screening campaign...|$|R
