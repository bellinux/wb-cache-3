Management {{changes in}} the coral reef fin fish fishery of the Great Barrier Reef provide a natural {{experiment}} of the efficacy of combining no-take areas and dedicated catch shares. A spatially-explicit bio-economic model of the fishery is {{used to analyze the}} tradeoffs between biomass and the net returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results for the scenarios examined show that: (1) the more the fishery is depleted, the greater are the payoffs from combining catch shares with no-take marine reserves; (2) a lower harvest while at high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> only lowers net returns slightly {{for a wide range of}} reserve sizes; and (3) an increase in the reserve area from when it is zero or small- sized leaves net returns virtually unchanged at any catch level.

50|$|Robinson re-evaluates Marx {{positively}} {{in relation}} to classical orthodoxy, but argues that he contains limitations that can be remedied only by using the work of John Maynard Keynes. She completely rejects Marx's labor theory of value, and recasts his work {{within the framework of}} aggregate Keynesian variables. Robinson argues that there is a contradiction {{between the first and second}} volumes of Capital: in Capital, Volume I, Marx assumes that a rising labor productivity leads to a rising <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> whereas in Capital, Volume III he assumes that rising labor productivity could lead, through a stable <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> to a rising rate of real wages and a declining rate of profit.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, Marx criticized ratios such as {{the share}} of profits and wages (wage share) in the gross or net product as deceptive, because they {{disguised}} the real capitalist relations of production, specifically the rate of surplus value.

50|$|In Marxian economics, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> is the {{divergence}} between labor productivity and the wage rate. In Marx's analysis of capitalist development, technological progress yields a higher ratio of constant capital (non-labor inputs) to variable capital (labor inputs), which lowers {{the demand for}} labor relative to capital inputs. This causes unemployment that services to exert a downward pressure on wages while productivity per worker rises, thus increasing the rate of surplus value extraction.|$|E
50|$|Here {{the minimum}} wage is w', higher than the monopsonistic w.

40|$|Selection and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> feeding {{areas by}} pre-{{breeding}} and nonbreeding Greylag Geese A nser anser, as we ll as by families, was studied in a breeding area consisting of four lakes in Scania, southernmost Sweden, {{in the years}} 1997 - 2000. Total production of young in each lake as we ll as the breeding performance of neck collared individuals was established annually, 1985 - 2000. This breeding population increased on average 15. 3 % p e ra n n um, from 93 pairs in 1985 to 910 pairs in 2001. The two main field types used by pre-breeding pairs, males of incubating females and non-breeders in flocks were win te r wheat and grassland, often switching from the fo rme r to the latter in mid-season. Almost all feeding during brood- rearing took place on pastures grazed by livestock or on a golf-course. Generally in spring, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> were below 300 - 400 goose days ha" 1, but <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> > 1, 000 goose days ha' 1 were noted for one cereal field and two grassland areas. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> by families varied markedly among brood-rearing areas as we ll as years, being highest all through the study period on a grazed pasture, where it ranged 800 - 1, 350 goose days ha' 1. Including the utilisation by non-breeders, the annual <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> this pasture ranged from 1, 400 to 2, 500 goose days h a 1. At the only lake without grazing by livestock (since the mid- 1990 s), significantly fewer goslings survived to fledging than at the other lakes (45 % vs 70 %). Indications of density-dependent effects on the productivity of sma ll young were noted {{at one of the}} lakes (Klosterviken) but not at another (Yddingen). Most likely, the lack of any density dependent effect, in spite of the very marked increase in the breeding population during the study period at Yddingen, is the result of access to highly fertilized grass on a golf course...|$|R

40|$|In Volume 1 of Capital Marx {{discusses}} {{three distinct}} ways that capital can increase surplus value, but he names {{only two of}} these as absolute surplus value and relative surplus value. The third mechanism, reducing wages below the value of labour power, Marx consigns to the sphere of competition and outside his analysis. This paper argues that (southern) wages held below the value of (northern) labour power is a structurally central characteristic of globalised, imperialist capitalism. These social relations require a re-working of Capital to incorporate systemically the additional surplus value extracted from oppressed workers, or 'super-exploitation'. While some authors have attempted analyses taking into account differential <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> (Emmanuel 1972; Carchedi 1991), much radical political economy either ignores (Choonara 2009) or denies (Callinicos 2009) the concept.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} {{to the study of}} Brazilian capitalist development has been how to interpret the survival of ‘backward’ forms <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> which, in combination with surplus value generated through higher degrees of worker productivity, often form the basis of the most dynamic economic sectors. This combination <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> in single production chains has long been a characteristic of Brazil’s insertion in the global economy. However, {{in the context of the}} ‘new consensus’ around export-oriented development, there has certainly been a revival of surplus value extracted by means of super-exploitation (as defined by Ruy Mauro Marini) in (certain) labour-intensive stages of production, as well as forms of unfree labour tantamount to slavery. At issue for the Brazilian labour movement is how to interpret and confront this so-called developmental ‘lag’; or alternatively, how to struggle for working class unity in a scenario which (despite falling unemployment rates, etc.) continues to be shaped by the neoliberal crisis of labour which struck in the 1990 s. This paper reflects on the struggle for unity amongst Brazilian workers on the issue of the grounds of Brazilian development in the movement against the FTAA...|$|R

During the 1960 's, the stock was decimated by the disease Ulcerative Dermal Necrosis which caused a dramatic reduction in catches. Catches have not recovered to pre-disease levels. The target egg deposition rate for the River Lune system which should produce the maximum number of surplus fish returning to the system has been determined at 13. 8 million eggs.

A new reference point, G(loss), is defined, which corresponds to the stock replacement line at the lowest observed spawning stock size. Recent fishing mortality rates yield replacement lines with a high probability of exceeding G(loss) and therefore indicate there is a high probability of further stock decline and a possibility of collapse.

50|$|In modern society, having work or leisure {{may often}} seem a choice, {{but for most}} of humanity, work is an {{absolute}} necessity, and consequently most people are concerned with the real benefits they get from that work. They may accept a certain <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> of their labour as an inescapable condition for their existence, if they depend on a wage or salary, but beyond that, they will increasingly resist it. Consequently, a morality or legal norm develops in civil society which imposes limits for surplus-labour, in one form or another. Forced labour, slavery, gross mistreatment of workers etc. are no longer generally acceptable, although they continue to occur; working conditions and pay levels can usually be contested in courts of law.|$|E

But the subjective factors are the explanation for why purely objective factors such as the severity of a crisis, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> etc., do not alone determine the revolutionary upsurge. A common example is the contrast of the oppression of the working classes in France in centuries prior to 1789 which although greater did not lead to social revolution as it did once the complete correlation of forces appeared.|$|E
50|$|The major {{industry}} of the East is forestry. The region has vast tracts of forest, and African and European companies have exploited these heavily. Because {{of the rapid}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation,</b> however, lumber companies {{have been forced to}} push further and further into Central Africa to find suitable trees. As a result, much of the logging that once took place in Cameroon has been relocated to neighbouring countries such as Congo and the Central African Republic. The massive logging vehicles still travel through the East on their way to Cameroon's ports, and it is possible that without the logging industry, the East might never have got the little transportation network that exists there now. The East is also the home of several timber processing centres with major operations located around Bélabo, Dimako, and Mindourou.|$|E
40|$|The {{arguments}} {{given for}} the decline and fall of Rome are many and varied. Two in particular have dominated the lit-erature. One, supported by Max Weber, A. B. R.

A. H. M. Jones, A. Bernardi, CM. Cipolla, and others have challenged this argument and have offered an alternative which focuses on the economic limita-tions of an agrarian based empire. The problem was manifest in an exceedingly oppressive system of taxation which also prevented system reproduction. These alternative arguments are synthesized in this paper by employing Marx's concept of reserve industrial army and explaining its operation with respect to various <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> The result is a step to a more comprehensive explanation ofRome's decline and fall...|$|R
