5000|$|Removing the [...] "sand vein" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for the digestive tract) {{is referred to}} as [...] "deveining". The sand vein can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the shrimp's body, allowing the dark ribbon-like digestive tract to be removed with a pointed utensil. Special deveining tools are sometimes used but knives, skewers, and even toothpicks can be used to devein. Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the vein can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers. On large shrimp, the [...] "blood vein" [...] (a {{euphemism for}} the ventral nerve cord) along the inner curve of the shrimp's body is typically removed as well. The shrimp is then <b>rinsed</b> <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> running water. Removing the vein is not essential, as it is not poisonous and is mostly tasteless. Deveining does slightly change the flavor and makes it more consistent. Shrimp also sometimes consume small amounts of sand and the vein might thus be gritty.|$|R

40|$|Ascites {{syndrome}} is a growth-related disorder of broilers that occurs {{more often in}} fast-growing birds and at low temperatures. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations among ascites-related traits measured either <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> or <b>under</b> normal temperature conditions, and to estimate genetic correlations between ascites-related traits measured <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions. 2. Several traits related to ascites were measured on more than 4000 chickens <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions and on more than 700 chickens under normal conditions. 3. The heritability estimates for body weight (BW) measured <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions were 0 · 42 and 0 · 50, respectively, for haematocrit value 0 · 46 and 0 · 17, respectively, and for ratio of right to total ventricular weight 0 · 45 and 0 · 12, respectively. 4. The genetic correlation between BW and haematocrit value <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions was - 0 · 23 and between BW and ratio of right to total ventricular weight - 0 · 27. Under normal conditions, however, these genetic correlations were 0 · 55 and 0 · 50, respectively. 5. These results demonstrate that the heritability estimates of ascites-related traits as well as genetic correlations between ascites-related traits and BW depend on the temperature conditions under which animals are kept. 6. Strong positive genetic correlations (around 0 · 8) were observed between total mortality, fluid in the abdomen and ratio of right to total ventricular weight <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions. The genetic correlation between ratio of right to total ventricular weight <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions was 0 · 91. 7.

40|$|Fruit texture changes impair {{the quality}} of apples {{submitted}} to long term storage, especially <b>under</b> <b>cold.</b> The changes are due to cell wall modifications during ripening and senescence and are associated to ethylene. We have investigated the activity of alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, a glycosyl hydrolase acting on the side chains of pectin in the cell wall and middle lamella. The transcription of arabinofuranosidase coding sequences 1 and 3 was investigated in plant organs {{and in response to}} ethylene, employing hormone application and 1 -methylcyclopropene. The transcription of arabinofuranosidase genes is not restricted to fruits, although upregulated by ripening and ethylene.

40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{evaluate}} changes of microvascular function <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation by measuring coronary flow velocities (CFVs) in vasospastic angina (VA) patients using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). 14 patients with VA and 15 healthy controls were included. CFVs were measured at the distal left anterior descending coronary artery by TTDE at baseline and <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation. Hyperemia was induced by intravenous adenosine infusion (140 µg/kg/min). At baseline, CFVs and coronary flow reserve (CFR) were not different between controls and VA patients. <b>Under</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation, the degree of increment of CFV with adenosine was lower in VA patients than in controls. Comparing baseline with cold stimulation, coronary flow reserve (CFR) increased (3. 1 ± 0. 7 to 3. 8 ± 1. 0, p= 0. 06) in controls. In contrast, in VA patients, CFR was decreased (2. 8 ± 0. 9 to 2. 6 ± 0. 7, p= 0. 05) and coronary vascular resistance index markedly increased (0. 35 to 0. 43, p= 0. 01). Throughout the study, no patient experienced chest pain or ECG changes. In VA patients, CFR was preserved at baseline, but coronary blood flow increase in response to cold stimulation was blunted and CFR was decreased. These findings suggest that endothelial dependent vasodilation is impaired at the coronary microvascular and the epicardial artery level in VA <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation...|$|R

The contents of GSH and AsA in heat (<b>cold)</b> acclimated leaves <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> (heat) stress were higher {{than those in the}} control. The deposits of calcium antimonite, an indicator for Ca(2 +) localization, were observed within the vacuoles, intercellular spaces in the control leaves of young grape plants grown under normal temperature. After heat or cold acclimation, the amount of cytosolic Ca(2 +) was more, but Ca(2 +) in vacuoles and intercellular spaces in mesophyll cells less than that in the control. The cytosolic Ca(2 +) were pumped back to vacuoles and intercellular spaces in heat acclimated-cells <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress, or in <b>cold</b> acclimated-cells <b>under</b> heat stress, both of which did not cause the chloroplast structure to be destroyed. In contrast, a large amount of cytosolic Ca(2 +) in the control mesophyll cells of grape, which was directly laid <b>under</b> heat or <b>cold</b> stress, appeared in intracellular spaces, and the chloroplast structure was destroyed. These results suggest that Ca(2 +) homeostasis is very important in grape mesophyll cells during the process of cross-adaptation of plants to temperature stresses. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, it is meaningful to study the mechanism of bermudagrass response to cold. Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial signal molecule with multiple biological functions. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate whether NO play roles in bermudagrass response to cold. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was used as NO donor, while 2 -phenyl- 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramentylimidazoline-l-oxyl- 3 -xide (PTIO) plus NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were applied as NO inhibitor. Wild bermudagrass was subjected to 4 °C in a growth chamber under different treatments (Control, SNP, PTIO + L-NAME). The results indicated lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage (EL), higher value for chlorophyll content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities after SNP treatment than that of PTIO plus L-NAME treatments <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress. Analysis of Chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence transient displayed that the OJIP transient curve was higher after treatment with SNP than that of treated with PTIO plus L-NAME <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress.

However, cold {{temperature}} {{is a key}} factor limiting resource utilization for Bermudagrass. Therefore, it is relevant to study the mechanisms by which Burmudagrass responds to cold. Melatonin is a crucial animal and plant hormone {{that is responsible for}} plant abiotic stress responses. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of melatonin in cold stress response of Bermudagrass. Wild Bermudagrass pre-treated with 100 μM melatonin was subjected to different cold stress treatments (- 5 °C for 8 h with or without cold acclimation). The results showed lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL) values, higher levels of chlorophyll, and greater superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities after melatonin treatment than those in non-melatonin treatment <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress. Analysis of chlorophyll a revealed that the chlorophyll fluorescence transient (OJIP) curves were higher after treatment with melatonin than that of non-melatonin treated plants <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress. The values of photosynthetic fluorescence parameters increased after treatment with melatonin <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress. The analysis of metabolism showed alterations in 46 metabolites in cold-stressed plants after melatonin treatment. Among the measured metabolites, five sugars (arabinose, mannose, glucopyranose, maltose, turanose) and one organic acid (propanoic acid) were significantly increased. However, valine and threonic acid contents were reduced in melatonin-treated plants. In summary, melatonin maintained cell membrane stability, increased antioxidant enzymes activities, improved the process of photosystem II, and induced alterations in Bermudagrass metabolism <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress...|$|R

Exposure to 4 °C for 2 h reduced pollen germination and tube growth along with increase of NOS-like activity, NO production and cGMP content in pollen tubes. DEA NONOate treatment inhibited pollen germination and tube growth in a dose-dependent manner {{under control and}} reinforced the inhibition <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stress, during which NO production and cGMP content promoted in pollen tubes. L-NNA and cPTIO markedly reduced the generation of NO induced by cold or NO donor along with partly reverse of cold- or NO donor-inhibited pollen germination and tube growth.

Effects of cPTIO and L-NNA in improving cold-treated pollen germination and pollen tube growth could be lowered by Viagra. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of cPTIO and L-NNA on Pro accumulation were partly reversed by Viagra.

Existing data were used from an experiment in which birds were housed in 2 groups under different climate conditions. In the first group, BW, the ratio of right ventricular weight to total ventricular weight (RV:TV), and hematocrit value (HCT) were measured in 4, 202 broilers <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions; in the second group, the same traits were measured in 795 birds under normal temperature conditions. Cold-stress conditions were applied to identify individuals that were susceptible to ascites. The RV:TV and HCT were approximately normally distributed under normal temperature conditions, whereas the distributions of these traits were skewed <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> temperature conditions, suggesting different underlying distributions. Fitting a bivariate mixture model to the observations showed that there was only one homogeneous population for ascites traits under normal temperature conditions, whereas there was a mixture of (2) distributions <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions.
