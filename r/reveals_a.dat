5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders.

However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
