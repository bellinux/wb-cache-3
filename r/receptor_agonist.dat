40|$|Prostaglandin F <b>receptor</b> (FP-R) <b>agonists</b> {{have been}} shown to reduce intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) in patients with glaucoma by enhancement of aqueous humor flow via uveoscleral path-way. This study analyzes additional mechanisms behind the ocular hypotensive effect of FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists.</b> The trabecular meshwork (TM) is actively involved in IOP regulation through contractile mechanisms. Contractility of TM is induced by endothelin (ET) - 1, a pos-sible pathogenic factor in glaucoma. ET- 1 levels in aqueous humor were found to be elevated in glaucoma. A possible intervention of the FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> in the ET- 1 effects on TM function was studied. The effects of FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> on contractility of bovine TM (BTM) were investigated using a force-length transducer. The effects of FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> on intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) mobilization in cultured cells were measured using fura- 2 AM. In summary, this study suggests that the anti-endothelin effect on TM contractility which probably increases aqueous humor outflow via the conventional route is additionally involved in the IOP-lowering effect of FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists.</b> Thus, FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> operate by di-rect interaction with ET- 1 -induced contractility of TM. This effect is mediated by the FP re-ceptor. The inhibiting action of FP <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> on ET- 1 -induced TM contractility could explain the fast effect on IOP of these antiglaucomatous drugs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The role of Glucagon-Like Peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> in the {{treatment}} of type 2 diabetes is debated; many recent trials, which were not included in previous meta-analyses, could add relevant information. DESIGN AND METHODS. All available randomized controlled trials (RCTs), either published or unpublished, performed in type 2 diabetic patients with GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> (exenatide and liraglutide), with a duration> 12 weeks were meta-analysed for HbA 1 c, BMI, hypoglycaemia, and other adverse events. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. A total of 21 RCTs (6 of which unpublished), enrolling 5, 429 and 3, 053 patients (with GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> and active comparator or placebo, respectively), was retrieved and included in the analysis. GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> determine a significant improvement of HbA 1 c in comparison with placebo (- 1. 0 [- 1. 1 :- 0. 8], p< 0. 001), with a low risk of hypoglycaemia.

25|$|Though IL-1 {{is useful}} in combating some diseases, {{endotoxic}} bacteria have gained an advantage by forcing the hypothalamus to increase cortisol levels (forcing the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, thus antagonizing IL-1).

25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin <b>receptor</b> <b>agonist</b> WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin <b>receptor</b> <b>agonist,</b> notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Several GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> are {{currently}} available {{for treatment of}} type 2 diabetic patients. Based on their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, these drugs are classified as short-acting GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> (exenatide and lixisenatide) or long-acting GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> (exenatide-LAR, liraglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide). In clinical practice, they are also classified as basal or prandial GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> to differentiate between patients who would benefit more from one or another based on characteristics such as previous treatment and the predominance of fasting or postprandial hyperglycemia. In the present article we examine available data on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the various GLP- 1 agonists and compare their effects {{with respect to the}} main parameters used to evaluate glycemic control. The article also analyzes whether the differences between the different GLP- 1 agonists justify their classification as basal or prandial...|$|R

40|$|IF 4. 693 International audienceRecent {{cardiovascular}} outcome trials - the LEADER with liragutide and SUSTAIN- 6 with semaglutide - {{have shown}} significant reductions of major cardiovascular (CV) events with these glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists.</b> Progressive {{separation of the}} treatment and placebo curves, starting clearly between 12 and 18 months of the trial period, and significant reductions {{in the risk of}} myocardial infarction and stroke, indicate that the beneficial CV effects observed with GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> could be due to an antiatherogenic effect. So far, the reasons for such an effect of GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> have not been entirely clear, although several hypotheses may be proposed. As the reductions in glycated haemoglobin and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in these trials were modest, and both trials lasted only a short period of time, reductions in hyperglycaemia and SBP are unlikely {{to be involved in the}} beneficial CV effects of GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists.</b> On the other hand, their effect on lipids and, in particular, the dramatic decrease in postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia may explain their beneficial CV actions. Reduction of body weight, including a significant decrease in visceral fat in patients using GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists,</b> may also have beneficial CV effects by reducing chronic proatherogenic inflammation. In addition, there are in-vitro data showing a direct anti-inflammatory effect with these agents that could also be involved in their beneficial CV effects. Moreover, studies in humans have shown significant beneficial effects on ischaemic myocardium after a very short treatment period, suggesting a direct effect of GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> on myocardium, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. Finally, as a reduction in insulin resistance has been associated with a decrease in CV risk, it cannot be ruled out that the lowering of insulin resistance induced by GLP- 1 <b>receptor</b> <b>agonists</b> might also be involved in their beneficial CV actions...|$|R
