5|$|Boxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow {{dominate}} <b>riparian</b> plant communities. Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, {{the virgin}} spinedace, and water striders all make {{their homes in}} the <b>riparian</b> zones.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Scott Township, Hull Creek is {{flanked by}} native trees and understory. However, further downstream, in Blakely, {{there is virtually no}} <b>riparian</b> buffer. Beyond this reach, the creek's <b>riparian</b> buffer again contains native trees and understory.|$|E
5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted <b>riparian</b> zones. Approximately 53percent of <b>riparian</b> zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy <b>riparian</b> zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
5|$|Some {{areas of}} the <b>riparian</b> buffer of Eddy Creek contain woody {{herbaceous}} plants. Strip mine overburden piles covered in forests also occur in the creek's <b>riparian</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado River and {{its tributaries}} often nourish {{extensive}} corridors of <b>riparian</b> growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although <b>riparian</b> zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and {{have been affected by}} engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent <b>riparian</b> zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where <b>riparian</b> areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta's size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the vaquita porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new <b>riparian</b> zones by smoothing the river's seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{area in the}} {{vicinity}} of Keyser Creek has experienced habitat loss due to abandoned mine impacts. What remains of the creek's <b>riparian</b> buffer in some reaches is overrun with invasive plants. The understory in the creek's <b>riparian</b> area is covered in knotweed. However, some reaches have <b>riparian</b> buffers containing red maple, silver maple, and river birch.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged <b>riparian</b> zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect <b>riparian</b> zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
5|$|Fish thrived for {{a limited}} time in Sulphur Creek between the {{introduction}} of perennial flows and the devastating floods {{at the end of}} the 20th century. These floods wiped out many of the remaining <b>riparian</b> areas lining waterways in the watershed. Despite the massive environmental degradation in the Sulphur Creek watershed, it is not biologically dead, yet and still supports some native species. Work is under way in the watershed to remove non-native species and restore native <b>riparian</b> vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is common}} east of the Rocky Mountains, but rare in the Pacific Northwest. In California, where it is widely distributed, the fungus is found {{in a variety of}} plant communities, {{including}} aspen, coastal oak woodland, Douglas Fir, Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, montane <b>riparian,</b> Redwood, Sierran mixed conifer, valley oak woodland, valley-foothill <b>riparian,</b> and White Fir. It was found to be the most common Armillaria species in hardwood and mixed oak forests in western Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often {{are lined with}} live oak and sycamore, which transition into the <b>riparian</b> zones of the main stem Santa Ana River. The inland <b>riparian</b> marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the <b>riparian</b> system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} places where it occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout <b>riparian</b> zones, but now is rarely seen in the Santa Ana River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched for miles {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In <b>riparian</b> areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. <b>Riparian</b> areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory {{recommends}} {{establishing a}} <b>riparian</b> buffer around Scotch Run and discouraging further development and All Terrain Vehicle usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's <b>riparian</b> buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some <b>riparian</b> buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the <b>riparian</b> buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
5|$|There are {{few or no}} <b>riparian</b> buffers along Mud Creek {{where it}} flows through {{agricultural}} land. However, the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory has recommended restoring the <b>riparian</b> buffers in Derry Township. A wet meadow is located along the creek north of Washingtonville. Plant types typically found in wet meadows include various ferns, sedges, grasses, and red maples. Mud Creek is designated as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{detritus}} can {{be found}} on West Branch Fishing Creek. The creek's <b>riparian</b> buffer is unfragmented.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily polluted, {{the creek}} {{supports}} aquatic life, including coastal cutthroat trout (leopard spotted) in its upper reaches. Watershed councils {{such as the}} Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in <b>riparian</b> zones.|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's <b>riparian</b> buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the <b>riparian</b> canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|More than 600,000 {{trees were}} {{planted in the}} {{watershed}} of Stafford Meadow Brook between 1912 and 1928. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended creating a 1000-foot <b>riparian</b> buffer around the Stafford Meadow Brook corridor. In lacks a <b>riparian</b> buffer in parts of Scranton. However, there are large hemlock stands along the stream above Lake Scranton. The wetlands along the stream provide an important habitat for wildlife and plant life. Beavers have also constructed ponds along some reaches of the stream. Bears have also historically been observed in the area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Riparian</b> {{vegetation}} {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for <b>riparian</b> zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry. Rincon Creek {{in the southern part}} of the RMD, free-flowing for at least part of the year, has the largest <b>riparian</b> zone in the park. The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller <b>riparian</b> zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native <b>riparian</b> vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as <b>riparian</b> vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has {{proposed}} a number of methods to conserve Fishing Creek and its tributaries. These include planting <b>riparian</b> buffers, eliminating leaky septic systems, and protecting the area from hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its <b>riparian</b> zone {{are home}} {{to a variety of}} species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, {{crayfish}} (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, Japanese knotweed, honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's <b>riparian</b> shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native <b>riparian</b> vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on volunteers for watershed <b>riparian</b> restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data on wildlife in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of their time to JCWC activities.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} includes {{parts of}} Laguna Niguel Regional Park and Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park. Despite its heavy pollution and increasing population of exotic species, {{for much of}} its length the creek is a <b>riparian</b> corridor.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include <b>riparian</b> vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. <b>Riparian</b> vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and <b>riparian</b> zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{clearing}} and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation, which fill in pools, degrade river ecosystems and make {{rivers and streams}} uninhabitable for Murray cod. This is exacerbated by removal of <b>riparian</b> (riverbank) vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the Darby Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby Creek Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for <b>riparian</b> {{restoration}} on Darby Creek. Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for <b>riparian</b> improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for <b>riparian</b> woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining <b>riparian</b> habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of these species were reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's <b>riparian</b> zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for <b>riparian</b> zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on <b>riparian</b> habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|Creek {{restoration}} projects {{since the}} 1990s {{have reduced the}} amount of Himalayan blackberry, an invasive species {{that had come to}} dominate much of the landscape near the creek. New plantings include native shrubs and trees such as red-osier dogwood, elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs, cattails, and smartweed, forested wetland, <b>riparian</b> woodland, open meadow, and orchard trees.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a <b>riparian</b> lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in <b>riparian</b> areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|Mammals {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by river otters, {{and are not}} a major dietary component. Mammals preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in <b>riparian</b> zones. The few occurrences of mammals found in the river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).|$|E
