5|$|In November 2010, the Croatian Parliament {{decided to}} hold the EU {{accession}} <b>referendum</b> 30 days after the treaty was signed; since the treaty was signed on 9 December 2011, the <b>referendum</b> was consequently (originally) scheduled for 9 January 2012. In November 2010, the Croatian Government proposed to hold the EU accession <b>referendum</b> simultaneously with another <b>referendum</b> aimed at altering general <b>referendum</b> rules.|$|E
5|$|A <b>referendum</b> in Croatia can {{be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the {{president}} considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} <b>referendum</b> if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each <b>referendum</b> and that the outcome is binding unless the <b>referendum</b> is called as an advisory <b>referendum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} <b>referendum</b> on the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband {{attended}} for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of}} the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a <b>referendum</b> should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public a <b>referendum</b> on the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a <b>referendum.</b> He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by <b>referendum.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{authorities}} held a <b>referendum</b> on independence {{with the}} option of remaining in Yugoslavia as a looser union.

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{government}} held {{a nationwide}} <b>referendum</b> on {{a declaration of}} sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the <b>referendum,</b> while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence.

5|$|On 25 April 1991, the Croatian Parliament {{decided to}} hold an {{independence}} <b>referendum</b> on 19 May. The decision {{was published in the}} official gazette of the Republic of Croatia and made official on 2 May 1991. The <b>referendum</b> offered two options. In the first, Croatia would become a sovereign and independent state, guaranteeing cultural autonomy and civil rights to Serbs and other minorities in Croatia, free to form an association of sovereign states with other former Yugoslav republics. In the second, Croatia would remain in Yugoslavia as a unified federal state. Serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. The <b>referendum</b> was held at 7,691 polling stations, where voters were given two ballots—blue and red, with a single <b>referendum</b> option each, allowing use of either or both of ballots. The <b>referendum</b> question proposing independence of Croatia, presented on the blue ballot, passed with 93.24% in favor, 4.15% against, and 1.18% of invalid or blank votes. The second <b>referendum</b> question, proposing that Croatia should remain in Yugoslavia, was declined with 5.38% votes in favor, 92.18% against and 2.07% of invalid votes. The turnout was 83.56%.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse four {{determinants}} of turnout in petition <b>referendums.</b> We find that distributive <b>referendums</b> have higher turnout than efficiency referendums; {{the higher the}} percentage obtained by parties campaigning for abstention, the lower turnout. Furthermore, <b>referendums</b> held in June show significantly less voters than in other months. The number of <b>referendums</b> voted simultaneously {{has no effect on}} turnout up to four <b>referendums.</b> Starting from these results we discuss possible reforms. ...|$|R

5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with Senate Republicans kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide <b>referendum</b> on the flag in 2003. The <b>referendum</b> was originally a two-part <b>referendum</b> pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including {{the one with the}} controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the <b>referendum</b> to a single vote of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Referendum</b> Party was a Eurosceptic, single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997.

Specifically, it called for a <b>referendum</b> on whether the British people wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 <b>referendum,</b> {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second <b>referendum</b> to ratify the results of any negotiation.

The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
50|$|The two {{constitutional}} <b>referendums</b> were mandatory <b>referendums,</b> {{which required}} both {{a majority of}} voters and cantons.

40|$|The diploma thesis "The French and Dutch <b>referenda</b> on the European Constitutional Treaty and {{the dilemma}} of European referenda" deals with those two <b>referendums,</b> {{which took place in}} 2005.
