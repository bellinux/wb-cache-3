5000|$|The large mirrors {{of the arm}} {{cavities}} are {{the most}} critical optics of the interferometer. Those mirrors make a <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavity</b> in each arm and allow to increase {{the power of the}} light stored in the 3-km arms. Thanks to this setup, the interaction time between the light and the gravitational wave signal is significantly increased. Those mirrors are non-standard pieces, made from state-of-the-art technologies. They are cylinders 35 cm in diameter and 20 cm thick, made from the purest glass in the world. The mirrors are polished to the atomic level in order to not diffuse (and hence lose) any light. Finally, a reflective coating (a Bragg reflector made with Ion Beam Sputtering, or IBS) is added. The mirrors located {{at the end of the}} arms reflect all incoming light; less than 0.002% of the light is lost at each reflection.|$|E
50|$|The {{gain medium}} of a laser is {{normally}} a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam {{by the process}} of stimulated emission described above. This material can be of any state: gas, liquid, solid, or plasma. The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some electrons into higher-energy ("excited") quantum states. Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted {{in the same direction as}} the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, population inversion is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is amplified. By itself, this makes an optical amplifier. When an optical amplifier is placed inside a <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavity,</b> one obtains a laser oscillator.|$|E
5000|$|Photons {{transfer}} {{their energy}} to the spacecraft by redshifting upon reflection. Thus the higher the spacecraft speed, the higher the efficiency. The figure shows the energy transfer efficiency from photons to the spacecraft's kinetic energy {{as a function of}} β=v/c (the spacecraft velocity divided by the light velocity) in photon propulsion. As the spacecraft velocity approaches the light velocity (v ≈ c) the efficiency of photon propulsion approaches 100%. The lower solid curve in the figure represents the efficiency of conventional photon rocket or sail with photon recycling. The upper solid line represents schematically an example the efficiency of a recycling photon rocket, such as a PLT. At low β, the recycling rocket can have a high thrust amplification factor (in this example, ~3,000), however as β approaches 1, the amplification factor converges to 1 and the overhead of recycling is unneeded. Therefore, these rockets are projected to bridge the efficiency gap. The simplest recycling scheme is a Herriot cell with multi-bouncing laser beams between two high reflectance mirrors that do not form a <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavity</b> as illustrated in Figure 4. This cell type approach was first proposed by Meyer, et al., followed by Simmons and McInnes. Mertzger and Landis [...] proposed a multi-bounce lightsail craft, such that the beam is reflected {{back and forth between the}} lightsail and a source reflector. Advanced reflectors permit more than 1000 bounces, reducing power requirements by 1000x compared to single bounce proposals. Using 100 MW to 1 GW lasers, a sub-100 day Mars transit is possible. The first experimental attempt on photon thrust amplification in a non-resonant Herriot-cell type optical cavity was performed by Gray et al. who obtained amplified photon thrust of ~0.4 µN with a 300-W laser and a photon thrust amplification factor of ~2.6.|$|E

40|$|The RC 2 LED is a {{substrate}} emitting OLED {{which has}} three additional interference layers between the ITO electrode {{and the glass}} substrate. This creates two <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavities.</b> The RC 2 LED has 2 <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavities.</b> The first cavity is also present in regular devices and is formed by metal/organic layers/ITO. The second cavity is formed by 3 additional layers: a high refractive index layer (Nb 2 O 5), a low refractive index layer (SiO 2) and a high refractive index layer (Nb 2 O 5). The additional layers introduce a strong wavelength dependent improvement of the extraction efficiency compared to the OLED without the additional layers. Our simulations show an improvement of the extraction efficiency of over 70 % over a wavelength range of 75 nm compared to an OLED without the 3 layers. Light extraction is worse compared to the reference OLED for wavelengths outside this wavelength range. This improvement has been experimentally verified for a green OLED with an emission between 500 nm and 650 nm. A numerical study shows a relative improvement of 10 % for the luminous power efficiency of a 3 color white OLED with the additional layers.

An automatic alignment system which is primarily sensitive to the carrier field component of the beam will not, in general, provide optimal SNR. We present an approach that modifies traditional dither alignment sensing by applying a large amplitude modulation on the signal field, thereby producing error signals that are sensitive to the signal sideband field alignment. When used in conjunction with alignment actuators, this approach can improve the detected SNR; we demonstrate a factor of 3 improvement in the SNR of a kilometer-scale detector of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.

40|$|Up to now, {{transverse}} quantum effects (usually {{labelled as}} "quantum imaging" effects) which are generated by nonlinear devices inserted in <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavities</b> have been calculated using the "thin crystal approximation", i. e. {{taking into account}} the effect of diffraction only inside the empty part of the cavity, and neglecting its effect in the nonlinear propagation inside the nonlinear crystal. We introduce in the present paper a theoretical method which is not restricted by this approximation. It allows us in particular to treat configurations closer to the actual experimental ones, where the crystal length is comparable to the Rayleigh length of the cavity mode. We use this method {{in the case of the}} confocal OPO, where the thin crystal approximation predicts perfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane, whatever its size and shape. We find that there exists in this case a "coherence length" which gives the minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed, and which gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can be obtained using such devices.

40|$|Suspended <b>resonant</b> <b>optical</b> <b>cavities</b> {{are basic}} {{building}} blocks for several experimental devices. An important issue is the control strategy required to bring them in the resonant or slightly detuned configuration needed for their operation, the so-called locking procedure. This can be obtained with a feedback strategy, but the error signal needed is tipically available only when the cavity is near the resonance with a precision of the order Δ L≃λ_ℓ F^- 1, where F is the cavity finesse and λ_ℓ is the laser's wavelength. When the mirrors are freely swinging the locking can be attempted only {{in the short time}} windows when this condition is verifyed. Tipically this means that the procedure must be repeated several times, and that large forces must be applied. In this paper we describe a different strategy, which tries to take advantage {{by the fact that the}} dynamics of the mirrors is known at least in an approximate way.

This challenge requires to place optical elements (e. g. mirrors, lenses, etc.) and to steer light beams with sub-nanometer precision. Existing methods for beam direction computing in resonators, e. g. iterative ray tracing or generalized ray transfer matrices, are either computationally expensive or rely on overparametrized models of optical elements.
