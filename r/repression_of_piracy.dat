Actions envisaged in the resolution should only apply to the territorial waters of Somalia, based upon that country’s prior consent. The resolution addressed solely the specific situation off the coast of Somalia, as requested by the Government.|$|E
40|$|Jurisdictional Aspects of <b>Repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>Piracy</b> The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the {{jurisdictional}} aspects of <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> in modern international law. The main reason for my research was to find out, whether there were sufficient legal instruments to be used while fighting piracy {{off the coast of}} Somalia. The thesis is composed of an introduction, five chapters and a summary. After an introductory chapter, which sets out the goals of this thesis, chapter one gives a brief insight into piracy's role throughout the history and shows the main causes of the Somalia piracy crisis and the answer of the international community. Moreover, this chapter explains that while piracy off the coast of Somalia seems to be a problem of the past, new piracy epicentre seems to have emerged near the coasts of Nigeria. Chapter two gives a deeper insight into the problem of defining piracy. It gives examples of the different definitions as used in various legal and also supporting documents and further follows up on the definition of piracy iure gentium as is stipulated in the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas. Chapter three sets out the theoretical grounds for asserting jurisdiction. At first, it concerns itself with territorial jurisdiction, as the most common and well established base, and after [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s, China and Brazil became {{increasingly}} interconnected, {{based largely on}} the production, distribution and consumption of cheap Chinese products. These countries have different cultural and historical attitudes to copied goods and non-regulated economic activities. However, {{over the last decade}} the dominant nations of the world system have been strengthening enforcement against piracy. This means that China and Brazil are now supposed to deal with the so-called piracy and their marketplaces. Based on ethnographical research of the commodity chain from China to Brazil from 1999 to 2009, this paper argues that Brazil and China react in different ways to the <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> imposed by major international actors. Despite the fact that the informal economy and the market for copies {{play an important role in}} both countries, the Chinese state views such activities as drivers of its development, while the Brazilian state interprets them as obstacles...|$|E

Arriving at the Calabrian port of Pizzo, Murat attempted to rally support in the town square, but his plan turned awry. The crowd was hostile and he was attacked by an old woman blaming him for the loss of her son. Calabria had been badly hit by Murat's <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> local <b>piracy</b> and brigandage during his reign.|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{international}} practice {{developed in the}} past years off the coasts of Somalia, the article highlights the main difficulties States are facing in contrasting the massive phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> which {{at the same time}} is a consequence of the lack of effectiveness of the somali government and an obstacle for its real consolidation. The juridical framework is somehow exceptional, because of the involvement of the UN Security Council, but in fact confirms the traditional law of the sea approach to piracy, which enables States to arrest foreign vessels in the high seas and requires permission by the coastal State to take action in the territorial sea. To bring the expected results and prosecute the individuals suspected <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> {{the international}} effort for the prevention and <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> the phenomenon relies on the appropriate application of multilateral conventions already in force and on new implementing measures, adopted by the competent Organizations...|$|R

40|$|In an epoch of {{transnational}} armed conflict, global environmental harm, and rising inequality, the extraterritorial application {{of human rights}} law has become a pressing and controversial legal issue. Human rights are invoked to address a number of global-scale problems, such as trans-border environmental harm, social and economic development, global inequality, the <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> in ungoverned spaces, and military occupation and armed conflict in the territory of a third state.

40|$|Since 2008 {{increasing}} pirate {{activities in}} Somalia, the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean have once again drawn the international community's attention to piracy and armed robbery at sea. States are resolved to repress these impediments {{to the free}} flow of trade and navigation. To this end a number of multinational counter-piracy missions have been deployed to the region. This book describes the enforcement powers that States may rely upon in their quest to repress piracy in the larger Gulf of Aden region. The piracy rules of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the legal safeguards applicable to maritime interception operations are scrutinized before the analysis turns to the criminal prosecution of pirates and armed robbers at sea. The discussion includes so-called shiprider agreements, the transfers of alleged offenders to regional states, the jurisdictional bases for prosecuting pirates, and the feasibility of an international(ized) venue for their trial. In addressing a range of relevant issues, this book presents a detailed and comprehensive up-to-date analysis of the legal issues pertaining to the <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> and armed robbery at sea and assesses whether the currently existing legal regime is still adequate to effectively counter piracy in the 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{conclude}} {{that there is a}} greater rate <b>of</b> software <b>piracy</b> by individuals from poorer compared to richer countries.

40|$|Publishers of {{computer}} software and music claimed losses of over $ 17. 6 billion to piracy in 2002. Theoretically, however, piracy may raise legitimate demand through positive demand-side externalities, sampling, and sharing. Accordingly, the actual impact <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> on the legitimate demand is an empirical issue. Addressing {{this issue in}} the context of recorded music, we develop and test hypotheses from theoretical models <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> on international data for music CDs over the period 1994 - 98. Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that "theft" outweighed the "positive" effects <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> However, the impact <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> on CD sales was considerably less than estimated by industry. We estimated that, in 1998, actual losses amounted to about 6. 6 % of sales, or 42 % of industry estimates. But, we found evidence that publishers would have raised prices in the absence <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> suggesting that the actual revenue loss would have been higher. ...|$|R
40|$|The text Maritime Piracy, Its Suppression and Punishment, {{analyses}} piracy as {{a classical}} threat to international maritime traffic, which has reappeared after being considered obsolete in {{a majority of}} the world for several decades. The text first discusses general questions connected with piracy - a definition <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> according to public international law is presented. Consequently, the factual side <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> is presented, since piracy still is a topic not very well-known in the Western world. In the following part of the text, the tools provided by public international law for suppression <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> are analyzed, as well as possible ways of prosecution of persons accused <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> The final part of the text discusses the case study of Somalia. In Somalia, piracy has become a threat to international peace as well as a severe hindrance to international maritime trade.

40|$|The {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> {{became more}} complex in Elizabethan and Jacobean romance, {{as a result}} of increasing generic sophistication and changing political circumstances. Generic developments in romance coincided with a period <b>of</b> intense English <b>piracy,</b> and as a result political changes concerning attitudes to the ideology and material practice <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> shape the treatment of seaborne crime in Elizabethan and Jacobean writing. Through a discussion <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> in John Barclay's Argenis (1621), examined in relation to its depiction in Philip Sidney's New Arcadia (1590) and Mary Wroth's Urania (Part 1, 1621; Part 2, written ? 1621 – 26), this article explores how depictions <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> do not alter simply in line with government policy regarding seaborne crime, but are also used to debate the merits of policy and leadership. <br/...|$|R

The piracy prevention measures {{can be divided into}} ethical, legal, and technical measures. Technical measures include measures like obfuscation and tamper-proofing, for example.
