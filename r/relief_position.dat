He is told that he's getting the start for an upcoming big game, and is given a hard time from Van Leemer which doesn't help his confidence or nerves. He goes to the Oasis to talk to his brother for support, but also receives no support. The bad night continues when he goes to see Tenley at home, meets her ex-boyfriend, and is embarrassed by her parents in front of him. They have a huge fight in the driveway in which she tells him that her parents don't know about them, and makes Ryan feel like he's just a summer fling. The next night, Ryan starts out well in the big game, but comes apart later on. The loss causes him to be demoted from his starting position to the bullpen in a <b>relief</b> <b>position.</b> Despite the bad outing, Hugh Alexander (John C. McGinley) the scout for the Philadelphia Phillies is still interested in Ryan. Dejected at his struggles and being demoted, Ryan snaps at Auggie and Pete after the game and says he likely won't appear at the final games. Showing what true friends are, Auggie snaps back at Ryan, stating that despite everything they will always be there to support him. The next morning, Tenley is mowing the Dunne's lawn and Ryan goes out to talk to her, they make up, and she invites him to the party at the Parrish house that night. At the party, Rand corners Ryan telling him that he wants Ryan to leave Tenley alone, or he will have his father replaced as the lawn maintenance person for all the rich families on Shore Road. Ryan tells him off, then leaves the party. Tenley follows him out and he asks her to meet him on the field after the game. At home, Ryan tells his dad what Rand said, and he doesn't appear concerned, but apologizes for snapping at him a few nights ago. And tells Ryan not to get discouraged with baseball.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the spatial {{distribution}} of small-leaved forests in Kuznetskaya depression where they are forest component of zonal forest-steppe vegetation. Two levels of spatial organization were determined. According to mesorelief communities of different associations are organized into topo-ecological series. These series differ by length and set of communities. On higher level spatial distribution is controlled by climate and reflects zonal structure. Central part of the depression is occupied by Artemisio–Betuletum communities in combination with communities of Calamagrostio–Betuletum which occur in more humid habitats. Near {{the eastern edge of the}} depres­sion forest vegetation is represented by combination of Trollio–Populetum and Campanulo–Betuletum communities where the first one is more typical for the plain conditions and second one – for the mountainous environment. In south­ern part of the depression communities of Campanulo–Betuletum are widespread in combination with Saussureo–Populetum communities which localized on higher well-moisturized slopes.

In this study we use very-high-resolution Worldview satellite stereopairs and Resurs-P images to reveal and measure the geomorphic features that preceded and followed GEC formation on the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas. Analysis of DEMs allowed us to: (1) distinguish different terrain positions of the GEC, {{at the foot of a}} gentle slope (Yamal), and on an upper edge of a terrace slope; (2) notice that the formation of both Yamal and Gydan GECs were preceded by mound development; (3) measure a funnel-shaped upper part and a cylindrical lower part for each crater; (4) and measure the expansion and plan form modification of GECs. Although the general characteristics of both craters are similar, there are differences when comparing both key sites in detail. The height of the mound and diameter of the resulting GEC in Yamal exceeds that in Gydan; GEC- 1 was surrounded by a well-developed parapet, while AntGEC did not show any considerable accumulative body.

40|$|ABSTRACT- This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the soil seed bank and its relationship with environmental factors that have an influence {{in the distribution of}} the vegetation above the ground in an excluded area of natural grassland in the South of Brazil. Most of the 122 identified species in the seed bank were perennials. Data analysis indicated three distinct community groups, according to the size and composition of the soil seed bank in lowlands with permanent wet soils, in lowlands and in other areas. In general, lowlands were characterized by low-fertility soils, high moisture and aluminum contents, being spatially homogeneous habitats and, therefore, more restricted to vegetation heterogeneity than other parts of the relief. Environmental factors most associated with soil seed bank size and composition were <b>relief</b> <b>position</b> and their co-related soil variables such as: soil moisture content, potassium content, organic matter, basic saturation of cation exchange soil capacity, exchangeable basics sum of the soil and clay soil content. According to that, <b>relief</b> <b>position,</b> associated with combined effects of soil chemical properties related to it, determines the observed variation pattern of the soil seed bank, as a reflection of the vegetation above the area.

This study highlighted on the important aspects and properties of soil catena of Daher El-Jabal in Jabal Al-Arab mountainous area South eastern of Syria, by implementing pedologic study in 2010 - 2012. Six soil profiles have been studied along pedo-genetic transect in order to highlight the soil catena prevailing properties. The results reveal that the soil has formed from igneous basaltic parent casts, related to Neogen era, where reliefs had the {{key role in the}} developing of soil solum. Consequently, Entisols were dominated on eroded summits, Inceptisols on back slops and mountain flanks, Mollisols on depressions. Both water erosion of soil surface and leaching inside soil solum processes were responsible for variation of soil texture, as such soils showed evident of changing in particles size distribution as well as in clay content. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was less than moderate with domination of Magnesium cation. Soil trace elements were poor to somewhat poor. Soil pH values in general were low; which reflect the pedo-genic character of igneous parent material in which soil drifted from. In some cases, where soil body subjected to continuous leaching of soil bases, in particular calcium cation; soil profiles became totally freed from calcium carbonates. Accordingly soil problems related to downing of soil reaction (pH) are more expected to be increasing by time.

40|$|Abstract Background Mayas {{living in}} {{southeast}} Mexico have used soils for millennia and provide thus {{a good example}} for understanding soil-culture relationships and for exploring the ways indigenous people name and classify the soils of their territory. This paper shows an attempt to organize the Maya soil knowledge into a soil classification scheme and compares the latter with the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). Methods Several participative soil surveys were {{carried out in the}} period 2000 - 2009 with the help of bilingual Maya-Spanish-speaking farmers. A multilingual soil database was built with 315 soil profile descriptions. Results On the basis of the diagnostic soil properties and the soil nomenclature used by Maya farmers, a soil classification scheme with a hierarchic, dichotomous and open structure was constructed, organized in groups and qualifiers in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} WRB system. Maya soil properties were used at the same categorical levels as similar diagnostic properties are used in the WRB system. Conclusions The Maya soil classification (MSC) is a natural system based on key properties, such as <b>relief</b> <b>position,</b> rock types, size and quantity of stones, color of topsoil and subsoil, depth, water dynamics, and plant-supporting processes. The MSC addresses the soil properties of surficial and subsurficial horizons, and uses plant communities as qualifier in some cases.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} kinesiotherapy in the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy and subsequent preparation for birth. Pregnancy is a physiological state {{when the body}} nourishes two organisms. Because of the baby nourishment pregnancy is certain strain for pregnant woman?s organism. Kinesiotherapy at {{the final stage of}} pregnancy is very important. The theoretical part describes physiological changes in female organism during pregnancy. Changes particularly occur in the respiratory system, circulatory system, musculoskeletal system and in body weight. From physiotherapeutic point of view particularly the changes in the postural system and selected muscles are described. Sudden weight growth affects the overall body posture and the structure of pregnant woman?s foot arch. The theoretical part also describes physiological birth, its phases and their length. The last chapter of the thesis theoretical part focuses on the most frequently applied kinesiotherapy methods. These are Ludmila Mojzisová method, Pilates method and gravidyoga. Outline of further kinesiotherapy methods then follows. The bachelor thesis has two aims and one research question set. The first aim is to introduce motion therapy among women in the 3 rd semester of pregnancy. The second aim is to prepare pregnant women for the birth by means of kinesiotherapy. The research question deals with finding whether kinesiotherapy has positive influence on the birth progress. Quantitative research method in the form of elaboration of case studies from three respondents was applied to meeting the goals in the practical part. The respondents attended pregnancy exercise and birth preparation classes. Case history was taken from of each pregnant woman to get the necessary data. The interview included information on accidents, operations, painful states, sport activities both before and during pregnancy. Static and dynamic check-up of aspections was then performed. The static check-up focused on overall body posture in back, side, and front views and was documented. The dynamic check-up monitored backbone development and hypermobility test. The practical part then describes individual therapies. An individual kinesiotherapeutic plan is described for all three respondents. The practical part is concluded in an output kinesiological analysis several days after the birth. The output examination also includes an interview on the birth progress and mental state of the respondents. The research confirmed that kinesiotherapy was beneficial for pregnant respondents in the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. The locomotor system problems caused by pregnancy changes in female organism were reduced or eliminated. The clients describe mental well-being during motion activities as well as between the visits. Birth preparation in the form of breathing in the individual birth phases and training of <b>relief</b> <b>position</b> was included into the therapy near the end of pregnancy. The women used the <b>relief</b> <b>position</b> on the big ball in the first birth period and as well as breathing specific for the individual birth phases. The research did not confirm whether kinesiotherapy influences the birth progress. Two of the three respondents delivered without significant complications. The delivery of the woman No. 1 was on the due date. The woman No. 3 delivered less than 3 weeks before the due date. The delivery was without serious complications in both the women. However there were complications in the respondent No. 3 caused by wrong position of the child. Caesarean section in epidural anaesthesia followed. The woman had no problems after the anaesthesia and was transported to the postpartum ward the next day after the intervention.
