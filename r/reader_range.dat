40|$|Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more and more popular in the field of ubiquitous computing, in particular for objects identification. An RFID system is composed by one or more readers and a number of tags. One of the main issues in an RFID network is the fast and reliable identification of all tags in the <b>reader</b> <b>range.</b> The reader issues some queries, and tags properly answer. Then, the reader must identify the tags from such answers. This is crucial for most applications. Since the transmission medium is shared, the typical problem to be faced is a MAC-like one, i. e. to avoid or limit the number of tags transmission collisions. We propose a protocol which, under some assumptions about transmission techniques, achieves a 60 % perfomance on the average (in terms of transmitted bits). It is based on a proper recursive splitting of the concurrent tags sets and on signal storing and later cancellation, until all tags have been identified...|$|E

In this paper we address more general scenarios, involving tags that are free to move and may stay in the <b>reader</b> <b>range</b> for very short time (e. g., a few seconds), making their identification a real challenge for the reader. We propose a protocol, called PrIME (for Priority-based tag Identification in Mobile Environments), {{that is based on}} a probabilistic model and performs continuous reading cycles during which tags may enter and leave the system at any time. Through extensive ns 2 -based simulations we show that PrIME is very efficient, as it is able to identify 98 - 99 % of mobile tags and to reduce the identification delay drastically with respect to other protocols...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in mobile RFID systems {{is the ability to}} read tags before they leave the system. So far, only a few works have considered tag mobility, targeting specific application scenarios, such as tags placed on a moving conveyor belt. However, many emerging applications involve mobile entities that are free to move so that the set of tags under the <b>reader</b> <b>range</b> is continuously and significantly changing. Such a mobile scenario poses important issues in terms of reliability and timeliness of the reading process. Not only the reader has to estimate the cardinality of the tag population passing through the system, but it has to also timely identify all tags. In this paper we propose PrIME, a new anti-collision protocol for single reader mobile systems. By means of extensive performance evaluation we show that PrIME is able to identify 100 % of mobile tags when they follow a pedestrian mobility model, reducing the tag identification delay by over 90 % with respect to the most performing solutions available in the literature...|$|E

30|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on framed slotted Aloha (FSA) and passive ultra {{high-frequency}} radio frequency identification multi-antenna systems with physical layer collision recovery. We modify the tags slightly by adding a so-called ‘postpreamble’ that facilitates channel estimation. Furthermore, we investigate the throughput performance of advanced receiver structures in collision scenarios. More specifically, we analyse the throughput of FSA systems with up to four receive antennas that can recover from a collision of up to eight tags on the physical layer and acknowledge all tags involved in that collision. Due to the higher collision recovery capabilities, the frame sizes can be significantly reduced, and thus, the throughput can be increased. We also derive analytically optimal frame sizes, given that {{a certain number of}} collisions can be resolved. We further study the constraints to the throughput due to the structure of our receiver and channel estimation for different collision scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a novel collision recovery method with two phases: first, a successive interference cancellation and, second, a projection of the constellation into the orthogonal subspace of the interference. Additionally, the inventory time, i.e. the number of slots necessary to successfully decode all tags in the <b>reader</b> <b>range,</b> is calculated and compared for different receiver types. A validation of our theoretical predictions is achieved by means of simulations. We show that by our proposed methods, we can realistically achieve more than ten times higher throughput or, equivalently, a reduction of the inventory time by more than 90 %.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} dedicated Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software for automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) {{on the performance of}} radiologists screening for breast cancer. METHODS: 90 ABUS views of 90 patients were randomly selected from a multi-institutional archive of cases collected between 2010 and 2013. This dataset included normal cases (n= 40) with > 1 year of follow up, benign (n= 30) lesions that were either biopsied or remained stable, and malignant lesions (n= 20). Six readers evaluated all cases with and without CAD in two sessions. CAD-software included conventional CAD-marks and an intelligent minimum intensity projection of the breast tissue. Readers reported using a likelihood-of-malignancy scale from 0 to 100. Alternative free-response ROC analysis was used to measure the performance.

It has been motivated by the availability of long-range passive RFID tags that can be acquired at a distance up to 35 meters. The analysis performed in this research work highlights the main {{strengths and weaknesses of}} existing anti-collision algorithms which assume a static RFID tag population and are not really efficient in identifying mobile tags like vehicles. Several key factors are taken into account, such as: <b>reader’s</b> <b>range,</b> <b>reader’s</b> reading rate, vehicle speed, and size of tag population. Three main configurations were analyzed: one RFID reader per traffic lane, two RFID readers per two traffic lanes and one RFID reader per multiple traffic lanes. Simulation models have been developed in C++ and validated under a certain confidence level to estimate the car loss ratio (CLR). Main results showed that when slow RFID readers are used, CLR is low when each car lane is assigned an RFID reader. However, in case of fast RFID readers, several car lanes can share a single RFID reader, leading to a reduced CLR. These results have been consolidated by a cost analysis which showed the cost effectiveness of sharing the same RFID reader by several car lanes while maintaining a low CLR. Finally, several design issues have been identified for future research work...|$|R

30|$|Overlapped tags are {{a reality}} in most {{deployments}} {{regardless of whether they}} are well planned or not.

The chances of overlapped tags is exacerbated by the presence of heterogeneous tags in the area.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the performance of}} the spine sign in detecting lower chest abnormalities in the lateral view. Methods: This retrospective study included 200 patients who had undergone lateral view and CT scans of the chest within 1 week. Two radiologists independently read the lateral views, and a third radiologist, blinded to the aim of the study, read the scans. The spine sign was considered as positive if the progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies was altered. Interreader agreement was calculated through k-statistics. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were calculated compared with CT. Results: Agreements between <b>readers</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 12 to 0. 68. Positive spine sign could appear in two ways: absent or inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were, respectively, 60 % and 70 %; 64 % and 84 %; 91 % and 97 %; 19 % and 29 %; and 61 % and 72 % for each <b>reader</b> (p-value <b>ranging</b> from 0. 026 to 0. 196). Abnormalities most frequently associated with positive spine sign were plate-like atelectasis, ground-glass opacity, pleural effusion and consolidation. Conclusion: The spine sign can present as an absent or inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies. It has a moderate sensitivity but a good positive-predictive value, so it can be useful especially when it appears as inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies to detect various abnormalities usually identifiable on chest radiographs. Advances in knowledge: On lateral chest radiographs, the spine sign is useful to detect lower chest abnormalities and is related to various underlying abnormalities and is, per se, non-specific.
