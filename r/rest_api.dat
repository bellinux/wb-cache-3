40|$|International audienceCloud {{computing}} {{is currently}} the most popular model to offer and access computational resources and services. Many cloud providers use the REST architectural style (Representational State Transfer) for offering such computational resources. However, these cloud providers face challenges when designing and exposing <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> {{that are easy to}} handle by end-users and/or developers. Yet, they benefit from best practices to help them design understandable and reusable <b>REST</b> <b>APIs.</b> However, these best practices are scattered in the literature and they have not be studied systematically on real-world APIs. Consequently, we propose two contributions. In our first contribution, we survey the literature and compile a catalog of 73 best practices in the design of <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> making APIs more understandable and reusable. In our secondcontribution, we perform a study of three different and well-known <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> from three cloud providers to investigate how their APIs are offered and accessed. These cloud providers are Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, and Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI). In particular, we evaluate the coverage of the features provided by the REST APIsof these cloud providers and their conformance with the best practices for <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> design. Our results show that Google Cloud follows 66 % (48 / 73), OpenStack follows 62 % (45 / 73), and OCCI 1. 2 follows 56 % (41 / 73) of the best practices. Second, although these numbers are not necessarily high, partly because of the strict and precise specification of best practices, we showed that cloud APIs reach an acceptable level of maturity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCloud {{computing}} is {{a popular}} Internet-based computing paradigm that provides on-demand computational services and resources, generally offered by cloud providers' REpresentational State Transfer (<b>REST)</b> <b>APIs.</b> To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there has been no study on the analysis of the lexicon adopted by cloud providers, despite its importance for developers. In this paper, we studied three different and well-known <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> (Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, and Open Cloud Computing Interface) to investigate and organise their lexicons. This study presents three main contributions: 1) a tooled approach, called CLOUDLEX, for extracting and analysing REST cloud computing lexicons, 2) a dataset of services, resources, and terms used in the three studied <b>REST</b> <b>APIs,</b> 3) our analysis of this dataset, which represents a first attempt to provide a common REST cloud computing lexicon. After analysing our dataset, we observe that although the three studied <b>REST</b> <b>APIs</b> to describe the same domain (cloud computing), contrary to what one might expect, they do not share a large number of common terms, and only 5 % of terms (17 / 352) are shared by two providers. Thus, the three APIs are lexically heterogeneous, and there is not a consensus on which terms to use on cloud computing systems. We discuss new avenues for cloud computing API designers and researchers...|$|R
