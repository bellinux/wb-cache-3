5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened {{immediately}} after Alexander's death in Babylon, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his <b>regent.</b> However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. When Perdiccas invaded Egypt {{in the summer of}} 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus. The council appointed Antipater as <b>regent</b> over the two kings, after which Antipater delegated authority to the leading generals. However, before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as the <b>regent</b> to succeed him, passing over his own son Cassander, ignoring the right of the king to choose a <b>regent</b> (since Philip III was considered mentally unstable), and bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E

5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince <b>Regent</b> (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the Duke of York; William, the Duke of Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the Duke of Kent. The Prince <b>Regent</b> had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The Duke of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as <b>regent</b> in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be <b>regent,</b> and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E
