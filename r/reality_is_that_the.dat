Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to this labor crisis, the AFL-CIO made many attempts to renew its labor movement in the 1980s, {{but none of them}} were successful. However, in 1988, an AFL-CIO organized teleconference of trade unionists recognized the potential of the nascent organizing model, gave it its name, and resolved to spread it throughout the trade-union movement: this was an element in the model's popularization. After the teleconference, the AFL-CIO, according to Hurd, established the [...] "Organizing Institute," [...] and the goal of the institute was [...] "...to train union organizers." [...] While, as Richard Hurd suggests, the attempts at reigniting the flame of union membership were largely unsuccessful, in 1995, former SEIU President John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO on the New Voice slate, on a platform of spreading the organizing model across the members of the federation. According to Richard Hurd, when Sweeney took over, he created an [...] "Organizing Department" [...] to enhance the strategy of employing the organizing model throughout the AFL-CIO, and he encouraged unions to begin [...] "...devoting 30% of their budgets to recruitment." [...] The extent of the success of this is disputed, with some suggesting that more rhetoric has changed than anything, but it did have at least some effect. Richard Hurd suggests that [...] "The <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individual national unions determine their own resource allocations and develop their own organizing programs," [...] but [...] "Most unions have increased the funding of their organizing departments, and many have devoted substantial resources to the effort."

30|$|As of July 2011, what {{happened}} in <b>reality</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commercial reactor business of AECL was sold to SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based company.
