Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the <b>restart,</b> which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the <b>restart,</b> there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the <b>restart,</b> dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the <b>restart,</b> moving up to fourth. The <b>restart</b> only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing <b>restart,</b> Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E

Lenka Kovářová Department: Department of Software and Computer Science Education Supervisor: RNDr. František Mráz, CSc. Abstract: <b>Restarting</b> {{automaton}} is {{a theoretical}} model of device recognizing a formal language. The construction of various versions of <b>restarting</b> automata {{can be a}} hard work. Many different methods of learning such automata have been developed till now. Among them are also methods for learning target <b>restarting</b> automaton from a finite set {{of positive and negative}} samples using genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a method for improving learning of <b>restarting</b> automata by means of evolutionary algorithms. The improvement consists in inserting new rules of a special form enabling adaption of the learning algorithm to the particular language. Furthermore, there is proposed a system for testing of learning algorithms for <b>restarting</b> automata supporting especially learning by evolutionary algorithms. A part of the work is a program for learning <b>restarting</b> automata using the proposed new method with a subsequent testing of discovered automata and its evaluation in a graphic form mainly.
