25|$|In June 2012, Disney {{confirmed}} that Walt Disney Animation Studios was adapting Marvel Comics' series {{and that the}} film had been commissioned into early stages of development.

Series co-creators Seinfeld and Larry David asked Mehlman to write an episode for the show after they <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> articles he wrote for newspapers and magazines. Mehlman originally had the idea of Elaine moving away from Jerry, but David and Seinfeld felt it would be funnier if Elaine moved closer to Jerry instead. [...] "The Apartment" [...] was first broadcast in the United States on April 4, 1991 on NBC (and was the first new episode of the series after the underwhelming reception of the previous episode, The Phone Message caused it {{to go on a}} two-month hiatus), and was watched in 15.7 million homes, making it the ninth most-watched program of the week it was broadcast. The episode gained mostly positive responses from critics.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, David Benioff had a phone {{conversation}} with George R. R. Martin's literary agent about the books he represented, and became interested in A Song of Ice and Fire {{as he had been}} a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read the books before. [...] The literary agent then sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to Benioff. Benioff <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in [...] "maybe 36 hours". They pitched the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to his question, [...] "Who is Jon Snow's mother?" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think it might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt [...] "justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of Many Faces as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E

It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear.

Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, {{they will be able}} to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E
