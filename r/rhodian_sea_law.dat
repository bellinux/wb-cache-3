40|$|The paper {{describes}} basic financial {{elements of}} commercial navigation during the Roman and medieval period. These primarily include the persons who financed the voyage, {{as well as}} other partners as determined by law. The legal regulation in question concerns maritime loan, a deposit used as an instrument of security for the return of loan ever since the Ancient times by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and other maritime nations in the Eastern Mediterranean. The oldest legal regulations related to maritime loan {{can be found in the}} Roman law, the Rhodian Law on Jettison of Cargo, and the <b>Rhodian</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Law</b> (Lex Rhodia). The paper analyses elements related to maritime litigation {{as well as other}} relevant issues such as maritime flags. In addition, the paper explores the extent of the influence that these regulations have had on the resolution of certain legal issues connected with maritime navigation...|$|E

25|$|The {{process to}} {{establish}} a public ship register commenced in 1881. The background was that a bank was being considered which would have as its purpose to lend money to purchase ships. This would require a legal framework which would firmly establish ownership and collateral in ships. The <b>Sea</b> <b>Law</b> Commission was appointed in 1882 to consider this and other legal aspects of the shipping industry. It {{soon became clear that}} the commission would have ship registration as its main purpose, as other aspects of <b>sea</b> <b>law</b> had to be coordinated internationally. They reached a conclusion which resulted in an 1888 proposal for Parliament which was based on a single, central register for ships. Parliament decided not to consider the law, and similar proposals in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1897 were similarly dismissed.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, Simonton {{took his}} family for a river trip aboard the Delta Queen, a 285-foot {{steamboat}} then operating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Built in the 1920s, the Delta Queen had begun as a California riverboat operating between San Francisco and Sacramento. After Simonton's cruise, {{the owners of the}} Delta Queen found they could not keep the business going. Simonton had so enjoyed his trip aboard the boat that he saved the enterprise, buying a controlling interest in 1957-58. With partners including E. J. Quinby, he turned the enterprise around, and even added an 1897 steam calliope rescued from the sunken Island Queen. For forty-two years, the boat ran on a series of Congressional exemptions from Safety at <b>Sea</b> <b>laws.</b> In 1966, Simonton sent his employee Bill Muster to Washington, DC to obtain the first exemption. Although the boat never went to sea, it would have been subject to Safety at <b>Sea</b> <b>laws</b> because it was built of wood from the water up. Bill Muster and company vice president Betty Blake led the effort to list the Delta Queen on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. President Carter campaigned from the Delta Queen and was on it in 1979 on the day that Simonton died.|$|R

40|$|In {{this day}} and age of {{europeanisation}} and internationalisation of all aspects of society, including law, the topic of medieval maritime law has attracted increasing interest.   Regulating sea shipping, which is characterised by the connection between different ‘nations’, <b>sea</b> <b>law</b> is intrinsically international.   Or is it?  The existence of a common medieval maritime law has often been presumed, but is researched thoroughly {{for the first time in}} this study. By analysing the developing and spread of the written <b>sea</b> <b>laws</b> across Northern Europe and by comparing the contents of the different maritime regulations, as well as the legal practice in five Northern European towns (Lübeck in Northern Germany, Reval (Tallinn) in Estonia, Danzig (Gdansk) in Poland, Kampen in the Netherlands and Aberdeen in Scotland) by using the examples of shipwreck, jettison and ship collision, the author has aimed to determine whether it is accurate to speak of a common <b>law</b> of the <b>sea</b> in medieval Northern Europe on the level of the books of law, their contents and the practice of the law at the town courts. Research has proven that there was no uniformity on any of these levels, despite occasional similarities between the laws and the judgements passed by the courts.   There was no single law compilation available throughout Northern Europe at any time during the Middle Ages, there were no common regulations in the written laws and there was  no uniform legal practice in the towns of Northern Europe. The divergence between the five towns handled in this study could largely be explained by the different role each of the towns played on the European stage.
