40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment {{options for}} {{patients}} with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) include anti-epithelial growth factor therapies, which, in Europe, are indicated in patients with RAS wild-type tumours only and require prior mutation testing of "hot-spot" codons in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and NRAS. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the implementation of RAS testing methods and estimate the RAS mutation prevalence in mCRC patients. METHODS: Overall, 194 pathology laboratories were invited to complete an online survey. Participating laboratories were asked to provide information on their testing practices and aggregated RAS mutation data from 20 to 30 recently tested patients with mCRC. RESULTS: A total of 96 (49. 5 %) laboratories across 24 European countries completed the survey. All participants tested KRAS exon 2, codons 12 and 13. Seventy (72. 9 %) laboratories reported complete testing of all RAS hot-spot codons, and three (3. 1 %) reported only testing KRAS exon 2. Sixty-nine (71. 9 %) laboratories reported testing > 80 patients yearly for RAS mutation status. Testing was typically performed within the <b>reporting</b> <b>institution</b> (93. 8 %, n = 90), at the request of a treating oncologist (89. 5 %, n = 85); testing methodology varied by laboratory and by individual codon tested. For laboratory RAS testing, turnaround times were </= 10 working days for the majority of institutions (90. 6 %, n = 87). The overall crude RAS mutation prevalence was 48. 5 % (95 % confidence interval: 46. 4 - 50. 6) for laboratories testing all RAS hot-spot codons. Prevalence estimates varied significantly by primary tumour location, approximate number of patients tested yearly and indication given for RAS testing. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a rapid uptake of RAS testing in the majority of European pathology laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Transoral CO 2 laser cordectomy for {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) of the glottis has resulted in excellent voice and oncologic outcomes as compared with non-surgical therapy. However, published experience with primary CO 2 laser cordectomy specifically for glottic SCC involving the anterior commissure (AC) is limited. A review of single academic institution experience with CO 2 laser cordectomy for glottic SCC involving the AC. Patients undergoing European Laryngological Society (ELS) classification cordectomy type Va or type VI between 2005 and 2013 were included. Post-surgical voice analysis was performed by speech language pathologists (SLP) from the <b>reporting</b> <b>institution.</b> Thirty patients were identified for inclusion. Mean post-surgical follow-up time was 47. 6 months (range 11 – 59). Initial local recurrence was identified in 5 / 30 (16. 7 %) patients. 2 / 5 recurrences were successfully salvaged by repeat CO 2 laser resections, 2 / 5 ultimately required salvage total laryngectomy, and 1 / 5 patient developed a second primary preventing further curative treatment. Overall laryngeal preservation rate was 28 / 30 (93. 3 %). Overall survival of the study cohort was 96. 7 %. Mean postoperative voice handicap index- 120 score was 36. 9 (SD = 21. 4). Perceptual analysis performed on the GRBAS scale resulted in mean scores: G = 2. 1 (SD = 0. 9), R = 1. 3 (SD = 1. 1), B = 1. 6 (SD = 1. 2). Though cancers involving the AC represent an aggressive subgroup of glottic SCC, CO 2 laser cordectomy results in encouraging oncologic and voice outcomes {{without the need for}} further therapy in the majority of cases. Clinical trials are encouraged to further define optimal treatment recommendations for glottic SCC involving the AC...|$|E

30|$|A 30 -year-old woman {{presented}} to a gynecological emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain. The medical history was unremarkable. The patient did not complain of nausea, vomiting, changing bowel function or weight loss. Ultrasound {{was significant for}} intra-abdominal fluid without any abdominal or pelvic mass. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for a presumably ruptured benign ovarian cyst. During the operation, yellowish ascites were noted, which presented throughout the peritoneum. Additionally, metastatic foci of a primarily unknown cancer at the diaphragm were noted, consistent with a peritoneal carcinoma. Both ovaries appeared to be slightly enlarged in size and shape, but no biopsy could be performed. The patient was then admitted to the <b>reporting</b> <b>institution</b> for further evaluation and therapy. She {{presented to}} our department with an approximately 5 × 4 × 4 -cm, hard, non-tender, mobile mass at the left lower abdominal region of the trocar incision, suggesting a port-site metastasis of a malignant tumor. A gynecological ultrasound revealed abdominal ascites with slightly enlarged ovaries. The cytological examination of the punctured abdominal ascites revealed highly suspicious neoplastic cancer cells, without any information about the primary tumor site. A subsequent CT scan revealed peritoneal carcinosis with ascites, enlarged paravasal lymph nodes and ovaries, right pleura effusion and a tumor on the ventral part at the greater curve of the stomach between the corpus and antrum. These results were consistent with a metastatic gastric cancer (Krukenberg tumor). A subsequent gastroscopy showed an approximately 10 -cm, hard gastric tumor with no stenosis. Multiple biopsies revealed only a reflux esophagitis and a gastric Helicobacter pylori infection. Due to the highly suspicious tumor, a second gastroscopy was performed and multiple biopsies were taken. These biopsies showed a poorly differentiated tumor of unknown origin. Further immunohistochemical analysis revealed a negative steroid receptor status, suggesting a primary gastric cancer metastatic to the ovaries. After adequate mobilization, the patient was dismissed and referred for further palliative chemotherapeutic treatment.|$|E
40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} on {{an analysis of the}} popular representations of the July 5 riots. Thus, the data set primarily consists of media narratives. A few political sources were used to provide some context in determining the situated-ness of the dominant discourses in China. While numerous media outlets sought to narrate the events surrounding July 5, I focused on five (5) major news sources. These included Al Jazeera, the British Broadcasting Corporation, the China Daily, The +ew York Times, and Xinhua. The China Daily and Xinhua are Chinese media agencies and are for the most part controlled by the Chinese state. Analysis of these sources provided a look at the discourses dominant in China. Al Jazeera, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and The New York Times are international media sources from multiple locales. The use of a geographically dispersed data set allowed me to determine the most dominant discourses used in general and to understand how these discourses changed based on the location of specific reporting institutions. By location, I mean the physical placement of the <b>reporting</b> <b>institution</b> embedded in a particular socio-political atmosphere. For this thesis, I also limited the date range to the first four (4) weeks of reports in order to delimit the scope and focus on the early discursive framing of the July riots. Based on an initial review of the literature and narratives on the July 5 riots, I devised several general assumptions {{about the impact of the}} July 5 riots on identity and discourse. The media sensationalized the incident and created it as an Event that allowed for greater exposure within broad international media outlets. This exposure served as the foundation for the media to construct the Event as 'ethnic' conflict and reproduce group divisions through discursive framing. Individuals involved in the protest and the riots that followed organized along ethnic lines rather than by other forms of group identity, such as social status. The narratives that sought to define the incidents took up these ethnic identities, reifying the groups, bringing them to the forefront as the central actors and reproducing the ethnically charged sociopolitical atmosphere. The state (Chinese Communist Party, specifically) was also defined as a major player, a group involved in the riot, separate from the ethnic identities of 'Han' and 'Uyghur,' but still critical to the group-making processes. Multiple discursive frames were employed in the representation (see Table 1 below) all of which performed the process of reification...|$|E
40|$|This article {{focus on}} how two supervising {{authorities}} on the transport sector, The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Railway Audit Authority (RAA), have obtained different audit roles. This despite being supervised by the same ministry and having a similar mandate. Both agencies are young in their present form. I study how interaction with the organizational environment and developing internal culture makes a difference in organizational identity and audit performance. To describe audit-roles I use the indicators role consciousness, audit performance, task priority and reporting system. As theoretical tools to analyze the findings an instrumental, an institutional and an environmental perspective is used. Main findings are also compared and categorized through recognized categories for audit-roles and control mechanisms. Within role indicators the variations between the organizations studied exceeds that which {{can be explained by}} looking at the two bodies mainly as tools used against a given goal. Both internal characteristics and the task environment affect the organizational identity and audit-role. The CAA performs more physical control than the RAA. The rules and regulations in the civil aviation sector are stricter, more numerous and more specific. In the railway sector the RAA has more a supervisory role and audit personnel have more leeway when interpreting regulations. While the CAA can be categorized as a magistrate, in the RAA I recognized more the role of a “misunderstood” consultant. In the railway sector there is a history of major communication problems between the RAA and the railway co-operatives. In many cases the co-operatives have actively ignored the RAA and their recommendations regarding security inspections. When 19 people were killed in the Åsta accident, it forced the co-operatives to adopt a more humble attitude. The following investigation blamed the co-operatives for lack of security systems. The RAA gained a much stronger position as a supervising authority on the sector after this accident. In the civil aviation sector the CAA maintains respect and a good relationship with its audit objectives. This {{can be traced back to}} common competence and corporative participation in rule making. In general I find that the responsibility structure on the civil aviation sector is clearer and less confusing than the corresponding structure in the railway sector. However the CAA has had longstanding internal problems between audit departments, between new and old personnel and between leadership and employees. The findings show most similarities between the audits connected to task priority and reporting. This can be traced back to the common <b>reporting</b> <b>institution,</b> which is the Ministry of transport and communications. An interesting finding is that for both agencies the reporting of goal achievements to the ministry is unlikely to have any significant consequence attached to it.

40|$|This is a {{proposal}} to consider the collection and analysis of stresses among systemic financial institutions. The “ 10 -by- 10 -by- 10 ” labeling suggests the general approach. A regulator would collect and analyze information concerning the exposures of N significant entities to M defined stress tests. For each stress, an entity would report its gain or loss, in total, and with respect to its contractual positions {{with each of the}} K entities for which the exposure, for that scenario, is among the K greatest in magnitude relative to all counterparties. Those counterparties would be identified, stress by stress. The headline version takes each of N, M, and K to be 10. In practice, however, the set of N <b>reporting</b> <b>institutions</b> is likely to be similar to the set of financial institutions that have been identified by a regulator as systemically important, for example {{in the sense of the}} Dodd-Frank Act or the set of globally important financial institutions that have been identified by the Financial Stability Board. Thus, the number of <b>reporting</b> financial <b>institutions</b> is likely to be somewhat larger than 10, but less than a full order of magnitude larger.
