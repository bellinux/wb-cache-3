He was also planning {{to build a new}} hangar at Gatwick for £300,000. Although he had £500,000 in <b>retained</b> <b>profits,</b> he needed a further £1m for the planned investment. Freeman's search for finance led to an offer from Airwork to buy him out. Airwork also offered to leave him in control of Transair and to give him a seat on the board of Airwork's holding company. Freeman's accepted Airwork's offer and Transair became an Airwork subsidiary the following year. During that time, the War Office invited new tenders for trooping flight contracts to Europe and the Far East, {{as a consequence of the}} Government's growing dissatisfaction with the operational performance and high costs of the ageing Handley Page Hermes fleet that was contracted from Airwork, Britavia and Skyways to operate most of these flights. The War Office awarded Transair the European contract, which was to be operated with the new Viscounts the airline had on order. The contract was to become effective from 1958.|$|E

Therefore, in this work we seek to examine how <b>retained</b> <b>profit</b> affect the value creation of 223 Brazilian companies, from 2008 to 2014, the control used was investment opportunity. Therefore we used descriptive statistics and panel data models. As main results we found that there is a high level of <b>retained</b> <b>profit</b> in the sample, however, {{a small part of the}} companies created value in the period. Still, the negative relationship between the level of capitalization of profits and created value is highlighted. Besides, it was observed that the companies that belonged to groups of higher levels of profit distribution ended up generating more wealth for investors...|$|R
50|$|By 1978, BCal had fully {{recovered}} from the 1974 crisis year, which had threatened its very existence at that time. After the severe contraction forced upon it by the early 1970s' oil crisis, the company's core scheduled operation was growing again with new widebodied aircraft and routes being added and schedules being expanded. Business was booming with planes being fuller {{than at any time}} in the firm's history. The airline recorded a pre-tax profit of £12.2 million during its 1977/78 financial year to 31 October 1978. This translated into a £10 million <b>retained</b> <b>profit.</b> It was the company's best financial result since its formation back in November 1970. BCal's senior management decided to allocate £644,000 of the <b>retained</b> <b>profit</b> to a new profit-share scheme to reward its staff for their hard work, and as an incentive for the future.

5000|$|In {{an address}} to the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 2008, he stated: [...] "The {{resulting}} huge flows of capital are.... channeled via state controlled banks towards those corporations deemed most likely to make effective use of the money in boosting productivity." [...] "How is consumption suppressed? The most obvious method is via tight controls on consumer credit. Less obviously the economy is regulated to make it physically difficult for consumers to consume (for instance, by severely limiting access to imported luxuries and by tightly restricting the supply of housing space). Sometimes the resulting savings arise in the hands of consumers. In many cases, however, they accrue to corporations in the form of super-high <b>retained</b> <b>profits.</b> Such profits are then used to build national muscle in targeted industries. A typical arrangement is that cartels keep consumer prices high, thereby allowing member firms to earn the necessary high returns to keep investing at a fast pace in the export side of their business. Cartels are generally given free rein provided only that they serve the national goal of boosting productivity." ...|$|E

In 1984 about ¥44 billion, or roughly 30 percent of total state expenditures, was slated for capital construction. In 1981 the leadership attempted to limit uncontrolled, excessive investment in capital construction.

50|$|A {{series of}} {{reductions}} in the profits tax were brought in from 1951 onwards by the new Conservative government. The tax rates fell to 22.5% on distributed profits and 2.5% on undistributed profits by 1957, but the profits tax was no longer income tax-deductible. Derick Heathcoat-Amory's Budget of March 1958 replaced the differential profits tax with a single profits tax measure, applicable to both <b>retained</b> and distributed <b>profits.</b> This gradual decrease, and final abolition, of taxes on capital distributions reflected ideological differences between the Conservative and Labour parties: the Conservative approach was to distribute profits to capital holders for investment elsewhere, while Labour sought to force companies to <b>retain</b> <b>profits</b> for reinvestment in the company in the hope this would benefit the company's workforce.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that shares were still registered by name in the VOC's register, and that transfer of shares was effected by an entry in that register, witnessed by the company's directors. Such transfers were allowed at infrequent opportunities (usually when a dividend was paid). The [...] "shares" [...] that are presented as [...] "the world's first shares" [...] therefore were in reality what we now would call either stock certificates or else stock options (depending on the concrete circumstances). This secondary market in VOC stock proved quite successful. The paid-in capital of the company, and hence the number of shares, remained the same during the life of the company (about 6.5 million guilders), and when the company proved to be very successful the demand for its shares drove up their price till they reached 1200 percent in the 1720s. Remarkably, the VOC did not raise new capital by issuing new shares, but it relied on borrowing and <b>retained</b> <b>profits</b> for the financing of its expansion. This is remarkable, because previous ventures on the contrary did not borrow, but used additional subscriptions if they needed extra capital ...|$|E

This is opposed to the traditional historical cost accounting model under which {{the real value}} of that portion of shareholders´ equity never maintained constant with sufficient revaluable fixed assets (revalued or not) are unknowingly, unnecessarily and unintentionally eroded at a rate equal to the annual rate of inflation {{as a result of the}} implementation of the very erosive stable measuring unit assumption under HCA. CMUCPP was authorized in IFRS in 1989 as an alternative to the traditional HCA model at all levels of inflation and deflation in the original Framework (1989) and is applicable as a result of the absence of specific IFRS relating to the concepts of capital and capital maintenance and the valuation of specific constant real value non-monetary items.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to income tax, companies were also {{subject to a}} profits tax, which was deducted from company profits when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (profits distributed to shareholders) than on <b>profits</b> <b>retained</b> within the company. By penalising the distribution of profits, it was hoped companies would <b>retain</b> <b>profits</b> for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax {{did not have the}} desired effect, so the distributed profits tax was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their profits.
