5|$|Between January and March 1952 the {{journalist}} Ian Fleming wrote Casino <b>Royale,</b> his first novel, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. Fleming conducted research for Live and Let Die, and completed the novel before Casino <b>Royale</b> {{was published in}} January 1953, four months before his second book was published. Fleming and his wife Ann flew to New York before taking the Silver Meteor train to St. Petersburg in Florida and then flying on to Jamaica. In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E
5|$|Casino <b>Royale</b> {{was first}} {{released}} on 13 April 1953 in the UK as a hardback edition by publishers Jonathan Cape, {{with a cover}} devised by Fleming.

The sales figures were strong enough for Cape to offer Fleming a three-book deal. In April 1955 Pan Books issued a paperback version and sold 41,000 copies in the first year.|$|E

5|$|Director Quentin Tarantino {{expressed}} interest in directing an adaptation of Casino <b>Royale,</b> but Eon were not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with Casino <b>Royale.</b> Tarantino also {{said he would have}} set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1967 adaptation, {{the rights}} to the film {{remained}} with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio, and {{the rights to}} their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony. In 1999, following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM/UA, Sony traded the rights to Casino <b>Royale</b> for MGM's partial-rights to Spider-Man. This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film Casino <b>Royale.</b> The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. Casino <b>Royale</b> is a reboot, showing Bond {{at the beginning of his}} career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.|$|E
