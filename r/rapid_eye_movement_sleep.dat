25|$|Accumulated {{observation}} {{has shown}} that dreams are strongly associated with REM <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> <b>sleep,</b> during which an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness. Participant-remembered dreams during NREM sleep are normally more mundane in comparison. During a typical lifespan, a person spends {{a total of about}} six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night). Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes. It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.|$|E
25|$|The first semi-multiple-systematic {{study of}} the {{connection}} between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed that memory retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into <b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> <b>sleep</b> and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After {{about an hour and}} a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (<b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> <b>sleep),</b> when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> <b>sleep</b> (REM) {{has since}} its {{discovery}} been {{closely associated with}} dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep. (In fact these {{could be considered a}} hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.|$|E
500|$|Cats {{conserve}} {{energy by}} sleeping {{more than most}} animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term [...] "" [...] for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period.

2500|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> <b>sleep</b> can be subclassified into tonic and phasic modes.

2500|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>{{movement}}</b> <b>sleep</b> (REM), non-rapid {{eye movement}} sleep (NREM or non-REM), and waking represent {{the three major}} modes of consciousness, neural activity, and physiological regulation. NREM sleep itself is divided into multiple stages – N1, N2 and N3. Sleep proceeds in 90-minute cycles of REM and NREM, the order normally being N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. As humans fall asleep, body activity slows down. Body temperature, heart rate, [...] breathing rate, and energy use all decrease. Brain waves get slower and bigger. The excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine becomes less available in the brain. Humans often maneuver to create a thermally friendly environment—for example, by curling up into a ball if cold.

2500|$|The normal EEG also varies {{depending}} on state. The EEG is used along with other measurements (EOG, EMG) to define sleep stages in polysomnography. Stage I sleep (equivalent to drowsiness in some systems) appears on the EEG as drop-out of the posterior basic rhythm. There can {{be an increase in}} theta frequencies. Santamaria and Chiappa cataloged a number of the variety of patterns associated with drowsiness. Stage II sleep is characterized by sleep spindles – transient runs of rhythmic activity in the 12–14nbsp&Hz range (sometimes referred to as the [...] "sigma" [...] band) that have a frontal-central maximum. Most of the activity in Stage II is in the 3–6nbsp&Hz range. Stage III and IV sleep are defined by the presence of delta frequencies and are often referred to collectively as [...] "slow-wave sleep". Stages I–IV comprise non-REM (or [...] "NREM") sleep. The EEG in REM (<b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement)</b> <b>sleep</b> appears somewhat similar to the awake EEG.|$|E
2500|$|The normal sleep/wake {{cycle in}} adults {{is divided into}} REM (<b>rapid</b> <b>eye</b> <b>movement)</b> <b>sleep,</b> non-REM (NREM) sleep, and consciousness. NREM sleep is further divided into Stages 1, 2 and 3 NREM sleep. The deepest stage (stage 3 of NREM) is {{required}} for the physically restorative effects of sleep, and in pre-adolescents, this is the period of release of human growth hormone. NREM stage 2 and REM, which combined are 70% of an average person's total sleep time, are more associated with mental recovery and maintenance. [...] During REM sleep, in particular, muscle tone of the throat and neck, as well as the vast majority of all skeletal muscles, is almost completely attenuated, allowing the tongue and soft palate/oropharynx to relax, {{and in the case of}} sleep apnea, to impede the flow of air to a degree ranging from light snoring to complete collapse. In the cases where airflow is reduced to a degree where blood oxygen levels fall, or the physical exertion to breathe is too great, neurological mechanisms trigger a sudden interruption of sleep, called a neurological arousal. [...] These arousals rarely result in complete awakening but can have a significant negative effect on the restorative quality of sleep. [...] In significant cases of OSA, one consequence is sleep deprivation due to the repetitive disruption and recovery of sleep activity. [...] This sleep interruption in stage 3 (also called slow-wave sleep), and in REM sleep, can interfere with normal growth patterns, healing, and immune response, especially in children and young adults.|$|E
