25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a <b>radiator</b> <b>cap,</b> the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E

This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent air pockets, as with many modern cars.

60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} resumed their seats. The car started {{and then by}} an unfortunate inadvertency Sir Richmond pulled the gear lever over from the first speed to the reverse. There was a {{metallic}} clangour beneath the two gentlemen, and the car slowed down and stopped although the engine was still throbbing wildly, and the dainty veil of blue smoke still streamed forward {{from the back of}} the car before a gentle breeze. The doctor got out almost precipitately, followed by a gaunt madman, mouthing vileness, who had only a minute or so before been a decent British citizen. He made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate car, but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for displacements to adjust. Quivering and refusing, the little car was extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady in the hands of revolutionaries, and this made the behaviour of Sir Richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done. He stopped the engine, he went down on his hands and knees in the road to peer up at the gear-box, then without restoring the spark, he tried to wind up the engine again. He spun the little handle with an insane violence, faster and faster for--as it seemed to the doctor--the better part of a minute. Beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran together; he bared his teeth in a snarl; his hat slipped over one eye. He groaned with rage. Then, using the starting handle as a club, he assailed the car. He smote the brazen Mercury from its foothold and sent it and a part of the <b>radiator</b> <b>cap</b> with it flying across the road. He beat at the wings of the bonnet, until they bent in under his blows. Finally, he hurled the starting-handle at the wind-screen and smashed it. The starting-handle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the ground....|$|E

Powel made several additional failed attempts to manufacture cars (one of them a cycle car) before finding success in auto accessories.

40|$|A spherical <b>cap</b> <b>radiator</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} parts of an underwater wide-beam imaging system. The back radiation of a traditional spherical <b>cap</b> <b>radiator,</b> which is composed of a vibrating cap and a rigid baffle, is strong and its far-field directivity function may fluctuate in big amplitude {{in the vicinity of the}} polar axis. These shortcomings complicate the processing of the reflective waves received for imaging the targets. In this study, the back radiation is weakened by adding an acoustic soft material belt between the vibrating cap and the rigid baffle. And the fluctuation mentioned above is lowered remarkably by dividing the spherical <b>cap</b> <b>radiator</b> into many annuluses and a relatively smaller spherical cap, and by controlling the phase retardations of all elements appropriately. Furthermore, the numerical experiments are carried out by the finite element method (FEM) to prove the validity of the above methods.

Especially on bus work problems developed with damaged tappets, burnt valves, damaged valves, damaged pistons, damaged blocks, clogged injectors, cylinder block failures, smoke emissions and excessive wear as well as roughness and noise in operation, a tendency to refuse to restart when hot, refusal to start in general and endemic overheating, sometimes resulting in <b>radiator</b> <b>caps</b> being blown off and steam and scalding water jetting out behind the bus.
