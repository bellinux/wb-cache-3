50|$|In late 1295 Devereux {{requested}} remedy from Edward I as {{while on}} King's service in Gascony and under royal protection, John de Acton (sheriff of Hereford) broke down the gates to his park at Lyonshall, {{and took his}} stock to Hereford. Acton held the stock until he extracted a pledge for 30 marks that Devereux owed him, and for default of this money Devereux released 13 marks of <b>rent</b> <b>of</b> <b>assize</b> for the term of his life from the annual rent that Acton owed him. Devereux requested peace from further duress, and claimed that due to these he {{would be unable to}} go with Lord Edmund back to Gascony when called to muster on 1 November. William was granted an exemption from the Tenth to be collected in 1295, and did return to Gascony. On his return in late 1296 Devereux again pleaded for pity on his estate for the great mischief and default that he had suffered in Gascony. Under pressure from these financial strains he had made covenants with Roger de la Warr (1st Baron de la Warr) in which he enfeoffed him of the manors of Lyonshall, Stoke Lacy, and Holme Lacy for life in return for 30L per year at the two terms for his sustenance. On their return to England Devereux kept his part of the bargain, but de la Ware did not.|$|E
