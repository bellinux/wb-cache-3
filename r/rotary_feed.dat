This paper proposes a unified static stiffness model of <b>rotary</b> <b>feed</b> system with geared transmission system. Taking the torsional stiffness of transmission shaft and mesh stiffness of gear pairs into account, the motion equations of the whole transmission system are presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{analytical}} model that could be used by the designers of a <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting system (RFCS) to identify the power demand of the RFCS with limited or no required field or laboratory data. Two separate RFCS were investigated, incorporated with either a low-speed cutting process (LSCP) or a high-speed cutting process (HSCP). The results from the laboratory and field trials were used to create and validate the analytical model. Laboratory tests were completed with the LSCP RFCS and these concluded that counter-knife sharpness, serrations and bevel angle all had significant effects on the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS when processing cereal straw and alfalfa. The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS, while processing cereal straw, increased by 0. 35 kW∙h/tonne (or 96 %) when the sharpness of the counter-knives decreased from 0. 13 to 0. 63 mm (where the sharpness was recorded by the leading-edge-width of the counter-knives). With the same decrease in sharpness, the specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing alfalfa increased by 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne (or 32 %). The specific energy required by the LSCP RFCS while processing cereal straw with sharp counter-knives (counter-knives with a leading edge width of 0. 13 mm) increased by 0. 11 kW∙h/tonne (or 51 %) when serrated counter-knives were used instead of un-serrated counter-knives. However, counter-knife serrations did not have a significant effect on the specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS when sharp counter-knives were used to process alfalfa. The increase in bevel angle from 15 to 90 ° caused the specific energy required to process cereal straw and alfalfa to approximately triple. The moisture content of alfalfa also had a significant effect on the specific energy required to process alfalfa with the LSCP RFCS. The specific energy demand of the LSCP RFCS was at a maximum when alfalfa at a moisture content of 53 % on a wet basis (w. b.) was processed and decreased slightly (approximately 0. 04 kW∙h/tonne or 10 %) when dryer and wetter alfalfa was processed. Field tests were completed with the HSCP RFCS and it was concluded that in general, there was a direct relationship between the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS and the moisture content of the straw, counter-knife engagement and throughput. Further, it was also concluded that the specific energy requirements of the HSCP RFCS were more sensitive to counter-knife engagement when higher moisture content straw was processed. Depending on the type of chopper used, the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS increased anywhere from 0. 15 to 0. 77 kW∙h/tonne (or 22 to 61 %) when the counter-knife engagement was increased from 0 to 100 % (or fully removed to fully engaged). Again, depending on the type of chopper used, when the moisture content of the straw processed by the chopper increased from approximately 7 to 25 % w. b. the specific energy required by the chopper increased by 0. 14 to 0. 96 kW∙h/tonne (or 28 to 84 %). The effect of throughput on the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS was dependent on the type of chopper used. For one of the choppers, an increase in throughput from 10. 5 to 13. 5 tonne/h caused the specific energy required by the HSCP RFCS to increase by 0. 24 kW∙h/tonne (or 35 %); however for a different chopper, an increase in throughput from 12 to 13 tonne/h caused the specific energy demand of the HSCP RFCS to decrease by 0. 16 kW∙h/tonne (or 19 %). The analytical model was validated using a subset of the data that were collected while employing each cutting device under field conditions and the data collected with the use of a custom-designed material properties test stand. The output of the analytical model fell within the 95 % confidence interval of the measured power demand for each of the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting systems, and the analytical model was therefore deemed sufficiently accurate. Based on the analytical model, the total power demand of both the LSCP and HSCP <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> and cutting systems was largely attributed to the power required to transport plant material. Further, the power required to transport the plant material along the sides of the counter-knives was much greater than the power required to transport the plant material along the rotor bed and along the leading edge of the tines. Because of the excessive power required to transport plant material along the sides of the counter-knives, three techniques were identified as potential strategies to decrease the power demand of the RFCS. The first technique involved removing half of the tines from the RFCS, and modifying the remaining tines to decrease the amount of plant material that is entrapped between sides of the counter-knives and the tines. The second technique involved coating the inside surface of the tines with a baked Teflon, to decrease the coefficient of friction between the plant material and the RFCS. The third technique involved reshaping the counter-knives, to decrease the surface area over which plant material was transported along the side of the counter-knives. According to the analytical model, employing any of the three techniques would result in the total power demand of the RFCS to decrease by 15 to 26 %. For the HSCP RFCS, a stochastic model was developed to identify which of the four choppers tested during field trials would have the best performance when subjected to the same operating conditions. The chopper with the best performance was the WR chopper as its use resulted in the minimum geometric mean length of material exiting the combine harvester while also consuming the least amount of specific energy...|$|R

40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, <b>rotary</b> <b>feed,</b> and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in dexel form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E
40|$|Powder flow {{appears in}} many {{industrial}} processes, including pharmaceuticals, food, detergents etc. Understanding the parameters affecting powder flow {{is necessary for}} rational product and process design. This research examines powder-air interactions for three powder handling systems: bin discharge, linear shoe-die system and rotary paddle feeder. As a starting point the flow behaviour of powders was characterised using established procedures to provide basic set of properties for assessing flowability. Powder permeability {{and the influence of}} small levels of compaction on permeability were determined. The influence of differential pressure on flow initiation from arching state was examined for powders discharging from bins. A dimensional model was developed to predict the differential pressure required to initiate powder flow as a function of orifice diameter and height of the powder above the exit. The mass flow rate of the powders were measured under a range of differential pressures. A dimensional model was developed to predict the mass flow rate as a function of differential pressure and exit diameter. The effect of processing parameters on the mass of the powder delivered into the die in linear shoe-die systems under the gravity and suction fill mechanism were investigated. The system was accommodated with differential pressure transducers and the evolution of the pressure inside during the process was monitored. Dimensional models were developed to predict the mass delivered into the die as a function of powder differential pressure developed during gravity and suction fill, shoe velocity and the velocity of the punch in the die. The influence of paddle rotational speed, exit diameter and differential pressure on the mass flow rate of powders in <b>rotary</b> <b>feeding</b> system was examined. This research identified the dimensionless groups relevant for the understanding of the flow of fine and cohesive powders under differential air pressure conditions. The dimensional models developed account for air pressure effects for 1) flow initiation and 2) flow rate during bin discharge, 3) gravity and 4) suction fill mechanisms in linear shoe-die filling systems. These models can be used to aid the design of powder flow processes where air pressure effects are influential...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{oil and gas}} {{field are}} in general {{discovered}} far from existing platforms or shore. Development of subsea processing systems are often a suitable alternative rather than platforms or floating vessels in an economical aspect. This {{is due to the}} fact that new fields are generally smaller than the old ones, they are located in deeper waters and some of the mature fields are in tail-production. As the step-out distances increases, the need for developing new technology and architectures for subsea equipment has become desirable to ensure reliable power supply to subsea processing equipment. This master thesis is more or less a feasibility study of a proposed innovative topology for a subsea power system for a long-step out application. The system is introducing a rotary frequency converter as a subsea application for supplying large power demanding loads, such as compressors and pumps. The motivation behind this topic is increasing the power transmission capability and performance of the subsea cable, accordingly also the step-out length. Two main power systems are presented for this analysis. A singly operated <b>rotary</b> converter <b>feeding</b> a high speed induction motor is modeled and analyzed. Secondly, a subsea distribution grid including parallel operated converters for supplying two induction motors. The systems has been partly divided and modeled and analyzed in different simulation tools. The simulation results indicate several promising results after introducing the rotary converter into the power system. Some of the challenges regarding long step-out is reduced or eliminated. Some of the key results from the power flow analysis are; the voltage drop and voltage amplification in the transmission cable during full-load and no-load is completely compensated from a synchronous generator equipped with a automatic voltage regulator (AVR). Furthermore, the reactive power production in the cable is considerable reduced. The voltage level can therefore relatively be increased for the same power level, due to the fact that the reactive power production is increasing squared with the voltage level. In addition, the AC resistance of the cable is some reduced, due to less influence of skin effect and proximity effect. Consequently, reducing $I^ 2 R$ losses in the cable. A dynamic analysis has been performed regarding the stability during a disturbance in the system and the properties of the rotary converter. The objective is to examine how these disturbances affect the system. Additionally, a motor start-up analysis of the rotary converter has been executed. The results do not indicate any severe transient levels in the simulation cases. </p...|$|R
