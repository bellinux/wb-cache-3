It was then <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's ratings to above the five million mark.|$|E
5|$|Des McAnuff {{replaced}} Mann as director, and filming was <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> December 1994. Screenwriter Horovitz {{was busy}} playwrighting in Europe, so McAnuff and producer Marvin Worth were constantly rewriting the script in July 1994. The budget {{was estimated at}} $20 million. McAnuff stepped down as director {{and was replaced by}} Dennis Hopper. Hopper was a close friend with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film. By May 1995, DiCaprio was still the top candidate to portray Dean with Milčo Mančevski in discussions to direct the film.|$|E

The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace; it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} {{automatically}} {{appealed to the}} Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested {{to withdraw from the}} case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to prepare an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.|$|E

5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played. The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a {{decision as to whether}} the games would be <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> a later time. Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{primarily}} {{took place}} between 9 July and 11 August 2007; the first scene filmed depicted the group being accosted by the Host while crossing over the engines. On 12 July, Tennant's mother, Helen McDonald, began to succumb to her cancer. Filming was <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> allow Tennant to be present when she died and was buried; she died on 15 July and was buried on 21 July. During Tennant's absence, scenes in the Titanics reception area were filmed at the Exchange in Swansea and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay. Tennant filmed his scenes in the area on 16 and 17 July. The last use of the Coal Exchange was on the 18th; scenes depicting the ship's collision with meteors were filmed on that day.|$|E
5|$|Many of the weekend's Premier League {{fixtures}} were <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> avoid a {{clash with}} the final, with some kicking off at 12:45 on Saturday and others on Sunday. By coincidence, Manchester City and Stoke City were scheduled {{to meet in the}} league on cup final day. The league match was rearranged for the Wednesday after the final. This prompted criticism from Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp, whose team was challenging Manchester City for a place in the 2011–12 Champions League. Redknapp stated that if Manchester City won the final, it would then be in Stoke City's interest to lose against Manchester City in the league match, as it would make Europa League qualification for Stoke more likely. Stoke City refuted this accusation strongly, but ultimately this scenario was avoided. Champions League qualification was settled four days before the final, when Manchester City beat Tottenham Hotspur 1–0 in a league match.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} planned {{start date}} of 15 April was pushed back when the Italians had problems moving to their start positions and later had trouble providing transport to establish lines of communication across the Adriatic. The operation was <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> 25 April. Prior to the Ljubljana conference, the Ustaše authorities were concerned about negotiations between the German and Italian commanders and Dangić, and were particularly worried that the Germans would permit the Italians and Chetniks to use Sarajevo as a base. On 31 March {{the commander of the}} Ustaše Black Legion, Jure Francetić, launched a pre-emptive offensive primarily against Dangić's Chetniks. Francetić captured Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica, meeting limited resistance from the Partisans, and then scattered the more numerous Chetniks while inflicting significant losses.|$|E

Meanwhile, in Ocean City, Maryland, a celebratory fireworks event was postponed to July5, and in Boston, a Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks display were <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> July 3. Fireworks displays were also postponed throughout Rhode Island. National Weather Service and Coast Guard officials {{warned of the}} potential for rip currents along the East Coast resulting from Arthur. The National Park Service-operated Wright Brothers National Memorial and Cape Lookout National Seashore were closed in anticipation of the storm. Several airlines waived change fees for travelers in areas affected by Arthur. Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent more than 54aircraft to Dayton, Ohio to prevent the occurrence of potential wind damage. In Nantucket, Massachusetts, a school was converted to a temporary shelter in anticipation of Arthur's arrival.|$|E

5|$|The Song (960–1276) were a Chinese dynasty. To their north {{were the}} Jurchens, a {{confederation}} of semi-agrarian tribes from Manchuria in northeast Asia. While the Song and Jurchen {{had once been}} military allies, the Jurchen tribes, unified {{under the rule of}} Wanyan Aguda, plotted a revolt in 1114 to end their vassalage under the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. Aguda established the Jin dynasty in 1115 and adopted the title of emperor. The Jin negotiated a joint attack with the Song against the Khitans. They planned the attack for 1121 and then <b>rescheduled</b> <b>to</b> 1122. In 1122, the Jurchens captured the Liao Supreme and Western Capitals. The Song tried yet failed to capture the Liao Southern Capital of Yan (modern Beijing), which fell later that year to the Jin. The military weakness of the Song gave the Jin more diplomatic leverage over them. Negotiations between the Song and Jin produced a treaty in 1123, but bilateral relations deteriorated because of territorial disputes over the Sixteen Prefectures. In 1125, the Jurchens invaded the Song.|$|E
