5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> she is not in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling {{her that if she}} wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{the signing of the}} 1890 act, Barber wrote to the {{superintendent}} of the Philadelphia Mint, Oliver Bosbyshell, setting forth proposed terms of a competition to select new coin designs. Barber suggested that entrants be required to submit models, as opposed to drawings, and that the designs be in low relief, which was used for coins. He proposed that the entries include the lettering and denomination, as submissions without them would not adequately show the appearance of the finished coin. He received a <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> due to other work, the Mint {{would not be able to}} address the question until the spring of 1891.|$|E
5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up {{work on the}} stone, but he was to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote {{to him about the}} stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and try to identify phonetic characters in them.|$|E

25|$|Defenders of Thomson's {{argument}} <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> {{the alleged}} disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because {{the factors that}} critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but {{do not apply to}} abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders also point to her 'people-seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion.|$|E
25|$|Global brain theorists <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> the {{emergence}} of distributed intelligence {{would lead to the}} exact opposite of this vision. The reason is that effective collective intelligence requires diversity of opinion, decentralization and individual independence, as demonstrated by James Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

25|$|Paul Nawrocki (1962) gives three {{arguments}} why {{the string}} should not break, while Edmond Dewan (1963) showed in a <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> his original analysis still remains valid. Many {{years later and}} after Bell's book, Matsuda and Kinoshita reported receiving much criticism after publishing an article on their independently rediscovered version of the paradox in a Japanese journal. Matsuda and Kinoshita do not cite specific papers, however, stating only that these objections were written in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Peel's {{enthusiasm for}} music outside the {{mainstream}} occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters {{and asked him to}} confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> in recent weeks they had been playing little else.|$|E

In the end of the stanza, poet questions the peddlers about what they are selling and they reply dice made from ivory and chessmen.|$|E

25|$|Some {{have criticized}} REBT for being harsh, formulaic {{and failing to}} address deep {{underlying}} problems. REBT theorists have argued in <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working {{on the basis of}} the client’s point of reference. They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions. Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined. REBT theorists have argued in <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds. In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.|$|E
25|$|NTP {{has been}} used in {{distributed}} denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A small query is sent to an NTP server with the return address spoofed to be the target address. Similar to the DNS amplification attack, the server responds with a much larger <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target. To avoid participating in an attack, servers can be configured to ignore external queries, or they can be upgraded to version 4.2.7p26 or later.|$|E

Often legitimate complaints about world financial status quo (economic inequality, over indebtedness and speculation, providing for riskless markets that don't need funds at the expense of slightly more risky market that could use finance) are used to draw illegitimate conclusions that the solution is a ban on all interest.|$|E

25|$|After {{beginning}} 1996 {{with two}} more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated puncher Mark Delaney (21–0). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics {{said that he had}} still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> he could only beat whoever was out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and Pat Lawlor.|$|E
25|$|Rehhagel has popularized {{the phrase}} kontrollierte Offensive (controlled offence). He prefers a grass-roots {{approach}} to football, stressing {{the importance of}} at least two (often also three) big, strong headers in central defence. His defensive schemes often use a dominant libero, such as Rune Bratseth, Miroslav Kadlec, or Traianos Dellas. In defence Rehhagel usually prefers robustness and height over footballing abilities (the most notorious example being Ulrich Borowka). In the period of all-round, fluid defence, many have criticized this as dated and anachronistic, but Rehhagel loves to <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> his success makes him right.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 {{one patient}} {{addressed}} Burou, requesting his services, {{and received a}} prompt <b>reply</b> <b>that</b> detailed the cost of sex-reassignment surgery at U.S. $5000 “payable in cash upon arrival, if possible in travelers checks.” The price included “12 - 15 days hospitalization at the clinic, medical care and fees included, {{as well as the}} doctor’s payment.” This price is considered modest for the time based upon reports that indicated the average cost of sex-reassignment surgery was on the rise. Burou {{is said to have been}} willing to make “enormous” financial concessions to his fees whenever a case “merited the operation”.|$|E
