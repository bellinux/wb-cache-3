25|$|This system {{depended}} {{primarily on}} the visibility of the central disc, whether it was open centred or whether only ray florets were apparent centrally (double bloom). The double bloom cultivars were then subdivided according {{to the way in}} which they were folded along their longitudinal axis, flat, involute (curled inwards) or revolute (curling backwards). If the end of the <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> was split, they were considered fimbriated. Based on these characteristics, nine groups were defined plua a tenth miscellaneous group for any cultivars not fitting the above characteristics. Fimbriated dahlias were added in 2004, and two further groups (Single and Double orchid) in 2007. The last group to be added, Peony, first appeared in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a panicle {{of flower}} heads containing yellowish disc florets and occasionally a small <b>ray</b> <b>floret.</b> The fruit {{is a tiny}} achene about a millimeter long.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} an achene. The {{fruit of the}} <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> is oval and hairless and lacks a pappus; that of the disc floret is more slender, shiny, lined with hairs, and tipped with a pappus of scales.|$|E
50|$|Ray Florets: Typically 12-21 <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> per capitulum. Individual <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> measure between 15-25mm in length.|$|R
5000|$|Individuals of Layia discoidea {{occasionally}} display <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{that are}} light yellow in color (see Calphotos and [...] ). Individuals bearing <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{have been observed}} in populations at the New Idria, Laguna Mountain, and Panther Peak serpentine masses. It is unclear if the <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> {{are a result of}} hybridization with nearby Layia glandulosa, a genetic mutation, or simply induced by environmental conditions.|$|R
50|$|In the anemone form, {{the disk}} florets are prominent, often raised and overshadowing the <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> The spoon-form disk florets are visible and the long, tubular <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> are spatulate.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is an umbel-shaped {{array of}} up to 20 or more flower heads, each lined with green- or red-tipped phyllaries. The head contains many disc florets and occasionally a tiny yellow <b>ray</b> <b>floret,</b> though these are usually absent.|$|E
50|$|Leaves {{are without}} petiole and {{directly}} {{attached to the}} stem, smooth margins and with thick hair underneath. Having more than one form of flower starting with a four-winged <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> which matures into a one-seeded, one-celled, fruits which remain closed at maturity; an achene with the calyx tube remaining attached.|$|E
5000|$|A ligule (from ligula [...] "strap", {{variant of}} lingula, from lingua [...] "tongue") — {{is a thin}} {{outgrowth}} at the junction of leaf and leafstalk of many grasses (Poaceae) and sedges. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the corolla, {{such as that of}} a <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> in plants in the daisy family Asteraceae.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ray</b> <b>florets</b> are {{essentially}} the colorful, flowery {{portion of the}} plant. In most Simsia, the amount of <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> can be anywhere between non-existent {{and as many as}} 45. They vary in colors, being any mixture of orange-yellow, lemon-yellow, pink, purple, or white. Simsia calva tend to have 8-21 <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> with their colors being orange-yellow, with traces, lining, or fully colored faces of brown or purple.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{flower head}} has {{a center of}} six {{yellowish}} disc florets with black stamens surrounded by five yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> The <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> generally have three teeth, the central tooth being the smallest. Plants flower in May through October.|$|R

5000|$|These {{plants are}} mainly shrubs and small trees, the largest {{exceeding}} four meters in height. The stems are spiny. The flower heads contain pink, red, or purple florets, including 8 to 13 hairy ray florets and usually either one or three disc florets. The <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> yields a fruit with a plumelike pappus, and the fruit from a disc floret {{has a more}} [...] "bristle-like contorted pappus".|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{a solitary}} sunflowerlike flower head lined with three to eight phyllaries. There is one golden <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> per phyllary, up to a centimeter {{in length and}} sometimes faintly toothed at the tip. At {{the center of the}} head are yellow disc florets. The blooming period is 3 to 4 weeks long, occurring in March and April. The fruit is an achene about 2 millimeters long.|$|E
50|$|Solidago ouachitensis is a {{perennial}} herb growing {{up to about}} 1.1 meters (44 inches) in height. It produces one or more erect stems from a woody caudex. The serrated (toothed) leaves are 10 to 13 centimeters (4.0-5.2 inches) long around {{the middle of the}} plant and smaller higher on the stem. One plant will produce 25-50 bell-shaped flower heads. Each flower head usually contains one yellow <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> and 4-5 disc florets. Flowering occurs in September and October.|$|E
50|$|In the reflex form, {{the disk}} florets are {{concealed}} and the <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> reflex outwards {{to create a}} mop-like appearance. The decorative form is similar to reflex blooms, but the <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> usually do not radiate at more than a 90° angle to the stem.|$|R
5000|$|Balsamorhiza rosea [...] is an herb up to 30 cm (12 inches) tall. It has flower heads, usually borne {{one at a}} time, {{with both}} <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> and disc <b>florets.</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>florets</b> are yellow at {{flowering}} time but turn red as they age. The species grows on dry hillsides.|$|R
40|$|Dahlias (Dahlia variabilis) {{exhibit a}} wide range of flower colours because of {{accumulation}} of anthocyanin and other flavonoids in their <b>ray</b> <b>florets.</b> Two lateral mutants were used that spontaneously occurred in ‘Michael J’ (MJW) which has yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> with orange variegation. MJOr, a bud mutant producing completely orange <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> accumulates anthocyanins, flavones, and butein, and MJY, another mutant producing completely yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets,</b> accumulates flavones and butein. Reverse transcription–PCR analysis showed that expression of chalcone synthase 1 (DvCHS 1), flavanone 3 -hydroxylase (DvF 3 H), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DvDFR), anthocyanidin synthase (DvANS), and DvIVS encoding a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor were suppressed, whereas that of chalcone isomerase (DvCHI) and DvCHS 2, another CHS with 69 % nucleotide identity with DvCHS 1, was not suppressed in the yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> of MJY. A 5. 4 [*]kb CACTA superfamily transposable element, transposable element of Dahlia variabilis 1 (Tdv 1), was found in the fourth intron of the DvIVS gene of MJW and MJY, and footprints of Tdv 1 were detected in the variegated flowers of MJW. It is shown that only one type of DvIVS gene was expressed in MJOr, whereas these plants are likely to have three types of the DvIVS gene. On the basis of these results, the mechanism regulating the formation of orange and yellow <b>ray</b> <b>florets</b> in dahlia is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{many plants}} of the aster family {{such as the}} sunflower, Helianthus annuus, the {{circumference}} of the flower head is composed of ray florets. Each <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal. Florets in {{the centre of the}} disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as Narcissus {{the lower part of the}} petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup (hypanthium) above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.|$|E
50|$|They show large {{yellow or}} orange flowers, 6-8 cm wide with 10-15 cm long ray florets and {{numerous}} disc florets. The phyllaries (a bract under the flowerhead) has long spreading hairs. Each phyllary {{is associated with}} a <b>ray</b> <b>floret.</b> Species of Arnica, with an involucre (a circle of bracts arranged surrounding the flower head) arranged in two rows, have only their outer phyllaries associated with ray florets. The flowers have a slight aromatic smell. If taken in the wrong dose it can be very dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Calycadenia villosa is {{an annual}} herb {{producing}} a very hairy erect stem approaching 40 centimeters (16 inches) in height. The leaves are linear (long and narrow) {{and up to}} 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. The inflorescence {{is made up of}} clusters of flower heads surrounded by gland-tipped bracts. Each flower head is a hairless bunch of small disc florets and 1 to 4 white to pink ray florets. Each <b>ray</b> <b>floret</b> has three lobes, the middle lobe being narrowest. The fruit is an achene; those developing from disc florets bear a pappus of scales.|$|E
