In April 1997, a colleague and I stopped {{in town to}} get directions to the Canyon of Veroncle. Photograph 1. The village of Murs is strategically sited on a large hill. BACKGROUND Access to the canyon is below town, just off the road to Gordes (see Illustration 1). The path down into the canyon gives the hiker a rare glimpse into a medieval industrial complex, with its <b>rock</b> dam, abandoned <b>flour</b> mills, and confusing array of canals.

50|$|The {{quality of}} food for common people was not always {{particularly}} high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from whole meal flour — probably both wheat and rye - but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. Corncockle (Agrostemma), {{would have made the}} bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages. The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age inevitably left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt <b>rock)</b> in the <b>flour</b> and when eaten later on, these small stones wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains of that period.|$|R

This was done to investigate the nutritional value and the general acceptability of the cassava flour and cocoyam <b>flour</b> supplemented <b>rock</b> cake. The proximate analysis indicate that the moisture content, ash and the carbohydrate increase with increasing cassava and cocoyam flour concentration. Generally the ash content of composite rock cakes increases {{as the level of}} supplementation increases implying that the inorganic nutrients in the composite rock cake is richer than that of wheat rock cake. It is observed from the organoleptic analysis that generally, whole wheat rock cake and cassava and cocoyam supplemented rock cake with cassava and cocoyam flour up to 30 % is preferred to rock cake with cassava and cocoyam flour beyond 30 %. Thus cassava and cocoyam flour can be used to substitute for wheat flour up to about 30 %...|$|R

50|$|Rock dust, {{also known}} as rock powders, rock minerals, <b>rock</b> <b>flour,</b> soil remineralization, and mineral fines, {{consists}} of finely crushed rock, processed by natural or mechanical means, containing minerals and trace elements widely used in organic farming practices.|$|E
50|$|Delta Lake {{is located}} in Grand Teton National Park, in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Delta Lake is {{situated}} in Glacier Gulch and is fed <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> (glacial silt) from the Teton Glacier, which turns the water turquoise in appearance.|$|E
50|$|The Verdon Gorge {{is renowned}} {{as one of}} the most {{beautiful}} canyons in Europe, and attracts numerous tourists, especially during the summer period. The river's striking turquoise colour is associated with glacial sources and the minerals of <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> suspended in the water.|$|E
50|$|From Besseggen {{there is}} a nice view over Gjende and Bessvatnet. Gjende is about 400 m lower than Bessvatnet. While Bessvatnet has a blue colour common to lakes, Gjende has a green colour due to glacier runoff {{depositing}} clay into the lake (<b>rock</b> <b>flour).</b>|$|E
50|$|The emerald colour of {{the water}} comes from <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> carried into the lake by melt-water from the glaciers that {{overlook}} the lake. The lake has a surface of 0.8 km2 and is drained through the 3 km long Louise Creek into the Bow River.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the unique}} aspects of Gjende is that the water has a {{distinct}} green color. The green color is the result from glacier runoff containing clay (<b>rock</b> <b>flour).</b> Looking down towards Memurubu {{one can see the}} river Muru coloring the water with a light colored runoff.|$|E
50|$|The lake, being glacially fed, {{does not}} reach its crest until {{mid to late}} June. When it is full, it {{reflects}} a distinctive shade of blue. The color {{is due to the}} refraction of light off the <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> deposited in the lake on a continual basis.|$|E
5000|$|The Hooker River drains {{both the}} Hooker and Mueller Glaciers {{and is the}} {{principal}} ablation outlet for these ice masses.

5000|$|Typically, natural <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> {{is formed}} during glacial migration, where the glacier grinds against {{the sides and}} bottom of the rock beneath it, but also is {{produced}} by freeze-and-thaw action, where the act of water freezing and expanding in cracks helps break up rock formations. Multiple cycles create a greater amount.|$|E
50|$|Mistaya River {{originates}} in Peyto Lake, a glacial lake of typical blue colour (due to <b>rock</b> <b>flour).</b> Mistaya flows north-west, receiving {{the waters of}} creeks such as Delta, Silverhorn, Cirque, Noyes, ChephrenTotem, Epaulette, Bison, Kaufmann and Sarback. A series of elongated lakes are formed along the river: Mistaya Lake and Waterfowl Lakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{scouring}} {{action of}} the glaciers pulverizes minerals in the rock over which the glacier passes. These pulverized minerals become sediment {{at the bottom of}} the lake, and some of the <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> becomes suspended in the water column. These suspended minerals support a large population of algae, making the water appear green.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>flour,</b> or glacial flour, {{consists}} of fine-grained, silt-sized particles of rock, generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding {{to a similar}} size. Because the material is very small, it becomes suspended in meltwater making the water appear cloudy, which is sometimes known as glacial milk.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Nooney {{is located}} in Glacier National Park, in the U. S. state of Montana. The lake is east of Mount Custer and [...]50 mi west of Lake Wurdeman. The Herbst Glacier is located above the lake to the northwest. <b>Rock</b> <b>flour</b> (silt) from melting glaciers make the lake appear opaque {{turquoise}} in color.|$|E
50|$|Grinnell Lake {{is located}} in Glacier National Park, in the U. S. state of Montana. Named after George Bird Grinnell, the lake has an opaque {{turquoise}} appearance from the <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> (silt) which is transported to the lake from Grinnell Glacier. Grinnell Lake is accessible via the Grinnell Glacier Trail and is 3.2 mi from the Many Glacier Hotel.|$|E
50|$|The {{waters of}} the Clutha Mata-Au are clear {{turquoise}} in the upper reaches, a characteristic that results from glacial and snow-melt filtering by upland lakes, especially Lake Wanaka. In global terms this is rare, because glacially fed rivers are normally discoloured by <b>rock</b> <b>flour.</b> The Clutha Mata-Au is also often listed among the world's swiftest rivers.|$|E
50|$|Very fine glacial sediments or <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> {{is often}} {{picked up by}} wind blowing over the bare surface and may be {{deposited}} great distances from the original fluvial deposition site.

50|$|During the summer, {{significant}} amounts of glacial <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> flow into the lake, and these suspended rock particles give the lake a bright, turquoise colour. Because of its bright colour, photos of the lake often appear in illustrated books, and {{the area around the}} lake is a popular sightseeing spot for tourists. The lake is best seen from Bow Summit, the highest point on the Icefields Parkway.|$|E
50|$|Some agronomists {{believe that}} <b>rock</b> <b>flour</b> has a {{powerful}} effect in restoring trace minerals to soil. An early experimenter was the German miller, Julius Hensel, author of Bread from Stones, who reported successful results with steinmehl (stonemeal) in the 1890s. His ideas were not taken up due to technical limitations and, according to proponents of his method, because of opposition from the champions of conventional fertilisers.|$|E
