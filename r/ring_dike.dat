25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner <b>ring</b> <b>dike</b> is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer <b>ring</b> <b>dike</b> is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|E

Recently, several studies on the effectiveness of subdividing <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> areas by means of compartmentalization dikes were published. These studies show that the total damage after a flood could indeed be smaller, but that the damage could also turn out to be larger on a local level. The available studies on compartmentalization usually consider only one dike pattern in the area concerned. This article develops, assesses and compares three fundamentally different strategies, based on different configurations of the compartmentalization dikes. Not only do we examine the effects of the most probable flood scenarios, we also look at the worst-case scenario, whereby the water is able to flood into the <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> area from all sides. The spatial layout of the area codetermines the effectiveness of each strategy. <b>Dike</b> <b>ring</b> area 14, which lies in the west of the Netherlands and that covers some cities, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, was chosen as the area of application. The results show that for this <b>dike</b> <b>ring,</b> the secondary <b>dike</b> strategy is most effective in reducing the number of expected victims under different flood scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on the {{material}} in two earlier papers, Brekelmans et al. [2012] and Eijgenraam et al. [2014 a] that were published in the journals Operations Research and Interfaces, respectively. It describes the optimization model that has been developed to optimize dike heights in the Netherlands. Moreover, it briefly describes the high impact of the results of this project on political decision making in the Netherlands. The project was awarded the INFORMS Franz Edelman 2013 Award. For more details on the validation of the model, the method used, and the political process and impact, we refer to these papers. In the Netherlands, <b>dike</b> <b>rings,</b> consisting of dunes, dikes, and structures, protect {{a large part of the}} country against flooding. After the catastrophic flood in 1953, a cost-benefit model was developed by D. van Danzig [1956] to determine optimal dike heights. The objective of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is to find an optimal balance between investment costs and the benefit of reducing flood damages, both as a result of heightening dikes. The question then becomes when and how much to invest in the <b>dike</b> <b>ring.</b> In Eijgenraam et al. [2014 b] we improve and extend D. van Danzig’s model. In that paper we show how to properly include economic growth in the cost-benefit model, and how to address the question when to invest in dikes. All these models consider <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> that consist of a homogeneous dike. This means that all parts in the <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> have the same characteristics with respect to investment costs, flood probabilities, water level rise, etc. Many <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> in the Netherlands, however, are nonhomogeneous, consisting of different segments that each have different characteristics. Differences occur, for instance, if along a <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> in the delta area a river dominated regime changes into a sea dominated regime, or if a <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> contains a large sluice complex. Currently, there are <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> with up to ten segments in the Netherlands. In this nonhomogeneous case, it is not necessary and not desirable to enforce that all these segments are heightened simultaneously and by exactly the same amount. Hence, the decision problem for the nonhomogeneous case concerns when and how much to invest in each individual dike segment. In the current article, we consider the extension of the homogeneous case in Eijgenraam et al. [2014 b] to the nonhomogeneous case. The research has been carried out as part of a project initiated by the government. The project’s main goal is to support decision making with respect to setting new flood protection standards for the <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> in the Netherlands. Figure 1 shows the main <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> and the current legal protection standard for each <b>dike</b> <b>ring.</b> Efficient flood protection standards can be derived from the optimal investment strategy and the resulting flood probabilities. How this can be done is explained in Eijgenraam et al. [2014 a]. Here we confine ourselves to a description of the first stage: finding the optimal investment strategy. In order to lay a firm base for the new standards, the 53 larger <b>dike</b> <b>rings</b> in the Netherlands need to be analyzed thoroughly. This requires that particular scenarios can be analyzed within a reasonable amount of time, where each scenario represents a certain instance of the model parameters such as economic growth, interest rate, water level rise, flood characteristics, investment costs and so on. It is shown in Eijgenraam et al. [2014 b] that the homogeneous case can be solved analytically. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in solving the nonhomogeneous case analytically. In this article we show how the nonhomogeneous dike height optimization problem can be modeled as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. In addition to the MINLP formulation of the decision problem, we constructed an iterative optimization algorithm that speeds up the solution time considerably. The algorithm has been implemented in AIMMS, which has subsequently been integrated in user-friendly software to perform the <b>dike</b> <b>ring</b> analysis [Duits 2009 a,b]. The final results have had a big impact in the political decision making process...|$|R
