One plan being considered adds digit 1 or 0 {{either to the}} beginning or {{to the end of}} the area code or the beginning of the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require 11-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. In another proposal, existing codes would be changed to x9xx, e.g. San Francisco's 415 would become 4915. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long distance carriers or unused <b>reserved</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
40|$|How {{effective}} is {{a hybrid}} pricing strategy for a cloud computing services vendor that mixes fixed-price <b>reserved</b> <b>services</b> with spot-price on-demand services? This research offers a decision support model {{to create the}} appropriate strategy for IT services based on prior research on information goods, electricity pricing, product versioning, and revenue yield management. The goal is to establish whether interruptible spot-price on-demand cloud computing services — which we view as damaged services — are valuable to the vendor. The results from the analysis of an economic model show that a hybrid strategy outperforms a one-service-only strategy in most cases, especially when clients are sensitive to services interruptions or when task values are highly differentiated. A more intriguing finding is that a vendor should permit the possibility of services interruptions even when clients are highly sensitive to their occurrence. The presence of interruptions serves as a quality differentiator between the on-demand services and <b>reserved</b> <b>services,</b> assuring {{the efficacy of the}} hybrid strategy. Moreover, a vendor may use capacity limit, in the hybrid strategy, as a tool to further improve its profit. To our knowledge, this research is the first to propose the damaged services perspective as an analogy for damaged goods in the cloud software market...|$|E
40|$|Ancillary {{services}} are some operational <b>reserved</b> <b>services</b> procured by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) for keeping {{a balance between}} supply and demand, stabilizing the transmission system and maintaining the power quality on an economical basis in any competitive electricity market environment. This paper discusses different types of ancillary services and their characteristics and challenges in the power market {{in order to find}} an efficient combination of ancillary services with the least reservation cost that secures reliable transmission system operation. An overview of practical experiences regarding performance of ancillary services in several competitive markets in the Europe, Australia and New Zealand will be discussed. Further, wind power as a disputable ancillary service will be presented in brief. In addition, some efficient proposals for revising the design and implementation of those markets will be mentioned in conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The cloud {{computing}} services market exhibits unique {{characteristics such as}} instant accessibility, fluctuating demand and supply, and interruptible service provision. Various pricing mechanisms exist in current industry practice. None of these pricing mechanisms, however, is comprehensive enough to capture all these features {{in a way that}} allows the vendors to optimize resource allocation. This dissertation identifies key factors related to {{cloud computing}} pricing, and examines their interplays. This research uses multiple approaches, including a market survey, game theory modeling, simulation, lab experiments and econometric modeling, to analyze the pricing strategy of cloud services vendors. A field study of a representative set of cloud vendors’ pricing approaches provides background information to motivate this dissertation. Important factors in current cloud pricing practice are highlighted. This part of the work offers an overview of how cloud computing services are priced and how the pricing approaches have evolved over time. This is important for identifying the causes of confusion among clients regarding the pricing of cloud computing services, especially when new pricing methods emerge. The following study reports on an analytical model and simulations to derive optimal pricing strategies for a monopoly cloud services vendor that operates in the re-served and spot-price services market. Although interruptible spot services potentially cause undesired consequences for clients, the cloud services vendor can improve its profit by offering low quality interruptible spot-price services, together with high quality fixed-price <b>reserved</b> <b>services.</b> The last study examines clients’ willingness-to-pay for brokered cloud services offered with a hybrid pricing mechanism in the presence of fixed-price reserved and spot-price on-demand services through behavioral experiments. This study yields two findings. First, subjects’ willingness-to-pay is affected by their informedness of the service interruption risk associated with spot-price on-demand services. Second, this effect is moderated by their aversion to risk...|$|E

40|$|The British Army Reserve (AR), and in {{particular}} its logistics component, is undergoing profound changes. The Future Reserves 2020 policy aims to expand the AR {{and make it more}} deployable on operations. However, to date, FR 20 has struggled to attract the recruits required to man this more deployable reserve force, despite recruitment campaigns offering increased monetary benefits. This study sampled AR logistics soldiers’ reasons for joining, remaining in service, and mobilizing when deployed. Consistent with the previous research, the study found that soldiers who joined for institutional reasons were more associated with longer career intentions and mobilizing for intrinsic reasons. Soldiers who joined for occupational reasons were less satisfied with all elements of <b>reserve</b> <b>service</b> and deployed in order to fulfil their contracts.
