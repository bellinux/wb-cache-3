40|$|There {{is little}} use of {{cultivated}} kelp including Saccharina latissima (syn. Laminaria saccharina) in the European food industry, {{in contrast to}} the extensive use of Pyropia (syn. Porphyra) as Nori, e. g. in sushi restaurants. A major reason for this discrepancy is possibly the extremely high iodine content in laminarian species, i. e. 3 – 10 g I kg- 1 dry weight, {{in contrast to the}} situation in Pyropia with its approximately 10 times lower iodine content. Another serious problem for commercial use of S. latissima from <b>rope</b> <b>culture</b> for food is the presence of epiphytic animals on the blades from May onwards as an unwanted food addition. This investigation presents data on iodine content in commercial samples of S. latissima, with indications of lower iodine values from rope cultivation in the Kattegat (Baltic) at reduced salinities, and in general from tank cultivation, possibly mainly due to rapid iodine depletion of seawater in the tanks. Boiling dried blades for several minutes in fresh water resulted in a reduction of the iodine content to approximately one third of the initial value after 2 min. Results from <b>rope</b> <b>cultures</b> in a Norwegian fjord showed the presence of epiphytic animals from early May onwards in the sea, which ruined the food quality of the blades, but the complete absence of such animals throughout the year in parallel tank-grown S. latissima, probably mainly due to mechanical prevention of larval settlement in tank tumble culture...|$|R
40|$|Blue mussel Mytilus edulis {{cultures}} {{contribute to}} nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems. Mussel populations filter particulate nutrients {{from the water}} column and inorganic nutrients are regenerated by excretion of metabolic wastes and decomposition of (pseudo-) faeces. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the intra-annual variability in nutrient regeneration by mussel <b>rope</b> <b>cultures</b> in oligotrophic fjord systems. In situ respiration and nutrient uptake and release rates of 1 m mussel ropes were measured using 250 l pelagic chambers. There was a 20 -fold difference between winter and summer respiration and nutrient release rates. Inorganic nitrogen release ranged from 50 to 1000 µmol h– 1 per meter rope. These variations were mainly related to mussel growth but were also related to changes in water temperature and biofouling biomass (organisms that colonized the mussel ropes). In total 24 genera of fouling organisms were observed, diversity increased over time (ranging from 2 to 12 genera m– 1), and fouling biomass was mainly characterised by ascidians (max. 37 ± 14 g m– 1). However, mussels dominated the <b>culture</b> <b>ropes,</b> representing > 90 % of total faunal biomass. The amount of organic material associated with the ropes was stable (6. 9 ± 0. 3 g m– 1). At the scale of one mussel farm, nutrient regeneration by mussel <b>rope</b> <b>cultures</b> increased inorganic nitrogen concentrations by 20 % and inorganic phosphorus concentrations by 5 % during summer conditions. During winter, there was no significant effect of mussel cultures on the inorganic nutrient pools. Nutrient regeneration by mussel cultures also affected stoichiometry as nutrients were excreted in dissimilar proportions (nitrogen > phosphate > silicate). The increased nutrient availability may contribute to primary production, especially in nutrient-limited (oligotrophic) fjord ecosystems. However, fjord-scale effects are largely dependent on hydrographic conditions of the fjord syste...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and implement potential new marine species with sediment and water biofiltration capacities of the nutrients from a landbased aquaculture production unit. The organisms associated with the effluents from two inland aquaculture facilities were studied; four species of algae were collected and tested for biofiltration and production under tank conditions Colpomenia sinuosa, Valonia utricularis, Ulva rigida and Schizymenia dubyi. H. sanctori was collected and placed in tanks with sediments from the aquaculture facility; total nitrogen and organic matter in the sediments were evaluated during a three week period where the effluents from the sea cucumber tanks were connected to Hydropuntia cornea tanks, the biofiltration and production of H. cornea submitted to the effluents was also tested, finally, a <b>rope</b> <b>culture</b> experiment with H. cornea, Grateloupia imbricata and Grateloupia turuturu was made at the biofilter facility of the PCT (Scientific and Technological Park of Taliarte). U. rigida presented the best growth rate, production and nitrogen uptake efficiency, followed by S. dubyi which presented the best nitrogen uptake rate. H. sanctori was an efficient biofilter of nitrogen in the sediments, returning them to the control conditions; they increased the amount of ammonia available for the growth of H. cornea although no significant differences were found in the growth rate, production, physiological state or biofiltration between H. cornea cultured with these effluents or directly from the effluents of the sedimentation tank, probably due to the little amount of ammonia present in both.

40|$|The {{trend of}} fish {{production}} in Singapore is towards increasing contribution from marine and brackishwater aquaculture. Aquaculture production in 1986 represented 6. 8 % of local fish production. It is envisaged that this sector will provide about 37. 5 % of production by 1995. Freshwater aquaculture will focus mainly on production of ornamental fish. Production from farming of freshwater food fish {{is not likely}} to increase significantly. Commonly farmed marine finfishes are groupers (Epinephelus tauvina), sea bass (Lates calcarifer), and golden snapper (Lutjanus johni). Crustaceans include prawns (Penaeus merguiensis), crabs (Scylla serrata) and mussels (Perna viridis). Of the freshwater finfishes, the most commonly cultured are the grass, silver and bighead carps, red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus hybrid), Lampam jawa (Puntius gonionotus), marble goby (Oxyleotrix marmorata) and the snakehead (Channa sp.). Aquaculture systems use a combination of floating and shorebased techniques. Earthen ponds are utilized for the culture of freshwater carps, floating netcages for marine finfish, ponds and floating netcages for marine crustaceans, and <b>rope</b> <b>culture</b> for mussels.

For the indoor production of seedlings attached to string the European technique developed by the French Fisheries Institute (IFREMER) was used. This technique has been adapted by the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (IEO) for this species. The string with the L. saccharina seedlings was outplanted in cultivation ropes which were deployed horizontally ('longline') in the sea, in February 2002.

The break-even price for the tiger shrimp 	 through semi-intensive culture system is worked out at Rs. 161 /kg and Rs. 126 /kg by improved 	 extensive method, while it fetches market sales price of Rs. 350 to 400 /kg.

40|$|For the {{management}} of the shellfish sector, shellfish are regularly imported from various European countries into the Dutch coastal waters. With the import of shellfish, there is a risk of unintentional introduction of exotic species, pests and diseases that could have harmful effects. Therefore, the transports or shellfish are watched critically by the various stakeholders. The present study focuses on the risks of the unintentional introduction of new exotic species with the shellfish transports. We define exotic species as species that are non-indiginous for the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf area and are introduced into this area by human activities. The biogeographical area Northeast Atlantic continental shelf region ranges from the Northern part of Spain to the coastal areas of Norway. Once established somewhere in the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf, shellfish transports can accelerate the introduction into the Dutch coastal waters. Far from every introduction of exotic species becomes a pest. However, once introduced it is very difficult if not impossible to remove the species from the ecosystem. In this study, the risks of unintentional introduction of exotic species with various shellfish transports are evaluated. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality will use this information to develop a new national policy for the transfer of shellfish. Recently, the debate on the present policy that dates from 1997 has intensified due to judgments of the Council of State and the European Court of Justice. Moreover, the shellfish farmers are more and more interested to transfer mussels and seed mussels that have been captured with mussel seed capture devices from the Oosterschelde and the Voordelta to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. This transport is prohibited under the present policy. The invasiveness of a species {{is an important factor in}} a risk assessment for the introduction of exotic species. The list “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good overview of the species with the highest risks. As a first indication this list is very useful, however, it should not be assumed that the list is complete. Besides as assessment on species, the risks can also be assessed on the location from where the shellfish are imported. Most of the exotic species that are present in the Dutch coastal waters have their area of origin in NW Pacific (39 species) or the NW Atlantic Ocean (26 species). The majority of he exotic species are introduced the Dutch coastal areas by secondary transport. Shellfish imports from Ireland, UK and France show the highest risks on introducing exotic species due to the number of exotic species in these countries and the environmental conditions that are comparable to the conditions in the Dutch coastal waters. According to the national policy on shellfish transfer, it is obliged to transfer shellfish from the Oosterschelde and Voordelta to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea (South – North transport). The risks of this transport on introduction of exotic species have been evaluated by means of expert judgment and literature review. A group of 11 national and international experts have been consulted for this study. A list of exotic species of the South (Oosterschelde, Voordelta, Grevelingenmeer and Veerse Meer) has been compiled and compared with the list of exotic species present in the North (Dutch part of the Wadden Sea). The target species, species that are present in the South but not in the North could potentially be introduced in the Dutch Wadden Sea with the shellfish transfer from the South. The risks of each of the 65 target species have been evaluated semi-quantitatively from the chance of successful introduction and the expected impact. The species with the highest risks are the tunicates Didemnum sp. and Botrylloides violaceus, the copepods Mytilicola orientalis and M. ostreae, the American whelk tingle Urosalpinx cinerea, the bryozoa Smittoidea prolifica, the protist Marteilia refringens and the marcoalgae Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Polysiphonia senticulosa and Undaria pinnatifida. At present it is allowed and common practice to transfer mussels from the Danish and German parts of the Wadden Sea to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The risks assessment indicates that with these shellfish transfers 46 exotic species could potentially be introduced into the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The species with the highest risks are mainly macroalgae: Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Heterosiphonia japonica and Laminaria ochotensis. The risks of shellfish transfers within the Wadden Sea are lower than the risks of shellfish transfer from South to North. During the Summer of 2008, 30 samples have been taken from mussels in the water column (<b>rope</b> <b>culture</b> and Mussel seed capture devices) and from the bottom (culture plots and natural beds), both in the Oosterschelde and the Voordelta. The samples have been analyzed for associated flora and fauna. Special attention was paid to the exotic species. In total 12 exotic species were identified in the samples. In the samples from the Voordelta only one exotic species was found (Sargassum muticum). The exotic species accounted for more than 10 percent of the total number of species identified in samples from the Oosterschelde. There was a clear distinction in species composition between the samples from the water column and from the bottom. Characteristic species for the bottom samples were the American slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata), the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the brush-clawed shore crab (Hemigrapsus takanoi) and the polychate Syllis gracilis. Characteristic species for the suspended culture are the macroalgae Sargassum muticum, Codium fragile and Undaria pinnatifida and the tunicate Styela clava. The present study is primarily focused on exotic species that might be introduced with shellfish transports. However, also other harmful not-exotic organisms such as toxic algae, pests and diseases could be unintentionally (re-) introduced with the shellfish. Based on the results of this study the research questions as formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality can be answered as follows: 1. Shellfish import from France, Ireland and the UK constitutes the highest risk at introduction of exotic species with shellfish transfer into the Dutch coastal waters. The risks of import from Ireland and UK to the Oosterschelde have been quantified in a previous study, the PRIMUS study. 2. The list with “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good indication of the invasiveness, and thus potential impact of species. However, the list is not exhaustive. 3. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer from South to North are not absent. The report gives an overview of risk species and a quantification of the risks. The number of exotic species associated with <b>rope</b> <b>culture</b> and mussel seed capture devices in the Oosterschelde corresponds to the number of exotic species associated with the bottom culture. However, the composition of the exotics differ. 4. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer within the Wadden Sea (Danish and German Wadden Sea to the Dutch Wadden Sea) is less than the risks of shellfish tranports from the Oosterschelde and Voordelta to the Wadden Sea.

40|$|Growth, mortality, production, spat collection, {{seasonal}} {{cycles of}} condition index, biochemical composition, carrying capacity of commercial raft culture systems and population genetic characteristics of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) were studied at different sites in Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn {{on the west}} coast of Scotland between May 1993 and May 1995. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate current suspended mussel culture production in raft systems and to obtain basic information on the biology and the genetic structure of the two mussel populations in the lochs. There were some water quality differences between the sites in relation to seston, salinity and transparency but not to temperature, particulate organic matter and chlorophylla. When food is available (as particulate organic matter and chlorophyll-a), there was a clear seasonal cycle in mussel somatic growth and shell growth. Mussel growth was relatively high from mid-spring until late autumn, but very slow during the rest of the year. The spring-summer period of rapid shell length and somatic growth coincided with relatively optimum environmental conditions and positive relationships were indicated between growth rates, temperature and salinity, indicating the limiting effect of these two primary factors on growth from late-autumn to mid-spring when there is also a lack of available food. Mussel growth was higher at 2 m depth on the raft-rope systems, but in lantern nets experimental growth did not show differences between depths. Growth was found to be similar in the lantern nets and on <b>culture</b> <b>ropes</b> in the two lochs in the first year of experiments (from May 1993 to May 1994). Overall, mean length increments were 31. 01 mm in Loch Etive and 28. 75 mm in Loch Kishorn over a 15 month period. The mussels reached marketable size (> 50 mm) in two years from the known time of spat settlement. A cross-transplantation experiment showed that site rather than stock is the main factor explaining differences in mussel growth in Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn. The position of the mussels within a raft has a significant effect on their growth; mussels at the inflow of a raft have a better growth than those near the outflow (p< 0. 05) due to greater availability of food. Mean mussel biomass was higher in Loch Kishorn while production was higher in Loch Etive, but there were seasonal and monthly fluctuations in both biomass and production at both sites. Biochemical composition and energy content were similar in both sites, while mussel meat yield and condition indices were significantly higher in Loch Kishom than Loch Etive. Meat content, condition index and carbohydrate values were high during the summer and low from autumn to spring, reaching minimum values in March and April at the time of spawning. Spat settlement occurred in June-July in Loch Etive and June-December in Loch Kishorn. Sea squirt, starfish and eider duck are problems effecting spat collection at the Loch Kishorn site, whereas spat collection in Loch Etive is unaffected by these pests/predators. The carrying capacities for cultured mussels were found to be about 24 metric tons per raft for Loch Etive and 38 metric tons per raft for Loch Kishorn using a particulate organic matter based model; these are reasonable estimates in comparison to the known mussel production levels reported by producers. However, a seston-based model gave an overestimate of carrying capacity for both sites. Cross-transplantation of mussels, electrophoresis and shell morphological measurements showed significant differences between the Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn mussel populations.

The maximum growth rates of Macrocystis fronds were comparable to rates reported elsewhere in southern hemisphere populations (22 mm - 24. 5 mmlday), but considerably lower than those in northern hemisphere populations. The major experiment incorporated in the study tested the effects of the Macrocystis canopy and the understorey canopy of the stipitate laminarian Ecklonia radiata on macroalgae and invertebrates. The experiment was structured so that the effects of clearances at different times could be determined. One impetus for this experiment was the need to address issues relating to the commercial harvesting of giant kelp, its sustainability and its effects on other species. The effects of canopy removals on understorey algae, mostly juvenile Macrocystis, Ecklonia and Carpophyllum spp, were highly dependent on the timing of canopy removals and the combinations of canopies removed. For example, winter harvests of the Macrocystis canopy alone enhanced the survival of post-settlement Macrocystis recruits, but had little effect on Ecklonia recruitment. However, when both Macrocystis and Ecklonia canopies were removed in spring, there was heavy recruitment of Ecklonia that grew to dominate the understorey. Strong inter and intraspecific interactions from the Macrocystis surface canopy appeared to have been reduced by physical factors including water turbidity, sedimentation and the deterioration of the surface canopy during summer. These physical factors were not as limiting in Tory Channel. Fine scale extrinsic factor effects including nutrients, light and grazing on the early life history of Macrocystis were investigated in small experiments. Results suggest that recruitment may be nutrient limited even at moderately low temperatures, and that small herbivorous gastropods are an important source of mortality in the early life stages of Macrocystis. Culturing and transplantation cultivation techniques were also examined as a means of supplementing algal supplies. Macrocystis was cultured successfully through its life cycle onto <b>culture</b> <b>ropes,</b> but generally failed to produce visible sporophytes when placed in the field. Cultured plants did grow in Tory Channel, however. Juvenile plants transplanted to ropes for on-farm cultivation showed little growth during summer, but the addition of nutrients significantly enhanced growth rates of these plants during warmer months when natural nutrient levels were low. Increased growth rates at the onset of winter and with the addition of nutrients during summer confirmed that low nutrient levels during summer are growth limiting. Akaroa Harbour kelp forests exhibited considerable variation in Macrocystis canopy biomass through time. For example, the 32, 000 m 2 kelp forest at Wainui had a biomass of 144 t in October 1995, which then decreased to 21 t in October 1996. Canopies tended to deteriorate during summer. Thus, at Ohinepaka Bay kelp forest had a biomass of 31 t during winter 1997, which decreased to 0. 06 t the following summer. The greatest reduction in biomass, however, coincided with a period of hugely increased sediment, which smothered blades in the sea-surface canopy, covered the substratum, and prevented successful recruitment of kelp for over a year. Nutrient depletion was one of several factors thought to cause the summer deterioration of the Macrocystis sea-surface canopy, which has important ramifications for the commercial harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera in summer. Management considerations and options are discussed in relation the commercial harvesting of Macrocystis in New Zealand. The major conclusion {{of this study is that}} although Macrocystis was able to form dense surface canopies during winter its ability to dominate kelp forests was constrained by physical factors, especially sedimentation, high turbidity, nutrients, and storms. The lack of strong interactions between Macrocystis and Ecklonia are also largely a result of their different life history characteristics. Overall, there appear to be no significant negative flow-on effects resulting from kelp harvesting and it appears that Macrocystis can be harvested sustainably...|$|R
