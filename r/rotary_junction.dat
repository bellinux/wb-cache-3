40|$|We {{propose a}} road traffic {{cellular}} automata model suitable to an urban environment. North, east, {{south and west}} car displacements are possible and road crossings are naturally implemented as <b>rotary</b> <b>junctions.</b> We consider the traffic in a Manhattan-like city and study the flow diagram and the car density profile along road segments. We observe that {{the length of the}} car queues obeys a complex dynamics and is not uniform across the network. The street length between two junctions and the turning strategies at rotaries are relevant parameters of the model. Our results are also confirmed by fully continuous traffic simulations. PACS: 05. 50 +q, 64. 60 +Cn, 89. 40 +k 1 Introduction Cellular automata models for road traffic have received a great deal of interest {{during the past few years}} (see [1]-[5] for instance). One-dimensional models for single lane car motions are quite simple and elegant. The road is represented as a line of cells, each of them being occupied or not by a vehicle. All cars [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Nahant Beach Boulevard, also Nahant Causeway and Nahant Road is a {{historic}} road on the isthmus connecting Nahant, Massachusetts to the mainland at Lynn, Massachusetts. The road runs from the Lynn <b>Rotary,</b> its <b>junction</b> with Lynn Shore Drive and the Lynnway, about 1.5 mi to Wilson Road in Nahant. It passes through Nahant Beach Reservation, a state park offering beach access on the isthmus. The road offers expansive views of the area coastlines and Boston Harbor. Both the park and the roadway are administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} set {{just north of}} Jeffersonville, and carries Vermont 108 across the Lamoille River, {{providing}} access to Bakersfield via Route 108 and Waterville via Route 109. On {{the south side of}} the bridge it is connected to a <b>rotary</b> forming the <b>junction</b> of Route 108 and Vermont Route 15, which runs generally east-west parallel to the river.|$|R
50|$|Route 111 {{begins in}} Concord at the <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> of Route 2, Route 2A and Route 119, next to Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Concord. The route is {{concurrent}} along Union Turnpike with Route 2 {{for the first}} 2.4 mi into Acton, before Route 2 heads northwestward, beginning its western highway portion. Route 111 continues along Massachusetts Avenue, having a junction with Route 27 {{not far from the}} split. The split is Exit 43.|$|E
50|$|The route {{continues}} into Bolton, crossing Route 117 {{and passing}} the Bolton Flats {{before entering the}} town of Harvard. Route 110 continues through the village of Still River, wrapping around Bare Hill Pond before joining Route 111, starting a 3.7-mile long concurrency which crosses Route 2 at Exit 38, just east of Fort Devens. The concurrency with Route 111 ends in Ayer in Middlesex County at a <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> with Route 2A, where Route 110 begins a concurrency with Route 2A eastward into Littleton.|$|E
40|$|In this today’s world, {{every person}} {{is willing to}} have their own vehicle. Their {{willingness}} led to the gradual {{growth in the number of}} vehicles. As per the considerations for the movement of the vehicles, lots of roadways have been constructed with several reinforcement parameters. The place where two or more road network meets, there is a construction of different types of intersections, rotaries/roundabouts. <b>Rotary</b> <b>junction</b> has efficiency to manage the various traffic congestion. Evaluation of <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> capacity is very important. As the evaluation of <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> is directly related with several traffic and motorist’s parameters such as level of service, travel time, delays, accidents, operation costs, environmental factors, etc. So, there should be proper attention for the evaluation and improvements in the rotary junctions. As at the <b>rotary</b> <b>junction,</b> lots of traffic are diverted to different routes as per the travel of motorists. There should be decrease in the congestion, accidents, etc. So, there must be improvement parameters to be followed for the improvement of rotary junctions. Improvement of <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> justification have been considering by evaluation of the <b>rotary</b> <b>junction</b> of Dogra Chowk, Jammu. Traffic volume study is the major study for the evaluation of the traffic condition of the <b>rotary</b> <b>junction.</b> To analyse the traffic volume, traffic survey has been considering in the peak hours on the <b>rotary</b> <b>junction...</b>|$|E

As of 2014, more than 70,000 vehicles use the Padi flyover every day. To ease the congestion, the NHAI has constructed an elevated four-lane <b>rotary</b> at the <b>junction.</b> Work on the project began in 2005 and completed in 2009.|$|R

He was re-elected twice more, and retired for good in 1998. In 1996 the people of Kimble County honored him with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Callan was also a past president and longtime member of the <b>Junction</b> <b>Rotary</b> Club, and was honored with the club’s Paul Harris Fellowship in 2005.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{miniature}} motorized endoscopic probe for Optical Coherence Tomography with an outer diameter of 1. 65 mm and a rotation speed of 3, 000 - 12, 500 rpm. This {{is the smallest}} motorized high speed OCT probe to our knowledge. The probe has a motorized distal end which provides a significant advantage over proximally driven probes since {{it does not require}} a drive shaft to transfer the rotational torque to the distal end of the probe and functions without a fiber <b>rotary</b> <b>junction.</b> The probe has a focal Full Width at Half Maximum of 9. 6 μm and a working distance of 0. 47 mm. We analyzed the non uniform rotation distortion and found a location fluctuation of only 1. 87 ° in repeated measurements of the same object. The probe was integrated in a high-speed Optical Frequency Domain Imaging setup at 1310 nm to acquire images from ex vivo pig lung tissue through the working channel of a human bronchoscope. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|E
500|$|The {{prototype}} {{required a}} crew of five men; the hull contained the engine bay to the rear, with the driver and radio operator, who doubled as the hull machine gunner, seated at the front-left and front-right, respectively. In the turret, the tank commander sat beneath his roof hatch, while the gunner was situated {{to the left of}} the gun breech and the loader to the right. The turret was offset [...] {{to the left of the}} chassis center line, while the engine was moved [...] to the right. This allowed the torque shaft to clear the <b>rotary</b> base <b>junction,</b> which provided electrical power to turn the turret, while connecting to the transmission box mounted in the hull between the driver and radio operator. Due to the asymmetric layout, the right side of the tank contained the bulk of its stowage volume, which was taken up by ready-use ammunition lockers.|$|R
