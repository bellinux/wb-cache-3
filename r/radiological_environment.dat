40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to make a}} training material for KSU, which shows how radiation affects the different electronic components in a <b>radiological</b> <b>environment.</b> All electronic systems in the presence of high ionizing radiation can experience difficulties and be destroyed. This influence may compromise the control system and thus the safety of a nuclear reactor plant. To achieve this objective requires a description of electronic components and sensors, to better understand its function. This thesis will also show the possible solutions available that the author found interesting. Organizations such as NASA, CERN and ESA have worked to develop electronic components immune to radiation. Those organizations have also developed a test protocol that guarantees to a certain extent the security of electronic components in a <b>radiological</b> <b>environment.</b> Since we know how the material reacts with the radiation, it could develop a material that can be resistant to radiation or like CMOS technology has proposed, to reduce the component to avoid the storage of charge in the oxide. Another solution can be the GRAPHENE. Its features will revolutionize the electronics and provide answer to the radiation problems, Graphene will replace Silicium and the electronic components will only have a few nanometers dimensions so the oxide area also reduces, and in this way avoid the known problem of storage of charge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{safeguards}} inspection, various nondestructive test {{techniques are}} used. For a long time, nondestructive assay based on radiation measurement such as gamma and neutron measurement {{have been used}} for nuclear material verification. However, due to physical access and <b>radiological</b> <b>environment</b> restrictions in verifying nuclear material, other nondestructive testing techniques are used for safeguards inspection purposes. At Wolsong nuclear power plants, spent nuclear fuel bundles are stored at spent fuel storage bay. Typically, tens of thousands of spent nuclear fuel bundles are densely stored under water. For safeguards inspection, those bundles are item counted, identified by serial numbers, and verified by nondestructive assay. In doing these activities, underwater camera and gamma radiation detectors are being used. However, due to narrow space between bundles and high radiation area, some of bundles are inaccessible. Recently, to overcome those restriction, ultrasonic and microwave techniques are introduced.

40|$|During {{the winter}} of 1997 the Topographical Mapping System (TMS) for {{hazardous}} and <b>radiological</b> <b>environments</b> and the Interactive Computer-Enhanced Remote-Viewing System (ICERVS) were used to perform wall inspections on underground storage tanks (USTs) W 5 and W 6 of the South Tank Farm (STF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The TMS was designed for deployment in the USTs at the Hanford Site. Because of its modular design, the TMS was also deployable in the USTs at ORNL. The USTs at ORNL {{were built in the}} 1940 s and have been used to store radioactive waste during the past 50 years. The tanks are constructed with an inner layer of Gunite{trademark} that has been spalling, leaving sections of the inner wall exposed. Attempts to quantify the depths of the spalling with video inspection have proven unsuccessful. The TMS surface-mapping campaign in the STF was initiated to determine the depths of cracks, crevices, and/or holes in the tank walls and to identify possible structural instabilities in the tanks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the {{inception}} of HLA, {{there has been much}} discussion on how to create interoperable federates. Much of the early HLA work focused on creating new federations starting from scratch. In practice, this is rarely the case. Creating a federation is a labor- and money-intensive process. This paper discusses the approach used to create a new federation using existing federates with different FOMs. Our approach draws on the work performed by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) Reference FOM Study Group and the SISO's ongoing Base Object Models Study Group.

Detectors were chosen from among large commonly-available sodium iodide (NaI) crystal scintillators and spaced as evenly as is thought possible with a detector apparatus attached to a gantry crane. Several scenarios were simulated with this model, based on a single IMCC being moved between a ship’s deck or cargo hold and the dock. During measurement, the gantry crane will carry that IMCC {{through the air and}} lower it onto a receiving vehicle (e. g. a chassis or a bomb cart).

That study determined that very low levels of hydrogen- 3 (as tritiated water) had migrated from the burial ground and were present in two nearby hand-pumped picnic wells. The current program consists of sample collection and analysis of air, surface and subsurface water, and bottom sediment. The {{results of the}} analyses are used to (1) monitor the migration pathway of water from the burial ground (Plot M) to the hand-pumped picnic wells, (2) establish if buried radionuclides other than hydrogen- 3 have migrated, and (3) generally characterize the <b>radiological</b> <b>environment</b> of the area.

For many years it was the only radionuclide found to have migrated in measurable quantities. Analyses since 1984 have indicated the presence of low levels of strontium- 90 in water from a number of boreholes next to Plot M. The available data does not allow a firm conclusion as to whether the presence of this nuclide represents recent migration or movement that may have occurred before Plot M was capped.

40|$|The {{eye lens}} {{is one of}} the most {{sensitive}} organs for radiation injury and exposure might lead to radiation induced cataract. Eye lens dosimetry in anesthesiology has been published in few clinical trials and an active debate about the causality of radiation induced cataract is still ongoing. Recently, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended a reduction in the annual dose limit for occupational exposure for the lens of the eye from 150 to 20  mSv, averaged over a period of 5  years, with the dose in a single year not exceeding 50  mSv. This prospective study investigated eye lens dosimetry in anesthesiology practice during a routine year of professional activity. The radiation exposure measured represented the exposure in a normal working schedule of a random anesthesiologist during 1  month and this cumulative eye lens dose was extrapolated to 1  year. Next, eye lens doses were measured in anesthesiology during neuro-embolisation procedures, radiofrequency ablations or vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures. The eye lens doses are measured in terms of the dose equivalent H p(3) with the Eye-D dosimeter (Radcard, Poland) close to the right eye (on the temple). In 16 anesthesiologists, the estimated annual eye lens doses range from a minimum of 0. 4  mSv to a maximum of 3. 5  mSv with an average dose of 1. 33  mSv. Next, eye lens doses were measured for nine neuro-embolisation procedures, ten radiofrequency ablations and six vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures. Average eye lens doses of 77  ±  76  µSv for neuro-embolisations, 38  ±  34  µSv for cardiac ablations and 40  ±  44  µSv for vertebro-/kyphoplasty procedures were recorded. The maximum doses were respectively 264, 97 and 122  µSv. This study demonstrated that the estimated annual eye lens dose is well below the revised ICRP's limit of 20  mSv/year. However, we demonstrated high maximum and average doses during neuro-embolisation, cardiac ablation and vertebro-/kyphoplasty procedures. With radiation induced cataract being explained as a possible stochastic effect, without a threshold dose, anesthesiologists who regularly work in a <b>radiological</b> <b>environment</b> should remain vigilant and maintain radiation safety standards at all times.

Key among the Enterprise SRS strategic initiatives is the integration of research into facilities in conjunction with on-going missions to provide researchers from other national laboratories, academic institutions, and commercial entities the opportunity to demonstrate their technologies in a relevant environment and scale prior to deployment. To manage that integration of research demonstrations into site facilities, The Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have established a center for applied nuclear materials processing and engineering research (hereafter referred to as the Center). The key proposition of this initiative is {{to bridge the gap between}} promising transformational nuclear fuel cycle processing discoveries and large commercial-scale-technology deployment by leveraging SRS assets as facilities for those critical engineering-scale demonstrations necessary to assure the successful deployment of new technologies. The Center will coordinate the demonstration of R&D technologies and serve as the interface between the engineering-scale demonstration and the R&D programs, essentially providing cradle-to-grave support to the research team during the demonstration. While the initial focus of the Center will be on the effective use of SRS assets for these demonstrations, the Center also will work with research teams to identify opportunities to perform research demonstrations at other facilities. Unique to this approach is the fact that these SRS assets will continue to accomplish DOE's critical nuclear material missions (e. g., processing in H-Canyon and plutonium storage in K-Area). Thus, the demonstration can be accomplished by leveraging the incremental cost of performing demonstrations without needing to cover the full operational cost of the facility. Current Center activities have been focused on integrating advanced safeguards monitoring technologies demonstrations into the SRS H-Canyon and advanced location technologies demonstrations into K-Area Materials Storage. These demonstrations are providing valuable information to researchers and customers as well as providing the Center with an improved protocol for demonstration management that can be exercised across the entire SRS (as well as to offsite venues) so that future demonstrations can be done more efficiently and provide an opportunity to utilize these unique assets for multiple purposes involving national laboratories, academia, and commercial entities. Key among the envisioned future demonstrations is the use of H-Canyon to demonstrate new nuclear materials separations technologies critical for advancing the mission needs DOE-Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) to advance the research for next generation fuel cycle technologies. The concept is to install processing equipment on frames. The frames are then positioned into an H-Canyon cell and testing in a relevant <b>radiological</b> <b>environment</b> involving prototypic radioactive materials can be performed...|$|E
40|$|Well ER- 2 - 1 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (formerly Nevada Operations Office), {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. This well was drilled in February and March of 2003, as part of a hydrogeologic {{investigation}} program for the Yucca Flat/Climax Mine Corrective Action Unit in the northeastern portion of the Nevada Test Site. Well ER- 2 - 1 was drilled as part of the Yucca Flat Corrective Action Unit Phase I drilling initiative. The well is located in north central Yucca Flat within Area 2 of the Nevada Test Site, and provided information regarding the <b>radiological</b> and physical <b>environment</b> near underground nuclear tests conducted in a saturated volcanic aquifer setting. Detailed lithologic descriptions with stratigraphic assignments are included in this report. These are based on composite drill cuttings collected every 3 meters and 83 sidewall samples taken at various depths between 113. 7 and 754. 4 meters, supplemented by geophysical log data. Detailed petrographic, chemical, and mineralogical studies of rock samples were conducted on 27 samples of drill cuttings. The well was collared in tuffaceous alluvium, and penetrated Tertiary-age tuffs of the Timber Mountain and Paintbrush Groups, Calico Hills and Wahmonie Formations, Crater Flat Group, Grouse Canyon Formation, before reaching total depth in the Tunnel Bed Formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA common {{denominator}} of all neutron radiography (NRAD) facilities worldwide {{is that the}} perimeter of the experimental chamber of the facility is a radiation shielding structure which,in some cases, also includes flight tube and filter chamber structures. These chambers are normally both located on the beam port floor outside the biological shielding of the neutron source. The main function of the NRAD-shielding structure isto maintain a <b>radiological</b> safe working <b>environment</b> in the entire beam hall according to standards set by individual national radiological safety regulations. In addition, the shielding's integrity and capability should not allow, during NRAD operations, an increase in radiation levels in the beam port hall and thus negatively affectadjacent scientific facilities (e. g. neutron diffraction facilities). As a bonus, the shielding for the NRAD facility should also prevent radiation scattering towards the detector plane and doing so, thus increase thecapability of obtaining better quantitative results. This paper addresses Monte Carlo neutron-particletransport simulations to theoretically optimize the shielding capabilities of the biological barrierfor the SANRAD facility at the SAFARI- 1 nuclear research reactor in South Africa. The experimental process to develop the shielding, based on the principles of the ANTARES facility, is described. After casting, the homogeneity distribution of these concrete mix materials is found to be near perfect and first order experimental radiation shielding characteristicsthrough film badge (TLD) exposure show acceptable values and trends in neutron- and gamma-ray attenuation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Radiologists' {{training}} {{is based on}} intensive practice and can be improved {{with the use of}} diagnostic training systems. However, existing systems typically require laboriously prepared training cases and lack integration into the clinical environment with a proper learning scenario. Consequently, diagnostic training systems advancing decision-making skills are not well established in radiological education. Methods We investigated didactic concepts and appraised methods appropriate to the radiology domain, as follows: (i) Adult learning theories stress the importance of work-related practice gained in a team of problem-solvers; (ii) Case-based reasoning (CBR) parallels the human problem-solving process; (iii) Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) can be useful for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). To overcome the known drawbacks of existing learning systems, we developed the concept of image-based case retrieval for radiological education (IBCR-RE). The IBCR-RE diagnostic {{training is}} embedded into a didactic framework based on the Seven Jump approach, which is well established in problem-based learning (PBL). In order to provide a learning environment that is as similar as possible to radiological practice, we have analysed the <b>radiological</b> workflow and <b>environment.</b> Results We mapped the IBCR-RE diagnostic training approach into the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) framework, resulting in the proposed concept of the IRMAdiag training application. IRMAdiag makes use of the modular structure of IRMA and comprises (i) the IRMA core, i. e., the IRMA CBIR engine; and (ii) the IRMAcon viewer. We propose embedding IRMAdiag into hospital information technology (IT) infrastructure using the standard protocols Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Health Level Seven (HL 7). Furthermore, we present a case description and a scheme of planned evaluations to comprehensively assess the system. Conclusions The IBCR-RE paradigm incorporates a novel combination of essential aspects of diagnostic learning in radiology: (i) Provision of work-relevant experiences in a training environment integrated into the radiologist's working context; (ii) Up-to-date training cases that do not require cumbersome preparation because they are provided by routinely generated electronic medical records; (iii) Support of the way adults learn while remaining suitable for the patient- and problem-oriented nature of medicine. Future work will address unanswered questions to complete the implementation of the IRMAdiag trainer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Well ER- 6 - 2 and its {{satellite}} hole, Well ER- 6 - 2 No. 1, were drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Restoration Project at the Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. Well ER- 6 - 2 was drilled in two stages in 1993 and 1994; the satellite hole, Well ER- 6 - 2 No. 1 was drilled nearby in 1993 but was abandoned. The wells were drilled as part of a hydrogeologic investigation program for the Yucca Flat-Climax Mine Corrective Action Unit Number 97, in the northeastern portion of the Nevada Test Site. The wells are located in Yucca Flat, within Area 6 of the Nevada Test Site. The wells provided information regarding the <b>radiological</b> and hydrogeological <b>environment</b> in a potentially down-gradient position from tests conducted in northern and central Yucca Flat. Construction of Well ER- 6 - 2 began with a 1. 2 -meter-diameter surface conductor hole, which was drilled and cased off to a depth of 30. 8 meters below the surface. A 50. 8 -centimeter diameter surface hole was then rotary drilled to the depth of 578. 5 meters and cased off to the depth of 530. 4 meters. The hole diameter was then reduced to 27. 0 centimeters, and the borehole was advanced to a temporary depth of 611. 4 meters. The borehole was conventionally cored to a total depth of 1, 045 meters with a diameter of 14. 0 centimeters. Borehole sloughing required cementing and re-drilling of several zones. The open-hole completion accesses the lower carbonate aquifer, the CP thrust fault, and the upper clastic confining unit. A fluid level depth of 543. 2 meters was most recently measured in the open borehole in September 2007. No radionuclides were encountered during drilling. The satellite hole Well ER- 6 - 2 No. 1 was drilled approximately 15. 2 meters north of Well ER- 6 - 2 on the same drill pad. This was planned to be used as an observation well during future hydrologic testing at Well ER- 6 - 2; however, the satellite hole was abandoned at the depth of 399 meters due to stuck drill pipe, and was subsequently cemented to the surface. Detailed lithologic descriptions with stratigraphic assignments in this report are based on composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3 meters, cores taken between the depths of 619. 3 and 1, 042. 4 meters, and geophysical log data. Stratigraphic assignments within the Paleozoic section are based on paleontological analyses. The well was collared in alluvium and at 30. 8 meters penetrated Paleozoic carbonate rocks. These consisted of dolostone with minor shale and limestone of the Bonanza King Formation, and limestone with minor quartzite, sandstone, and dolostone assigned to the Guilmette Formation. The borehole reached total depth in a shale unit assigned to the Chainman Shale. The units below the Bonanza King Formation are overturned due to faulting and folding and, therefore, are stratigraphically upside-down...|$|R
