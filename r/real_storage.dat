40|$|Background Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used devices in asthma treatment in the Nordic countries. As new DPIs become available, patients are likely to be exposed to more than one type of device, with variable optimal handling. The aim was to examine <b>real</b> life <b>storage</b> and retention of multidose DPIs in patients with asthma. Methods This patient-reported survey on <b>real</b> life <b>storage</b> and retention of DPIs included asthma patients using multidose DPIs. Basic patient characteristics, information on inhaler use and storage, check of expiry date, and concurrent inhaler use was examined using an on line questionnaire. Results A total of 738 patients were included with a median age of 41 years, out of which 83 % were women. Sixty-three per cent reported storage conditions pre-defined as risk locations for their maintenance inhaler and 38 % of the responding patients had more than one maintenance inhaler in use at the same time. Two thirds of the study population checked inhaler expiry date less than monthly or not at all. Use after expiry date was frequently reported. Two thirds of the patients had not received information on DPI storage, either from their doctor and/or nurse or at the pharmacy. Conclusions This patient reported survey indicates that two thirds of the patients store their inhaler devices in suboptimal conditions, and only a minority had received instruction regarding inhaler handling. Non awareness of inhalersâ€™ expiry dates and use of more than one maintenance inhaler simultaneously was common. As inhaler mishandling may impact device functionality, improved communication and patient education is needed...|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} IBM {{introduced}} MVS, {{which not only}} supported virtual storage that was larger than the available <b>real</b> <b>storage,</b> as did SVS, but also allowed an indefinite number of applications to run in different address spaces. Two concurrent programs might try to access the same virtual memory address, but the virtual memory system redirected these requests to different areas of physical memory. Each of these address spaces consisted of three areas: an operating system (one instance shared by all jobs), an application area unique for each application, and a shared virtual area used for various purposes, including inter-job communication. IBM promised that application areas would always be at least 8 MB. This made MVS the perfect solution for business problems that resulted from the need to run more applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} Storemates was first thought up by Shaffique Prabatani after a {{personal}} experience {{of lack of}} space.

Inspired by this local solution, Shaff, Ben and Jason decided to take this idea and create an online service where people can share their space with those in need; appearing on BBC's Dragon's Den and BBC's <b>Real</b> <b>Storage</b> Wars.Today Shaff and Ben continue as Managing Partners; Jason stepped down as a director, although remains as a consultant and shareholder.|$|E
5000|$|PL/I {{was first}} {{implemented}} by IBM, at its Hursley Laboratories in the United Kingdom, {{as part of}} the development of System/360. The first production PL/I compiler was the PL/I F compiler for the OS/360 Operating System, built by John Nash's team at Hursley in the UK: the runtime library team was managed by I.M. (Nobby) Clarke. The PL/I F compiler was written entirely in System/360 assembly language. [...] Release 1 shipped in 1966. OS/360 is a real-memory environment and the compiler was designed for systems with as little as 64 kilobytes of <b>real</b> <b>storage</b> - F being 64 kB in S/360 parlance. To fit a large compiler into the 44 kilobytes of memory available on a 64-kilobyte machine, the compiler consists of a control phase and a large number of compiler phases (approaching 100). The phases are brought into memory from disk, one at a time, to handle particular language features and aspects of compilation. Each phase makes a single pass over the partially-compiled program, usually held in memory.|$|E

50|$|Multiprocessing {{systems are}} either loosely coupled, {{which means that}} each {{computer}} has access to a common workload, or tightly coupled, {{which means that the}} computers share the same <b>real</b> <b>storage</b> and are controlled by a single copy of the operating system. MVS retained both the loosely coupled multiprocessing of Attached Support Processor (ASP) and the tightly coupled multiprocessing of OS/360 Model 65 Multiprocessing. In tightly coupled systems, two CPUs shared concurrent access to the same memory (and copy of the operating system) and peripherals, providing greater processing power and a degree of graceful degradation if one CPU failed. In loosely coupled configurations each of a group of processors (single and / or tightly coupled) had its own memory and operating system but shared peripherals and the operating system component JES3 allowed managing the whole group from one console. This provided greater resilience and let operators decide which processor should run which jobs from a central job queue. MVS JES3 gave users the opportunity to network together two or more data processing systems via shared disks and Channel-to-Channel Adapters (CTCA's). This capability eventually became available to JES2 users as Multi-Access SPOOL (MAS).|$|E

40|$|Storage {{systems such}} as file systems, databases, and RAID systems have a simple, basic contract: you give them data, they do not lose or corrupt it. Often they store the only copy, making its {{irrevocable}} loss almost arbitrarily bad. Unfortunately, their code is exceptionally hard to get right, since it must correctly recover from any crash at any program point, no matter how their state was smeared across volatile and persistent memory. This paper describes EXPLODE, a system that {{makes it easy to}} systematically check <b>real</b> <b>storage</b> systems for errors. It takes user-written, potentially system-specific checkers and uses them to drive a storage system into tricky corner cases, including crash recovery errors. EXPLODE uses a novel adaptation of ideas from model checking, a comprehensive, heavyweight formal verification technique, that makes its checking more systematic (and hopefully more effective) than a pure testing approach while being just as lightweight. EXPLODE is effective. It found serious bugs in a broad range of <b>real</b> <b>storage</b> systems (without requiring source code) : three version control systems, Berkeley DB, an NFS implementation, ten file systems, a RAID system, and the popular VMware GSX virtual machine. We found bugs in every system we checked, 36 bugs in total, typically with little effort. ...|$|E

While the distribution of the processorâ€™s CPU is primarily a political question and the allocation of the processorâ€™s channels are dictated by the characteristics of the I/O configuration, the allocation of the processorâ€™s <b>real</b> and expanded <b>storage</b> is a complex question. This paper will present an algorithm for allocating <b>real</b> and expanded <b>storage</b> based on the hypothesis that an optimal allocation of the processorâ€™s storage resources has been achieved when the percentage of the processorâ€™s CPU resource used for memory management is minimized. During 1985, Amdahl delivered a new feature called Multiple Domain Facility (MDF) [1] that allowed its users to arbitrarily partition the physical resources of a single processor to define multiple logical partitions.
