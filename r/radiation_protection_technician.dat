The Waste Management System is a distributed computer processing system {{stored in a}} Sybase database and accessed by a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Omnis 7. It resides on the local area network at the Plutonium Facility and is accessible by authorized TRU waste originators, count room personnel, <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> <b>technicians</b> (RPTs), quality assurance personnel, and waste management personnel for data input and verification. Future goals include bringing outside groups like the LANL Waste Management Facility on-line {{to participate in this}} streamlined system.

40|$|Abstract. The {{current state}} {{and need for}} <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> {{training}} in Finland have been surveyed by the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority – STUK. The survey sought {{to determine whether the}} current requirements for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training had been met, and to promote <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training. Details of the scope and quality of present <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training were requested from all educational institutes and organizations providing <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training. The survey covered both basic and further training, special training of radiation safety officers, and supplementary training. The questionnaire was sent to 77 educational organization units, 66 per cent of which responded. Radiation workers and radiation safety officers were asked about <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> knowledge and needs for additional training. The questionnaire was sent to 880 radiation users and 170 radiation safety officers, 70 per cent of whom responded. The survey covered all professional groups and fields of the use of ionizing radiation except nuclear energy. The amount of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training in basic and further (specialization) training in the same vocational or academic degree varied remarkably by educational organization. The average amounts of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> included in most professional degrees met the requirements. 32 per cent of workers considered their <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> training inadequate for their duties, and 48 per cent had completed no supplementary training in <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> over the last five years.

30|$|Aside {{from the}} {{optimisation}} of protocols and procedures, their standardisation and their personalisation, {{it is most}} important to optimise <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> using existing <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> measures (28). To optimise <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> in terms of applicability and best benefit for staff and patients, the establishment of key indicators of safety and quality in <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> is essential according to the general ALARA principle discussed before. The primary goal {{of the development of}} safety programmes is to reduce morbidity risks from excessive exposure to ionising radiation for specific procedures and populations, e.g. interventional radiology and the paediatric population. Another focus is on cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> devices and safety programmes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of four questions about personal data and ten questions about <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> was distributed to lead consultants, consultants, residents, medical students, and medical technical assistants at two institutions, a level 1 trauma center and a children's hospital.

30|$|Although the {{majority}} of students (83 %) reported that they had lectures about radiation during their study, only 39 % reported that these lectures focussed on radiation dose and associated risks. As the subjects are future doctors referring patients for imaging examinations, they should be taught about the approximate quantity of radiation involved and which imaging methods use radiation and which do not. Knowledgeable and well-trained students {{play an important role in}} the creation of a positive radiation safety culture. The revised Euratom basic safety standard (BSS) Directive, article 18, states that 'member states shall encourage the introduction of a course on <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> in the basic curriculum of medical and dental schools’ [29, p. 15]. <b>Radiation</b> <b>protection</b> courses for medical students should include knowledge needed by a referring physician, i.e., basic knowledge on patient <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> such as biological effects of radiation, justifications of exposures, procedure optimisation, risk-benefit analysis, typical doses for each type of examination, etc. In addition, knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of ionising radiation in medicine, should be part of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> education and training for medical students [30, p. 14]. ICRP (2009) recommends a total of 5 – 10  h for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> education and training for medical students [31]. However, universities, including the sampled universities, provide an average of only two hours of lectures on <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> and there are no learning outcomes for <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> lectures in the curriculum [32]. This is alarming and may reflect the attitudes of the academic staff towards <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> issues. It is, therefore, suggested that a <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> curriculum, that covers the topics and the learning outcomes that are recommended for referrers in EU Directive 2014 [30], is developed, and the number of teaching hours needs to be consistent with the ICRP (2009) recommendations [31]. Radiation safety training should be an essential part of a university’s commitment [33]. Appropriate knowledge about radiation dose and protective measures from ionising medical examinations are important components for guideline adherence [34].|$|R
40|$|Background: Use of {{ionising}} radiation in diagnostic radiography {{could lead to}} hazards such as somatic and genetic damages. Compliance to safe work and <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> practices could mitigate such risks. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the knowledge and <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> practices among radiographers in Lagos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: The study was a prospective cross sectional survey. Convenience sampling technique was used to select four x-ray diagnostic centres in four tertiary hospitals in Lagos metropolis. Data were analysed with Epi- info software, version 3. 5. 1. Results: Average score on assessment of knowledge was 73 %. Most modern <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> instruments were lacking in all the centres studied. Application of shielding devices such as gonad shield for protection was neglected mostly in government hospitals. Most x-ray machines were quite old and evidence of quality assurance tests performed on such machines were lacking. Conclusion: Radiographers within Lagos metropolis showed an excellent knowledge of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> within the study period. Adherence to <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> practices among radiographers in Lagos metropolis during the period studied was, however, poor. Radiographers in Lagos, Nigeria should embrace current trends in <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> and make more concerted efforts to apply their knowledge in protecting themselves and patients from harmful effects of {{ionising radiation}}...|$|R
40|$|Background Application of {{ionizing}} radiation in many fields especially in medicine is growing, {{and can cause}} adverse health effects.

Materials and Methods The current {{study was conducted in}} all radiology departments of the teaching hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran, and their <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> status was investigated using Audit technique. For this purpose Audit checklist was prepared and essential information gathered by observation, interview with radiology department managers, and documentary surveying. At the end, standard situations were classified in three levels: poor (˂ 50 %), medium (50 - 75 %),s and good (75 - 100 %). Results The mean of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> in the studied radiology departments was 70. 53 %. The highest and lowest levels of <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> were in quality control and suitable ventilation, respectively. <b>Radiation</b> <b>protection</b> was evaluated as medium in 71. 4 % and good in 28. 6 % of the studied radiology departments.
