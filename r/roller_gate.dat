40|$|The paper {{describes}} the simultaneous topology, material, standard and rounded dimension optimization of mechanical structures, {{performed by the}} Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) approach. Beside the generation of an MINLP mechanical superstructure, {{the development of a}} general multilevel MINLP formulation for a mechanical superstructure is presented. The consideration of the discrete materials as well as standard and particularly rounded dimensions in structural synthesis significantly increases the combinatorics of the discrete optimization, which as a result may become too difficult to solve. A Linked Multilevel Hierarchical Strategy (LMHS) has been introduced for the solving of such large combinatorial problems. In order to decrease the effect of non-convexities, the Modified Outer-Approximation/Equality-Relaxation (OA/ER) algorithm has been applied. Four numerical examples of different complexities are presented to illustrate the proposed multilevel MINLP optimization approach: the optimization of two steel trusses, a composite I beam and a hydraulic steel <b>roller</b> <b>gate</b> Intake gate, erected in Aswan II, Egypt...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced <b>Roller</b> Track <b>Gate</b> (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional <b>Roller</b> Track <b>Gate</b> (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of dry bulk carrier vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present <b>Roller</b> Track <b>Gate</b> with the Multi-functional <b>Roller</b> Track <b>Gate,</b> the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel <b>roller</b> <b>gates,</b> supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|R
