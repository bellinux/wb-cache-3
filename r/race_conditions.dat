25|$|Practice summary: A {{total of}} 32 drivers {{completed}} 2,165 laps without any major incidents. Several drivers took time driving in packs, simulating <b>race</b> <b>conditions.</b> Dario Franchitti, along with Honda, topped the speed chart {{for the first}} for the month. The only minor incident of the day involved Sebastián Saavedra. His car lost paint and decals off the engine cover, bringing out a yellow for debris and track inspection. Sixteen of the full-time entries had passed the required 2,000-mile threshold, and took to the track Wednesday with fresh powerplants.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{practical}} application involving the hitting set problem arises in efficient dynamic detection of <b>race</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this case, each time global memory is written, the current thread and set of locks held by that thread are stored. Under lockset-based detection, if later another thread writes to that location {{and there is not}} a race, it must be because it holds at least one lock in common with each of the previous writes. Thus the size of the hitting set represents the minimum lock set size to be race-free. This is useful in eliminating redundant write events, since large lock sets are considered unlikely in practice.|$|E
25|$|On the men's side, rain {{made the}} <b>race</b> <b>conditions</b> difficult. Reigning World Champion Javier Gómez {{incurred}} a fall during the bike leg, {{causing him to}} fall off {{the pace of the}} race pack for the final 10 kilometres of the bike. Gómez managed to catch the lead group; however, Jonathan Brownlee, Alistair Brownlee, Sven Riederer, Brendan Sexton and David Hauss were in front of him. Alistair fell on one of the turns during the run before falling off the pace and out of contention. Gómez eventually passed the leaders, with only Jonathan keeping pace with him for a short while. Gómez finished first with Jonathan second and Riederer third. Alistair, the 2009 World champion, finished 29th.|$|E

25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual <b>race</b> <b>conditions</b> You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

Though {{it was not}} a name he particularly cared for, he would admit later that it was an appropriate summation of his approach to his racing. Skilled at setting up his car for <b>race</b> <b>conditions,</b> Prost would often conserve his brakes and tyres early in a race, leaving them fresher for a challenge at the end.|$|E
500|$|In the men's race, {{conducted}} the previous day, humidity and heat {{had taken the}} greatest toll on the athletes. To compensate for the expected warm weather, some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts. This {{proved to be a}} misjudgment, as conditions were cooler in the Great Wall section than on the previous day— compared to [...] Thunderstorms, bringing persistently heavy rain and strong winds, resulted in actual <b>race</b> <b>conditions</b> far different from expected. Other riders, such as Katherine Bates (who did not finish), prepared by wearing cooling vests before the race and stocked up on ice packs during it.|$|E
40|$|We {{conservatively}} extend an ACP-style discrete-time process {{theory with}} discrete stochastic delays. The semantics of the timed delays relies on time additivity and time determinism, which are properties that {{enable us to}} merge subsequent timed delays and to impose their synchronous expiration. Stochastic delays, however, interact {{with respect to a}} so-called <b>race</b> <b>condition</b> that determines the set of delays that expire first, which is guided by an (implicit) probabilistic choice. The <b>race</b> <b>condition</b> precludes the property of time additivity as the merger of stochastic delays alters this probabilistic behavior. To this end, we resolve the <b>race</b> <b>condition</b> using conditionally-distributed unit delays. We give a sound and ground-complete axiomatization of the process theory comprising the standard set of ACP-style operators. In this generalized setting, the alternative composition is no longer associative, so we have to resort to special normal forms that explicitly resolve the underlying <b>race</b> <b>condition.</b> Our treatment succeeds in the initial challenge to conservatively extend standard time with stochastic time. However, the ‘dissection’ of the stochastic delays to conditionally-distributed unit delays comes at a price, as we can no longer relate the resolved <b>race</b> <b>condition</b> to the original stochastic delays. We seek a solution in the field of probabilistic refinements that enable the interchange of probabilistic and nondeterministic choices...|$|R

500|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the [...] season, three practice sessions were held, two ninety-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. During the first practice session on Friday, Mercedes set times well clear of their closest rivals. Nico Rosberg was fastest on {{a time of}} 1:32.292, {{more than half a}} second quicker than his teammate Lewis Hamilton in second place. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest, albeit almost two seconds slower than Rosberg. Newcomers Stoffel Vandoorne and Alfonso Celis Jr. were 18th and 21st fastest respectively, both slower than their teammates. Celis went off track at one point at turn 3, leading him to back off the pace in order not to damage the car, as his responsibility laid mainly with gathering information for the team. The session was marked by unusually cool weather, said to be representative of the expected <b>race</b> <b>conditions</b> for Sunday's race, held at night. Therefore, many teams decided to send their cars out for a large number of laps, with sixteen drivers recording twenty laps or more.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and to participate later in a press conference. After the feature race, Vandoorne {{said that it was}} a [...] "very entertaining race" [...] and he thought that the safety car came out at the wrong time. He stated that {{from his point of view}} overtaking was easy, and he did not expect to catch Rossi, but it had been a good start for the season starting from first place, recording the fastest lap, and winning the event. Haryanto said it felt [...] "really great" [...] to finish on the podium, but thought it would be difficult to close the gap with the drivers in front of him. He stated that he did not expect to have a fast pace on the soft-compound tyres but knew that his pace under <b>race</b> <b>conditions</b> was good. Having been disappointed at his result in the qualifying session, Rossi was pleased to stand on the podium. He felt he achieved the best result for Racing Engineering. He stated that it was a good race for the team, and felt he should have not pushed too hard when he knew Vandoorne was in clean air.|$|E

2500|$|Linear types, {{based on}} the theory of linear logic, and closely related to {{uniqueness}} types, are types assigned to values having the property that they have one and only one reference to them at all times. These are valuable for describing large immutable values such as files, strings, and so on, because any operation that simultaneously destroys a linear object and creates a similar object (such as 'str= str + [...] "a"') can be optimized [...] "under the hood" [...] into an in-place mutation. Normally this is not possible, as such mutations could cause side effects on parts of the program holding other references to the object, violating referential transparency. They are also used in the prototype operating system Singularity for interprocess communication, statically ensuring that processes cannot share objects in shared memory {{in order to prevent}} <b>race</b> <b>conditions.</b> The Clean language (a Haskell-like language) uses this type system in order to gain a lot of speed (compared to performing a deep copy) while remaining safe.|$|E
