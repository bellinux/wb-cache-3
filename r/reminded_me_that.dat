500|$|In February 2016, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl {{reunited with}} the actress, Kelsey Rohr, {{who played the}} girl in the [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] music video twenty-three years earlier and who was then just six years old. Rohr stated that [...] "Today <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I peaked at 6 years old BUT I was the most badass kid on the playground. Today was the {{absolute}} coolest. Or in Dave's words seeing each other today was a 'historic moment'! What a legend!".|$|E
500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E

[...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when I came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, writing {{that while there}} had been a [...] "self-congratulatory quality" [...] to Glee since its mid-season break, [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] was a return to [...] "the Glee [...] fell in tormented love with." [...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> what I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things.

500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre.

In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City.

When I was 13 years old, I ran away from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I wanted to be on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio".

2500|$|In 2002, Abagnale himself {{addressed}} the issue of his story's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said in part: [...] "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was just telling a story and not writing my biography." ...|$|E

"Reading the {{statements}} from last weekend's sessions <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{it was probably}} the senior warden, not the girl's mother, who in 1975 reported John's abuse, after which I immediately told him to leave the parish, and that {{in order to maintain the}} confidentiality of both John and the girl, I did not tell the parents, who nonetheless confronted me when they had found out four years later. Until reading {{the statements}} I had never before known that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the parish to which he went after leaving my parish. That I could have prevented that from happening had I known to act differently is extremely grievous to me. My efforts to maintain confidentiality and prevent scandal were very misguided." ...|$|E
