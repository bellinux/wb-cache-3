5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation</b> tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E

40|$|Oil {{companies}} in Alberta, Canada, invested $ 32 billion on new oil sands projects in 2013. Despite {{the size of}} this investment, there is a demonstrable deficiency in the uniformity and understanding of environmental legislation requirements that manifest into increased project compliance risks. This descriptive study developed 2 prioritized lists of environmental regulatory compliance <b>risks</b> and <b>mitigation</b> strategies and used multi-criteria decision theory for its theoretical framework. Information from compiled lists of environmental compliance <b>risks</b> and <b>mitigation</b> strategies was used to generate a specialized pairwise survey, which was piloted by 5 subject matter experts (SMEs). The survey was validated by a sample of 16 SMEs, after which the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank a total of 33 compliance <b>risks</b> and 12 <b>mitigation</b> strategy criteria. A key finding was that the AHP is a suitable tool for ranking of compliance <b>risks</b> and <b>mitigation</b> strategies. Several working hypotheses were also tested regarding how SMEs prioritized 1 compliance <b>risk</b> or <b>mitigation</b> strategy compared to another. The AHP showed that regulatory compliance, company reputation, environmental compliance, and economics ranked the highest and that a multi criteria mitigation strategy for environmental compliance ranked the highest. The study results will inform Alberta oil sands industry leaders about the ranking and utility of specific compliance <b>risks</b> and <b>mitigations</b> strategies, enabling them to focus on actions that will generate legislative and public trust. Oil sands leaders implementing a risk management program using the <b>risks</b> and <b>mitigation</b> strategies identified in this study will contribute to environmental conservation, economic growth, and positive social change...|$|R

25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed seismic hazard assessment of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed seismic hazard analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of earthquake <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation</b> studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as comprehensive understanding of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have put effort into developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E

40|$|Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) is {{the highly}} demanded fruit for export {{commodity}} from Indonesia. The biggest mangosteen production center in Indonesia is West Java Province. The {{development of the}} mangosteen supply chain in Indonesia, particularly in West Java Province is heavily affected by uncertain potential risks for the chain. This paper identifies potential risks of the supply chain and studies the interrelationships between strategies for mitigating those risks. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was utilized to identify the main risks then Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) was used to illustrate the interrelationship of those <b>risks</b> <b>mitigations.</b> Data were gathered through questionaires guided interviewing the experts of mangosteen business.

Improved coordination and trust building may advocate the Indonesian government to facilitate the provision of soft loans to agricultural businesses, which enables the farmers’ cooperative to buy mangosteen in cash therewith improving their return on investment...|$|R
25|$|As a result, a study {{into the}} risks of bird strikes at KSIA was commissioned, with special {{attention}} being paid to the barn swallows at Mount Moreland. The study showed that the early morning dispersals of swallows generally happen before any scheduled arrivals or departures (earlier than 06:00), and the late afternoon swarms take place below the airport approach path, with only 5% of the birds protruding up into the path for {{a very short time}} (around 10 minutes). It was also noted that larger bird species, flying at higher altitudes, would pose more of a risk to aircraft than the swallows, such species already being a risk at Durban International Airport. The study concluded that it would definitely be possible for the airport and swallows to co-exist. Proposed <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation</b> measures included curtailing flight movements during the afternoon swarm, setting the glide slope approach to Runway 06 to 3.2 or 3.5 degrees rather than the standard 3 degrees (to stay above the birds), and the installation of a radar system that would monitor bird movements and be integrated into the operational plan of the airport.|$|E
25|$|In November 2006, declaring {{satisfaction}} with the F-35's progress to date, the government gave 'first-pass' initial approval to the project under which F-35s will be acquired, deferring to late 2008 a {{decision on whether to}} actually order the aircraft. Following this initial approval, on 13 December 2006 Australia signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which commits Australia to the next phase of the F-35's development. In October 2006 the deputy chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn, publicly stated that the RAAF had considered suitable aircraft which could be acquired if the F-35 was delayed, but that such aircraft were not believed to be necessary {{on the basis of the}} F-35 program's progress at the time. Concerns over the F-35 delivery schedule developed in Australia during 2007. In February the defence minister announced that a <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation</b> strategy, which involved obtaining F/A-18F Hornets, was being developed to prevent a gap in the RAAF's air combat capability if the F-35 program was delayed. This strategy was adopted, and an order for 24 F/A-18Fs was announced on 6 March 2007. The first aircraft was delivered in 2009 and the first squadron was declared operational in December 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The main charge {{made against}} the buddy system as practiced {{is that it}} has been grossly overrated as a means of <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation.</b> Critics say that the buddy system acts as a crutch to give {{unjustified}} confidence to divers who individually do not have either the skills or the discipline to adequately deal with any real diving problems.

The reality may be that the buddy diver on which many divers depend is often no better able to handle an emergency than the dependent buddy.

2500|$|The Government stated that, {{unlike the}} Bail Act 1978, the new act {{is not based}} on a [...] "system of offence-based presumptions". Instead, {{it is based on the}} premise of whether the accused will present as an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] to society. The new act also allows for a further {{application}} if: the accused previously did not have legal representation, there is new relevant information, relevant circumstances have changed, or the accused is under 18 and the previous application was made on a first appearance for the offence. In May 2013, on the second reading of the Bail Bill, Attorney General and Minister for Justice Greg Smith described the Government's approach as one of [...] "risk-management". [...] The Bail Act 2013 adds an [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test in regard to whether [...] "the accused will fail to appear in any proceedings for the offence, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence". One significant change is in consideration of [...] "the presumption of innocence and the general right to be at liberty." [...] Another important change is that [...] "once bail is granted, it will continue to operate until it is either revoked or the substantive proceedings concluded." [...] Under the Bail Act 2013, bail does not have to be formally continued by the court. When the bail authority determines that the accused poses an [...] "unacceptable risk", it must record the nature of the presumed risk and consider <b>risk</b> <b>mitigation</b> approaches. To determine whether there is an [...] "unacceptable risk", the bail authority can consider the person's background; the seriousness of the offence; the strength of the case; whether the person has a history of violence or non-compliance with bail requirements, apprehended violence orders, parole or good behaviour bonds; the likely length of the sentence if bail is not granted; and whether the person is of a disadvantaged group. It was noted by a member of the NSW Bar Association that, while they were not [...] "unusual or unfamiliar", not all of the factors the bail authority may consider are directly related to the [...] "unacceptable risk" [...] test.|$|E
