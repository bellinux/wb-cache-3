5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
500|$|Back in 1939, as the British sailors {{fight the}} Nazis in the ballroom, Mulder tells [...] "Scully" [...] {{that she has}} to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle {{in order to get the}} ship out of the rift in space. Mulder grabs [...] "Scully" [...] and kisses her, [...] "in case they never meet again". [...] "Scully" [...] punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, {{surrounded}} by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where [...] "Scully" [...] punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile, as the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Male Model" [...] targets {{the male}} {{role models for}} female rock bands, while [...] "Pompeii" [...] explores soul-searching themes such as one's losses and anxieties. [...] "Youth Decay" [...] was {{described}} by PopMatters as a song that [...] "grapples with adult disbelief {{of the problems of}} youth and the manifestations of it in terms of eating disorders and silence." [...] It features fast punk rock guitar work. The lyrics to [...] "#1 Must-Have" [...] reference images of the riot grrrl scene in the mainstream media. It was written when Tucker was preparing for an interview about the subject, held by the EMP Museum in Olympia, Washington. The song also alludes to the misogyny that took place at the Woodstock music festival in 1999, where several women were raped. Similarly, the song [...] "Was It a Lie?" [...] is a protest against how violence is used as entertainment in the media. [...] "The Professional" [...] aims at music journalism and contains heavy drum work, while [...] "Ironclad" [...] features [...] "fuzzed-out riffs and pounding fills". Other songs such as [...] "Leave You Behind" [...] and [...] "The Swimmer" [...] feature soft melodies and harmonies. [...] "You're No Rock n' Roll Fun" [...] was described as [...] "easy moving, beach punk rock music". [...] "Milkshake n' Honey" [...] was considered to be the band's funkiest song. Pitchfork commented that the song [...] "spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> at the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rowling made a guest {{appearance}} as {{herself on the}} American animated sitcom The Simpsons, in a special British-themed episode entitled [...] "The Regina Monologues". The dialogue consisted of a short conversation between Rowling and Lisa Simpson, who mispronounces Rowling's name. She acknowlewdges Lisa with [...] "Thank you, young Muggle". When Lisa asks her about the ending of Harry Potter, Rowling sighs and says: [...] "He grows up, and marries you. Is {{that what you want}} to hear?" [...] to which Lisa swoons and dreamily replies, [...] "Yes!" [...] before Rowling <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and walks away.|$|E
2500|$|There is meta-humor in this strip; for example, the {{characters}} talk with their mouths closed. Their dialogue has many exclamation points {{when they talk}} quietly or nicely like the dialogue in Peanuts. Also, in some strips, there are repeated drawings and lines (i.e. in the May 21, 2008 strip, Buckles steps back from a harmless garter snake, horrified. He then hides behind Paul, who rolls his eyes and says, [...] "For crying out loud, Buckles! It's just a harmless garter snake!" [...] After that, like Buckles, Paul steps back from the harmless garter snake, horrified. Then he hides behind Jill, who is gardening but <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> saying, [...] "For crying out loud, Paul!..." [...] like Paul did with Buckles).|$|E

60|$|She <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{round the}} young men, {{with a long}} sweep of her painted eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney accent, but with an {{affectation}} of refinement which made every word a feast of fun.|$|R
5000|$|Treadwell stated: What is Swing? Perhaps {{the best}} answer, after all, was {{supplied}} by the hep-cat who <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> stared into the far-off and sighed, [...] "You can feel it, but you just can't explain it. Do you dig me?" [...] Treadwell (1946), p.10 ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't want to {{talk about}} her. She used to be married to someone, and she {{divorced}} him. And then she was married to someone else, and he divorced her. And I'm certain her hair wasn't that colour two years ago, and I don't think a woman ought to make up like that, and her dress is all wrong for the country, and those pearls can't be genuine, and I hate the way she <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> about, and pink doesn't suit her a bit. I think she's an awful woman, and I wish you wouldn't keep on talking about her." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{might seem}} {{difficult}} to a beginner, but {{to those of}} us who frequent the movies it is nothing. The reel spins and we see--a narrow room--(it is always narrow in the movies)--to indicate straitened circumstances--cardboard furniture--high chairs with carved backs--two cardboard beams across the ceiling (all this means the Middle Ages)--a long dinner table--all the little Columbuses seated at it--Teresa Colombo cutting bread at one end of it--gives a slice to each, one slice (that means poverty in the movies)--Teresa <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> up--all the little children put their hands together and say grace (this registers honesty). The thing is done. Let us turn back to the history book and see what is to be put in next.|$|E
60|$|When {{the girls}} had perched {{themselves}} on any available article of furniture, they waited with respectful eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment, and Julia <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> with <b>her</b> finger on her lips, looking {{as if she could}} tell much if she dared.|$|R
6000|$|Was {{there ever}} {{anything}} so lucky as this? Pamela's situation was fast becoming the cook's situation.

Tammy had a discussion with the two in order to get them focused, but Tammy could not control them. When Bill Rancic checked Synergy's progress, Allie meant to <b>roll</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in front of him; which it did not look good as Bill brought up that statement.|$|R
6000|$|When men see girls wasting {{their time}} in {{consultations}} about bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can hardly help saying, “For Heaven’s sake, let girls be better educated; let them have some better objects of thought—some more solid occupations.” But after a few hours’ conversation with an oracular literary woman, or a few hours’ reading of her books, they are likely enough to say, “After all, when a woman gets some knowledge, see what use she makes of it! Her knowledge remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own ‘intellectuality;’ she spoils the taste of one’s muffin by questions of metaphysics; ‘puts down’ men at a dinner-table with her superior information; and seizes the opportunity of a soirée to catechise us on the vital question {{of the relation between}} mind and matter. And then, look at her writings! She mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for originality; she struts on one page, <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth. She may have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the difference between his own English and a Londoner’s: rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect. No—the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest crops.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Snoopy is less helpful, however, when Patty {{complains}} that {{her hair is}} a [...] "mousey blah" [...] style. Snoopy brings in a large red gift box, and inside is a large red curly-haired wig that makes Patty look like Little Orphan Annie. After trying it on, Patty <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and dumps the wig on Snoopy's head.|$|E
50|$|Highlander: The Search For Vengeance {{contains}} two Quickenings {{that occur in}} the same manner as those in the first original Highlander movie. A Japanese woman in the fields undergoes vibrations in her head and slightly <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as she becomes immortal. Colin MacLeod's Quickening by lightning takes place inside an old Stonehenge-like structure and is very similar to Connor MacLeod's Quickening in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E

50|$|The betrothal of Evangeline Brackett to Angus McTavish is built, {{in large}} part, {{on the way}} she bites her lip and <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> when she tops her drive, says the Oldest Member.

60|$|Teeka <b>rolled</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in his {{direction}} and strained the squirming mite still closer to her. Tarzan came nearer. Teeka drew away and bared her fangs. Tarzan was nonplussed. In all his experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today {{she did not look}} playful. Tarzan ran his brown fingers through his thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared. Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.|$|R

5000|$|When Prince Charles appears {{wielding}} a rapier {{and wearing a}} swashbuckler costume {{like that of the}} actors in the silent film, Princess Diana <b>rolls</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and returns her attention to the television. Further attempts by Prince Charles to impress his spouse—including presenting her with a red rose and jumping through a flaming hoop—are similarly rebuffed as she is more interested in the romances depicted on her television. Costello later commented that he had [...] "no idea" [...] of the reason for the interspersed royalty scenes, which were, he says, the director's idea. At one point, the singer drops two stone tablets similar to those in the classic film The Ten Commandments and they are smashed.|$|E

Now, the shock threatened to break in upon her and sweep away all her intervening life, make her as a girl of eighteen again, loving her father. So she pressed back, away from the shock, she clung to her present life.|$|R
60|$|A strained, anguished look {{came into}} Mrs. Smethurst's face and was {{reflected}} in the faces of {{the other members of the}} circle.
