40|$|The {{issue of}} {{designing}} drives, which provide low frequency (max. 1 rotation per minute) rotation {{with a big}} moment (min 1 MN m) of large technical bodies utilized in restricted spaces, is a complex and contradictory one. The drives of geokhod propeller, rotor actuators of tunneling machines with overload protection, as well as actuators of other machinery meeting aforementioned requirements are examples of such machines. The paper considers mathematical model developed by the authors which determines the relation of design factors of transmission tooled with hydraulic cylinders to kinematic parameters of output element movement. The paper also provides description of methods to determine pumping unit efficiency for <b>rotary</b> <b>transmission</b> tooled with hydraulic cylinders...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to present}} the {{application}} of the finite element method to perform stress and fatigue analysis on a mechanical drive axle. Drive axles are widely used in rotating machinery and are subject to fatigue problems. The <b>rotary</b> <b>transmission</b> axle in this study is supported in bearings loaded by an alternating force of 6. 8 kN, wherein the axle has rounding radii all 0. 003 m in size and a ground surface of AISI 1050 steel with Young’s elasticity modulus of 206. 8 GPa and Poisson modulus of 0. 28. We present the rupture conditions ensuing from tension as well as fatigue, for a lifetime of the transmission axle of 350, 000 cycles. The quantitative results compared satisfactorily to the empirical fatigue data...|$|E
40|$|Wire capstan drives {{are used}} as <b>rotary</b> <b>transmission</b> {{elements}} for their very low (nominally zero) backlash and high stiffness properties. To obtain high stiffness, the cable is typically wrapped around the input and output drum in a figure-eight pattern multiple times. This stiffness can be determined by analyzing the amount of deformation between the cable and the drums and the friction caused by this contact. In product literature and various textbooks [1][2][3], it was noticed that different methods of determining the stiffness of the transmission drive were presented depending how friction was considered. It is found the model which considers the extension from the external torque and preload force matches experimental data {{along with the other}} model that defined the area of traction to act in a certain section of the drum. As the coefficient of friction between the cable and transmission drum increases, the two models differ giving the method that defined the area of slip along a certain section of the drum, the conservative choice. This paper presents a comparison of two different stiffness models, along with data from experiments to study the model differences.

50|$|The Wind 125 feature front {{disk brake}} and the {{conventional}} transmission (one down and four {{up with a}} clutch) {{as compared to the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>transmissions</b> found on most underbone and tricycle model motorcycles. The front head cowl conceals a set of functional clocks that provide motorcycle speed, engine revolution counter, odometer and fuel gauge. The Wind 125 retails for P54,000.|$|R
50|$|This {{can cause}} serious {{damage to the}} dynamos and power plant, {{potentially}} resulting in centrifugal warping and collision of the rotor windings with the field coils, shaft bearing overspeed and failure, and damage to the driving engine, the engine governor, or the <b>rotary</b> power <b>transmission</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The Byk 100 is the {{entry-level}} motorcycle of Bajaj. The defining {{feature of}} the Bajaj's motorcycle is the head cowl which is also present in the Byk100. The Byk 100 uses a drum brake system for the front and a <b>rotary</b> type <b>transmission</b> with a clutch. The retail price is P34,000. However, this particular model has regressed and was replaced with the CT 100 model, which has typically the same specifications.|$|R
40|$|Polypeptide {{sequences}} encoded by some exons of {{the human}} tropoelastin gene (EDP, elastin-derived peptide) have been analysed {{for their ability to}} coacervate and to self-assembly. The great majority of them were shown to form organized structures, but only a few were indeed able to coacervate. Negative staining and <b>rotary</b> shadowing <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy showed the polypeptides to adopt a variety of supramolecular organization, from filaments, as those typical of tropoelastin, to amyloid-like fibers. The results obtained gave significant insight to the possible roles played by specific polypeptide sequences of tropoelastin...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the initial}} 600 volt direct current (DC) installation, Ultimo Power Station {{supplied}} three phase alternating current (AC) at 6600 volts, 25 cycles per second. Originally, this current was not stepped up for <b>transmission.</b> <b>Rotary</b> converters {{were used to}} convert the three phase AC to 600 volts DC for the tram supply. The 1500 volt DC heavy rail electrification commenced operation in 1926 and also initially utilised high capacity rotary converters.|$|R
40|$|A unique {{new class}} of core–shell {{structured}} composite nanoparticles, C-coated inorganic fullerene-like WS 2 (IF-WS 2) hollow nanoparticles, has been created {{for the first time}} in large quantities, by a continuous chemical vapour deposition method using a <b>rotary</b> furnace. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy and Raman characterisations of the resulting samples reveal that the composite nanoparticles exhibited a uniform shell of carbon coating, ranging from 2 – 5 nm on the IF-WS 2 core, with little or no agglomeration. Importantly, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis confirm that their thermal stability against oxidation in air has been improved by about 70 °C, compared to the pristine IF-WS 2, making these new C-coated IF-WS 2 nanoparticles more attractive for critical engineering applications...|$|R
50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for <b>rotary</b> motors. <b>Transmission</b> systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.|$|R

His primary research interest lies within {{the dynamics of the}} high-speed <b>rotary</b> power and <b>transmissions,</b> including the spur/helical/bevel planetary gear trains, permanent magnet motors, rolling ball bearings, and other transmissions having structural symmetry.

40|$|Mycoplasma mobile is a {{parasitic}} bacterium {{that causes}} necrosis in the gills of freshwater fishes. This study examines the molec-ular structure of its variable surface protein, MvspI, whose {{open reading frame}} encodes 2, 002 amino acids. MvspI was isolated frommycoplasma cells by a biochemical procedure to 92 % homogeneity. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation sug-gested that this protein is a cylinder-shapedmonomer with axes of 66 and 2. 7 nm. <b>Rotary</b> shadowing <b>transmission</b> electronmi-croscopy of MvspI showed that the molecule is composed of two rods 30 and 45 nm long; the latter rod occasionally features a bulge. Immuno-electronmicroscopy and epitope mapping showed that the bulge end of the molecular image corresponds to the C terminus of the amino acid sequence. Partial digestion by various proteases suggested that the N-terminal part, comprised of 697 amino acids, is flexible. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence showed that the molecule features a lipoprotein and 16 repeats of about 90 residues; 15 positions exist between residues 88 and 1479, and the other position is between residues 1725 and 1807. The amino acid sequence of MvspI was mapped onto a molecular image obtained by electronmicroscopy. The present study {{is the first to}} elucidate the molecular shape of a variable surface protein of mycoplasma. Mycoplasmas are commensal and occasionally parasitic bac-teria with small genomes and no peptidoglycan layer (30). They bind to host tissues via adhesion proteins. Some species at-tach to solid surfaces through a membrane protrusion and glide by a unique mechanism which is thought to be involved in parasitis...|$|R
40|$|Angiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) is an {{essential}} molecule for blood vessel formation; however, {{little is known about}} the structure-function relationships of Ang 1 with its receptor, Tie 2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain- 22 ̆ 7). In this study, we generated several Ang 1 and angiopoietin- 2 (Ang 2) variants to define the role of the superclustering and oligomerization domains of the Ang 1 protein. Then we analyzed the molecular structure of the variants with SDS-PAGE and <b>rotary</b> metal-shadowing <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy (RMSTEM) and determined the effects of these variants on the binding and activation of Tie 2. Ang 1 exists as heterogeneous multimers with basic trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers, whereas Ang 2 exists as trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers. The variant Ang 1 C 265 S, consisting of trimers, tetramers, and pentamers without multimeric forms of Ang 1, yielded less Tie 2 activation than did Ang 1, whereas monomeric Ang 1 (Ang 1 /FD), dimeric Ang 1 variants (Ang 1 D 2, and Ang 1 D 3), and dimeric and trimeric Ang 1 variant (Ang 1 D 1) dramatically lost their ability to bind and activate Tie 2. An Ang 1 protein in which two cysteines (amino acids 41 and 54) were replaced with serines (Ang 1 C 41 S/C 54 S) formed mostly dimers and trimers that were not able to bind and activate Tie 2. In addition, improper creation of a new cysteine in Ang 2 (Ang 2 S 263 C) dramatically induced Ang 2 aggregation without activating Tie 2. In conclusion, proper oligomerization of Ang 1 having at least four sub-units by the intermolecular disulfide linkage involving cysteines 41 and 54 is critical for Tie 2 binding and activation. Thus, our data shed a light on the structure-function relationships of Ang 1 with Tie 2...|$|R
