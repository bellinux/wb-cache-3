40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter spp. {{are associated}} with up to 80 % of diarrheal illness to travelers from developed countries to developing countries. In order to study acute gastrointestinal diseases, researchers from developed countries such as the United States rely on transporting clinical specimens from the developing countries to laboratories in the U. S. in <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems. There are few commercially available <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems cited in the literature or designated by transport system manufacturers for the transport of enteric bacteria. Therefore a laboratory-based {{study was conducted to}} assess three commercial available <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems, two gel swabs and one liquid vial, to determine the most appropriate for the maintenance and recovery of common enteric bacterial pathogens. A total of 13 bacterial enteropathogens were recovered from 25 °C and 4 °C storage temperatures at time points up to 21 days. The results demonstrated that the gel swab and liquid vial transport systems performed similarly for all isolates at both temperatures. All three <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems struggled to maintain the isolates at recoverable concentrations when stored at 4 °C and it is recommended that isolates be stored at 25 °C in <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems. Lastly, swab <b>transport</b> systems are <b>recommend</b> for <b>transport</b> since they are small and easy to pack, resist leakage, and are less expensive than similarly performing liquid vial <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of viral infections by culture {{relies on the}} collection of proper specimens, proper care to protect the virus in the specimens from environmental damage, and use of an adequate transport system to maintain virus activity. Collection of specimens with swabs that are toxic to either virus or cell culture should be avoided. A variety of <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> have been formulated, beginning with early bacteriological <b>transport</b> <b>media.</b> Certain swab-tube combinations have proven to be both effective and convenient. Of the liquid <b>transport</b> <b>media,</b> sucrose-based and broth-based media appear to be the most widely accepted and used. Studies on virus stability show that most viruses tested are sufficiently stable in <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> to withstand a transport time of 1 to 3 days. Some viruses may withstand longer transport times. In many cases, {{it is not necessary to}} store virus specimens in a refrigerator or send them to the laboratory on wet ice or frozen on dry ice.

40|$|We {{compared}} relative recoveries of Bordetella pertussis from simulated nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens incubated {{in three}} separate <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> at different temperatures. <b>Transport</b> <b>media</b> included one-half-strength Regan-Lowe (RL. 5), Regan-Lowe with one-half-strength agar (RL. 5 A), and buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar supplemented with alpha-ketoglutarate, lincomycin, and anisomycin (BCYE alpha LA). For each transport medium, recovery of B. pertussis was least efficient after storage at 25 degrees C. The highest recovery of B. pertussis from a mixed culture was achieved with RL. 5 at 4 degrees C. Overall, RL. 5 and RL. 5 A were comparable as <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> whether held at 4 or 25 degrees C, but fewer organisms were recovered from BCYE alpha LA. In addition, Regan-Lowe (RL), Bordet-Gengou, and cyclodextrin media were compared as primary isolation media for recovering B. pertussis from simulated NP swabs held at 4 and 35 degrees C in RL. 5 medium. The highest recovery of B. pertussis was obtained on RL primary isolation medium. Bordet-Gengou medium recovered only 80 % and cyclodextrin medium recovered less than 60 % {{of the numbers}} recovered on RL medium. Based on these results, refrigeration (4 degrees C) of NP swabs shipped in RL. 5 transport medium and using RL as the primary isolation medium are recommended for recovering B. pertussis from swab specimens...|$|R

UDP is inherently an unreliable <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> that results in certain unacknowledged packet losses. Multimedia applications usually can tolerate some packet losses for its rendering at the receiver side.
