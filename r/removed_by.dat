5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} detect litchi fruit under nature scenes, an {{identification}} method was studied. A simple process was proposed to segment {{the image and}} remove noises. Its key steps include image converting; segmenting by Two-Cluster K-means clustering; labeling by white and black; small noises <b>removing</b> <b>by</b> open-close combined morphology; and big noises <b>removing</b> <b>by</b> blob area thresholding. A new contribution {{has been made to}} weighing by ultrasonic sensor and machine vision which allows for identifying litchi weight under nature scenes. A max error of 27 % was recorded in tests of such weighing method...|$|R
5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
