5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or <b>raddle,</b> sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a <b>raddle</b> contaminates it.|$|E

She was, he observed, of middle-age, lean and aquiline-featured, with an exaggerated chin, that ended squarely as boot. Her sallow cheeks were <b>raddled</b> to a hectic color, a monstrous head-dress--like that of some horse in a lord mayor's show--coiffed her, and her dress was a mixture of extravagance and incongruity, the petticoat absurdly hooped.|$|R

50|$|For this project, Daniel and Geo Fuchs photographed rooms {{representing}} the former power/ {{authority of the}} East Germany government: wiretapped rooms, locations of physical violence, torture, and psycho-terror - {{and yet it is}} not a documentary in the classical sense. The photographed view of a not completely closed door, <b>raddled</b> office furniture or a crooked hung portrait of Erich Honecker on the wall, is an artistic visualization of the evidence that the regime was an ailing system long before the fall of the Wall. The images were taken 15 years {{after the fall of the}} wall, in rooms, which Daniel and Geo Fuchs still found in their initial condition. In compliance with the status-quo, the artists photographed solely during daylight. The only style element for each picture is the same calculated central point, which seems to drag the viewer into the room.|$|R

The new order was born among conflicts and adversities, which did not come without the influence on the kelter of an average family. All the threats influence the shape of Polish families, and what was noticed by Z. Kwieciński, the educational reactions undertaken in the families are incoherent. If we add often negative, or outright aggressive impact of school and out of school (television, literature etc.) factors, it is difficult to be surprised with the miserable educational effects appearing in the form of pathological behaviours touching children and young people...|$|R
