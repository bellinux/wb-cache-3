The BACTEC 460 TB PZA susceptibility test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a daily (D) <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> has been available for more than 10 years, but weekend laboratory staffing is necessary. A nonweekend (NW) <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> has not been validated in a multicenter study. This prospective multicenter study compares the interlaboratory reproducibility of PZA susceptibility results by following both the D and NW schedules. A total of 181 cultures were shared among four laboratories. Isolates were selected based on resistance or borderline resistance {{to at least one}} streptomycin-isoniazid-rifampin-ethambutol drug or PZA. One laboratory used a D <b>reading</b> <b>schedule,</b> and three laboratories used a NW schedule. Both reading schedules are based on the standard BACTEC 460 TB PZA protocol. With the NW schedule, the growth index (GI) is not available for test interpretation on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Of the 181 shared cultures, 154 were found to be susceptible by all laboratories, 19 were found to be resistant, and 8 had discordant results. The overall pairwise interlaboratory agreement was 97. 7 %. The discrepancies were not associated with the type of <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> used. However, the median control GI was significantly higher for the NW schedule (321) than for the D schedule (259) (P < 0. 0001) although results were available on average in about 7 days from setup for both schedules. These results show that the NW schedule is a suitable alternative for laboratories that do not read and interpret PZA susceptibility tests on weekends...|$|E

The idea is to form a group of six to ten people, pick a book, define a <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> and meet {{once a week to}} discuss what you’ve read. Study groups provide enough structure to help you read and digest books and other information better than you would on your own. Yet, SGs don’t require as much time or involve as much pressure as a formal class. It’s a way of fostering your own professional development and keep up with new technology. As Warren Keuffel points out, you can’t always count on your company to provide the training that you want or need: “Engineers should recognize that professional and team development is by nature, and often by organizational default, an activity for which individual engineers need to take responsibility. If you’re the kind of engineer who expects your company to train you with whatever skills you require for well-rounded professional growth, you may be unpleasantly surprised when the time comes to shop those skills around to other shops. ”[1] Your company inherently benefits from software practitioners improving their skill...|$|E

The document listed numerous books I had already read. Novels like Great Expectations, Catcher in the Rye, A Separate Peace, and Moby Dick dominated the list.

Buried deep within the technical jargon and philosophical language of Understanding Media, with its discussions of “hot ” and “cool ” media and the claim that the medium was the message (or, perhaps even more appropriately the massage), was the introduction of a concept that sounded revolutionary at the time: the rapid expansion of mass media had made former distinctions based upon national boundaries obsolete.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to obtain a {{preliminary}} description, through study of the legal files, of that group of persons who appear before the Court of Domestic Relations for a reconsideration of the custody decision made initially, {{at the time of}} divorce. A sample of 92 cases heard in Mu 1 tnomah County in 1965 was obtained. A survey of the literature revealed that much of what has been written on the subject of divorce and custody is primarily from a statistical or legalistic standpoint and very little bears directly on the granting or obtaining of custody or the problems encountered by the custodial or non-custodial parents and the children. A <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> was developed for the purpose of recording the information in the legal files maintained by the court.

40|$|AbstractDrug {{susceptibility}} testing (DST) {{is often}} needed in patients clinically failing tuberculosis (TB) therapy. Most studies of phenotypic direct drug susceptibility tests, such as microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) tests, {{have been performed}} in patients not receiving TB treatment. The effect of ongoing TB treatment {{on the performance of}} MODS direct DST has not been previously explored, but patients failing such therapy constitute an important target group. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the performance of MODS direct rifampicin and isoniazid DST in patients clinically failing first-line TB treatment, and to compare MODS direct DST with indirect proportion method DST. Sputa from 264 TB patients were cultured in parallel in Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) and MODS assays; strains were tested for rifampicin and isoniazid susceptibility by the proportion method at the national reference laboratory. Ninety-three samples were culture-positive by LJ and MODS (concordance of 96 %; kappa 0. 92). With conventional MODS plate DST reading (performed on the same day as the sample is classified as culture-positive), the isoniazid DST concordance was 96. 8 % (kappa 0. 89), and the concordance for rifampicin susceptibility testing was 92. 6 % (kappa 0. 80). Reading of MODS DST plates 1 week after cultures had been determined to be culture-positive improved overall performance marginally—the isoniazid DST concordance was 95. 7 % (kappa 0. 85); and the rifampicin DST concordance was 96. 8 % (kappa 0. 91). Sensitivity for detection of multidrug-resistant TB was 95. 8 %. MODS testing provided reliable rifampicin and isoniazid DST results for samples obtained from patients receiving TB therapy. A modified DST <b>reading</b> <b>schedule</b> for such samples, with a final reading 1 week after a MODS culture turns positive, marginally improves the concordance with reference DST...|$|E
40|$|The problem {{studied in}} this paper is as follows. Consider a file stored in {{contiguous}} space on disk. Given a list of pages to be retrieved from the file, what is the fastest way of retrieving them? It is assumed that adjacent pages on disk can be read with a single read request. The straightforward solution is to read the desired pages one by one. However, if two or more pages are located {{close to each other}} it may be faster to read them with a single read request, possibly even reading some intervening "empty" pages. It is shown that finding an optimal <b>read</b> <b>schedule</b> is equivalent to finding the shortest path in a certain graph. A very simple approximate algorithm is then introduced and (experimentally) shown to produce schedules that are close to optimal. The expected cost of schedules produced by this algorithm is derived. It is found that significant speed-up can be achieved by the simple mechanism of using additional buffer space and issuing "large reads" whenever it is advantageous to do so...|$|R

40|$|Video on Demand (VOD) is an {{exciting}} and promising technology which has attracted significant commercial and non-commercial interest. While research and development continue {{to increase the speed}} and capacity of all computer components, memory (DRAM) capacities experience relatively slow growth. This thesis explores the buffer memory requirements of VOD servers by giving a new buffer sharing and <b>read</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithm called Block-Release Sharing, and by experimental analysis of a server which incorporates this algorithm. The Block-Release Sharing (BRS) algorithm (an extension of Makaroff and Ng's CES algorithm [1]) re-uses buffer blocks as they are consumed by the outgoing media streams, while scheduling buffer replenishment to minimize the response time for new streams. The BRS algorithm was implemented in a VOD server which runs under Linux and Solaris, and the server's performance was tested. The BRS algorithm saves space while adding little or no jitter, and improves response times for starting new streams when adequate bandwidth is available from the server. iii Acknowledgments This thesis {{would not have been possible}} without the the advice and guidance of my advisor, Professor Klara Nahrstedt.
