The <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> {{seal arrangement}} further comprises an arrangement that not only allows for preloading of the stationary seal ring relative to the seal seat, but also provides for dampening yielding a dynamic seating response for the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seal arrangement.

40|$|To study {{frictional}} {{property of}} mechanical seals when distributing dimples with varying parameters along the <b>radial</b> <b>face,</b> friction experiments, including seal faces with varying dimple diameter in various types, invariable dimple diameter, and without dimples, {{were carried out}} on end-face tester under different loads and rotation speeds. The {{results show that the}} introduction of dimples on seal face does reduce friction coefficient efficiently, but its anti-friction effect is closely related to the arrangement manner of dimple diameter and the operation condition. The type with increasing dimple diameters along the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> from the inner to the outer diameter should be more suitable for the design of seal faces for its smaller friction coefficient when comparing with the type with optimum invariable dimple diameter. On the other hand, the operation condition, including loads and rotation speeds, {{must be taken into account}} to determine how to increase the dimple diameter along the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> from the inner to the outer diameter. The results could be a good start for further theoretical study to search for the optimum varying dimple parameters of mechanical seals...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{domain of}} a point group is a conic solid. An object with a given symmetry in a given orientation {{is characterized by the}} fundamental domain. If the object is a surface it is characterized by a surface in the fundamental domain continuing to its <b>radial</b> bordal <b>faces</b> or surface. If the copies of the surface do not fit, <b>radial</b> <b>faces</b> or surfaces can be added. They fit anyway if the fundamental domain is bounded by reflection planes.|$|R
40|$|To study {{tribological}} {{property of}} mechanical seals when distributing micropores along the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> with changeable parameter, friction experiments of mechanical seals under a certain condition {{were carried out}} while the pore diameter changed. The results show that: the introduction of micropores on the surface can reduce the friction efficiently, but its antifriction effect {{is closely related to}} the distribution of micropores. The friction coefficient is the smallest when pore diameters increasing by degrees along the seal <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> from the inside out, while complexly distributed of pore diameter has a poor effect on antifriction of mechanical seals. The results can offer some help for optimal design of mechanical seals with micropores...|$|R
40|$|A seal {{assembly}} is provided {{for reducing the}} escape of fluids from between a housing and a shaft rotably mounted in the housing. The {{seal assembly}} comprises a pair of seal rings resiliently connected {{to each other and}} disposed in side-by-side relationship. In each seal ring, both the internal bore surface and the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> which faces away from the other seal ring are provided with a plurality of equi-spaced recesses. The seal faces referred to are located adjacent a seating surface of the housing. Under normal operating conditions, the seal assembly is stationary with respect to the housing, and the recesses generate life, keep the assembly spaced from the rotating shaft and allow slip therebetween. The seal assembly can seize on the shaft, and slip will then occur between the <b>radial</b> <b>faces</b> and the housing...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} quality of Eucalyptus dunnii sawn wood {{for use in the}} lumber industry. Logs of 25 and 30 cm of diameter were used, broken down according to two methods. The first method produced boards with tangential faces and the other method produced boards with <b>radial</b> <b>faces.</b> Defects such as crooking, bowling, cupping, and index of cracks in boards, in two humidity conditions, were appraised. Defects were appraised before and after drying, i. e. after reaching the humidity balance. The crooking was more intense in radial boards. The bowling was similar in the two studied systems. Cupping only happened in tangential boards after drying. Cracks were more intense in tangential break down, presenting larger evolution after drying, when compared with radial break down. The breaking down system envisaging boards with <b>radial</b> <b>faces</b> presented pieces of better conditions for industrial purposes...|$|R
50|$|An additional, {{important}} {{characteristic of}} shear-mode fractures {{is the process}} by which they spawn wing cracks, which are tensile cracks that form at the propagation tip of the shear fractures. As the <b>faces</b> <b>slide</b> in opposite directions, tension is created at the tip, and a mode I fracture is created {{in the direction of the}} Ïƒh-max, which is the direction of maximum principal stress.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{calculation}} {{for determining}} compressible flow across <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seals {{were compared with}} measured results obtained in a seal simulator rig at pressure ratios to 0. 9 (ambient pressure/sealed pressure). In general, the measured and calculated leakages across the seal dam agreed within 3 percent. The resultant loss coefficient, dependent upon the pressure ratio, ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 68.

40|$|Radial {{forces on}} the primary seal ring of a flat {{misaligned}} seal are analyzed, {{taking into account the}} radial variation in seal clearance. An analytical solution for both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects is presented that covers the whole range from zero to full angular misalignment. The net radial force on the primary seal ring is always directed so as to produce a radial eccentricity which generates inward pumping. Although the radial force is usually very small, in some cases it {{may be one of the}} reasons for excessive leakage through both the primary and secondary seals of a <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seal...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the narrow seal approximation which enables closed form analytical solutions for <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seals is examined in this paper. Both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects in a flat, misaligned seal are considered. Analytical results obtained from a simplified Reynolds equation, based on the neglect of circumferential pressure gradient and seal curvature, are compared with accurate results from numerical solution of the complete Reynolds equation. The agreement between the approximate and accurate solutions is quite reasonable {{over a wide range}} of a seal's inner-to-outer radius ratio. For radius ratios greater than 0. 8, the {{accuracy of}} the narrow seal approximation is better than 1 percent over most of the range of angular misalignment...|$|R
40|$|The cambium which {{produces}} wavy-grained xylem in spruce differs from normal cambium by a higher frequency of oblique anticlinal divisions {{and a higher}} rate of intrusive growth of fusiform initials. Since the orientation, either to the left or to the right, of the divisions and the overlaps achieved by the growting tips is uniform within the areas called domains, the domain pattern of the cambium is reflected in the pattern of grain undulations in the xy 1 em. The domain pattern moves longitudinally about 0. 7 mm during the production of l mm of xylem. A visible expression of the movement is the obliquity of undulation lines on the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> of the wavy xylem...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hydrodynamic}} self-acting seal {{designs for}} a LOX turbopump were analyzed {{in order to}} predict performance. A <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seal-to-seal LOX at 310 N/sq cm and 32, 000 rpm (130 m/s) was analyzed for pressure differentials of 172 to 448 N/sq cm and speeds from 98 to 147 m/s. A segmented circumferential seal-to-seal helium at 34. 5 or 69 N/sq cm and 157 m/s was analyzed for pressures of 35 to 86 N/sq cm (10 N/sq cm ambient) and speeds from 94 to 189 m/s. Test results confirmed noncontact operation near the design speed and pressure, and relatively good qualitative agreement between test and analysis.

40|$|Squeeze {{effects in}} a liquid {{lubricated}} <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> seal are analyzed. The analysis considers face misalignment with both axial and angular vibrations {{of the primary}} seal ring. Translational, rotational, and cross-coupled damping coefficients of the fluid film are derived analytically from a solution of the Reynolds equation utilizing the narrow seal approximation. Results are given {{for a wide range}} of practical radius ratios. At each radius ratio, the complete range of angular misalignment - from parallel faces to touch down - is covered. It is shown that squeeze effects in face seals are usually larger than the more familiar hydrodynamic effects. These effects play an important role in the seal's mechanism of operation and therefore have to be considered in any realistic seal model...|$|R

30|$|NIR {{reflectance}} spectra {{were measured}} {{before and after}} thermal/hygrothermal treatment from the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> of the air-dried wood samples using a Fourier transform (FT)-NIR spectrophotometer (Bruker, MATRIX-F; TE-InGaAs detector with a fiber optic probe) under laboratory conditions. The measurement area was 7 Â mm 2, which covered more than 2 Â years of tree rings, allowing the averaged spectral information of early and late wood to be acquired. A white plate (barium sulfate) served as the reference signal. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, 32 scans were co-added at a spectral resolution of 8 Â cmâˆ’ 1 over a wavenumber range of 10, 000 â€“ 4000 Â cmâˆ’ 1. A zero-filling of two (corresponding to a spectral interval of 4 Â cmâˆ’ 1) was applied. Three NIR spectral measurements were obtained and averaged for each sample.|$|R
40|$|Sliding Contact In many sliding systems, {{the sliding}} {{surfaces}} are not coextensive, so that points on one surface experience alternating periods of contact and separation. This intermittent {{process can be}} expected to influence the sliding speed at which the system is susceptible to frictionally-induced thermoelastic instability (TEI). This question is explored {{in the context of a}} simple system consisting of a rotating thin-walled cylinder whose end <b>face</b> <b>slides</b> against a rigid surface. The results show that at low Fourier numberâ€”i. e., when the frequency of the process is high compared with the thermal transient of the systemâ€”only the time-averaged frictional heat input is important and the critical speed is an inverse linear function of the proportion of time in sliding contact. At higher Fourier number, lower critical speeds are obtained, but the dependence on Fourier number is relatively weak. ...|$|R

25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the <b>radial</b> <b>faces</b> of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plybamboo is {{commonly}} made using chordwise bamboo strips. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that the bamboo utilization rate and the processing efficiency are low in manufacturing chordwise curtain Plybamboo. This paper presents a study on the manufacturing technology of radial curtain plybamboo form. Radial strips cut from bamboo were glued on the <b>radial</b> <b>faces.</b> The results showed: (1) the bamboo utilization rate of radial cutting strips was 15 - 20 % higher than chordwise cutting strips, and the resin consumption was only approximately 50 % of chordwise bamboo strips; (2) however, radial bamboo strips were more subject to lengthwise bending deformation than chordwise strips during drying. This lengthwise bending deformation can be effectively reduced or prevented by placing a hollow rigidity axle in the radial bamboo curtain rolls when using the bound drying method; (3) the hot pressing time of the radial curtain plybamboo form was approximately 50 % of the chordwise composite plastic curtain plybamboo...|$|R
40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic {{interlocked}} grain, local minute undulations of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the <b>radial</b> <b>face</b> of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of cambial initials. The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the interlocked grain formation...|$|R
40|$|The PrimWood method. Part 1 : Properties and {{production}} of timber with vertical annual rings. Old traditions and modern measurements show that radial sawn wood is subject to smaller moisture movements in {{the plane of the}} surface and has a harder surface and better shape-stability than timber sawn by conventional sawing techniques such as square sawing and through-and-through sawing. The advantages are greater if the juvenile wood is removed. Timber with <b>radial</b> <b>faces</b> and where the juvenile wood has been removed is said to have vertical annual rings, and such timber is particularly valuable for products such as floors, furniture, panels and exterior carpentry.

40|$|A {{model to}} predict {{off-axis}} crack evolution in multidirectional laminates subjected to multiaxial loading is proposed. The model applies multi-scale stress and local fracture mechanics analyses {{to distinguish between}} two microscopic damage mechanisms, which govern the damage evolution, as well as determining {{the magnitude of the}} damage evolution rate associated with each microscopic damage mechanism. The multi-scale analysis is based on the GLOB-LOC off-axis crack damage model, which is extended to include substantial new capabilities such as the influence of crack <b>face</b> <b>sliding</b> interaction and prediction of variations in the stress field due to the local crack density. The extension of the GLOB-LOC model introduces physically based multiaxial fatigue criteria for off-axis crack initiation and mixed-mode off-axis crack propagation.

The strong dependence of the COD on the relative stiffness and thickness of the surrounding layers, found in this study, is described by a power law.
