40|$|Graduation date: 2013 ﻿This project {{presents}} a new, and more versatile, method for performing <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> (also known as Parallax Occlusion Mapping), utilizing rates {{of change in}} texture coordinates across a polygon surface to calculate the texture sampling offsets used in the ray-tracing portion of the <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> algorithm. This new technique relies solely upon the texture-coordinates, vertex-coordinates, and a depth-map texture, allowing <b>Relief</b> <b>Mapping</b> to be utilized on complex meshes {{without the need for}} additional per-polygon information such as texture-aligned tangents or normal maps...|$|R

40|$|Relief impostors {{have been}} {{proposed}} as a compact and high-quality representation for high-frequency detail in 3 D models. In this paper we propose an algorithm to represent a complex object through {{the combination of a}} reduced set of <b>relief</b> <b>maps.</b> These <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> can be rendered with very few artifacts and no apparent deformation from any view direction. We present an efficient algorithm to optimize the set of viewing planes supporting the <b>relief</b> <b>maps,</b> and an image-space metric to select a sufficient subset of <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> for each view direction. Selected maps (typically three) are rendered based on the well-known ray-height-field intersection algorithm implemented on the GPU. We discuss several strategies to merge overlapping <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> while minimizing sampling artifacts and to reduce extra texture requirements. We show that our representation can maintain the geometry and the silhouette of a large class of complex shapes with no limit in the viewing direction. Since the rendering cost is output sensitive, our representation can be used to build a hierarchical model of a 3 D scene. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The surface of the saucer bears a <b>relief</b> <b>map</b> of Canberra and the rolling countryside around it. At the feet of Ethos are indentations that represent the lake that was later to fill the space between the Civic Centre and the administrative part of the city.

The shape grammar allows for modeling {{of the trunk}} and higher-level branches, {{as well as the}} details of compound leaves without resorting to image-based approximation strate-gies. The prioritized grammar rules illustrate the development of hierarchical and detailed tree models. This thesis introduces a novel idea of using implicit equations to ray trace tree surfaces as an alternative to triangle meshes. Each atomic shape in the tree model is an individually ray-traced conical frustum. This method yields a tree surface with correct behavior at the joins between adjacent shape geometries. The thesis also {{presents a}} new algorithm for <b>relief</b> <b>mapping</b> the ray traced tree sur-face. <b>Relief</b> <b>mapping</b> provides additional realism by closely imitating the irregular bark structure found on natural trees.

Our work is oriented towards city models with real photographic textures of the building facades. At {{the heart of our}} approach is a multi-resolution tree of the scene defining multi-level relief impostors. Key ingredients of our approach include the pre-computation of a small set of zenithal and oblique <b>relief</b> <b>maps</b> that capture the geometry and appearance of the buildings inside each node, a rendering algorithm combining <b>relief</b> <b>mapping</b> with projective texture mapping which uses only a small subset of the pre-computed <b>relief</b> <b>maps,</b> and the use of wavelet compression to simulate two additional levels of the tree. Our scheme runs considerably faster than polygonal-based approaches while producing images with higher quality than competing relief-mapping techniques.
