5000|$|According to Karel van Mander, Mostaert {{was born}} in Haarlem and had been a pupil of Jacob van Haarlem, the painter that painted the altarpiece of the Carrier's guild there in the St. Bavochurch. [...] He was handsome, eloquent and polite, and claimed to be descended from the Haarlem knights of the Crusade to Damietta. He worked {{eighteen}} years as portraitist for Margaret of Austria (1480-1530), governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. He died in Antwerp {{where he had been}} awarded a pension for life. Mostaert's name first appeared in city records in 1498, the year he married and bought a house in his birthplace. He is also mentioned in Haarlem archives from 1527 to 1554. In 1500 Mostaert was commissioned to paint the shutters for a <b>receptacle</b> <b>housing</b> the relics of Saint Bavo in the Groote Kerk, Haarlem. From this date he began to be listed in the records of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke, and continued to be frequently listed until 1549. He became deacon of the painters' guild in 1507, and again in 1543 and 1544.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} Latin etymologies have been proposed, {{including}} condon (<b>receptacle),</b> condamina (<b>house),</b> and cumdum (scabbard or case). [...] It {{has also been}} speculated {{to be from the}} Italian word guantone, derived from guanto, meaning glove. [...] William E. Kruck wrote an article in 1981 concluding that, [...] "As for the word 'condom', I need state only that its origin remains completely unknown, and there ends this search for an etymology." [...] Modern dictionaries may also list the etymology as [...] "unknown".|$|R
