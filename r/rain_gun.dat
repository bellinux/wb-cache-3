40|$|Este trabalho apresenta uma rotina computacional, em Visual Basic 6, para determinar o perfil radial de aspersores, mediante ensaios de equipamentos autopropelidos de irrigação. Para a avaliação do programa, foi utilizado o aplicativo computacional SIMULASOFT e dados de ensaios de campo de sistemas autopropelidos de irrigação. As lâminas aplicadas, geradas pelo programa SIMULASOFT, foram para o aspersor PLONA-RL 250 (bocal = 20 x 6 mm; pressão = 490 kPa), em deslocamento linear com velocidade de 50 m h- 1, e quatro ângulos de giro distintos (180; 270; 330 e 360 º). As lâminas aplicadas, observadas nos ensaios de campo, em condições de vento menores que 1, 5 m s- 1, foram para o aspersor PLONA-RL 250, operando na pressão de 392 kPa e sob as condições: i) bocal de 14 mm, ângulo de giro de 240 º e velocidade de 30 m h- 1; ii) bocal de 14 x 6 mm, ângulo de giro de 270 º e velocidade de 55 m h- 1. O perfil radial gerado pela rotina computacional com as lâminas aplicadas, geradas com SIMULASOFT, foi igual ao perfil radial obtido em ensaios de laboratório, revelando que o procedimento de cálculo está correto. Uma boa semelhança entre os perfis radiais do aspersor, determinados em ensaios de laboratório e gerados pela rotina computacional, com as lâminas obtidas nos ensaios de campo, foi observada, mostrando que ensaios de campo de sistemas autopropelidos de irrigação podem ser utilizados para a obtenção do perfil radial de aspersores. This paper {{presents}} a computational algorithm, in Visual Basic 6, to determine <b>rain</b> <b>gun</b> radial water distribution patterns, based on catch can data collected at standard tests of traveller irrigation machines. The algorithm was evaluated by using both simulated and measured data input. The simulated data input {{were obtained by}} running a software, named SIMULASOFT, in order to generate catch can data of a traveller irrigation machine transect section. Simulated values were computed considering the PLONA-RL 250 sprinkler (nozzle = 20 x 6 mm; pressure = 490 kPa) working with four wetted sector angles (180 º, 270 º, 330 º and 360 º) and a 50 m h- 1 linear traveling speed. The measured catch can data were obtained at field tests, held under wind speeds lower than 1. 5 m s- 1, of a traveler irrigation machine working with the PLONA-RL 250, at 392 kPa, under the following conditions: i) nozzle = 14 mm; sector angle 240 º, and traveling speed = 30 m h- 1; ii) nozzle = 14 x 6 mm, sector angle = 270 º, and traveling speed = 55 m h- 1. Comparisons among radial water application profiles measured at the test bench and the ones generated by the algorithm indicated that computed profiles based on simulated data were more accurate than the computed profiles based on field measured data. A great similarity obtained with simulated input data demonstrate the numerical accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The reasonably good resemblance of radial patterns generated by the algorithm, when using experimental input values, demonstrates that catch can transect values collected during standard field test of traveller irrigation machines {{may be used in}} order to determine <b>rain</b> <b>gun</b> radial water distribution pattern...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The Cool Farm Tool – Potato (CFT-Potato) is a spreadsheet programme {{that allows the}} calculation {{of the amount of}} CO 2 equivalents that it costs to produce 1 t of potato. The spreadsheet was adapted from an original generic version of the tool, and completed for potato production in diverse production areas in the world applying different levels of technology. The CO 2 embedded in chemicals during their production and released from the soil after nitrogen fertilization in the CFT-Potato has been updated to consider more recent products and production methods. Energy costs of the operations in the original version taken from generic data provided by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Standard, however, were altered (usually increased) where there was evidence from practical sources that the original figures did not apply. For example, the figure of around 16 l of diesel per ha for potato harvesting in the original version was corrected to 60 l of diesel per ha based on observational data. Figures for typical potato operations such as windrowing were supplied.

The CFT-Potato can be used by growers to calculate the actual costs of one ton of potato in terms of kg CO 2 and explore the repercussion of altered management options. Here the comparison of four potato production systems in the Netherlands is shown: seed potatoes (115 kg of CO 2 /t), table potatoes (77), starch potatoes (71) and organic potato (82). Based on potato dry matter, however, starch potato has the lowest footprint mainly due to the extensive use of pig slurry of which the production and transport CO 2 costs are attributed to the pig production chain. This research was partly funded by Pepsico-Fritolay and McCain Foods. [URL]...|$|E

30|$|The {{tendency}} {{to rely on}} standing water {{during the growing season}} as to exploit rice yields has led to poor water use efficiency. Numerous studies on Pakistan revealed that 13 – 18  cm of water is applied per irrigation, which is considerably higher than the consumptive use of around 8  cm between irrigation events (Kahlown et al., 2001). Additionally, farm irrigation efficiency ranges between 23 and 70 % (Clyma and Ashraf, 1975; Kahlown et al., 1998; Kijne and Kuper, 1995). Furthermore, the use of a pressurized irrigation method has allowed planting of rice and wheat in different countries. Sprinkler irrigation, such as portable <b>rain,</b> <b>guns</b> can be used to add water depth, and sprinklers have been used under prevailing climatic conditions on the Indian subcontinent to improve farm irrigation efficiency by up to 80 %.|$|R
60|$|So it was {{the news}} of the battle came {{filtering}} through to them all that morning. The Americans had lost a second ship, name unknown; the Hermann had been damaged in covering the Barbarossa.... Kurt fretted like an imprisoned animal about the airship, now going up to the forward gallery under the eagle, now down into the swinging gallery, now poring over his maps. He infected Smallways with a sense of the immediacy of this battle that was going on just over the curve of the earth. But when Bert went down to the gallery the world was empty and still, a clear inky-blue sky above and a rippled veil of still, thin sunlit cirrus below, through which one saw a racing drift of rain-cloud, and never a glimpse of sea. Throb, throb, throb, throb, went the engines, and the long, undulating wedge of airships hurried after the flagship like a flight of swans after their leader. Save for the quiver of the engines it was as noiseless as a dream. And down there, somewhere in the wind and <b>rain,</b> <b>guns</b> roared, shells crashed home, and, after the old manner of warfare, men toiled and died.|$|R

60|$|DEAR MR. STEAD,--Peace by compulsion. That seems {{a better}} idea than the other. Peace by persuasion has a {{pleasant}} sound, but I think {{we should not be}} able to work it. We should have to tame the human race first, and history seems to show that that cannot be done. Can't we reduce the armaments little by little--on a pro rata basis--by concert of the powers? Can't we get four great powers to agree to reduce their strength 10 per cent a year and thrash the others into doing likewise? For, of course, we cannot expect all of the powers to be in their right minds at one time. It has been tried. We are {{not going to try to}} get all of them to go into the scheme peaceably, are we? In that case I must withdraw my influence; because, for business reasons, I must preserve the outward signs of sanity. Four is enough if they can be securely harnessed together. They can compel peace, and peace without compulsion would be against nature and not operative. A sliding scale of reduction of 10 per cent a year has a sort of plausible look, and I am willing to try that if three other powers will join. I feel sure that the armaments are now many times greater than necessary for the requirements of either peace or war. Take wartime for instance. Suppose circumstances made it necessary for us to fight another Waterloo, and that it would do what it did before--settle a large question and bring peace. I will guess that 400,000 men were on hand at Waterloo (I have forgotten the figures). In five hours they disabled 50,000 men. It took them that tedious, long time because the firearms delivered only two or three shots a minute. But we would do the work now as it was done at Omdurman, with shower <b>guns,</b> <b>raining</b> 600 balls a minute. Four men to a gun--is that the number? A hundred and fifty shots a minute per man. Thus a modern soldier is 149 Waterloo soldiers in one. Thus, also, we can now retain one man out of each 150 in service, disband the others, and fight our Waterloos just as effectively as we did eighty-five years ago. We should do the same beneficent job with 2,800 men now that we did with 400,000 then. The allies could take 1,400 of the men, and give Napoleon 1,400 and then whip him.|$|R
