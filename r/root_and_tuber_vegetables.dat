In order to accommodate for the intended uses of chlorantraniliprole, the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRLs in carrots, beetroot, celeriac, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, swedes, turnips and other <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables,</b> except sugar beet and radish, from the values of 0. 02 mg/kg or 0. 04 mg/kg (depending on the crop) to 0. 06 mg/kg and in oilseeds, except peanuts, soya bean and cotton seed, from the limit of quantification of 0. 01 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 06 mg/kg for the intended use on carrots, beetroot, celeriac, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, parsley root, salsify, swedes, turnips, other <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables.</b> For the import tolerance on rape seed, sunflower seed and the minor oilseeds a MRL of 2 mg/kg is derived. The MRLs proposed for rape seed and sunflower seed are tentative, because the submitted dataset was incomplete (six instead of the eight residue trials). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of chlorantraniliprole in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of chlorantraniliprole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore are unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

Hence in keeping view of this objective the present paper focused on to assess the diet and nutritional status of rural preschool children at district level in the State of Orissa. This {{study was conducted in}} rural areas of 30 districts in the State of Orissa. Dietary history was obtained from 1, 605 preschool children and about 6, 803 children (1 - 6 Yrs) were covered for anthropometry and clinical examination. The data revealed that the mean intakes of majority of foods except cereals <b>and</b> millets, <b>roots</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubers</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> were below the recommended dietary intakes in both the age groups of preschool children. Similarly, in general, the intakes of majority of nutrients were below the RDA. The overall prevalence of Kwashiorkor and Marasmus was 1. 1 % each. The prevalence of Bitot’s spots was 2. 7 %. About 63 % of preschool children were stunted and underweighed.

Some samples of citrus fruit, exotic fruit [ [...] . ] contained perchlorate concentrations that can {{have undesirable effects on}} health if large portions are consumed on a one-time basis (BfR Opinion no. 022 / 2013). The EU Commission has commissioned the EFSA to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment. As a provisional enforcement approach until this assessment is completed, the EU Commission has initially proposed a general reference value of 0. 5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of food for perchlorate concentrations in fruit and vegetables. The proposal was adapted following discussions with the member states, and the following provisional enforcement approach was adopted on 16 July 2013 : the reference value is 0. 2 mg per kg for citrus fruit, pome fruit, <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuber</b> <b>vegetables,</b> table grapes, spinach, melons and water melons, 1. 0 mg per kg for leaf vegetables (apart from spinach), fresh herbs and celery grown in glasshouses/under cover, and 0. 5 mg per kg for all other fruit and vegetable products. The BfR welcomes the partial lowering of reference values to 0. 2 mg per kg. However, the BfR does not consider the adopted values to be suitable to adequately protect consumers against potential health risks due to the consumption of large portions of fruit and vegetable products with perchlorate residues. The BfR believes that only a concentration of 0. 05 mg per kg would be acceptable for all fruit and vegetable products based on the assessment methodology used for pesticides. As it is still not ultimately clear how perchlorate finds its way into foods, it is also unclear whether the presence of perchlorate in foods should be considered a "contaminant" or a "residue".

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the level of}} arsenic concentration in vegetables and other food categories in three selected areas of Pabna district and to estimate quantitatively the dietary arsenic exposure {{in one of the}} arsenic contaminated areas of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in CharRuppur, Char mirkamari and Lakshmikunda village of IshwardiUpzila in Pabna district. Ishwardi (Town) consists of 12 wardsand 37 mahallas. Arsenic was detected in the ADM Lab,Department of Pharmacology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh with Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (HG-AAS; PG- 990, PG Instruments Ltd. UK). Arsenic was detected by forming AsH 3 at below pH 1. 0 after the reaction of As with a solution of sodiumborohydride (NaBH 4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, M= 40, 000 g/mol,) and 10 % HCl. In this test, standard was maintained asAsV ranging from 0 to 12. 5 μg/L. Results: A total of 120 vegetable samples, 15 rice samples and 15 fish samples were collected from five different markets ofthree different villages of Pabna district and were tested forarsenic concentration.

40|$|Since declaring {{independence}} in 1957, the Republic of Ghana {{has become a}} stable constitutional democracy. Ghana’s economy has grown substantially over the past decade, yet remains primarily agrarian, accounting for 50 % of the total employment and 25 % of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Smallholder rain-fed farming using rudimentary technologies dominates the agricultural sector accounting for 80 % of total agricultural production. Approximately 90 % of smallholder farms are less than two hectares in size, and produce a diversity of crops. The major crops cultivated in Ghana include numerous cereal, <b>root</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuber,</b> leguminous, fruit, <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> industrial crops. Maize is the most widely cultivated crop in Ghana, and accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} the daily caloric intake. However, significant yield gaps exist where actual maize yields are 50 to 80 % less than achievable yields. The following document was written after conducting a three month 2012 summer internship in Ghana as an agronomic expert volunteer for the Ghana Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement (ADVANCE) Project. My primary objectives included monitoring ADVANCE crop production demonstration plots and farmers’ fields to diagnose and address crop health issues, with the goal of identifying why smallholders in the north continue to get lower than expected yields even when good agronomic practices (GAPs) are being implemented. Observations indicate GAPs are not being adopted, partly because they are not often being implemented correctly at demonstration plots. The benefits of GAPs can be better realized through improved planning, communication, cooperation and education among all participants. This document is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the Republic of Ghana. Chapter 2 is a brief introduction to agriculture production in Ghana, emphasizing agriculture in the northern savannah and the major challenges facing development in the north. Chapter 3 is a detailed summary of my experience working on the ADVANCE Project. The final chapter discusses how agricultural development—in particular maize productivity—can be improved in the northern savannah of Ghana. Advisor: Gary L. Hei...|$|R

Crop breeding to increase starch yield from cassava and sweetpotato will improve their competitiveness in these markets.
