40|$|The Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} {{caused by the}} earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 {{is believed to be}} the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The Korean government is providing support to Japan and is also trying to protect the people from the hazards of ionizing radiation. To this end, Korean rescuers have been dispatched to the disaster-struck areas to assist in the relief operations. Our institution, National Radiation Emergency Medical Center (NREMC), has been providing medical services to the people returning from the contaminated areas of Japan. The NREMC performs various medical activities in cases of <b>radiological</b> <b>emergencies,</b> including assessment of the absorbed dose in cases of suspected irradiation. Although physical dosimetry, like a personal badge, is routinely used in pre-arranged works in the contaminated areas, most people who were examined in Fukushima did not carry any type of physical dosimeters. Thus, the main issue was to determine whether these people were overexposed to radiation. Cytogenetic biodosimetry is one of the methods that can be used to retrospectively assess the irradiated dose. However, the indications for this approach need to be understood 62 adequately and the results must be interpreted carefully. As a neighboring country, we were highly impacted by the nuclear crisis. However, we can learn from such disasters and prepare ourselves to face such crises in the future. I hope that this article helps people understand the usefulness and limitations of cytogenetic biodosimetry in <b>radiological</b> <b>emergencies...</b>|$|R

At Argonne {{during this period}} of time, she was engaged primarily in applied work. This involved applications of physics in engineering and in specific areas such as radiation safety. In particular, her work included engineering research relative to fossil energy utilization, as well as radioactive waste disposal, technology for arms control verification, and <b>radiological</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness and also chemical warfare agent emergency preparedness.Initially, in 1977, Herzenberg joined a project for developing instrumentation for process control {{for a new generation of}} coal conversion and combustion plants. Development proceeded on non-invasive techniques for measuring the composition and flow rate of coal slurries and pulverized coal in pneumatic transport in pipes. For the analysis of the composition of coal, she worked on the application of neutron-induced gamma spectrometry; while measurement of slurry flow was based on using short lived radioactivity induced in the slurry. She later worked in technology assessment and evaluation of programs in areas that included fossil energy utilization, arms control verification, and radioactive waste disposal. She also worked in emergency preparedness and response for technological hazards, mainly in <b>radiological</b> <b>emergency</b> preparedness for nuclear power plants and emergency preparedness for chemical demilitarization.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of countermeasures against a nuclear accident has been designed {{by means of the}} concept of fuzzy set theory. In most of the existing countermeasure models in actions under <b>radiological</b> <b>emergencies,</b> the large variety of possible features is simplified by a number of rough assumptions. During this simplification procedure, a lot of information is lost which results in much uncertainty concerning the output of the countermeasure model. Furthermore, different assumptions should be used for different sites to consider the site specific conditions. In this study, the diversity of each variable related to protective action has been modelled by the linguistic variable. The effectiveness of sheltering and evacuation has been estimated using the proposed method. The potential advantage of the proposed method is in reducing the loss of information by incorporating the opinions of experts and by introducing the linguistic variables which represent the site specific conditions...|$|R

A database of background MN yields was set up, allowing determination of the dose detection threshold in both scoring modes.

50|$|His {{homemade}} reactor {{never came}} anywhere near reaching critical massâ€”but {{it ended up}} emitting dangerous levels of radiation, likely well over 1,000 times normal background radiation. Alarmed, Hahn began to dismantle his experimentsâ€”but in a chance encounter, police discovered his activities, which triggered a Federal <b>Radiological</b> <b>Emergency</b> Response involving the FBI and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On June 26, 1995 the United States Environmental Protection Agency, having designated Hahn's mother's property a Superfund hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and its contents and buried them as low-level radioactive waste in Utah. Unknown to officials, his mother, fearful that she would lose her house if {{the full extent of}} the radiation were known, had already collected the majority of the radioactive material and thrown it away in the conventional garbage.

40|$|Abstract. Decision-makers {{dealing with}} {{environmental}} issues {{are facing a}} number of serious challenges in situations of emergencies. In the case of extreme weather conditions or <b>radiological</b> <b>emergencies,</b> data sent by monitoring networks need not only to be processed automatically to produce maps but the information provided needs also to allow decision makers to assess associated uncertainties and easily delineate affected areas. Extreme events are furthermore usually characterized by local extreme values and sometimes anisotropies {{that are difficult to}} handle in a statistical point of view, especially at the early stages of an event when only little information is available and the means to contrast real events from technical anomalies are not always obvious. The use of INTAMAP, a web processing service for the automatic interpolation of measured point data, is here discussed from an end-userÂ¿s point of view using some measurements of environmental radioactivity.
