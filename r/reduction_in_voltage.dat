50|$|For {{the case}} of motors driven by Variable Speed Drives, when the input voltage is reduced, {{there will be a}} {{proportionate}} reduction of the output voltage from the VSD and the motor will draw less current and eventually consume less power. However, if the motor is running on high load (>80%), the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> will result in reduced torque and motor will end up drawing more current and power.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have discovered}} that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, {{a significant amount of}} money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to reduce demand. Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand - typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as incandescent lights and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage,</b> because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} {{as far as}} Voltage Optimisation {{is concerned}} is to assume that a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> will result {{in an increase in}} current and therefore constant power. Whilst this is true for certain fixed-power loads, most sites have a diversity of loads that will benefit {{to a greater or lesser}} extent with energy savings aggregating across a site as a whole. The benefit to typical equipment at three phase sites is discussed below.|$|E

5000|$|Reduce CPU {{supply voltage}} ("undervolting"). Many of today's CPUs can run stably at their stock speed, or {{even with a}} slight overclock, at a reduced voltage, which reduces heat output. Power {{consumption}} is approximately proportional to V2·f, that is, it varies linearly with the clock frequency and quadratically with the voltage. This means that even a small <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> can have a large effect in power consumption. Undervolting and underclocking {{can also be used}} with chipsets and GPUs.|$|E
50|$|The {{heat output}} of any {{resistance}} device, {{such as an}} electric space heater, {{is equal to the}} true power consumption, which is an increasing function of the applied voltage. If the resistance stays constant, power consumption is proportional to the square of the applied voltage. Therefore, a significant reduction of heat output will occur with a relatively small <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage.</b> An incandescent lamp will dim due to lower heat creation in the filament, as well as lower conversion of heat to light. Generally speaking, no damage will occur but functionality will be impaired.|$|E
50|$|Most solar cells, {{which are}} quite large {{compared}} to conventional diodes, well approximate an infinite plane and will usually exhibit near-ideal behavior under Standard Test Condition (n ≈ 1). Under certain operating conditions, however, device operation may {{be dominated by}} recombination in the space-charge region. This {{is characterized by a}} significant increase in I0 as well as an increase in ideality factor to n ≈ 2. The latter tends to increase solar cell output voltage while the former acts to erode it. The net effect, therefore, is a combination of the increase in voltage shown for increasing n in the figure to the right and the decrease in voltage shown for increasing I0 in the figure above. Typically, I0 is the more significant factor and the result is a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Power dips are <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{mostly of}} short {{duration}} (<300 ms) but sometimes longer. They may cause {{a number of}} problems with equipment, for example contactors and relays may drop out causing machinery to stop. There are a number of low voltage ride through techniques including Uninterruptible Power Supplies, the use of capacitors on low voltage DC control circuits, the use of capacitors on the DC bus of Variable Speed Drives. Care must be taken that Voltage Optimisation measures do not reduce the voltage to an extent that equipment is more vulnerable to power dips.|$|R

50|$|Voltage {{optimisation}} {{is a term}} {{given to}} the systematic controlled <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the <b>voltages</b> received by an energy consumer to reduce energy use, power demand and reactive power demand. While some voltage 'optimisation' devices have a fixed voltage adjustment, others electronically regulate the voltage automatically.|$|R
50|$|The {{higher the}} voltage {{the higher the}} power {{consumption}} {{in the case of}} a pure resistance load. A <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> does not affect the energy used by the domestic appliances which use resistive loads except in devices such as kettles and toasters which will take longer to do their job due to atmospheric losses. The main commercial benefit when installing VO units, is on inductive loads, like motors which run pumps, fans and the like. In the home, the potential energy saving can be up to 12% on electricity bills. A VO device will lower the voltage to the most efficient level to maximise the savings on electricity consumption, so you may notice certain things taking a little longer, such as a kettle may take a little longer to boil.|$|E
50|$|In a {{switching}} subcircuit, switching noise must be suppressed. When a load {{is applied}} to a voltage source, it draws {{a certain amount of}} current. Typical power supply lines show inherent inductance, which results in a slower response to change in current. This in turn affects the transient voltage levels, since if the load current is zero the voltage across the load is zero as well. This sudden voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output capacitors of the power supply. This is only temporary; the inductor ultimately saturates (that is the magnetic field around the conductor reaches its max), the voltage drop across the inductor reaches zero, and the supply voltage comes back to normal. But even a temporary <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> can disturb adjacent subcircuits. Decoupling caps provide instantaneous current jolt which helps maintain constant voltage across a subcircuit (or provide a low impedance path for the transient currents; different descriptions are used by different industries).|$|E

The overline line voltage was changed from 2,200 Volts DC to the more common 1,500 Volts DC and automatic block signalling was installed. Work to modernise the infrastructure and implement the voltage change took place throughout 1984 and 1985. The St. Cergue-La Cure section was changed to the new, reduced voltage in mid-October 1985 and the Nyon-St. Cergue section followed on 5 December 1985. [...] As part of this modernisation, new rolling stock was purchased, and arrived starting in autumn 1985. These were new automotrice (powered driving railcars) and matching voitures pilote (driving trailers). During the transitional phase in the line voltage, the old cars were able to continue in service after the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage,</b> but at reduced speed.

30|$|In this work, the seeding {{of metal}} {{nanoparticles}} {{was shown to}} reduce the voltage required to initiate breakdown in an air DC microdischarge. <b>Reductions</b> <b>in</b> the breakdown <b>voltage</b> were seen to {{be as high as}} 25 % for a PD scaling of 40  Torr-cm. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging of the discharge region revealed that the breakdown process was enhanced by a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the required <b>voltage</b> from nanoparticle seeding, and then heating from the discharge led to ignition of some of the nanoparticles as they flowed through the discharge region. The use of SEM imaging gave detailed information regarding the particle size, shape, and oxidation distributions. Further use of ex situ diagnostic techniques, such as SEM analyses, could allow for the development of empirical correlations between particle characteristics and <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> the breakdown <b>voltage.</b> Visual evidence of particle charging being the most likely mechanism for breakdown voltage reduction and subsequent reduction of the effective distance between the electrodes has been presented.|$|R
50|$|Titanium diboride is {{a popular}} {{material}} for handling molten aluminum due to its electrical conductivity, refractory properties, {{and its ability to}} wet with molten aluminum providing a superior electrical interface while not contaminating the aluminum with boron or titanium. TiB2 {{has been used as a}} drained cathode in the electroreduction of molten Al(III). In drained-cathode processes, aluminum can be produced with an electrode gap of only 0.25m with an accompanying reduction in required voltage. However, implementation of such technology still faces hurdles: with a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage,</b> there is a concomitant reduction in heat generation and better insulation at the top of the reactor is required. In addition to improved insulation, the technology requires better bonding methods between TiB2 and the bulk graphite electrode substrate. Bonding tiles of TiB2 or applying composite coatings each present their own unique challenges, with the high cost and large TiB2 capital cost of the former and the design difficulty of the latter. Composite materials must have each component degrade at the same rate, or the wettability and thermal conductivity of the surface will be lost with active material still remaining deeper within the electrode plate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high voltage}} {{terminal}} of the coil was attached through a wire to {{various types of}} handheld electrode which the physician used to apply the high voltage to the patient's body. The treatment was not painful for the patient, because alternating current in the radio frequency (RF) range, above 10 kHz in frequency, does not generally cause the sensation of electric shock. The Oudin coil was a [...] "unipolar" [...] generator, with {{the lower end of}} the coil grounded, so sometimes only one electrode was applied to the patient and the return path for the currents was through the ground. However usually a ground wire from the bottom of the coil was used; attached to a ground electrode which the patient held. A drawback of the Oudin coil was that movement of the electrode and wire during use changed the capacitance of the top terminal of the secondary coil, and thus its resonant frequency. [...] This threw the secondary coil out of resonance with the primary, causing a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage.</b> So the tap point on the primary coil had to be constantly adjusted during use to keep the primary and secondary in [...] "tune" [...] (seen in left image above).|$|E
5000|$|The {{conceptual}} {{model of the}} buck converter is best {{understood in terms of}} the relation between current and voltage of the inductor. Beginning with the switch open (off-state), the current in the circuit is zero. When the switch is first closed (on-state), the current will begin to increase, and the inductor will produce an opposing voltage across its terminals in response to the changing current. This voltage drop counteracts the voltage of the source and therefore reduces the net voltage across the load. Over time, the rate of change of current decreases, and the voltage across the inductor also then decreases, increasing the voltage at the load. During this time, the inductor stores energy {{in the form of a}} magnetic field. If the switch is opened while the current is still changing, then there will always be a voltage drop across the inductor, so the net voltage at the load will always be less than the input voltage source. When the switch is opened again (off-state), the voltage source will be removed from the circuit, and the current will decrease. The decreasing current will produce a voltage drop across the inductor (opposite to the drop at on-state), and now the inductor becomes a Current Source. The stored energy in the inductor's magnetic field supports the current flow through the load. This current, flowing while the input voltage source is disconnected, when concatenated with the current flowing during on-state, totals to current greater than the average input current (being zero during off-state). The [...] "increase" [...] in average current makes up for the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage,</b> and ideally preserves the power provided to the load. During the off-state, the inductor is discharging its stored energy into the rest of the circuit. If the switch is closed again before the inductor fully discharges (on-state), the voltage at the load will always be greater than zero.|$|E

40|$|Exponential {{growth in}} the number of on-chip transistors, coupled with <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>voltage</b> levels, makes each {{generation}} of microprocessors increasingly vulnerable to transient faults. In a multithreaded environment, we can detect these faults by running two copies of the same program as separate threads, feeding them identical inputs, and comparing their outputs, a technique we call Redundant Multithreading (RMT). This paper studies RMT techniques in the context of both singleand dual-processor simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) single-chip devices. Using a detailed, commercial-grade, SMT processor design we uncover subtle RMT implementation complexities, and find that RMT can be a more significant burden for singleprocessor devices than prior studies indicate.
