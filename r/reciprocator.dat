40|$|Strong {{reciprocity}} {{refers to}} the willingness to sacrifice one's own material selfinterest to punish others for opportunistic actions. This propensity provides a decentralized mechanism for the enforcement of social norms, but its extent and persistence poses a theoretical puzzle. Since opportunistic individuals choose optimally to comply with or violate norms based on the likelihood and severity of sanctioning they anticipate, such individuals will always outperform <b>reciprocators</b> within any group. The presence of <b>reciprocators</b> in a group can, however, alter the behavior of opportunists {{in such a manner}} as to benefit all members of the group (including <b>reciprocators).</b> We show that under these circumstances, <b>reciprocators</b> can invade a population of opportunists when groups dissolve and are formed anew according to a process of purely random (non-assortative) matching. Furthermore, even when these conditions are not satisfied (so that an opportunistic population is stable) there may exist additional stable population states in which <b>reciprocators</b> are present...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Strong <b>reciprocators</b> possess two {{behavioural}} dispositions: {{they are}} willing to bestow bene ts on those who have bestowed bene ts, and {{they are willing}} to punish those who fail to bestow bene ts according to some social norm. There is no doubt that peoples' behaviour, in many cases, agrees with what we would expect if people are strong <b>reciprocators,</b> and Fehr and Henrich argue that many people are, in fact, strong <b>reciprocators.</b> They also suggest that strongly reciprocal behaviour may be brought about by specialised cognitive architecture produced by evolution. I argue that specialised cognitive architecture can {{play a role in the}} production of strongly reciprocal behaviour only in a very attenuated sense, and that the evolutionary foundations of strong reciprocity are more likely cultural than biological...|$|R

We show that these problems can be addressed econometrically, by estimating a finite mixture model to isolate types, incorporating double censoring and a tremble term. Most subjects act selfishly, but a substantial proportion are reciprocal with altruism playing only a marginal role.

50|$|This said, {{reciprocation}} {{in personal}} relationships rarely follows a mathematical formula {{and the level}} of reciprocation, i.e. the give and take, will vary depending on the personalities involved, and situational factors such as which party has more control, persuasive power or influence. It is often the case that one party will typically be the lead <b>reciprocator</b> with the other being the responsive <b>reciprocator.</b> The form of reciprocation can also be influenced by the level of emotional need. Sometimes one party will need more support than the other and this can switch at different times depending on the life situation of each party. Because reciprocation is influenced by personal circumstances and since people do not follow a set pattern like robots, reciprocation from a friend to a friend for example will vary in intensity and an absolutely consistent pattern cannot be expected. If for example a person has a large inner circle of friendships with reciprocation as the key element of friendship, then the level of reciprocation within the inner circle will influence the depth of a friendship therein. Reciprocation can be responsive or initiative. It is also a fundamental principle in parenting, a successful work place, religion and karma.|$|E

50|$|Social {{behavior}} and cooperation with other participants are two {{factors that are}} not modeled in traditional game theory, but are often seen in an experimental setting. The evolution of social norms has been neglected in decision-making models, but these norms influence {{the ways in which}} real people interact with one another and make choices. One tendency is for a person to be a strong <b>reciprocator.</b> This type of person enters a game with the predisposition to cooperate with other players. They will increase their cooperation levels in response to cooperation from other players and decrease their cooperation levels, even at their own expense, to punish players who do not cooperate. This is not utility-maximizing behavior, as a strong <b>reciprocator</b> is willing to reduce their payoff in order to encourage cooperation from others. Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) developed a model based on reciprocity called the sequential reciprocity equilibrium. This model adapts traditional game theory logic to the idea that players reciprocate actions in order to cooperate. The model had been used to more accurately predict experimental outcomes of classic games such as the prisoner's dilemma and the centipede game. Rabin (1993) also created a fairness equilibrium that measures altruism's effect on choices. He found that when a player is altruistic to another player the second player is more likely to reciprocate that altruism. This is due to the idea of fairness. Fairness equilibriums take the form of mutual maximum, where both players choose an outcome that benefits both of them the most, or mutual minimum, where both players choose an outcome that hurts both of them the most. These equilibriums are also Nash equilibriums, but they incorporate the willingness of participants to cooperate and play fair.|$|E

40|$|We use a novel {{experimental}} design {{to examine the}} role of reputational concerns in explaining conditional cooperation in social dilemmas. By using the strategy method in a repeated sequential prisoners’ dilemma in which the probabilistic end is known, we can distinguish between strategically and non-strategically motivated cooperation.

In contrast, strategically motivated second movers conditionally cooperate only if the game continues and they otherwise defect. Experimental results, with two different subject pools, indicate reputation building is used around 30 % of the time, which accounts for between 50 % and 75 % of all realized cooperative actions.

40|$|Direct {{reciprocity}} is {{a mechanism}} {{for the evolution of}} cooperation based on the idea of repeated encounters between the same two individuals. Here we examine direct reciprocity in structured populations, where individuals occupy the vertices of a graph. The edges denote who interacts with whom.

For birth–death or pairwise comparison updating, we find that evolutionary stability of direct reciprocity is more restrictive on a graph than in a well-mixed population, but the condition for <b>reciprocators</b> to be advantageous is less restrictive on a graph. For death–birth and imitation updating, in contrast, both conditions are easier to fulfill on a graph. Moreover, for all four update mechanisms, <b>reciprocators</b> can dominate defectors on a graph, which is never possible in a well-mixed population. We also study the effect of an error rate, which increases with the number of links per individual; interacting with more people simultaneously enhances the probability of making mistakes.

5000|$|Since Mauss {{discussed}} {{the ability of}} gifts to drive giving, receiving, and reciprocating gifting as animating objects through {{a piece of the}} giver going with the property, the spirit of the gift has been a subject of scholarship.

Because of the “thing itself possesses a soul” for the Māori, and for Mauss’s theory of the gift “to make a gift of something to someone is to make a present of some part of oneself” and “to accept something from somebody is to accept some part of his spiritual essence, of his soul.” [...] More simply put, receiving a gift carries with it an obligation to receive and to reciprocate, and the gift itself drives this system of exchange.

40|$|An oft-cited {{and robust}} result from Public Goods Game {{experiments}} is that, when subjects start playing, the aggregate level of contributions is {{significantly different from}} zero.

However, at the theoretical level, economists would prefer to account for motivational heterogeneity endogenously, instead of simply assuming it from the outset. Our work provides such endogenisation, by assuming that social evolution is driven by material payoffs only. By separately focusing on different types of ‘experimentally salient’ pro-social players (such as <b>Reciprocators,</b> Strong <b>Reciprocators</b> and Altruists), we are able to shed light – to our knowledge, for the first time, within the public good framework – on the evolutionary stability of two-type populations consisting of positive proportions of both ‘nice’ and ‘mean’ guys.

40|$|Cooperation is {{fundamental}} to human societies, {{and one of the}} important paths for its emergence and maintenance is reciprocity. In prisoner's dilemma (PD) experiments, reciprocal strategies are often effective at attaining and maintaining high cooperation. In many public goods (PG) games or n-person PD experiments, however, reciprocal strategies are not successful at engendering cooperation. In the present paper, we attribute this difficulty to a coordination problem against free riding among reciprocators: Because it is difficult for the <b>reciprocators</b> to coordinate their behaviors against free riders, this may lead to inequality among players, which will demotivate them from cooperating in future rounds. We propose a new mechanism, institutionalized reciprocity (IR), which refers to embedding the reciprocal strategy as an institution (i. e., institutionalizing the reciprocal strategy). We experimentally demonstrate that IR can prevent groups of <b>reciprocators</b> from falling into coordination failure and achieve high cooperation in PG games. In conclusion, we argue that a natural extension of the present study will be to investigate the possibility of IR to serve as a collective punishment system...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{behavior}} in experimental public goods games {{is fundamental to}} the work of environmental, behavioral, institutional and policy-oriented economists. Although much research has been devoted to explaining the dynamics of such experiments, the conclusions drawn to date are contradictory. Through the use of a novel experimental design, a theoretical model of behavior, and appropriate econometric methods, we address weaknesses in the current literature and resolve much of the conflicting claims about motives in public goods experiments. Our analysis demonstrates that herders and strong <b>reciprocators</b> are the main contributors to the public good, whereas the role of interdependent utility and warm-glow altruism is weak at best. Further, the oft-observed decay in contributions over rounds is driven by the revocation of cooperation by disappointed strong <b>reciprocators</b> coupled with the herding behavior of confused subjects.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 75). Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) {{have been}} studied as {{an important aspect of}} performance in the workplace, in part, because they positively contribute to productivity. These behaviors are often identified as discretionary, and are generally less likely to be measured in terms of performance or rewarded in terms of promotions or monetary rewards. The most commonly studied form of OCB is helping behavior. Past research has examined individual characteristics and organizational variables predicting who is likely to perform helping behaviors; however, little research has examined variables predicting the reciprocation of helping behaviors in an organizational context, especially between two individual parties. This study is {{based on the idea that}} the decision to reciprocate helping behaviors is one that will vary based on social exchange theory. Furthermore, it specifically examines the characteristics of certain episodes and the actors involved that may substitute or enhance the effects of being in a social exchange relationship. Specifically, the present study explored the following moderators of the effects of social exchange on employees' decisions to reciprocate helping: (1) individual characteristics of the potential <b>reciprocator</b> (including conscientiousness, capability, and the belief in the norm of reciprocity), (2) individual characteristics of the target of reciprocation (including general helpfulness, likeability, and capability), (3) characteristics of the relationship between parties involved (the quality of the social exchange relationship and balance of the exchange relationship at the time of helping), and (4) characteristics of the help received (including the degree to which the help was helpful and the degree to which the help was difficult to perform). The sample for this study consisted of 346 employees recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk service (MTurk) and 217 student employees. Participants responded to a survey with measures of all of the variables of interest. Correlations, hierarchical multiple regression, and moderated multiple regression analyses were performed to test the hypotheses. The results showed strong support for a positive relationship between the quality of one's social exchange relationship with a coworker and the likeliness to reciprocate helping to that coworker. However, there was no evidence that the balance of one's social exchange relationship was related to helping reciprocation. Additionally, there was no evidence of moderation effects for the characteristics of the potential <b>reciprocator,</b> the target for reciprocation, or the help itself. Instead, some of the variables investigated functioned as direct predictors for helping reciprocation, beyond the effects of the quality of social exchange relationship, while some had no relationship to helping reciprocation at all. The strongest effects were found for conscientiousness of the potential <b>reciprocator</b> and the degree to which the potential <b>reciprocator</b> perceived the help he/she received as helpful. The characteristics of the target of reciprocation were not as important in one's decision to reciprocate helping. Although the moderation hypotheses were not supported, the findings for the direct effects on helping reciprocation contribute to the OCB and social exchange research in the context of employee-employee relationships.

40|$|Indirect {{reciprocity}} {{is a key}} {{mechanism for}} the evolution of human cooperation. Previous studies explored indirect reciprocity in the so-called donation game, a special class of Prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s Dilemma (PD) with unilateral decision making. A more general class of social dilemmas includes Snowdrift (SG), Stag Hunt (SH), and PD games, where two players perform actions simultaneously. In these simultaneous-move games, moral assessments need to be more complex; for example, how should we evaluate defection against an ill-reputed, but now cooperative, player? We examined indirect reciprocity in the three social dilemmas and identified twelve successful social norms for moral assessments. These successful norms have different principles in different dilemmas for suppressing cheaters. To suppress defectors, any defection against good players is prohibited in SG and PD, whereas defection against good players may be allowed in SH. To suppress unconditional cooperators, who help anyone and thereby indirectly contribute to jeopardizing indirect reciprocity, we found two mechanisms: indiscrimination between actions toward bad players (feasible in SG and PD) or punishment for cooperation with bad players (effective in any social dilemma). Moreover, we discovered that social norms that unfairly favor <b>reciprocators</b> enhance robustness of cooperation in SH, whereby <b>reciprocators</b> never lose their good reputation...|$|R
40|$|How do human groups {{maintain}} {{a high level}} of cooperation despite a low level of genetic relatedness among group members? We suggest that many humans have a predisposition to punish those who violate group-beneficial norms, even when this imposes a fitness cost on the punisher. Such altruistic punishment is widely observed to sustain high levels of cooperation in behavioral experiments and in natural settings. We offer a model of cooperation and punishment that we call strong reciprocity: where members of a group benefit from mutual adherence to a social norm, strong <b>reciprocators</b> obey the norm and punish its violators, even though as a result they receive lower payoffs than other group members, such as selfish agents who violate the norm and do not punish, and pure cooperators who adhere to the norm but free-ride by never punishing. Our agent-based simulations show that, under assumptions approximating likely human environments over the 100, 000 years prior to the domestication of animals and plants, the proliferation of strong <b>reciprocators</b> when initially rare is highly likely, and that substantial frequencies of all three behavioral types can be sustained in a population. As a result, high levels of cooperation are sustained. OUr results do not require that group members be related or that group extinctions occur...|$|R
