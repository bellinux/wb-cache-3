40|$|International audienceThe {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} self-deployable structure with flexible joints is presented in this paper. Joints store elastic energy in the folded, prestressed position and allow deployment until they are stopped by tendons. A study on a wire <b>rope</b> <b>joint</b> is first presented to determine its mechanical behavior with experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches. An analysis is then performed on a bidimensional structure to propose the specific modeling of introducing prestress to the joints. The method is applied to a spatial system in an analysis that uses static equilibrium and kinematic deployment simulations. The results show good concordance among the different approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of diamond wire saw upon ex plo i tation {{of natural stone}} depends on the right choice of the const ructional and technological fac¬tors of the machine, diamond wire and conditions, and way of explora¬tion in the particular kind of the rock. One of these parameters is the steel rope of diamond wire. A long-standing work on testing and certifying of hoisting ropes, experience and knowledge acquired upon these testings, aroused us to a detailed analysis and testing of the ropes which are used in diamond wire shaping. The paper {{presents the results of}} testings of steel ropes of diamond wire and the testings of <b>rope</b> <b>joints</b> i. e. tensile strength which can resist the <b>joints</b> between separate <b>rope</b> sections. The suggested idea regarding construction desings of steel rope of diamond wire, which is used in natural carbonate stone exploitation, is based on this experimen¬tal testing of steel ropes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{the problem of}} <b>ropes</b> <b>joints</b> for {{forestry}} aerial ropeway plants has been studied. The existing legislation defines in way uniform the design criterions related to the ropes in the ropeway sector. Such norm covers all the aspects related to this matter, from the criterions of sizing, to the specifications related to the top connection and to the rope splice, to the check methods and the cut off criterions. Indeed in this study a procedure it {{has been set up}} that allows with a simple algorithm to reach the formulation of the bending maximum stress rising in the joints muffs for line of the ropeway plants. In fact considering the different lines has been possible to obtain four differential equations, with second order, non homogeneous, that have been integrated with the method of the variation of the constants. For them the constants of integration have been determined calculating in correspondence of every section of transition, the deflections and the rotations of the lines that meet in it. In such way making some positions it is possible to obtain a correct formula for this case considered. Such formula is nevertheless interesting because its structure recalls that simpler and summary of Isaachsen and therefore easy results the comparison with it. By mean the computational program FEMLAB has been possible to verify the stress course inside the rope...|$|R

It take magnetizing and receiving sensor in integrated intensive arrangement, adopt mining intrinsic safe single box-type structure, the temperature is adaptive, free maintenance and avoid debugging. The master control board has two kinds of media communication interface; the transmission distance can be 20 km. This system has self-check, parameter setting, data analysis and inquires, report printing, and other functions. Field application show that the system realized high speed, online testing and accurate positioning in steel cord rusting in belt, <b>rope</b> breaking, <b>joint</b> twitch, shifting, zinc coating aging etc. conditions, the judge accuracy rate is more than 99. 9 percent...|$|R
40|$|A {{carbon fiber}} rope thermal barrier is being {{evaluated}} {{as a replacement}} for the conventional room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) thermal barrier that is currently used to protect o-rings in Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) nozzle joints. Performance requirements include its ability to cool any incoming, hot propellant gases that fill and pressurize the nozzle joints, filter slag and particulates, and to perform adequately in various joint assembly conditions as well as dynamic flight motion. Modified National Aeronautics and Space Administration (MNASA) motors, with their inherent and unique ability to replicate select RSRM internal environment features, were an integral step in the development path leading to full scale RSRM static test demonstration of the carbon fiber <b>rope</b> (CFR) <b>joint</b> concept. These 1 / 4 scale RSRM motors serve {{to bridge the gap between}} the other classes of subscale test motors (extremely small and moderate duration, or small scale and short duration) and the critical asset RSRM static test motors. A series of MNASA tests have been used to demonstrate carbon fiber rope performance and have provided rationale for implementation into a full-scale static motor and flight qualification...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with strength analysis of multi-clip joints. Such structures enable visible growth of the carrying capacity and make them elements easily assembled by the clamping jaws and a single-clamp press. Each joint exerts an appreciable in uence upon the safety level of the whole structure. A numerical analysis was performed to assess the eect of clearance between a sleeve and <b>rope</b> upon the <b>joint</b> quality. Phenome-na emerging in the area between the clips were analysed as well. Some strength tests related {{to the process of}} drawing the wire rope out of the sleeve were also investigated. Changes in the stiness of the clamping sleeve were analysed in view of the in uence of the aforementioned fac-tors upon the carrying capacity of joints and the sleeve material eort. Experimental investigations were conducted as well aiming at the deter-mination of the smallest possible number of clips or the eective length of joints necessary for carrying the loads higher than the admissible load of the wire rope...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for enhancing the positive moment capacity of the mid-span areas of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement under monotonic increasing loads. However under seismic actions, the support regions of beams may also require retrofitting. In such cases, retrofitting should be effective under reversed cyclic flexural actions. According to the best knowledge of authors, there is no study investigating this important issue in the literature. Therefore, the present study focuses on retrofitting of beam support regions under reversed cyclic flexural moments. As the initial stage of a more comprehensive testing program, three full-scale RC beam-column-slab sub-assemblages were tested. The sub-assemblages also included a part of transverse beams perpendicular to the main beam tested. One specimen was tested as a reference specimen while the remaining two specimens were tested after being retrofitted with near surface mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) ropes with two different details in terms of anchorage of the CFRP <b>ropes</b> into <b>joint</b> region. The anchorage of CFRP ropes was provided by NSM application over the slab next to the column in one of the specimens, while CFRP rope was anchored by epoxy adhesive within the joint core by embedding it through a drilled hole on the column in other specimen. The effectiveness of the proposed anchoring methods was investigated through experimentally. The findings of the study indicated that the specimen retrofitted with NSM anchoring method achieved a remarkable enhancement in flexural capacity, whereas, anchoring through embedment of the CFRP rope within the epoxied drilled hole was not that successful...|$|R
