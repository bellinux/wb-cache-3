5000|$|Some fretted {{instruments}} have a compensated nut. This type of nut provides better intonation {{across the}} instrument. The principle: given that strings are different thicknesses and have different tensions, the temperament of each fret is not 100% accurate for an equal temperament instrument. This is especially evident {{on the first}} few frets of an electric guitar. Many guitar players notice how 'open position' chords (Such as E, A, C, D and G) never sound in tune with each other. A compensated nut aims to correct this, by staggering the starting position of each string according to thickness. While not a complete solution such as a true temperament fretboard, there is a noticeable difference in tuning within chords. Many guitar companies, such as Music Man, and ESP include compensated nuts as standard on most of their instruments, and companies such as Earvana provide <b>retrofittable</b> types.|$|E
50|$|Carbon-neutral fuels {{might lead}} to {{greenhouse}} gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere.

This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50% if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants. Most coal and natural gas power plants have been predicted to be economically <b>retrofittable</b> with carbon dioxide scrubbers for carbon capture to recycle flue exhaust or for carbon sequestration. Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess economic impacts of climate change if it were not done, but also to pay for itself as global fuel demand growth and peak oil shortages increase the price of petroleum and fungible natural gas.|$|E

40|$|A capture {{option is}} an option {{contract}} where the option holder can exercise a contract to retrofit an existing fossil fuel plant to capture carbon dioxide (rm CO 2) on or before a fixed date. We suggest that new thermal power plants, particularly those in developing countries, consider issuing capture options at the design stage, because the sellers—the owners of newly built thermal power plants—may then invest in making these plants rm CO 2 capture ready (CCR) to optimise returns from selling capture options. In a detailed case study on a 600  MW ultrasupercritical pulverised coal-fired power unit a potential storage site in Guangdong, China, {{the value of a}} capture option and CCR investment is evaluated using the backward deduction option pricing method through a stochastic cash flow model with Monte-Carlo simulations. If the power plant is <b>retrofittable</b> without CCR investment, then for an 8 % discount rate the value of a capture option is US  11  million before CCR investment. Investing US  3. 8  million in CCR increases the value of the capture option by an estimated US  12  million. Perhaps more important from a policy point of view, CCR investment can reduce the odds of early closure by 20 % and also increase the chance of retrofitting to capture by 43 %. If the power plant is not <b>retrofittable</b> in the absence of CCR design modifications, CCR investment to avoid ‘carbon lock-in’ is not only important for climate policy but is also economic from an investment point of view. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on a range of key assumptions to test the robustness of the findings. ...|$|E

Presence sensors, which are widely deployed in modern buildings, attempt to regulate lighting to the presence of people in indoor spaces.

In this paper, we provide an initial investigation on detecting indoor activities by using simple sensors (infrared, pressure and acoustic) deliberately avoiding the use of rich sensors such as cameras. The sensors are low-cost, wireless, and <b>retrofittable</b> in existing structures. Our prototype is able to recognize five activities (working at a desk with or without a PC, having a meeting, and the presence/absence in the office) with accuracy of almost 95 %, while unaffecting user’s behavior and comfort. ...|$|E

40|$|Terahertz time-domain {{spectroscopy}} (THz-TDS) is able {{to extract}} optical or dielectric properties of materials, whether in the solid, liquid, or gas phase, in the T-ray frequency region. Spectroscopy of a liquid or gas often requires a receptacle to confine the sample. In order to allow T-rays to probe the sample effectively, the receptacle must have T-ray transparent windows. However, even though windows are transparent to T-rays, attenuation exists, because of multiple reflections at air-window and window-air interfaces, which accounts for a major energy loss. Due to the recent emergence of T-ray technology, there has been very little work carried out to-date on the reduction of reflection losses. This paper analyses the reduction of T-ray reflection loss {{by means of an}} antireflection coating. Because T-ray wavelengths are much larger than visible wavelengths, the antireflection layer thickness for T-rays is much larger than the usual optical case. This creates an interesting opportunity for <b>retrofittable</b> antireflection layers in T-ray systems.

For this reason, we recently presented a simple and <b>retrofittable</b> modification to the two-photon laser-scanning microscope which extends the depth of field {{through the use of}} an axicon (conical lens). Here we demonstrate three significant benefits of this technique using biological samples commonly employed in the field of neuroscience. First, we use a sample of neurons grown in culture and move it along the z-axis, showing that a more stable focus is achieved without compromise on transverse resolution. Second, we monitor 3 D population dynamics in an acute slice of live mouse cortex, demonstrating that faster volumetric scans can be conducted. Third, we acquire a stereoscopic image of neurons and their dendrites in a fixed sample of mouse cortex, using only two scans instead of the complete stack and calculations required by standard systems.

40|$|Laser welded {{aluminum}} {{fillet welds}} increase stability and decrease {{weight in the}} automotive body construction and are therefore often used for car body parts. Tactile guided laser welding optics with active position control enable automatic compensation for component tolerances. This allows efficient laser beam welding of those aluminum fillet welds in high-volume manufacturing. Despite {{the high degree of}} automation in this process unacceptable seam faults can not be completely excluded. It is still necessary to check all welded seams. A preferred solution would be to have a <b>retrofittable,</b> fully automated solution for the quality control, that does not extend the current production cycle time. This would lead to a higher quality as well as cost reductions. Existing systems are not suitable for the quality control of aluminum fillet welds and provide the user only with little information about the cause of imperfections. This thesis develops a camera based quality control system using an additional, high power, monochromatic illumination. The seam imperfections of the welding process are thereby detected in real time via an image based analysis.

Pre- and post test inspections employing electron microscope scans, x-ray fluorescence, grid mass loss measurements, and measurements of grid aperture diameters and thicknesses revealed an extraordinary low degree of erosion. No reduction in grid thicknesses was detectable within {{the margin of}} error of the measurements. Mass losses for the grids were on tbe order of 0. 1 gm to 0. 25 gm for the decelerator and accelerator grids, respectively and were attributed to an enlargement of grid apertures of 60 to 70 /l m for the accelerator grids. Grid perveance measurements were performed for two grid sets at various grid gap settings. Perveances obtained for carbon-carbon were slightly lower than those found for molybdenum grids which was attributed to a larger grid thickness of the carbon-carbon accelerator and decelerator grids. New, advanced carbon-carbon panels were fabricated with fiber volume fractions of up to 57 % and flexural moduli approaching the value for molybdenum, making these grid panels some of the strongest carbon-carbon material ever made.

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} in information protection {{is how to}} preserve the confidentiality of sensitive information under spyware surveillance. This problem has not been well addressed by the existing access-control mechanisms which cannot prevent the spyware already in a system from monitoring an authorized party’s interactions with sensitive data. Our answer to this challenge is PRECIP, a new security policy model which takes a first step towards practical and <b>retrofittable</b> confidential information protection. This model is designed to offer efficient online protection for commercial applications and operating systems. It intends to be retrofitted to these applications and systems without modifying their code. To this end, PRECIP addresses several practical issues critical to containing spyware surveillance, which however are not well handled by the previous work in access control and information-flow security. Examples include the models for human input devices such as keyboard whose sensitivity level must be dynamically determined, other shared resources such as clipboard and screen which must be accessed by different processes, and the multitasked processes which work on public and sensitive data concurrently. We applied PRECIP to Windows XP to protect the applications for editing or viewing sensitive documents and browsing sensitive websites.

The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate improvements in fuel management and design of water reactors (PWRs) that could potentially increase the utilization of natural uranium resources in a once-through fuel cycle (i. e., without using spent fuel reprocessing and recycle). For the present study, potential improvements were limited to <b>retrofittable</b> concepts, i. e., those which could be modifications to the reactor system or balance of plant. The potential improvements considered were not necessarily restricted to those which might be economical under current uranium ore prices or to those which might be acceptable to the nuclear industry at the present time. A six-month fuel cycle, for example, although technically possible, would be neither economical nor accept able to the industry at the present time.

30|$|The {{survey results}} show the {{potential}} of the proposed 3 D visualization method for assessing the as-is building conditions as an intuitive communication tool. Since the main purpose of the proposed method is to provide guidance for making efficient and effective energy retrofit decisions by diagnosing and visualizing the as-is building conditions, the proposed method only needs to be conducted once per regular building diagnostic process (e.g., annual building inspection) and {{does not need to be}} performed more frequently. Hence, it does not add significant burden to the building practitioners, and allows the proposed method to be repeatable in parallel with thermographic inspection. The proposed method can inspect very small surfaces with potential performance problems (in fact, at the vertex-level of a mesh). This level of granularity, for example, would be helpful when installing blown-in loose-fill insulation is considered as one of the retrofit alternatives to improve the thermal resistance of the defected areas. However, if the detected areas are too small, retrofitting such problems is not likely to be practically feasible due to technical challenges and long payback period. Thus, practical retrofit decisions need to be taken up to a certain minimum size of retroffitable surface. The proposed method chooses not to dictate the minimum size of the <b>retrofittable</b> building area. Rather, by presenting the measurements at the point-level, the proposed method lets the building practitioners set their desired value prior to assessing different energy efficiency retrofit alternatives.|$|E

This thesis outlines a feasible design for a <b>retrofittable</b> motorized module for a hand-powered tricycle produced and widely distributed throughout Kenya. There are many mobility aids {{that are similar to}} the Kenyan handcycle, which can also adapt the module design.

This work will be presented to a wheelchair workshop summer 2008 in hopes to convert it into a feasible design for production. Increased reliable mobility will allow the disabled community in Kenya to apply for jobs, and even be afforded opportunities in micro-business for the first time. The design of the powertrain consists of a common motorized bicycle 2 hp engine and a two-stage gear reduction. The control system uses an analogous setup to that of a motorcycle.

40|$|For {{the past}} decades {{concerns}} over the effect of aviation on the local air quality have risen, with mitigation remaining a priority for industry. To meet the CO 2 reduction goal of 75 % compared to 2005 levels, set out by the European Commission report 'Flightpath 2050 ', more assessment on future aircraft technologies and their potential in meeting these goals is needed. Analysis of these technologies requires increased amount of disciplines {{being involved in the}} conceptual design stage through the use of physics-based methods. With the amount of computational budget and knowledge needed by specialists during this stage increasing, methods for effective management is needed. Multidisciplinary collaborative design aims at reducing the analysis burden placed on engineers by distributing computational load among numerous involved parties. Collaboration comes with technical and non-technical issues. Work at DLR {{in the last few years}} has focused on tackling some of these issues with the development of the Remote Component Environment (RCE), an integration framework, and the Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Scheme (CPACS). From projects, such as "VAMP", it has been shown that issues in effective communication between teams of experts with different specialists still exist in large collaborative design projects. Identifying common knowledge among the involved specialists, such as inter-disciplinary correlations, has shown to assist in this effective communication. In this project a visualisation tool has been developed in order to easily identify and present these correlations. This is accomplished through the use of Response Surface Modeling techniques in order to generate real-time functioning 2 D and 3 D plots from given data sets. The functionality of this tool is demonstrated throughout this report with the data obtained from analyses in this study. In order to assess the potential of advanced technologies a study is performed. Fuel consumption can be assumed to be directly linked to CO 2 emissions, thus within this study analysis of fuel consumption is performed. Cost savings in future aircraft will also play a crucial role for airliners and passengers, and therefore is also analysed within this study. In order to perform this study an analysis workflow system was developed for the design of a mid-range conventional passenger aircraft from top-level requirements. This workflow was developed in the RCE collaborative integration environment and from joining tools from a physics-based toolkit developed at DLR. So-called adjustment modules were developed and integrated into this workflow in order to artificially adjust basic parameters at different stages of the analysis workflow, thus mimicking the effects of certain technologies. These technologies included <b>retrofittable</b> technologies, such as winglets, geared-turbofans, and lightweight cabin materials, as well as non-retrofittable technologies, including Natural Laminar Flow (NLF), Active Load Alleviation (ALA), and composite structures. Through these adjustments two analyses were performed. One in which the wing was fixed to the reference aircraft planform, and another in which the wing area was adjusted according to the reference wing loading and changes in MTOM from the artificial adjustments. From these analyses the potential fuel and cost savings of a number of case studies were performed. For a case in which technologies were retrofitted onto an A 320 -like aircraft, a potential fuel savings of 16 - 24 % and cost savings of 4 - 6 % was estimated. For a case in which a number of both non-retrofittable and <b>retrofittable</b> technologies were implemented at the start of development of the same aircraft, a potential fuel savings of 26 - 36 % and cost savings of 9 - 13 % was estimated.

This paper reports the research carried out on the late-medieval historic centre of Brienza, overlooked by the XI-century Castle, where some blocks of abandoned houses have been investigated, their types and construction models have been catalogued and the possibility of refurbishing them has been discussed from a static and technological point of view. All this results in a number of interesting acquisitions, such as those on the masonry constructive systems (opera), the wooden roofs and floors with round beams and non-squared boards, the constructive typologies of single and double frame roofs with tiles on bat-tens, the “opus craticium” for partitions and wooden windows and doors. We have proved that it is possible to make these buildings earthquake-resistant complying with the latest regulations on energy demand and environmental sustainability, thus giving them a new future. All this is possible through the application of non-invasive and <b>retrofittable</b> devices of masonry strengthen-ing, the use of trusses made of modified laminated turkey oak wood placed in the plane of the floors, the use of internal insulation as well as insulating plasters...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{ninety percent}} of U. S. {{coal-fired}} utility boilers are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP). Cost effective <b>retrofittable</b> ESP technologies are the only means to accomplish Department of Energy's (DOE) goal of a major reduction in fine particulate and air toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Particles in the size range of 0. 1 to 5 {micro}m typically escape ESPs. Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, molybdenum and antimony, concentrate on these particles. This is the main driver for improved fine particulate control. Vapor phase emissions of mercury, selenium and arsenic are also of major concern. Current dry ESPs, which operate at temperatures greater than 280 F, provide little control for vapor phase toxics. The need for inherent improvement to ESPs has to be considered keeping in perspective the current trend towards the use of low sulfur coals. Switching to low sulfur coals is the dominant approach for SO{sub 2 } emission reduction in the utility industry. Low sulfur coals generate high resistivity ash, which can cause an undesirable phenomenon called ''back corona. '' Higher particulate emissions occur if there is back corona in the ESP. Results of the pilot-scale testing identified the ''low temperature ESP'' concept to have the biggest impact for the two low sulfur coals investigated. Lowering the flue gas temperature to 220 F provided the maximum impact in terms of decreased emissions. Intermediate operating temperatures (reduction from 340 to 270 F) also gave significant ESP performance improvement. A significant reduction in particulate emissions was also noted when the flue gas humidity was increased (temperature held constant) from the baseline condition for these moderately high resistivity ash coals. Independent control of flue gas humidity and temperature was an important and a notable element in this project. Mercury emissions were also measured {{as a function of}} flue gas temperature. Mercury emissions decreased as the flue gas temperature was lowered, indicating the native ability of ash to capture the mercury. Pulsed operation of the ESP with the SIR module provided a 2 to 3 -fold reduction in emissions at the higher operating temperatures. In light of the positive results from Phase I, we propose proof of concept testing in the field in Phase II. The main objective of the Phase II testing would be to determine the ESP performance improvement as a function of flue gas temperature and humidity for a range of low-sulfur coals being fired by utilities. Equally important will be the long-term evaluation of the risk of corrosion and plugging (due to acid condensation) associated with low temperature operation. The impact of higher flue gas velocities (lower SCA-specific collection area), compared to the laboratory pilot program, would also need to be evaluated. A secondary objective would be to examine mercury capture by the ESP at the different temperatures and with sorbent injection...|$|E
30|$|Primarily, {{identification}} of chatter using stability lobe diagram (SLD) is very critical in machining. In machine tools, chatter and non-chatter vibrations separate {{from each other}} using SLD, which {{is a series of}} interconnected lobes in term of axial depth of cut and spindle speed that demarcates the regions of chatter vibrations. Regions below the lobes mean stable chatter vibrations [3]. SLD can be developed in either time or frequency domains. It is much faster to develop SLD in the frequency domain than in time domain. Frequency response function (FRF) [4 – 6], linear time-periodic function [7], and zero order approximation of the characteristics equation [8] are commonly employed to predict chatter vibrations in literature. In FRF, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) can determine the actual machining boundary where unstable cut show high amplitude with high vibration and stable cut show lower vibration with low amplitude [9]. Owing to the above deliberations, two important points, which increased chatter vibration in machining [4 – 6, 10 – 17] were identified as follows: an increase in depth of cut which move up vibration frequency and the effects of high spindle speed on shifting machine dynamic toward unstable cutting vibrations. Dos Santos and Coelho [4] improved the accuracy of chatter prediction in machine tools using the stability lobe diagram. Gagnol et al. [5] develop a spindle dynamic model for rotor equation using Timoshenko beam theory. Eynian [6] used Nyquist contour to predict the stability through dominant poles of the closed loop delay-differential equation for machining systems. Li et al. [10] established a comprehensive dynamic model of milling for stability analysis by considering regeneration, helix angle, and process damping. Solis et al. [11] used nondestructive trials to determine a new transfer function of the milling process for stability analysis. Altintas and Budak [12] and Altintas et al. [13] developed analytical methods for the predictions of chatter in milling. Soliman and Ismail [14] used PD fuzzy controller to limit the chatter indication. Quintana and Ciurana [15] experimentally determined stability lobe by increasing the depth of cut in feed direction. Tsai et al. [16] proposed acoustic signal feedback and spindle speed compensation for intelligent control application to avoid chatter vibration in milling process. Abele and Fiedler [17] created stability lobe of the milling process by considering the dynamic behavior of the system. In the past, efforts have been made by a quite number of researchers to study the problems of machining chatter vibrations [3]. Experimental and finite element (FE) model of machine tool were combined to investigate the vibrations [18, 19]. Kersting et al. [19] highlighted the effects of vibration on the workpiece, which focused on the feedback of workpiece displacement using FE. Dankena et al. [20, 21] related workpiece vibration to the workpiece material and workpiece structure. They pointed out that compound workpiece was a major cause of unfavorable workpiece performance, such as material height deviations, transition deviation at material joint, and surface roughness deviation, as compared to a single workpiece. Ma et al. [22 – 25] attributed vibration of the flexible workpiece to the workpiece fixture, and they improved the stiffness of the workpiece by using magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Ma et al. [22] designed a flexible fixture to investigate the regenerative chatter based on the MR fluids. Ma et al. [23] also proposed a dynamic analytical model by considering fixture constraints and the damping factor. Zeng et al. [24] constructed the dynamic model of the workpiece-fixture-cutter system by using the cutting force and the fixture element as the disturbance input and control input, respectively [24]. Similarly, <b>retrofittable</b> intelligent active fixtures, capable of observing the process in real-time and exert adequate counter-excitations was reported in Ref. [25]. In spindle speed variation, workpiece vibrations are curtailed by selecting suitable spindle speed so that the excitation frequency corresponds to the workpiece resonance [26]. Active control is a process that utilized the actuator force to provide adequate damping force that suppresses chatter vibration [27]. It consumes considerable energy to derive the actuator.|$|E
