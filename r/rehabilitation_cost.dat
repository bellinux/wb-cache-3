40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} {{the determinants of}} inpatient <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>costs</b> in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and {{examined the relationship between}} length of stay (LOS) and discharge costs using data from VA and community rehabilitation hospitals. We estimated regression models to identify patient characteristics associated with specialized inpatient <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>costs.</b> VA data included 3, 535 patients discharged from 63 facilities in fiscal year 2001. We compared VA <b>costs</b> to community <b>rehabilitation</b> hospitals using a sample from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation of 190, 112 patients discharged in 1999 from 697 facilities. LOS was a strong predictor of cost for VA and non-VA hospitals. Functional status, measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores at admission, was statistically significant but added little explanatory value after controlling for LOS. Although FIM scores were associated with LOS, FIM scores accounted for little variance in cost after controlling for LOS. These results are most applicable to researchers conducting cost-effectiveness analyses. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{inaccuracies}} {{in predicting}} maintenance and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>costs</b> for road networks {{due to the}} variability and uncertainties in road network condition. To realistically predict maintenance and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>costs,</b> stochastic characteristics of road network condition {{should be considered in}} the estimate. It may, however, not be feasible or practicable to include every single stochastic characteristic of road network conditions in the analysis. To explore this possibility in assessing variations in cost estimates, an analysis was conducted to identify input parameters that are critical for predicting road deterioration condition. Findings indicated that the variability in pavement strength significantly contributed to the variability of predicting road pavement deterioration. Based on this information, discrepancies in cost estimates due to the variability of pavement strength for road maintenance and rehabilitation were subsequently assessed. This paper presents the results of an analysis that was undertaken to identify critical input parameters for road pavement deterioration prediction.

5000|$|Majayjay {{served as}} the site of early Catholicism in Laguna. The Augustinians first came in 1568. Along with five Augustinian priests and Juan de Salcedo, nephew of Miguel López de Legazpi, they started to evangelize the sceptical townsmen led by Gat Yantok. In 1571, the Franciscans {{established}} a mission town with Don Gaspar Osorio, Agustín Osorio, Juan Osorio, Juan de Mendoza, Ventura Mag-olop, Aman Lingasan and Martín Siasip. The first church was constructed by locals in 1575 near the May-it river and was made of nipa and bamboo and was later burned in 1576. In 1578, Franciscans Fathers Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa started to evangelize the town. A church, still of nipa [...] and bamboo, was built that same year under the patronage of Saint Gregory the Great. Due to the lack of religious men, the first parish priest of Majajay, Father Antonio Nombela was only assigned in 1594. Under his pastorship, a long robe worn by wives to the church, called lambón was first used in the Philippines. In 1599, the Superior Gobierno authorized the construction of a stone church. While awaiting its construction, the makeshift church was burned in 1606. Majayjay also served as infirmary for the old religious men until 1606 before it was transferred to Lumban. Construction of the stone church began in 1616 and was completed in 1649 with the help of Maestro de Campo Don Buenaventura de Mendoza. The church was again partially burned in 1660. Rehabilitation started in 1711 and finished in 1730 by 14,000 people on forced labor and a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> of $26,000 by Father Jose de Puertollano. Instead of rebuilding the church, Father Puertollano decided to sandwich the ruins between two layers of brick resulting in an unusual wall thickness of 3 m. It took 19 years for the people of Majayjay to complete the church which was made of adobe stone with red tiles and prime lumber. On completion in 1730, the church became the biggest in the Philippines ...|$|E

40|$|Operations {{excellence}} in inpatient rehabilitation {{is critical to}} coordinate care transitions for people with serious illness and injury. Public insurers typically only pay inpatient rehabilitation services within {{a certain period of}} time regardless of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s recovery condition. Furthermore, the funded inpatient rehabilitation length of stay (RLOS) is determined without much quantitative analysis. Such an 2 ̆ 2 ad-hoc one-fit-all 2 ̆ 2 approach is often questionable, especially when inpatient rehabilitation service providers are under pressure of discharging patients early to control the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost,</b> meanwhile maintaining their readmission risks. Keeping the right balance between these two outcomes is imperative in achieving a cost-effective system. In this research, we present a stochastic process to model the care transition. We report a simulation study to evaluate the process for a cohort of publically funded traumatic brain injury patients and explore the tradeoff between the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> and readmission risk. We systematically vary the funded RLOS within each patient cluster to identify promising discharge timing policies. Following the preliminary results obtained through the simulation experiments, we introduce a search heuristic within the framework of our model. The genetic algorithm based simulation optimization algorithm that arose out of this approach optimizes the RLOS within each cluster by identifying the ideal combination of RLOS over all clusters that would minimize both the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> and the readmission risk. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of overloaded truck traffic on the pavement damage and its <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> of Benghazi Street in Misurata city, Libya. Evaluation of allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> also becomes concern of this study to determine the sufficiency of the cost. The objectives of this study are to know the influence of overloaded truck traffic towards the pavement damage; to know the overloaded truck traffic towards rehabilitation cost; and to evaluate sufficiency of the allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> based on the actual condition of the pavement rehabilitation needs. Pavement Condition Index (PCI), Equivalent Standard Axle Loads (ESAL) factors calculation were carried out in this study. PCI determined to rate the pavement damage condition based on damage that found at Benghazi Street. ESAL of the traffic determined by AASHTO 1993 standard to get the damage factor due to axle loads. Further the evaluation of allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> was conducted based on the ESAL of the traffic by comparing the standard normal ESAL with the ESAL of overloaded truck traffic. The PCI result determined the highest rate of the pavement condition was 71. 0 and the lowest one was 6. 0. It was retrieved from 21 segments along 2100 meters of Benghazi Street, 17 segments attained under 50 and it was only 3 segments attained above 50 value of PCI. The PCI of total area resumed the value of 31. 5 which means a very poor pavement condition rate. In other result, ESAL of truck traffic attained up to 953, 230 where the ESAL of normal load determined only 327, 964. Ratio of both was 2. 90 which mean overload ESAL 290 % higher than normal one. The maintenance cost of normal ESAL determined 2. 39 dinar Libya/ ESAL and it reached up to 2, 276, 030. 28 dinar. The maintenance cost needs to be adjusted 65 % more than allocated maintenance cost. It can be concluded that the maintenance cost for the next periods should be planned well based on the actual ESAL investigation {{so that it can be}} managed to suitable cost and sufficient service for safety and comfort of the user...|$|E
