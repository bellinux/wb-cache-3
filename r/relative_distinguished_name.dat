5000|$|Early {{deployments}} of X.500 within {{corporations and}} institutions with entries representing {{the employees of}} those organizations often used a DIT structure which mirrored the organizational structure, with organizational unit entries corresponding to departments or divisions of the organization. The <b>relative</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>names</b> of theentries for employees were often formed from the common names of the individual employees. An example DN of an early X.500/LDAP deployment might be [...] "cn=Joe Bloggs, ou=Marketing, ou=Operations, o=Example Corporation, st=CA, c=US".The disadvantage {{of this approach is}} that it when the organizational structure is changed, or if employees change their legal name, it can require the moving or renaming of entries in the directory, which adds both complexity and overhead and can also upset applications not designed to deal gracefully with such moves.|$|R

5000|$|Today, {{many large}} {{deployments}} of X.500 or LDAP use a single, flat namespace for the entries, and choose {{to name the}} entries for individuals based on a <b>relative</b> <b>distinguished</b> <b>name</b> that is an organizationally-assigned identifier,such as a username or an employee number. Today, a DN might resemble [...] "uid=00003,ou=People, dc=example, dc=com". The advantage of this structure is that entries need not be moved even when employees change their name, or are transferred to different departments. These changes can be effected through just an attribute modification, and applications which may be using the DN as a unique identifier (e.g. in a database) {{do not need to}} be touched.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{concept of}} X.500 {{is that there}} is a single Directory Information Tree (DIT), a {{hierarchical}} organization of entries which are distributed across one or more servers, called Directory System Agents (DSA). An entry consists of a set of attributes, each attribute with one or more values. Each entry has a unique Distinguished Name, formed by combining its <b>Relative</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Name</b> (RDN), one or more attributes of the entry itself, and the RDNs of each of the superior entries up to the root of the DIT. As LDAP implements a very similar data model to that of X.500, there is further description of the data model in the article on LDAP.|$|E
