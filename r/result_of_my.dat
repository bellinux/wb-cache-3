500|$|Mortimer {{qualified}} for six women's SM10 {{events at the}} 2012 London Paralympics—the 200-metre individual medley, 4 × 100 m freestyle relay 34pts, 4 × 100 m medley relay, 50- and 100-metre freestyle and 100-metre backstroke—and expectations for her were high. On August 30, {{the first day of}} the competition, Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand won the SM10 200-metre individual medley; Mortimer took the silver medal. For a half-hour before the competition, Mortimer was [...] "bawling her eyes out"; she told The Canadian Press, [...] " [...] here and meeting all these people made me realize I am so incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> accident. I don’t know if this was part of the journey I was supposed to walk in life but I wouldn’t take it back for the world". The next day, she won the S10 50-metre freestyle gold medal in a record time of 28.10 seconds. Mortimer's time was [...]07 second faster than her April Trials record, and [...]14 second faster than Pascoe's time; she went into the race [...] "a bit annoyed" [...] and [...] "mad at anyone who was going to take it from me".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the album}} Travieso Carmesí, a musical project created to celebrate the Bicentennial of Mexico. Lafourcade analyzed Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara's catalogue and decided to record a tribute album with his songs, since the singer wanted to give herself the opportunity to perform songs written by another person. In 2014, Lafourcade {{wanted to find a}} balance between heart, mind and body, and traveled to Veracruz, Colombia and Cuba, searching for inspiration to write new music. [...] "This [...] album was made parallel to the experience of singing the Lara's music... is the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> need to be proud of my songs." [...] Lafourcade said to Vívelo Hoy. The album Hasta la Raíz is Lafourcade's sixth studio album and is her first album of original material in six years, since Hu Hu Hu (2009) and was produced by Argentinean musician Cachorro López, Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel García and herself after another record producer became very expensive. The album version of the track was released as a digital download on January 14, 2015 and a new version entitled [...] "Canova's Root Version" [...] was available on May 19, 2015. Lafourcade included the song on the live EP Spotify Sessions. [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] is featured in the Italian edition of the album series Now Summer Hits 2015.|$|E

Prior to his arrest (but after the charges became public), Tamogami explained the payments as [...] "not something that I directly ordered, but [...] <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ignorance and lack of oversight." ...|$|E

2500|$|... ou {{know that}} Berio used The Raw and the Cooked in his Sinfonia. A {{part of the}} text is recited, {{accompanied}} by the music. I admit that I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|Tureaud next {{worked as}} a bouncer. It was {{at this time that}} he created the persona of Mr. T. His wearing of gold neck chains and other jewelry was the result of {{customers}} losing the items or leaving them behind at the night club after a fight. A banned customer, or one reluctant to risk a confrontation by going back inside, could return to claim his property from Mr. T wearing it conspicuously right out front. Along with controlling the violence as a doorman, Tureaud was mainly hired to keep out drug dealers and users. During his bouncing days, Tureaud was in over 200 fights and was sued a number of times, but won each case. [...] "I have {{been in and out of}} the courts as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> beating up somebody. I have been sued by customers whom I threw out that claimed that I viciously attacked them without just cause and/or I caused them great bodily harm as a result of a beating I supposedly gave them," [...] Mr. T once remarked.|$|E
2500|$|Zunes {{writes that}} [...] "assaults on critics of Israeli {{policies}} have been more successful in limiting open debate, but this gagging censorship effect stems more from ignorance and liberal guilt than from any all-powerful Israel lobby." [...] He goes {{on to explain that}} while [...] "some criticism of Israel really is rooted in anti-Semitism", it is his opinion that some members of the Israel lobby cross the line by labeling intellectually honest critics of Israel as antisemitic. Zunes argues that the mainstream and conservative Jewish organizations have [...] "created a climate of intimidation against many who speak out for peace and human rights or who support the Palestinians' right of self-determination." [...] Zunes has been {{on the receiving end of}} this criticism himself [...] "As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opposition to US support for the Israeli government's policies of occupation, colonization and repression, I have been deliberately misquoted, subjected to slander and libel, and falsely accused of being [...] "anti-Semitic" [...] and [...] "supporting terrorism"; my children have been harassed and my university's administration has been bombarded with calls for my dismissal." ...|$|E
