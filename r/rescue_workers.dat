5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E
5|$|No {{escape from}} the jetty or the vessel was {{possible}} {{in the absence of}} rescue boats, given that no fixed link was built from the jetty to the shore. However, all concerned praised the initiative and courage of the firefighters and <b>rescue</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> said there were no more survivors.|$|E

However, Facebook and Twitter users recognized it as that of an Israeli baby wounded by a Hamas rocket attack; [...] "Kiryat Malachi" [...] was printed on the <b>rescue</b> <b>worker's</b> vest.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} crash, a {{memorial}} stone {{in memory of}} the victims was erected near the crash site in Le Vernet. The following month, about 1,400 relatives of victims, senior politicians, <b>rescue</b> <b>workers,</b> and airline employees attended a memorial service at Cologne Cathedral. The parents of Andreas Lubitz were invited to the service but did not attend.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 attacks had {{immediate}} {{effects on}} the American people. Police and <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> {{from around the country}} took leaves of absence, traveling to New York City to help recover bodies from the twisted remnants of the Twin Towers. Blood donations across the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9/11.|$|E
5|$|The Salvation Army served over 100,000meals and {{provided}} over 100,000ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to <b>rescue</b> <b>workers.</b> Local residents and those from further afield {{responded to the}} requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000units of blood donated 131units were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.|$|E

5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some public funding, but received criticism for its financial ties to the Church of Scientology, for exposing <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> to potential medical dangers, and for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine. Sources in the Fire Department told a reporter that several participants had joined Scientology, even disconnecting from their families.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> also died when the tower collapsed. Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is debatable.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann {{sent for}} Brand again {{a few days}} later. Eichmann was {{accompanied}} this time by Gerhard Clages, also known as Otto Klages, chief of Himmler's Sicherheitsdienst (security service) in Budapest. Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers– Eichmann, Becher and Clages– had involved themselves with the Brand proposal. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs that the Germans had intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.|$|E
5|$|Following the announcement, {{numerous}} {{residents of}} the town began to sign a list volunteering to enter the structure themselves to continue the search; the owners also announced their intention to seek a court injunction ordering the resumption of search and rescue efforts. After an appeal from local MPP Michael Mantha, whose constituency office was in the mall, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty urged <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> to resume their search for survivors.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> spent days digging through mud to find victims of the hurricane until the search was disbanded on October6. The government received criticism for the tragedy, citing that the dam that broke had been poorly built. Overall, at least 1,263fatalities and $100million (1976USD) in damage are attributed to the hurricane, {{making it one of the}} deadliest tropical cyclones on record in the eastern Pacific, as well as one of the few Pacific hurricanes to kill more than 1,000people.|$|E
5|$|National governments, {{domestic}} non-governmental organizations, {{and international}} aid agencies established hundreds of shelters, evacuated {{hundreds of thousands}} of people, raised millions of dollars of resources, and rallied thousands of <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> as the powerful hurricane churned through the Caribbean. Despite a number of near misses, Hurricane Dean did not make landfall in the Greater Antilles and the islands were spared the brunt of the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{humanitarian response}} was immediate, {{and in some}} cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> by providing 15,000 to 20,000meals over a ten-day period.|$|E

Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer <b>rescue</b> <b>workers</b> to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and clothing was brought to towns isolated by the storm. In Culiacán, churches, schools, and a baseball stadium served as temporary shelters for displaced persons. <b>Rescue</b> <b>workers</b> also searched for bodies of victims of both Lidia and the subsequent Hurricane Norma, which hit the same area a few days later. Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, Antonio Toledo Corro, declared his state a disaster area. He also asked the Mexican Federal Government for aid.|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to help keep him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. <b>Rescue</b> <b>workers</b> constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E
