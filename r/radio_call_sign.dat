5|$|The Air Commando sergeants, James J. Stanford and Charles Larimore Jones {{discovered}} the problem, obtained manuals on forward air control {{and went to}} work to resolve the issue. In short order, they arranged rides in Air America and Continental Air Services aircraft and began marking ground targets. The expedient worked and the sergeants, using <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Butterfly, succeeded brilliantly.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> Hichens {{could not think of}} anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained with him {{for the rest of his}} time with the coastal forces.|$|E

5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being {{trained on the}} Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career. He had chosen this Christian name as his <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E

25|$|Also, in Taiwan, another contradiction was {{the radio}} call signs {{for the fire}} trucks or rescue vehicles. For reasons to avoid {{unwanted}} attentions and to remain secrecy, all radio call signs for all police vehicles were uncorrelated with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, rescue vehicles, and ambulances of fire brigades. When fire police teams were responding to an emergency situation, these confusing call signs inevitably led to chaos and time delay. A successful fire chief, Chao Kang (趙鋼), convinced the police high command to rearrange the <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> assignment for all fire vehicles. Chao Kang then was appointed as the Commissioner of Taiwan Provincial Fire Administration, and the Director-General of National Fire Agency from 10 September 2000 to September 2002.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day on the station, Shepherd {{requested}} the use of the <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Alpha", which he and Krikalev preferred it to the more cumbersome [...] "International Space Station". The name [...] "Alpha" [...] had previously been used for the station in the early 90's, and following the request, its use was authorized for the whole of Expedition 1. Shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time. Referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said: [...] "For thousands of years, humans have been going to sea in ships. People have designed and built these vessels, launched them with a good feeling that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage." [...] Yuri Semenov, the President of Russian Space Corporation Energia at the time, disapproved of the name [...] "Alpha"; he felt that Mir was the first space station, and so he would have preferred the names [...] "Beta" [...] or [...] "Mir 2" [...] for the ISS.|$|E

2500|$|The Amateur <b>Radio</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Receiving Test use a {{software}} program called RufzXP that generates a score for each competitor.

[...] In the RufzXP program, competitors listen to an amateur <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> sent in Morse code and must enter that callsign with the computer keyboard. [...] If the competitor types in the call sign correctly, their score improves and {{the speed at which}} the program sends subsequent call signs increases. [...] If the competitor types in the call sign incorrectly, the score is penalized and the speed decreases. [...] Only one call sign is sent at a time and the event continues for a fixed number of call signs (usually 50). [...] Competitors can choose the initial speed at which the program sends the Morse code, and the winner is the competitor with the highest generated score.|$|E

2500|$|All U.S. states offer {{specialized}} {{license plates}} for licensed amateur radio operators, {{in many cases}} at no extra charge or at a discount compared to standard vanity plates.

The owner's <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> is used instead of a standard-issue serial. Texas allows radio amateurs to have their call sign on the license plates of multiple vehicles that they own, in effect allowing more than one vehicle to share the same license plate number.|$|E
