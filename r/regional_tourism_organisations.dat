40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{conventional wisdom}} about {{the superiority of}} the neoliberal market-led approach in leading regional tourism development. The rise and rise of neoliberal market management philosophies over the last 30 years has contributed to an incontrovertible 'truth' that <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTOs) established and led by business actors are best placed to lead regional tourism development. Despite this dogma, little evidence has surfaced to support the notion that market-led organisations offer a superior model of regional tourism governance. This paper examines the capacity of two different <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> in Brazil, a market-led RTO and a government-led RTO, operating in the same geographical space to lead regional tourism development. Focusing on the capacity of each organisation to lead, the findings reveal that the capacity to lead requires more nuanced attention, and that both types of RTOs have an important, and potentially complementary, roles to play in leading regional tourism.

40|$|To {{ensure the}} success of Rugby World Cup 2011 (RWC 2011) in New Zealand <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> were {{expected}} to collaborate with each other as part of developing a nationwide approach to the event, whilst simultaneously competing {{with each other for}} visitor nights and spending. Simultaneous cooperation and competition is known as coopetition. Relatively {{little is known about the}} impact of coopetition on knowledge transfer dynamics. The study analyses how coopetition between <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTOs) impacted their knowledge transfer dynamics in the context of RWC 2011. The study utilised an exploratory, comparative, qualitative, case study approach. Twenty-one semi-structured interviews with CEOs and senior managers from RTOs were conducted both pre-event and post-event. A formal survey and a documentation review provided complementary data. The findings indicate that the level of collaboration among RTOs fell short of the collaborative approach advocated by government and event organisers. It was also evident that a continuum of competition and collaboration (i. e. coopetition) was present in the RTO network for RWC 2011. This continuum mirrored normal everyday RTO behaviour with its focus on regional issues. Overall, the knowledge acquisition and transfer processes among the RTOs were negatively affected in two ways: (1) the limited RTO collaboration did not facilitate an effective knowledge transfer process; and (2) RTO competition constrained knowledge sharing. These factors restricted the flow of potentially useful knowledge and information around mega-events. The structure and set-up of RWC 2011 — especially the regional bidding process to host teams and matches — was crucial. This bidding process impeded inter-regional collaboration and knowledge transfer whilst simultaneously facilitating competition among the RTOs. The study concludes that coopetition can negatively affect the sharing and transfer of knowledge in a destination marketing and mega-events environment. The research addresses the call for further research in this field and enhances understanding of how to better leverage mega-events in the future...|$|E
40|$|As {{tourism is}} an {{information}} business, tourists {{have to rely}} on the information available beforehand. One – prominent – source of information are call centres of national or <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations,</b> which provide users expert advise and also pre-compiled information documents and brochures. However, such requests are usually answered with on demand off and on-line searches, communicating the required information to the customer via telephone. This is a cumbersome and often low quality process. The project OnTourism aims at improving these processes by automatically extracting (publicly) available information about the requested topics and compiling them into comprehensible documents which can then be sent to the customers. The information access for the call centre’s personnel is supported by semantic annotation of the available documents, thus improving the required time to answer customers’ requests as well as the service quality...|$|E

40|$|No {{matter how}} the people of Scotland vote in the {{independence}} referendum, the management of tourism in Scotland will change {{and the implications of}} this vote will be felt throughout Europe. As the demand for devolved political powers grow, there {{is likely to be a}} concurrent move to devolve the management and marketing of tourism from national tourism organisations, to more regional based tourism organisations. The emergence of such regional based tourism organisations is likely to result in them forming more powerful political groupings to lobby against European Union wide rules that may restrict them from developing stronger regional products. The free movement of people and goods within the Europe Union may become more difficult, as more regional policies are developed. The future of two key European policies, the Euro and a passport free common travel area, may also be questioned.

40|$|In {{competitive}} tourism markets the consumer-traveller is spoilt {{by choice}} of available destinations. Successfully differentiating a destination and getting noticed at decision time {{is arguably the}} focus of activities by destination marketing organisations (DMOs). In pursuit of differentiation, three emergent themes in the marketing literature {{during the past decade}} have been branding, integrated marketing communications (IMC), and customer relationship management (CRM) a fundamental goal of each being stimulating customer loyalty. However there has been little attention given to destination loyalty in the tourism literature.

While short breaks represent a significant aspect of holiday behaviour for the two samples, respondents' comments indicate the tourism industry in Australia and New Zealand may be missing opportunities to better cater to this trave segment.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the governance of}} <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTOs) and relates governance {{to the principle of}} subsidiarity. The principle maintains that tasks and responsibilities should be accomplished by the lowest and most basic elements of any social organisation, and it is an injustice to assign to a larger and higher association what the lesser and subordinate associations can do. There is little research on understanding RTO governance, on how governance may contribute to RTO instability or on the application of the principle of subsidiarity in a tourism context. A New Zealand case study demonstrates a series of fundamental problems with typical RTO governance structures, linked to problems found in many tourism partnerships. Data collection methods for the case study of the Waikato RTO included observation, interviews, focus groups and document analysis. The paper concludes that the principle of subsidiarity can underpin an RTO governance system if the RTO adopts an ethos of service to the tourism sector and the wider community. This governance style requires open communication and consultation, must foster trust and legitimacy and contribute to securing the RTO's ongoing required resources. Such a governance structure would align well with the principles of sustainable tourism...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} gap in {{the tourism}} literature exists {{in the area of}} destination branding, a field that has only attracted attention since the late 1990 s. While interest in applications of brand theory to practise in tourism is increasing, there is a paucity of published research in the literature to guide destination marketing organisations (DMOs). In particular there have been few reported analyses of destination brand positioning slogans, which represent the interface between brand identity and brand image. Part of a wider investigation of DMO slogans worldwide, and in keeping with the conference location, the paper focuses on slogans used by New Zealand <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTOs). In the absence of any universally accepted criteria by which a DMO’s staff, political appointees and advertising agency could be held accountable by stakeholders, the slogans are examined in terms {{of the extent to which}} they have stood the test of time and effectively differentiate through a meaningful proposition.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} the leadership practices of two Brazilian <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTOs) using an exploratory case study. Design/methodology/approach - The research adopts an embedded case study approach, permitting {{the comparison of}} the leadership phenomenon in the "Instituto Estrada Real" (the IER) and the "Associa磯 Circuito do Ouro" (the ACO). Semi-structured interviews (n= 14) were undertaken to gather information from the RTOs' executives and actors/followers influenced directly by RTO leadership {{in order to obtain}} their perceptions about leadership practice. Findings - Four leadership themes emerged: capacity to produce results, capacity to mobilise followers, articulation and communication of goals and actions, and articulation of roles and responsibilities. The findings are discussed in regards to the hierarchical and market governance structures of the two RTOs and the implications for leadership practice. The interviewees identified that transactional forms of leadership dominated the hierarchical governance structure of the ACO and that it was able to mobilise effectively other levels of government. However, this leadership does not deliver results at the speed required by the private sector. The IER is a market-led governance structure and its leadership practices effectively mobilised the private sector. However, it was found to operate in isolation from government and other key tourism stakeholders.

This paper will report on an action research project aimed at identifying and applying new approaches to using tourism effectively as a strategy for sustainable development in destination communities. The research reported in this paper adopted a community capitals approach to sustainable destination development and explored the links between features of tourism development and impacts on the social capital available to destination communities. The study was based on a workshop conducted with sixteen regional tourism development officers that used a variety of techniques, including a futures wheel exercise, to identify the relationships between aspects of tourism development and both positive and negative impacts on social capital. The results of the workshop highlighted the importance of effective local resident engagement in tourism planning and activity and suggested several new dimensions of tourism planning for further exploration and development.

40|$|Despite {{the many}} unique and {{fascinating}} tourism attractions in Sub-Saharan Africa, the sub-region {{is still the}} least visited in the world. The reasons for the poor performance required an objective analysis. The main objective of this paper, therefore, was to identify and analyze the factors that hinder the full realization of Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s tourism potential. Specifically, the study analyzed the following variables: location, accessibility, climate, attractions, infrastructure, facilities, services, {{and the image of}} the sub-region as an attractive tourist destination. The geographical scope of the study was confined to that part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The study was based primarily on secondary data sources. These included the World Tourism Organization (WTO), World Travel and Tourism Council, United Nations World Tourism Barometer, and the <b>Regional</b> <b>Tourism</b> <b>Organisation</b> of Southern Africa (RETOSA). They all compile annual reports as well as world tourism rankings by number of visits, revenue generated and employment created. The major findings of the study were that the weak state of tourism in Sub-Saharan Africa was due to: poor and circuitous connectivity with the major tourist generating countries as well as within the subregion itself; inadequate and poorly developed tourism infrastructure and related facilities; widespread poverty; and a generally poor image. In addition, the study found that droughts and famine, as well as the prevalence of such diseases as HIV/AIDS, malaria, yellow fever and cholera had a negative impact. On the basis of these findings, the study recommends that governments of Sub-Saharan Africa should embrace good governance {{and the rule of law}} in order to reverse the sub-regionâ€™s negative image.

40|$|In {{competitive}} tourism markets the consumer-traveller is spoilt {{by choice}} of available destinations, {{and so it}} is likely many places are substitutable. Successfully differentiating a destination at decision time is arguably the greatest challenge faced by destination marketing organisations (DMOs). In the emerging literature relating to place branding there has been little attention given to issues such as visitor loyalty, destination switching, repeat visitation and customer relationship management. Underpinned by the proposition that communicating with previous visitors will be a more efficient use of resources than traditional advertising, this paper reports an exploratory investigation into the extent that <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> (RTO) in Queensland, Australia, are encouraging repeat visitors from their largest market. While there was a general recognition of the potential for visitor relationship management (VRM), none of the RTOs had yet been able to develop a formal approach {{to stay in touch with}} previous visitors.

40|$|With {{reports of}} travel {{purchases}} and reservations {{being one of}} the fastest growing segments of the Internet community (eMarketer, 2002), it is no surprise that the number of tourism operators on the Web has increased considerably over the past few years. In recent years, Australia and Chile have developed strong social and economic ties. With the introduction of direct air links between Australia and Chile in July 2002, the number of Australian business people and tourists visiting Chile and neighbouring countries increased significantly. This isn’t surprising considering approximately 35, 000 Chileans live in Australia (DFAT, 2005). This paper presents the results of a comparison of the use of Web technologies by <b>Regional</b> <b>Tourism</b> <b>Organisations</b> (RTOs) in the Chilean and Asia Pacific tourism industries. The Extended Model of Internet Commerce Adoption (eMICA) (Burgess and Cooper, 2000) was used to assess the web sites of RTOs to determine the extent of adoption and level of integration of web technologies for destination marketing. A significant finding of this study is the number of RTOs sites offering Stage 3 functionality (transaction processing) in Chile compared with the Asia Pacific region. The results of the study add further support to the premise of the model, that is, in developing commercial websites, businesses in this industry sector typically start simply by establishing a presence on the Web and build on functionality over time, as their experience and expertise in the use of Internet technologies increases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{past decade}} has been {{particularly}} difficult for the tourism industry worldwide, and in Asia/Australasia in particular, as crises have followed in rapid succession, starting with {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001. Severe flooding in Central Queensland in early 2011, was followed soon after by Cyclone Yasi, again revealing the vulnerability of communities to the forces of nature. The tourism industry, due to the discretionary nature of the consumption activity, is particularly vulnerable to crises and the fragmented nature of the industry can make it difficult to prepare for and quickly respond to crises. This paper investigates the impacts of the 2011 flooding and Cyclone Yasi on Central Queensland tourism operators and the degree of implementation and effectiveness of the Tourism Queensland Crisis Management Plan Template to prepare <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> and businesses for crises such as these. This research has found that whilst {{only a small number of}} Central Queensland tourism operators were directly affected by Cyclone Yasi and the flooding, the impacts and outcomes appear very similar for both those directly and indirectly affected: (i) loss of business revenue, downsizing the operation due to the decrease in the number of tourists; (ii) medium term impacts due to ongoing negative media coverage; and (iii) lack of compensation from insurance companies and the Queensland Government. All these have led to a very slow recovery for the tourism industry within Central Queensland...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} the preparedness of regional destinations for new and developing markets (NDMs) focusing on service provision and cultural considerations. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews using semi-structured questions and {{quantitative and qualitative analyses}} were undertaken with regional tourism-related stakeholders {{to investigate}} NDMs, levels of preparedness for these markets, perceptions on service quality and host and visitor culture. Findings: <b>Regional</b> <b>tourism</b> operators and <b>organisations</b> within the case study were not well prepared for NDMs such as China and India. There was a strong desire to present a local experience with services that reflect the Australian culture, rather than replicate the visitors’ culture. Levels of awareness for the services preferred by NDMs and the intention to cater specifically to these preferences was found to be inconsistent. Key challenges include market diversity, staff training, limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. Resource allocation to address these challenges may not be a high priority, impacting NDMs’ preparedness and <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> growth. Originality/value: Globally, <b>tourism</b> <b>organisations</b> are directing marketing efforts towards NDMs. However, ill-preparedness for these markets can lead to low levels of tourist satisfaction, reduced re-visitation and fewer positive word-of-mouth recommendations, all of which negatively impact tourism growth and development.

40|$|Policy makers, {{industry}} and researchers are paying considerable {{attention to the}} importance of the relationship between food and tourism in destination differentiation from competitors and in contributing to economic development. There is a vital role for food in broadening a destination’s appeal; increasing visitor yield; enhancing visitor experience; strengthening regional identity; and stimulating growth in other sectors. Thus, food contributes to the overall sustainable competitiveness of a tourism destination. Despite growing research interest in food and tourism, there is still work to be done to bring the relationship of these two elements into focus. In order to better understand the role that food plays in tourism destination differentiation and development this PhD research draws on globalisation theory, world culture theory, tourism development theory and network and cluster theory. Particular attention is paid to the role that global processes play in shaping regional competitiveness and resultant policy initiatives. The empirical focus of the research is on the case of Rotorua, New Zealand, located in the Bay of Plenty in the central North Island. Rotorua is one of the premier tourist destinations in New Zealand, however, on a range of socio-economic indicators it ranks poorly compared with other regions in the country. The region is rich in scenic resources and Maori cultural heritage and these are the main attractions of the district. With the exception of the traditional Maori hangi, the contribution of food in tourism has not been emphasized strongly by regional food/tourism stakeholders. This study argues that greater use of local food in the region’s tourism offers a means of potentially strengthening the district’s development and differentiation. A thorough content analysis of national and <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>organisation</b> marketing on the Internet and in brochures reveals that food features prominently in the 100 % Pure New Zealand Internet campaign and in a number of <b>regional</b> <b>tourism</b> promotions. Rotorua is shown to lag behind many regions in its use of food as a feature of the local tourism experience. Interviews with 50 tourism and food industry experts provide a range of insights into the issues associated with attempting to increase the role of food in tourism in Rotorua, and in New Zealand more generally. A variety of issues and constraints which work against developing the role of food in tourism are identified. The research highlights that there is {{little in the way of}} an identifiable regional cuisine in Rotorua. There is also lack of communication between local food and tourism stakeholders and an absence of effective networks. A variety of suggestions are then presented on ways to more effectively link food to tourism in Rotorua. The research highlights the importance of developing regional food network groups and the linking of food into local tourism strategies. The potential to better develop indigenous dimensions of food in tourism is also examined. Not every region can market themselves as ‘food tourism’ destinations but most have some potential to increase the role that local food plays in tourism and development. The Rotorua case shows that there is potential to use food as a tool to achieve destination differentiation and development in regions whose success and renown is based on attractions other than food...|$|R
