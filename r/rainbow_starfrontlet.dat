50|$|The <b>rainbow</b> <b>starfrontlet</b> (Coeligena iris) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is found in Ecuador and Peru. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, at elevations of 1500 -3300 m, and heavily degraded former forest.They can be seen {{along the edges of}} forests and adjacent shrubby areas.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Starfrontlets</b> {{feed off}} of nectar taken {{directly}} from brightly colored, scented small flowers of trees, herbs, shrubs and epiphytes. They {{tend to favor}} flowers with the highest sugar content. Then they seek it out, aggressively protect, and watch those areas containing flowers with high energy nectar.They use their straw-like tongues to retrieve the nectar while hovering, licking 13 times per second. They may also take some small spiders and insects for sources of protein, in which are needed during the breeding season to ensure the good development of their young. Insects are often hunted in flight swooped off leaves or branches, or are snatched forecfully from spider webs. A nesting female may capture up to 2,000 insects in a day.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Starfrontlets</b> averages 13.5 - 14 cm (~5.25 - 5.5 inches) in length, {{along with}} the beak being about 2.9 cm (~1.1 inch) long. The female is {{responsible}} for building the nest out of plant fibers woven together and green moss on the outside. Thus camouflaging itself in a protected location in a shrub, bush or even tree. The nest is typically found on a low, thin horizontal branch. The male defends his territory and the flowers he feeds on. The young are born unmovable and blind, without any down.The female alone protects and feeds the chicks with chewed food [...] They push the food down the chicks' throats with her long bill directly into their stomachs.The chicks are brooded only the first week or two, and left alone even on cooler nights after about 12 days. The chicks then leave the nest when they are close to 7 - 10 days of age.|$|R
