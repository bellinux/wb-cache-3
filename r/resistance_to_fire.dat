5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E

2500|$|Asbestos mining existed {{more than}} 4,000 years ago, but {{large-scale}} mining {{began at the}} end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Some of those properties are sound absorption, average tensile strength, affordability, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire,</b> heat, and electricity. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century [...] until public knowledge (acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of asbestos dust outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries.|$|E

2500|$|Due to a {{widespread}} practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, {{most of the}} destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps reported that he [...] "was stopped by a fireman {{who told me that}} people in that neighborhood were firing their houses… they were told that they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire. The insurance industry eventually paid out over $250,000,000 (the largest amount they paid out for the next 60 years) which significantly helped to rebuild the city." [...] Building standards of the original 1906 buildings had almost no earthquake resistance built in. Since 1906 earthquake standards have been steadily upgraded as damages caused by earthquakes are investigated. Unfortunately, a lot of older buildings do not meet today's standards, and it would typically cost too much to upgrade them. It was discovered in 1906 (again) that all masonry-type structures built of brick and un-reinforced concrete are <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> but not earthquakes. A detailed analysis of the city of San Francisco today estimates that an earthquake over 7.0 magnitude would completely destroy or seriously damage many sections of San Francisco and could possibly result in thousands of deaths. Today in most communities, structures built to later earthquake standards would do well in all but the strongest earthquakes. The water mains and other infrastructure needed for fighting fires have all been upgraded but are yet untested.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} PhD {{project was}} to study the genetic {{architecture}} of pear <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> two of its most significant diseases and pests, fire blight and psylla, which cause severe yield losses in all the main pear production regions worldwide. The development of new pear varieties with resistance against these two biotic stresses is of major interest for Integrated Pest Management. This project was designed in a joint collaboration among Fondazione Edmund Mach (Italy), Institut de Recherches en Horticulture et Semences (France) and Plant & Food Research (NewZealand). The interspecific pear F 1 progeny PEAR 3 x ‘Moonglow’ was developed {{with the purpose of}} cumulating <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> blight and psylla deriving from Asian and European pear cultivars. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) -based genetic maps were built for PEAR 3 and ‘Moonglow’. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) were detected for the resistances, demonstrating their polygenic nature. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) can now be applied for these two traits. Furthermore, the segregating population exhibited genetic incompatibilities, and the genomic regions associated with hybrid necrosis were mapped {{for the first time in}} pear. Development of molecular markers linked to the lethal genes should allow breeders to avoid crosses leading to incompatible combinations that could affect the expression of important agronomic traits co-segregating with these gene...|$|R

5000|$|When {{used as a}} {{component}} in fire barriers, drywall is a passive fire protection item. In its natural state, gypsum contains the water of crystallization bound {{in the form of}} hydrates. When exposed <b>to</b> heat or <b>fire,</b> this water is vaporized, over a range of temperatures from 80° to 170 °C (see calcium sulphate), retarding heat transfer until the water in the gypsum is gone. This makes drywall an ablative material because as the hydrates sublime, a crumbly dust is left behind, which, along with the paper, is sacrificial. Generally, the more layers of Type X drywall one adds, the more one increases the fire-resistance of the assembly, up to four hours for walls and three hours for ceilings. Evidence of this can be found both in publicly available design catalogues, including DIN 4102 Part 4 and the Canadian Building Code on the topic, as well as common certification listings, including certification listings provided by Underwriters Laboratories and Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC). [...] "Type X" [...] drywall is formulated by adding glass fibres to the gypsum, <b>to</b> increase the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fires,</b> especially once the hydrates are spent, which leaves the gypsum in powder form. Type X is typically the material chosen to construct walls and ceilings that are required to have a fire-resistance rating.|$|R

40|$|Tree {{characteristics}} were recorded from 2829 standing trees in 24 0. 25 -ha terra firme forest plots in central Amazonia, 3 y after a surface fire had {{swept through the}} study area. Sixteen of the plots were within forest that burnt {{for the first time}} at the end of the 1997 - 98 El Niño (ENSO) event, and the remaining eight plots were within unburnt primary forest. In order to investigate the morphological correlates of tree mortality, we measured tree diameter at breast height (dbh) and bark thickness, and recorded burn height, bark roughness and the presence of latex, resin and buttress roots. Leaf litter depth was also recorded at the base of all trees in the unburnt forest. Using logistic regression models, tree mortality was best explained by the burn height, although dbh and the presence of buttresses were also important. Buttressed trees were associated with deeper leaf litter accumulation at their bases and higher char heights than trees without buttresses. Moreover, trees surviving the fire had signifcantly thicker bark than living trees in unburnt forest plots, indicating that thin-barked trees are more prone to selective mortality induced by heat stress. Latex did not appear to have had any significant effects on mortality, though resins were less abundant amongst the live trees in the burnt forest than in the unburnt controls. Levels of fire-mediated tree mortality in this study are compared with those in other Amazonian forest regions in light of historical factors affecting tree <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fires...</b>|$|R
5|$|On 12 June 1917, {{well before}} Mutsu was laid down, Hiraga {{proposed}} a revised {{design for the}} ship that reflected the lessons from the Battle of Jutland that had occurred the previous year, and incorporated advances in boiler technology.

He reduced the secondary armament from 20 guns to 16, although they were raised in height to improve their ability <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> during heavy weather and to improve their arcs of <b>fire.</b> <b>To</b> increase the ship's protection he proposed angling the belt armor outwards <b>to</b> improve its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> horizontal <b>fire,</b> and increasing the thickness of the lower deck armor and the torpedo bulkhead.
