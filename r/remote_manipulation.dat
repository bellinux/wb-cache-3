This stimulating challenge to basic researchers was advanced by Paul Bach-Y-Rita (1972) and by the National Academy of Science (1986) report on Electronic Aids for the Blind.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} constraint-based haptic {{rendering}} algorithm for arbitrary point cloud data. With the recent proliferation of low-cost range sensors, 3 D point cloud data {{is readily available}} at high update rates. Challenges in haptic rendering of this data arise due to noise and poorly defined surface composition. We propose that point cloud data can be rendered as an implicit surface, which can be formulated to be mathematically smooth and efficient for computing interaction forces. This method is resistant to sensor noise, makes no assumptions about surface connectivity or orientation, and has fast pre-processing suitable for streaming data from a sensor. Applications to <b>remote</b> telerobotic <b>manipulation</b> are discussed. I...|$|R

50|$|Astronauts {{experiencing}} weightlessness {{will often}} lose their orientation, get motion sickness, and lose {{their sense of}} direction as their bodies try {{to get used to}} a weightless environment. When they get back to Earth, or any other mass with gravity, they have to readjust to the gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. Importantly, those body motor disturbances after changing from different gravities only get worse the longer the exposure to little gravity. These changes will affect operational activities including approach and landing, docking, <b>remote</b> <b>manipulation,</b> and emergencies that may happen while landing.

40|$|User {{interfaces}} for <b>remote</b> robotic <b>manipulation</b> widely lack sufficient {{support for}} situation awareness and, consequently, can induce high mental workload. With poor situation awareness, operators {{may fail to}} notice task-relevant features in the environment often leading the robot to collide with the environment. With high workload, operators may not perform well {{over long periods of}} time and may feel stressed. We present an ecological visualization that improves operator situation awareness. Our user study shows that operators using the ecological interface collided with the environment on average half as many times compared with a typical interface even with a poorly calibrated 3 D sensor; however, users performed more quickly with the typical interface possibly because of the poor calibration. ...|$|R

5000|$|While others {{disagree}} on theoretical grounds and state that dependable high, non-fizzle level yields, can be achieved, {{arguing that it}} would be [...] "relatively easy" [...] for a well funded entity with access to fusion boosting tritium and expertise to overcome the problem of predetonation created by Pu-240, and that a <b>remote</b> <b>manipulation</b> facility could be utilized in the assembly of the highly radioactive gamma ray emitting bomb components, coupled with a means of cooling the weapon pit during storage to prevent the plutonium charge contained in the pit from melting, and a design that kept the implosion mechanisms high explosives from being degraded by the pits heat. However, with all these major design considerations included, this fusion boosted reactor grade plutonium primary will still fizzle if the fission component of the primary does not deliver more than 0.2 kilotons of yield, which is regarded as the minimum energy necessary to start a fusion burn. The probability that such a device would fail to achieve this threshold yield increases as the burnup value of the fuel increases.|$|E

At school, she's an ace student and popular with boys. Her reason for joining élDLIVE was because she refused to follow the path her father laid out for her. She lost six months' worth of memories because of her role as a patient in a project called the Taklimakan Project, where patients have SPH organs implanted into them. The operation also caused residual illnesses and she has to take pills to stave them off, though she does not know their true purpose, thinking that they're environmental adaptation pills. She acts coldly towards Chūta when he first joined élDLIVE because she thought he wouldn't take the job seriously, but begins to warm up to him as they work more together and when he proved her innocence during the <b>remote</b> <b>manipulation</b> case. However, after Dolugh's upgrade she began avoiding him due to his smell suddenly changing, but manages to overcome that with the help of Dr. Love. She's also friends with Veronica and Ninotchka because they joined élDLIVE around the same time, though she and Veronica also fight a lot due to their rivalry.

This system eliminates the effects of communication time delays in <b>remote</b> robot <b>manipulation.</b> The simulator provides the operator with predictive display and feedback of computed contact forces through a six-degree of freedom (6 -DOF) master arm on a real-time basis. With this system, peg-in-hole tasks involving round-trip communication time delays of up to a few seconds were performed at three support levels: a real image alone, a predictive display with a real image, and a real-time graphic simulator with computed-contact-force reflection and a predictive display. The experimental results indicate the best teleoperation efficiency was achieved by using the force-reflecting simulator with two images. The shortest work time, lowest sensor maximum, and a 100 percent success rate were obtained. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of simulated-force-reflecting teleoperation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology has {{launched}} in 2000 a new programme {{to promote the}} use of New Learning Technologies (NLT) at the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology. The goal of this programme is to encourage a reform of traditional teaching through the innovative application of Information and Communication Technologies. In this framework, the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) has started the eMersion project, a multidisciplinary effort to deploy innovative pedagogical scenarios and flexible learning resources for carrying out virtual and real experiments via the Internet. The eMersion project aims at promoting a pedagogical trial-and-error paradigm by enhancing the opportunities for engineering trainees to carry out extensive experimentation in their education curriculum. The proposed approach relies on the benefits {{to be gained from}} alternative means of experimentation that allow the students to reinforce their understanding of physical phenomena in a framework where errors are neither penalized nor hazardous. The production of practice-oriented pedagogical components is directed toward the use of various existing tools to provide students with facilities to experiment through simulations, virtual and enhanced reality based manipulations as well as <b>remote</b> <b>manipulations</b> of laboratory setups. In {{the first part of this}} paper, the revised pedagogical scenarios that are envisioned for further deployments in automatic control, fluid mechanics and biomechanics are presented. Those three expertise domains of the Mechanical Engineering Department have been selected as trial candidates due to their respective needs for more flexible and practice-oriented facilities. In the second part of this paper, the NLT resources enabling the eMersion paradigm are introduced. The key components are Web-based documents describing the experimental setups and the protocols to be carry out, cockpit-like GUIs for running the virtual or real experiments in a highly interactive manner, and last but not least an original electronic journal shared by a team of students that collaborate to fulfill the hands-on sessions requirements...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to label}} neurons and {{to monitor their}} {{activity}} with genetically encoded fluorescent reporters have been a staple of neuroscience research for several years.
