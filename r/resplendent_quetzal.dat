25|$|Trogons are {{territorial}} and monogamous. Males {{will respond}} quickly to playbacks of their calls and will repel {{other members of}} the same species and even other hole-nesting species from around their nesting sites. Males attract females by singing, and, {{in the case of the}} <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal,</b> undertaking display flights. Some species have been observed in small flocks of 3–12 individuals prior to and sometimes during the breeding season, calling and chasing each other, but the function of these flocks is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are {{generally}} sedentary, with no species known to undertake long migrations. A {{small number of}} species are known to make smaller migratory movements, particularly montane species which move to lower altitudes during different seasons. This has been demonstrated using radio tracking in the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> in Costa Rica and evidence has been accumulated {{for a number of}} other species. The Narina trogon of Africa is thought to undertake some localised short distance migrations over parts of its range, for example birds of Zimbabwe's plateau savannah depart after the breeding season. A complete picture of these movements is however lacking. Trogons are difficult to study as their thick tarsi (feet bones) make ringing studies difficult.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Bird life in {{the forests}} of the central region {{includes}} <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzals,</b> goldfinches, hummingbirds, jays and toucanets.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "song" [...] is a treble {{syllable}} {{described as}} kyow or like [...] "a whimpering pup", often in pairs, {{which may be}} repeated monotonously. <b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> have other unmusical calls as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> {{are weak}} fliers. Their known predators include the ornate hawk-eagle, golden eagle, and other hawks and owls as adults, emerald toucanets, brown jays, long-tailed weasels, squirrels, and the {{kinkajou}} as nestlings or eggs.|$|R
25|$|Over 840 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal,</b> scarlet macaw, three-wattled bellbird, bare-necked umbrellabird, and the keel-billed toucan. The Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance. Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and amphibians, including the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis).|$|E
500|$|Figs are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} potential keystone species in communities of fruit-eating animals because of their [...] fruiting patterns. Nathaniel Wheelwright reports that emerald toucanets fed on unripe F. aurea fruit at times of fruit scarcity in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Wheelwright listed the species as a year-round food source for the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> at the same site. In the Florida Keys, F. aurea {{is one of five}} fruit species that dominate the diet fed by white-crowned pigeons to their nestlings. F. aurea is also important in the diet of mammalian frugivores—both fruit and young leaves are consumed by black howler monkeys in Belize.|$|E
2500|$|Trogons are {{generally}} inactive outside of infrequent feeding flights. Among birdwatchers and biologists {{it has been}} noted that [...] "part from their great beauty [...] are notorious ... for their lack of other immediately engaging qualities". Their lack of activity is possibly a defence against predation; trogons on all continents {{have been reported to}} shift about on branches to always keep their less brightly coloured backs turned towards observers, while their heads, which like owls can turn through 180 degrees, keep a watch on the watcher. Trogons have reportedly been preyed upon by hawks and predatory mammals; one report was of a <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> taken while brooding young by a margay.|$|E
50|$|<b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> are {{considered}} specialized fruit-eaters, although they mix their diet with insects (notably wasps, ants, and larvae), frogs and lizards. Particularly important are wild avocados and other {{fruit of the}} laurel family, which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the pits, which helps to disperse these trees.|$|R
25|$|Animals {{thought to}} {{represent}} Quetzalcoatl include <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzals,</b> rattlesnakes (coatl meaning serpent in Nahuatl), crows, and macaws. In his form as Ehecatl {{he is the}} wind, and is represented by spider monkeys, ducks, and the wind itself. In his form as the morning star, Venus, he is also depicted as a harpy eagle. In Mazatec legends, the astrologer deity Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, who is also represented by Venus, bears {{a close relationship with}} Quetzalcoatl.|$|R
50|$|<b>Resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> have a {{green body}} (showing {{iridescence}} from green-gold to blue-violet) and red breast. Their green upper tail coverts hide their tails and in breeding males are particularly splendid, being {{longer than the}} rest of the body. The primary wing coverts are also unusually long and give a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like crest. The bill, which is partly covered by green filamentous feathers, is yellow in mature males and black in females.|$|R
2500|$|The trogons as {{a family}} are fairly uniform in appearance, having compact bodies and long tails (very long {{in the case of}} the quetzals), and short necks. Trogons range in size from the 23cm, 40 gram scarlet-rumped trogon to the 40cm, 210 gram <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal</b> (not {{including}} the male quetzal's [...] tail streamers). Their legs and feet are weak and short, and trogons are essentially unable to walk beyond a very occasional shuffle along a branch. They are even incapable of turning around on a branch without using their wings. The ratio of leg muscle to body weight in trogons is only 3 percent, the lowest known ratio of any bird. The arrangement of toes on the feet of trogons is also unique among birds, although essentially resembling the zygodactyl’s two forward two backward arrangement of parrots and other near-passerines, the actual toes are arranged with usually inner hallux being the outer hind toe, an arrangement that is referred to as heterodactylous. The strong bill is short and the gape wide, particularly in the fruit eating quetzals, with a slight hook at the end. There is also a notch at the end of the bill and many species have slight serrations in the mandibles. The skin is exceptionally tender, making preparation of study skins difficult for museum curators. The skeletons of trogons are surprisingly slender, particularly the skulls which are very thin. The plumage of many species is iridescent, although most of the Asian species are not. The African trogons are generally green on the back with red bellies. The New World trogons similarly have green or deep blue upperparts but are more varied in their lowerparts. The Asian species tend towards red underparts and brown backs.|$|E

5000|$|The park covers 12,500 acres (5,058 ha) and two life zones—lower montane {{rainforest}} and pre-montane rainforest. These forests provide {{habitat for}} some 45 mammal species, including the Baird's tapir, kinkajou, white-faced capuchin monkey, paca, agouti, ocelet, and jaguarundi. The park's 400 bird species include sparrow hawks, <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzals,</b> emerald toucanets, and violaceous trogons. There are 28 species of reptiles and amphibians, {{and a large}} insect population that includes the thysania agrippina, the largest moth on the American continent.|$|R
5000|$|... (May 29, 2001)The misty rain forests, {{rivers and}} {{beautiful}} white sand beaches of Costa Rica {{are home to}} one of the most diverse assemblages of life on Earth. Along the coast, giant crocodiles fight for the right to mate, while in the trees, troops of capuchin, squirrel and howler monkeys, as well as <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> and beautiful songbirds, forage for food above the forest floor that is home to Hercules beetles, deadly army ants and poison dart frogs. On the sandy beaches hatchling sea turtles emerge by the thousands to race to the safety of the sea and, though few survive and reach open ocean, enough return to lay their eggs and complete the cycle of life unique to this Eden called Costa Rica.|$|R
2500|$|In general, Chiapas has a humid, {{tropical}} climate. In the north, in {{the area}} bordering Tabasco, near Teapa, rainfall can average more than [...] per year. In the past, natural vegetation at this region was lowland, tall perennial rainforest, but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely {{to give way to}} agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the Pacific Ocean, but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near Tapachula. On the several parallel [...] "sierras" [...] or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy, allowing the development of cloud forests like those of the Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo, home to a handful of <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzals</b> and horned guans.|$|R

50|$|In Mesoamerica, Persea proliferated {{into many}} new species, and the berries {{of some of}} them {{constitute}} a valuable food supply for quetzals, trogoniform birds {{that live in the}} montane rainforests of Mesoamerica. In particular, the <b>resplendent</b> <b>quetzal's</b> favorite fruits are berries of wild relatives of the avocado. Their differing maturing times in the cloudforest determine the migratory movements of the quetzals to differing elevation levels in the forests. With a gape width of 21 mm, the quetzal swallows the small berry (aquacatillo) whole, which he catches while flying through the lower canopy of the tree, and then regurgitates the seed within 100 m from the tree. Wheelright in 1983 observed that parent quetzals take far less time intervals to deliver fruits to the young brood than insects or lizards, reflecting the ease of procuring fruits, as opposed to capturing animal prey. Since the young are fed exclusively berries in the first 2 weeks after hatching, these berries must be of high nutritional value. Usually only the total percentage of water, sugar, nitrogen, crude fats and carbohydrates are reported by ornithologists.|$|R
