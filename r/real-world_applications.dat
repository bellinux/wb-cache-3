It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. <b>Real-world</b> <b>applications</b> relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E

25|$|In {{practical}} terms, these complexity results {{suggested that}} while Bayesian networks were rich representations for AI and machine learning applications, {{their use in}} large <b>real-world</b> <b>applications</b> {{would need to be}} tempered by either topological structural constraints, such as naïve Bayes networks, or by restrictions on the conditional probabilities. The bounded variance algorithm was the first provable fast approximation algorithm to efficiently approximate probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks with guarantees on the error approximation. This powerful algorithm required the minor restriction on the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network to be bounded away from zero and one by 1/p(n) where p(n) was any polynomial on the number of nodes in the network n.|$|E

25|$|The mouth lies in {{the centre}} of the oral surface in regular urchins, or towards one end in {{irregular}} urchins. It is surrounded by lips of softer tissue, with numerous small, bony pieces embedded in it. This area, called the peristome, also includes five pairs of modified tube feet and, in many species, five pairs of gills. On the upper surface, opposite the mouth, is the periproct, which surrounds the anus. The periproct contains a variable number of hard plates, depending on species, one of which contains the madreporite.

25|$|Wisconsin state {{government}} and the University of Wisconsin–Madison remain the two largest Madison employers. However, Madison's economy today is evolving from a government-based economy to a consumer services and high-tech base, particularly in the health, biotech and advertising sectors. Beginning in the early 1990s, the city experienced a steady economic boom and has been less affected by recession than {{other areas of the}} state. Much of the expansion has occurred on the city's south and west sides, but it has also affected the east side near the Interstate 39-90-94 interchange and along the northern shore of Lake Mendota. Underpinning the boom is the development of high-tech companies, many fostered by UW–Madison working with local businesses and entrepreneurs to transfer the results of academic research into <b>real-world</b> <b>applications,</b> especially bio-tech applications.|$|E

500|$|Between 1703 and 1705, Leibniz {{corresponded with}} Jakob after {{learning}} about his discoveries in probability {{from his brother}} Johann. Leibniz managed to provide thoughtful criticisms on Bernoulli's law of large number, but failed to provide Bernoulli with de Witt's work on annuities that he so desired. From the outset, Bernoulli wished for his work to demonstrate that combinatorics and probability theory would have numerous <b>real-world</b> <b>applications</b> in all facets of society—in the line of Graunt's and de Witt's work— and {{would serve as a}} rigorous method of logical reasoning under insufficient evidence, as used in courtrooms and in moral judgements. It was also hoped that the theory of probability could provide comprehensive and consistent method of reasoning, where ordinary reasoning might be overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation. Thus the title Ars Conjectandi was chosen: [...] a link to the concept of ars inveniendi from scholasticism, which provided the symbolic link to pragmatism he desired and also {{as an extension of the}} prior Ars Cogitandi.|$|E

500|$|Infinite {{networks}} are largely of only theoretical interest {{and are the}} plaything of mathematicians. [...] Infinite networks that are not constrained by real-world restrictions can have some very unphysical properties. [...] For instance Kirchhoff's laws can fail in some cases and infinite resistor ladders can be defined which have a driving-point impedance which depends on the termination at infinity. [...] Another unphysical property of theoretical infinite networks is that, in general, they will dissipate infinite power unless constraints are placed on them {{in addition to the}} usual network laws such as Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. [...] There are, however, some <b>real-world</b> <b>applications.</b> [...] The transmission line example is one of a class of practical problems that can be modelled by infinitesimal elements (the distributed element model). [...] Other examples are launching waves into a continuous medium, fringing field problems, and measurement of resistance between points of a substrate or down a borehole.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{approach}} for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems using a steady state GA and reduced models. Our method called Objective Exchange Genetic Algorithm for Design optimization (OEGADO) is intended for solving <b>real-world</b> <b>application</b> problems that have many consmints and very small feasible regions. OEGADO runs several GAs concurrently with each GA optimizing one objective and exchanging information about its objective with others. Empirical results in benchmark and engineering design domains are presented. A comparison between OEGADO and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) shows that OEGADO performed better than NSGA-II for difficult problems, and found Pareto-optimal solutions in fewer objective evaluations. The results suggest that our method may be better for solving <b>real-world</b> <b>application</b> problems wherein the objective computation time is large...|$|R

Due to most former modern computing architectures having 32-bit memory address space limitations, which imposes a hard limit of 4GB {{on the size of}} any database using such techniques, the effectiveness of the technique of directly mapping a database into a single-level store was strictly limited. [...] However, today's 64-bit processors now mostly implement 48-bit address spaces, giving access to 47-bit addresses or 128 terabytes of database size, making databases using shared memory useful once again in <b>real-world</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
