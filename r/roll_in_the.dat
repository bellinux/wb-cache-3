More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E

Comparing {{the crystal}} {{orientation}} of the structure, tensile properties, boiling water shrinkage rate between difference filament <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same spinning position spun by WINGS POY system and tradition ACW POY system, {{it is found that}} there are differences in orientation degree, crystallinity, tensile strength, elongation at break, initial modulus and boiling water shrinkage rate between difference filament <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same spinning position.

5|$|Tumbleweeds, {{which are}} the {{above-ground}} portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include Kali tragus (also known as Salsola tragus), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and has gained {{a reputation as a}} noxious weed. Fungi of the genus Bovista are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E

25|$|Once a float {{lands on}} a beach, it may <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surf and become etched by sand. Many glass floats show {{distinctive}} wear patterns from the corrosive forces of sand, sun, and salt water.

Other floats have small amounts of water trapped inside of them. This water apparently enters the floats through microscopic imperfections in the glass while the floats are suspended in Arctic ice or held under water by netting.|$|E
25|$|A similar problem {{affected}} {{some models}} of the Supermarine Spitfire. At high speeds, the ailerons could apply more torque than the Spitfire's thin wings could handle, and the entire wing would twist in the opposite direction. This meant that the plane would <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction opposite to that which the pilot intended, {{and led to a}} number of accidents. Earlier models weren't fast enough for this to be a problem, and so it wasn't noticed until later model Spitfires like the Mk.IX started to appear. This was mitigated by adding considerable torsional rigidity to the wings, and was wholly cured when the Mk.XIV was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in the sunlight, and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E

40|$|The {{turbulent}} Ekman {{boundary layer}} (EBL) {{has been studied}} in {{a large number of}} theoretical, laboratory and modeling works since F. Nansen's observations during the Norwegian Polar Expedition 1893 – 1896. Nevertheless, the proposed analytical models, analysis of the EBL instabilities, and turbulence-resolving numerical simulations are not fully consistent. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> role of turbulence self-organization into longitudinal <b>roll</b> vortices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EBL and its dependence on the meridional component of the Coriolis force remain unclear. A new set of large-eddy simulations (LES) are presented in this study. LES were performed for eight different latitudes (from 1 ° N to 90 ° N) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domain spanning 144 km <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meridional direction. Geostrophic winds from the west and from the east were used to drive the development of EBL turbulence. The emergence and growth of longitudinal <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EBL was simulated. <b>The</b> simulated <b>rolls</b> are <b>in</b> good agreement with EBL stability analysis given in Dubos et al. (2008). <b>The</b> destruction of <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> westerly flow at low latitude was observed in simulations, which agrees well with the action of secondary instability on <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EBL. This study quantifies the effect of the meridional component of the Coriolis force and <b>the</b> effect of <b>rolls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EBL on the internal EBL parameters such as friction velocity, cross-isobaric angle, parameters of the EBL depth and resistance laws. A large impact of the roll development or destruction is found. The depth of <b>the</b> EBL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> westerly flow is about five times less than it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> easterly flow at low latitudes. The EBL parameters, which depend on the depth, also exhibit large difference in these two types of the EBL. Thus, this study supports the need to include the horizontal component of the Coriolis force into theoretical constructions and parameterizations of <b>the</b> boundary layer <b>in</b> models...|$|R

This loss fueled him to take the 12th Asahi Pro Best Ten undefeated, which made him look incredibly powerful, as all the opponents were 9-dan. The victory made him the youngest title holder ever in Japan. He lost {{in the second round of}} the 30th Honinbo preliminary to Toshihiro Shimamura 9-dan. Even though he had a second chance to take the match against Masao Kato—due to a triple ko—he still lost. He was on a <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1st Tengen league, until he was defeated by Shuzo Ohira. He didn't get far in the rest of the tournaments that year.
