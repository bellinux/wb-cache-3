25|$|Traditionally, the Speaker {{has been}} a member of the {{governing}} party, current Speaker Darryl Plecas being an exception; however, while holding the office of Speaker that MLA must act neutrally and treat all other MLAs impartially, and to preserve this impartiality the Speaker follows Speaker Denison's rule in breaking ties. The Speaker presides over the debates and procedures of the Legislative Assembly. The Speaker enforces the Rules of Procedure, commonly referred to as the Standing Orders. Any disputes or procedural rulings are made according to the Standing Orders or, in absence of a <b>rule</b> <b>governing</b> a specific situation, to parliamentary precedence and convention. The Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie.|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> {{natural language}} quantifiers (e. g. "all," "some," "most") neither coincide with nor resemble the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the analogues of those expressions {{that occur in}} the artificial languages used by semanticists. Some semanticists, e. g. Peter Strawson, have put forth data-consistent hypotheses as to the identities of the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> some natural-language quantifiers. But, despite their obvious merits, those hypotheses have been universally rejected. In this paper, it is shown that those hypotheses are indeed correct. Moreover, data-consistent hypotheses are put forth as to the identities of the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the words "most" and "many," the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> which semanticists have thus far been unable to identify. The points made in this paper are anticipated in a paper, published in the same issue of the Journal of Pragmatics, by Andrzej Boguslawski...|$|R

25|$|No {{satisfactory}} explanation can as yet {{be given}} for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine {{the proportion of the}} two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though {{it is not possible to}} formulate a <b>rule</b> <b>governing</b> it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.|$|E

2500|$|Linguists {{focusing}} on structure {{attempt to understand}} the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously). [...] All linguistic structures {{can be broken down}} into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis. [...] For instance, consider the structure of the word [...] "tenth" [...] on two different levels of analysis. [...] On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word [...] "tenth" [...] is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality. [...] The <b>rule</b> <b>governing</b> the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker [...] "th" [...] follows the number [...] "ten." [...] On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the [...] "n" [...] sound in [...] "tenth" [...] is made differently from the [...] "n" [...] sound in [...] "ten" [...] spoken alone. [...] Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of [...] "tenth", they are less often aware of the <b>rule</b> <b>governing</b> its sound structure. [...] Linguists focused on structure find and analyse rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.|$|E
2500|$|The Taichung Police Commissioner, Hu Mu-yuan (...) {{resigned}} on , {{partly because}} he did not report the case to the National Police Agency and Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu until several days after the murder occurred and partly because of the poor quality of the police report, although the presence of police officers during the shooting led many to suspect police corruption. Later investigations revealed that Weng was indeed closely connected with the Taichung City Police Department, prompting the issue of a new <b>rule</b> <b>governing</b> relationships between police and gang members. At the time, Taichung was well known for having a high crime rate, potentially due to police corruption. Although the crime rate in Taichung decreased later in 2010, critics would continue to criticize Mayor Hu's efforts to reduce crimes throughout his tenure.|$|E
