50|$|Priced {{considerably}} {{higher than the}} Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting, electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade , and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts'. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning compressor clutch. Other options include floor vents or air conditioning , AM/FM radio , cruise control , <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> <b>rack</b> , rear window wiper , various seat styles and fabrics , removable sunroof , right hand mirror , TRX tires and shocks , child seat , and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.|$|E
5000|$|Mebetoys {{models were}} known for {{well-done}} castings (Rixon 2005, p. 80). Some were very clever model selections {{such as the}} Autobianchi A66 Elaf petroleum with a <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> <b>rack</b> carrying two large plastic oil barrels, or the Porsche 912 Rally (a 911 in rally form) with rock guards in thin yellow plastic strips covering the front windshield and hood and also featuring red and chrome body and bumper supports which extended from front to rear bumper. This car, in 1:43 scale, was topped off, literally, with three spare tires on the roof. Mebetoys Innocenti Mini (Italian-made mini) appeared in several different guises - including with skis and sled on its roof rack. Other models were unique {{because they were not}} offered elsewhere, like the ISO Fidia S4 grand touring sedan. Politoys had the Rivolta and Corgi and Matchbox made the Grifo ubiquitous, but nobody else made the Fidia S4. Models such as the Lamborghini Urraco, Maserati Bora, Toyota 2000 GT, and Ferrari 365 GTC-4 were also special and not often seen in 1:43 scale. Corgi Toys made the Bora, but the Mebetoys version was much better proportioned, detailed and painted (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 74). Sinclair's Auto Miniatures, largely responsible for bringing the diecast collector hobby to the United States, discussed that many people were not aware that Mebetoys also made a few promotional issue diecast cars (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). In the 1960s the company issued a couple of 1:24 scale Alfa Romeos, referred to as the [...] "le veterane" [...] set. These two cars were a 1925 P2 World Champion Grand Prix car and a 1951 Alfetta racer. They had exquisite detail with rubber tires and were mounted on a wood base with a decorative identification plate and covered with a clear plastic display box. These were reissued in the late 1970s (Sinclair's 1977).|$|E

Also, the North American Outback has lower side body claddings, which are not applied to international models (although the cladding may come on international models as a dealer-installed option). The interior retractable rear cargo cover has a separate storage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover can be removed for large items but stored inside the vehicle {{and out of the}} way. The rear seatbacks can be partially reclined for comfort.|$|R
50|$|Most models did {{not have}} many accessories, unlike the {{competitors}} Minialuxe, but a few items like roof skis did occasionally appear, like on the Panhard Dyna (Ralston 2008, p. 32). After about 1960, opening features began to appear on some - like the opening doors on the Renault 4 van or the Land Rover Expedition, which also featured a spare tire and <b>roof</b> <b>luggage</b> / equipment <b>rack.</b> Also, different companies would often be advertised {{on the sides of}} the model trucks and vans, like Locatel telephone, Cibie lights, or Fleury Michon, a provider of meat products (Ralston 2008, p. 33).|$|R

25|$|However, these <b>luggage</b> <b>racks</b> {{were always}} underutilised. Travellers {{preferred}} {{holding on to}} their bags where they were standing or sitting, as opposed to placing them on the <b>luggage</b> <b>racks,</b> probably due to convenience and fear of theft. Some commuters were also complaining that these racks took up critically needed space which could be occupied by other passengers which often filled the train. Furthermore, the service to Changi Airport was cancelled and replaced by a shuttle service to and from Tanah Merah station, dismissing {{the need to provide}} these racks for non-airport bound train services. Therefore, in 2003, trains with the <b>luggage</b> <b>racks</b> had them removed, and replaced with an empty standing area, with a dual purpose of serving as a wheelchair area.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} Changi Airport Line was opened, {{some of these}} trains plying the East West Line had <b>luggage</b> <b>racks</b> {{installed}}.
