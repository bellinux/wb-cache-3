40|$|This Comment {{describes}} a New Jersey Supreme Court in detail, {{along with the}} current state of both federal and state leave laws and federal and state pregnancy discrimination laws. Next, this Comment argues that it is the interaction of federal and state leave laws that most often creates a gap in leave and that this gap produces a disparate impact on pregnant employees, which violates the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. It also examines the most common misinterpretations courts make when examining pregnant employees’ <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> under anti-discrimination laws. In conclusion, this Comment advocates for the treatment of pregnancy as one singular condition under leave laws, because a holistic approach would more closely mirror women’s real world experience with pregnancy and prevent discriminatory gaps...|$|E

40|$|The EU Water Framework Directive {{stipulates}} {{the principle}} of cost recovery, including environmental and resource costs, for European water services. Yet a definition of member states' precise obligations is highly controversial. This particularly holds true for the question whether the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> cost <b>recovery</b> can be restricted to water supply and wastewater disposal only, as many member states argue. The European Court of Justice has now decided on the Commission's infringement proceedings against Germany regarding {{the scope of the}} term 'water services'. In its eagerly awaited substantive decision, the Court dismissed the Commission's action as unfounded but left the door open for further claims. However, many legal arguments in favour of a strict interpretation of cost recovery are not only misleading but also pass up valuable opportunities to deal with scarce water resources in an efficient way...|$|R
5000|$|The Ninth Circuit {{refused to}} grant Veoh attorney's fees under 17 USC § 505 because {{it found that}} the suit was not frivilous or in bad faith, citing Fogerty v. Fantasy. [...] However, it also denied Veoh's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> fee <b>recovery</b> under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 68, which states that if a party refuses a {{settlement}} offer, and final decision is less favorable for the party than the offer, that such a party {{would be responsible for}} paying the counterparty's fees subject to the underlying statute (17 USC § 505 in this case). The Circuit reasoned that Rule 68 did not apply even though Veoh did offer a settlement since it had already decided to not award fees under 17 USC § 505, and that Rule 68 does not apply to prevailing defendants. [...] This {{has been a source of}} confusion and controversy, since prevailing defendants would not need Rule 68 which awards less than 17 USC § 505, and losing defendants would never be eligible for Rule 68 because 17 USC § 505 only applies to prevailing defendants.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{complexity}} of hydrocarbon projects and the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> higher <b>recovery</b> rates have driven the oil-and-gas industry {{to look for}} a more-detailed understanding of the subsurface formation to optimize recovery of oil and profitability. Despite the significant successes of geophysical techniques in determining changes within the reservoir, the benefits from individually mapping the information are limited. Although seismic techniques have been the main approach for imaging the subsurface, the weak density contrast between water and oil has made electromagnetic (EM) technology an attractive complement to improve fluid distinction, especially for high-saline water. This crosswell technology assumes greater importance for obtaining higher-resolution images of the interwell regions to more accurately characterize the reservoir and track fluid-front developments. In this study, an ensemble-Kalman-based history-matching framework is proposed for directly incorporating crosswell time-lapse seismic and EM data into the history-matching process. The direct incorporation of the time-lapse seismic and EM data into the history-matching process exploits the complementarity of these data to enhance subsurface characterization, to incorporate interwell information, and to avoid biases that may be incurred from separate inversions of the geophysical data for attributes. An extensive analysis with 2 D and realistic 3 D reservoirs illustrates the robustness and enhanced forecastability of critical reservoir variables. The 2 D reservoir provides {{a better understanding of the}} connection between fluid discrimination and enhanced history matches, and the 3 D reservoir demonstrates its applicability to a realistic reservoir. History-matching enhancements (in terms of reduction in the history-matching error) when incorporating both seismic and EM data averaged approximately 50 % for the 2 D case, and approximately 30 % for the 3 D case, and permeability estimates were approximately 25 % better compared with a standard history matching with only production data...|$|R
40|$|A {{mail survey}} of 810 Greater Vancouver Area {{residents}} investigated how the public's {{acceptance of a}} <b>request</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia {{was influenced by the}} method of death (e. g., lethal injection vs. withdrawal of life-support) and by the identity of the patient featured in a vignette (e. g., stranger vs. oneself). The study also identified considerations people found most important in deciding whether a patient's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia was legitimate (e. g., patient's pain, chance <b>for</b> <b>recovery).</b> Life-support withdrawal was found significantly more acceptable (90 % support) than a lethal injection (79 % support), yet the identity of the person involved did not affect the acceptability of euthanasia. However, a factor analysis suggested that the decisions about oneself may be more complex and more closely scrutinized than decisions about others. The considerations rated most important by participants paralleled legal guidelines from the Netherlands and Oregon...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, a new {{generation}} of recyclers has developed throughout the state of California. Hundreds of businesses reuse, recycle, and compost materials source-separated from construction and demolition (C&D) projects. A significant new development, however, is the availability of mixed C&D processors. Mixed C&D processors accept C&D materials in a mixed form and process them <b>for</b> <b>recovery.</b> Processors use a variety of hand labor, specialized materials handling equipment, and mechanized sorting systems to accomplish this heavy task. Communities that have a mixed C&D processor within an economical haul distance can now be comfortable in requiring that most C&D debris generated in their communities be processed <b>for</b> maximum <b>recovery</b> prior to landfilling. If mixed C&D processing facilities are not available, communities could work to develop them or issue a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> proposals for the service of mixed C&D processing.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) examine whether need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> differs between workers (i) not on-call, (ii) on-call but not called and (iii) on-call and called, and (2) investigate the associations between age, health, work and social characteristics with need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> the three scenarios (i–iii). Cross-sectional data of N = 169 Dutch distal on-call workers were analysed with multivariate logistic regression. Need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> differed significantly between the three scenarios (i–iii), with lowest need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> scenario (i) ‘not on-call’ and highest need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> scenario (iii) ‘on-call and called’. Poor mental health and high work–family interference were associated with higher need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> in all three scenarios (i–iii), whereas high work demands was only associated with being on-call (ii and iii). The results suggest that the mere possibility of being called affects the need <b>for</b> <b>recovery,</b> especially in workers reporting poor mental health, high-work demands and work–family interference. Practitioner summary: On-call work is a scarcely studied but demanding working time arrangement. We examined need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> and its associations with age, health, work and social characteristics among distal on-call workers.

40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} is to address the {{relationship}} between hearing status and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery.</b> In addition, the role of hearing status in the relationship between psychosocial work characteristics (i. e. job demands and job control) and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> was assessed. The sample comprised 925 normally-hearing and hearing-impaired working adults (aged 18 - 65 years) participating in the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. Hearing status was determined using the national hearing (speech-in-noise) test over the internet. Psychosocial work characteristics and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> were assessed using the job content questionnaire and the Dutch questionnaire on the experience and assessment of work. Regression models revealed a significant association between hearing status and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> after work, poorer hearing leading to an increasing need <b>for</b> <b>recovery.</b> Additionally, poorer hearing led to a higher odds for risky levels of need <b>for</b> <b>recovery.</b> Hearing status did not influence the significant relationship between psychosocial work characteristics (i. e. job demand and job control) and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> after work.
