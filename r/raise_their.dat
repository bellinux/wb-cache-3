5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E

5|$|Nurkse {{stressed}} productivity as {{the primary}} determinant {{of the size of}} the market. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.|$|E

5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, they spread their pincers {{and in some cases}} <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{functions}} of the queen ant sounds are to recruit workers, smell nestmates, and facilitate oral exchanges of food and pheromones.

5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> bodies side-by-side while treading water.|$|E

Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Henson and {{his wife}} moved to New York City, where the newly formed Muppets, Inc., would reside for some time. Jane quit {{performing}} to <b>raise</b> <b>their</b> children.
