5000|$|In {{financial}} mathematics and stochastic optimization, {{the concept of}} risk measure is used to quantify the risk involved in a random outcome or <b>risk</b> <b>position.</b> Many risk measures have hitherto been proposed, each having certain characteristics. The entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) is a coherent risk measure introduced by Ahmadi-Javid, which is an upper bound for the value at risk (VaR) and the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), obtained from the Chernoff inequality. The EVaR can also be represented by using the concept of relative entropy. Because of its connection with the VaR and the relative entropy, this risk measure is called [...] "entropic value-at-risk". The EVaR was developed to tackle some computational inefficiencies of the CVaR. Getting inspiration from the dual representation of the EVaR, Ahmadi-Javid developed a wide class of coherent risk measures, called g-entropic risk measures. Both the CVaR and the EVaR are members of this class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Knee joint {{proprioception}} combines {{sensory input}} {{from a variety}} of afferent receptors that encompasses the sensations of joint position and motion. Poor proprioception is one of the risk factors of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Most studies have favored testing knee joint position sense in the sagittal plane and non-weight-bearing position. One of the most common mechanisms of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury is dynamic knee valgus. No study has measured joint position sense in a manner relevant to the mechanism of injury. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} measure knee joint position sense in the noncontact anterior cruciate liga-ment injury <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> and normal condition. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty healthy male athletes participated in the study. Joint position sense was evaluated by active reproduction of the anterior cruciate ligament injury <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> and normal condition. The dominant knees of subjects were tested. [Results] The results showed less accu-rate knee joint position sense in the noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> rather than the normal condition. [Conclusion] The poorer joint position sense in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> compared with the normal condition may contribute to the increased incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury...|$|E

It is suggested that a broader analytical repertoire may support development of insight into the nature and speed of change during turbulent phases of IT-enabled modernization. We present empirical data from a two-year research project studying strategic responses to the competitive emergence of electronic trading at the major international financial futures exchanges (1998 - 200).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} farmland {{investment decisions}} using a stochastic dynamic programming framework. Consideration {{is given to}} the dynamic, stochastic nature of farmland returns, linkages between farmland returns and farmland prices, and the effects of the above dynamic factors on a farm's financial structure. Optimal decisions to purchase or sell farmland are found for a central Illinois farm with high quality farmland. Sizes and debt distributions are then determined, given that the optimal decision rule is followed. Decisions from the dynamic programming model also are compared to a capital budgeting model. Key words: farmland investments, risk, stochastic dynamic programming. Land transactions have significant impacts on a farm's profitability and financial structure. Much research has analyzed various aspects of these impacts with emphasis given to financing firm growth. Using debt capital to finance firm growth requires an increase in leverage posi-tion which increases the firm's <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> (Barry, Hopkin, and Baker), alters the time pattern of cash flows (Ellinger, Barry, and Lins; Lee), reduces its liquidity (Barry and Baker), and may affect the optimal production orga-nization (Baker). Alternative strategies for managing debt and equity capital also affect a firm's <b>risk</b> <b>position</b> (Held and Helmers; Hin-man and Hutton), consumption patterns, and production decisions (Johnson and Boehlje). These financing issues are important when considering farmland purchase or sale deci-sions. Other important factors include the sto-chastic, dynamic nature of farmland returns (Alston; Burt) and linkages between farmland returns and prices (Burt). Most previous stud-ies either assume that future farmland returns and prices are known with certainty or that their distributions are known unconditionally.
