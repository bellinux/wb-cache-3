5|$|The {{connection}} with <b>radon</b> <b>gas</b> was first recognized among miners in the Ore Mountains near Schneeberg, Saxony. Silver has been mined there since 1470, and these mines {{are rich in}} uranium, with its accompanying radium and <b>radon</b> <b>gas.</b> Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the USSR's demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed {{as a cause of}} lung cancer in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The crater {{is located}} at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an {{elevated}} area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous rilles.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to <b>radon</b> <b>gas,</b> asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution.

5|$|Radon is a colorless and odorless gas {{generated}} by the breakdown of radioactive radium, {{which in turn is}} the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, causing about 21,000 deaths each year. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration. <b>Radon</b> <b>gas</b> levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to <b>radon</b> <b>gas.</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of <b>radon</b> <b>gas,</b> supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{private firms}} {{processed}} most uranium ore mined in the United States.

40|$|Vulsini Volcanic {{district}} in Northern Latium (Central Italy) {{is characterized by}} high natural radiation background resulting from the high concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium in the volcanic products.

Soil <b>gas</b> <b>radon</b> concentration ranges between 7 and 176 kBq/m 3 indicating a large degree of variability in the NORM content and behavior of the parent soil material related in particular to the occurrence of two different lithologies. Soil <b>gas</b> <b>radon</b> mapping confirmed the existence of two different areas: one along the shoreline of the Bolsena lake, characterized by low soil radon level, due to a prevailing alluvial lithology; another close to the Bolsena village with high soil radon level due {{to the presence of}} the high radioactive volcanic rocks of the Vulsini volcanic district. Radon risk assessment, based on soil <b>gas</b> <b>radon</b> and permeability data, results in a map where the alluvial area is characterized by a probability to be an area with high Radon Index lower than 20 %, while probabilities higher than 30 % and also above 50 % are found close to the Bolsena village.

25|$|Radium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolRa and atomic number88. It is the sixth element in group 2 of the periodic table, {{also known as}} the alkaline earth metals. Pure radium is silvery-white, but it readily reacts with nitrogen (rather than oxygen) on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride (Ra3N2). All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into <b>radon</b> <b>gas</b> (specifically the isotope radon-222). When radium decays, ionizing radiation is a product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence.|$|E
25|$|Radium (usually in {{the form}} of radium {{chloride}} or radium bromide) was used in medicine to produce <b>radon</b> <b>gas</b> which in turn was used as a cancer treatment; for example, several of these radon sources were used in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. However, many treatments that were used in the early 1900s are not used anymore because of the harmful effects radium bromide exposure caused. Some examples of these effects are anaemia, cancer, and genetic mutations. Safer gamma emitters such as 60Co, which is less costly and available in larger quantities, are usually used today to replace the historical use of radium in this application.|$|E

40|$|<b>Radon</b> <b>gases</b> {{released}} from the ground surface and building materials are the major sources of ionization in the indoor atmosphere. Radon will undergo radioactive decay in the atmosphere by emitting an alpha particle. The alpha and beta particles, and the gama rays from Rn- 222, Rn- 220 and their decay products give up their energy by ionizing the molecules and aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Radon and its progeny concentrations and the electrical conductivity of air due to both polarities were measured simultaneously at a height of 1 m from the floor inside dwellings of Mysore city, India. Diurnal variations of radon and its progeny concentrations show their peak values {{in the early morning}} (0200 to 0600 hrs) throughout the year. Observations show an increase in the concentration of radon and its progeny during night time compared to the daytime values. The electrical conductivity of the atmospheric air also exhibits similar trend.
