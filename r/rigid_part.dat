It was a three-engined biplane with a two step monocoque hull, circular apart from the shallow, curved planing bottom. The fuselage had no internal bulkheads and was deliberately designed to be flexible so as to absorb the shocks of landing, {{though there was a}} rigid section under the wings. As with Saunders' other wooden aircraft, Valkyrie's hull [...] was covered with Consuta sewn stress-bearing plywood. It accommodated a crew of five. There was a pair of open tandem cockpits with dual flying controls well forward of the wing leading edge. Below this, aft and in the hull were the navigation and radio operator's position, and further aft, behind the trailing edge there were two gunners' positions, roughly in tandem but offset port and starboard, each fitted with machine guns on Scarff rings. The gunner's cockpit in the nose was similarly equipped. [...] There were bunks and living space for all five crew in the <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the hull. The fin was large and angular, carrying the braced rectangular tailplane with unbalanced elevators above the top of the hull. [...] The fin also carried a large and prominently balanced rudder with a rudder servo surface on outriggers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to structures, {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} can yield information on the dynamics of {{various parts of the}} protein. This usually involves measuring relaxation times such as T1 and T2 to determine order parameters, correlation times, and chemical exchange rates. NMR relaxation is a consequence of local fluctuating magnetic fields within a molecule. Local fluctuating magnetic fields are generated by molecular motions. In this way, measurements of relaxation times can provide information of motions within a molecule on the atomic level. In NMR studies of protein dynamics the nitrogen-15 isotope is the preferred nucleus to study because its relaxation times are relatively simple to relate to molecular motions [...] This, however, requires isotope labeling of the protein. The T1 and T2 relaxation times can be measured using various types of HSQC-based experiments. The types of motions that can be detected are motions that occur on a time-scale ranging from about 10 picoseconds to about 10 nanoseconds. In addition slower motions, which take place on a time-scale ranging from about 10 microseconds to 100 milliseconds, can also be studied. However, since nitrogen atoms are found mainly in the backbone of a protein, the results mainly reflect the motions of the backbone, which is the most <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of a protein molecule. Thus, the results obtained from nitrogen-15 relaxation measurements may not be representative for the whole protein. Therefore, techniques utilising relaxation measurements of carbon-13 and deuterium have recently been developed, which enables systematic studies of motions of the amino acid side-chains in proteins.|$|E

50|$|Poinsot’s {{geometric}} {{interpretation of}} Earth’s polhode motion was still {{based on the}} incorrect assumption that the Earth was a completely rigid rotating body. It was not until 1891 that the American astronomer, Seth Carlo Chandler, made measurements showing {{that there was a}} periodic motion of 14 months in the Earth’s wobble and suggesting that this was the polhode motion. Initially, Chandler’s measurement, now referred to as the “Chandler wobble,” was dismissed because it was significantly greater than the long-accepted 9-10 month period calculated by Euler, Poinsot, et al. and because Chandler was unable convincingly to explain this discrepancy. However, within months, another American astronomer, Simon Newcomb, realized that Chandler was correct and provided a plausible reason for Chandler’s measurements. Newcomb realized that the Earth’s mass is partly rigid and partly elastic, and that the elastic component has no effect on the Earth’s polhode period, because the elastic part of the Earth’s mass stretches so that it is always symmetrical about the Earth’s spin axis. The <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the Earth’s mass is not symmetrically distributed, and this is what causes the Chandler Wobble, or more precisely, the Earth’s polhode path.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Unstable intertrochanteric (IT) fractures, {{especially}} fractures with {{a reverse}} or transverse fracture line, have tendencies to make significant impaction on shortening of the femoral neck and lower extremity. The biomechanical {{complexity of the}} fracture, the type and {{the position of the}} implant are known to influence postoperative outcome. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare characteristics of two versions of dynamic hip implants in controlling the dynamization of unstable IT fractures of the femur. Methods. In the prospective study that included 1, 115 patients with fractures of the proximal femur, 61 patients had IT fractures with a reverse or transverse fracture line. All the patients were treated surgically with the same implant in two versions: Dynamic Hip Screw - DHS-MB-S implant with a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of standard length (40 mm) and DHS-MB-I implant, with a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the implant individualized for each patient depending on the transverse diameter of the proximal femur. The patients were under gradual radiographic and clinical control. Six months postoperatively we measured the length of the extremity and the degree of the medialization of the distal part of the femur. Results. All the fractures healed six months after the operation. Medialization and shortening of the extremity were significantly less in the group with fractures fixed by the DHSMB- I implant, in which length of the <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of the implant was preoperatively measured individually for each patient. Conclusion. In order to achieve a desired functional result, the control of dynamisation in unstable IT fractures is significant in the fixation of these fractures of the femur.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} human posture {{tracking}} by deploying accelerometers {{on a human}} body. One fundamental issue in such scenarios is how to calculate the gravity. This is very challenging especially when the human body parts keep on moving. Fortunately, {{it is likely that}} there is a point of the body that touches the ground in most cases. This allows sensors to collaboratively calculate the gravity vector. Assuming multiple accelerometers being deployed on a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> of a human body, a recent work proposes a data fusion method to estimate the gravity vector on that <b>rigid</b> <b>part.</b> However, finding the optimal deployment of sensors that minimizes the estimation error of the gravity vector is not addressed.

Simulation and real experimental results show that our schemes are quite effective in finding near-optimal solutions for a variety of rigid body geometries.

40|$|Abstract — We {{model the}} full {{dynamics}} of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> in three-point frictional sliding {{contact with a}} flat rigid 6 -degree-offreedom plate. Given a periodic plate motion and the geometric, inertial, and frictional properties of the part, we define an asymptotic twist field mapping each part configuration to a unique part twist (linear and angular velocity). Asymptotic twist vectors in the field approximate the part’s cycle-averaged twist at each configuration and are independent of time or the system’s initial state. Simulations and experiments show that the trajectory of the part’s configuration as it slides on the plate is well described by the field. With the ability to program arbitrary plate motions, part manipulation reduces to finding plate motions that generate asymptotic twist fields to accomplish desired tasks. Several simple fields useful for manipulation tasks (e. g., sensorless part alignment) are verified in simulation and experiment. For the special case of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> with infinitesimal thickness, we show that the part’s cycle-averaged twist for any configuration asymptotically converges to a unique asymptotic twist vector.

The Zigzag wingbox consists of a <b>rigid</b> <b>part</b> and a morphing part.

The morphing part consists of various morphing partitions where in each partition there are two spars each consisting of two beams hinged together. Each morphing partition is covered by flexible skin and is bounded by two ribs through which the spars are connected. The ribs transfer the loads between the spars of adjacent morphing partitions and serves as the main structure to which the flexible skins are to be attached.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} laminar high-Reynolds-number {{flow through}} a long finite-length planar channel, where a segment of one wall {{is replaced by a}} massless membrane held under longitudinal tension. The flow is driven by a fixed pressure difference across the channel and is described using an integral form of the unsteady boundary-layer equations. The basic flow state, for which the channel has uniform width, exhibits static and oscillatory global instabilities, having distinct modal forms. In contrast, the corresponding local problem (neglecting boundary conditions associated with the <b>rigid</b> <b>parts</b> of the system) is found to be convectively, but not absolutely, unstable to small-amplitude disturbances in the absence of wall damping. We show how amplification of the primary global oscillatory instability can arise entirely from wave reflections with the <b>rigid</b> <b>parts</b> of the system, involving interacting travelling-wave flutter and static-divergence modes that are convectively stable; alteration of the mean flow by oscillations makes the onset of this primary instability subcritical. We also show how distinct mechanisms of energy transfer differentiate the primary global mode from other modes of oscillatory instability. ...|$|R
