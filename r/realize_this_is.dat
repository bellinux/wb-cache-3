500|$|A {{writer for}} Rap-Up {{considered}} the video realistic, as [...] "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic {{called it an}} inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, [...] "Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, but that's alright because I like the way it hurts." [...] Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Daniel Kreps called it [...] "especially striking" [...] and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from The Boston Globe commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from Yahoo! Music wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.|$|E

60|$|But {{to come to}} {{the chief}} and most {{practical}} question, the relation of education to industry. Sooner or later education in Russia must become subordinate to the needs of industrial development. That the Bolsheviks already <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> proved by the articles of Lunacharsky which recently appeared in Le Phare (Geneva). It was the spectre of industry that haunted me throughout the consideration of education as in the consideration of art, and what I have said above of its dangers to the latter seems to me also to apply here. Montessori schools belong, in my view, to that stage in industrial development when education is directed as much towards leisure occupations as towards preparation for professional life. Possibly the fine flower of useless scientific enquiry belongs to this stage also. Nobody in Russia is likely to have much leisure for a good many years to come, if the Bolshevik programme of industrial development is efficiently carried out. And there {{seemed to me to be}} something pathetic and almost cruel in this varied and agreeable education of the child, when one reflected on the long hours of grinding toil to which he was soon to be subject in workshop or factory. For I repeat that I do not believe industrial work in the early days of industry can be made tolerable to the worker. Once again I experienced the dread of seeing the ideals of the Russian revolutionaries go down before the logic of necessity. They are beginning to pride themselves on being hard, practical men, and it seems quite reasonable to fear that they should come to regard this full and humane development of the child as a mere luxury and ultimately neglect it. Worse still, the few of these schools which already exist may perhaps become exclusive to the Communists and their children, or that company of Samurai which is to leaven and govern the mass of the people. If so, they will soon come to resemble our public schools, in that they will prepare, in an artificial play atmosphere, men who will pass straight to the position of leaders, while the portion of the proletariat who serve under them will be reading and writing, just so much technical training as is necessary, and Communist doctrine.|$|E
