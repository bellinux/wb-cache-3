40|$|FMR antigens {{are found}} {{on the surface of}} cells {{infected}} with Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher murine leukemia viruses (MuLV). These antigens are serologically distinct from the G cell surface antigens that are found on cells infected with endogenous MuLV (AKR and Gross virus). Cell surface antigens of both virus groups are immunogenic in mice, and immunization with appropriate virus-infected cells leads to the production of cytotoxic antisera. The cytotoxic activity of FMR antisera can be absorbed by disrupted preparations of Rauscher MuLV, but not by AKR MuLV. FMR antisera precipitate the viral envelope proteins gp 70, pl 5 (E), and p 12 (E) from detergent-disrupted preparations of [3 H]leucine-labeled MuLV. The reaction of these antisera with p 15 (E) and p 12 (E) proteins is directed against group-specific antigens and can be absorbed with AKR MuLV; in contrast, the reaction of these antisera with gp 70 is directed against type-specific antigens and is absorbed only by viruses of the FMR group. In <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays</b> with detergent-disrupted 125 I surface-labeled cells, FMR antisera react only with type-specific antigens of the viral envelpe protein.

Specific interactions between the purified sensory domain of Tlp 1 and L-aspartate were identified using an amino acid array and saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Chemotaxis assays showed differences between migration of wild-type C. jejuni cells and that of a tlp 1 - isogenic mutant, specifically towards aspartate. Furthermore, using yeast twohybrid and three-hybrid systems for analysis of protein-protein interactions, the cytoplasmic signalling domain of Tlp 1 was found to preferentially interact with CheV, rather than the CheW homologue of the chemotaxis signalling pathway; this interaction was confirmed using <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assays.</b> This is the first identification of an aspartate receptor in bacteria other than Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

An <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> with disrupted virions indicated that antibodies A 6 - 8, B 9 - 18, and C 9 - 12 were directed against the gp 70 glycoprotein, and that antibody F 12 - 9 reacted with a viral antigen with a molecular weight of 18, 000.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Core antigen (HBcAg) is {{the most}} {{immunogenic}} component of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is believed to induce virtually always antibodies (anti-HBc) in immunocompetent infected persons. However, some chronically infected persons do not develop detectable anti-HBc. OBJECTIVE: A more sensitive assay for anti-HBc was to be developed and used to re-evaluate a cohort of chronically HBV infected persons without detectable anti-HBc. STUDY DESIGN: Among 3309 serum samples which had been tested by commercially available (microparticle) enzyme immune assay (M/EIA) 34 samples from 22 patients were identified having reacted positive for HBsAg and negative for anti-HBc. Nine of these patients had immunosuppression or HIV coinfection, 13 patients were immunocompetent, 5 of them were perinatally infected. Anti-HBc was re-tested for in an <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> (IP) <b>assay</b> using (32) P-labelled recombinant HBcAg as reagent and anti-human-IgG-coated magnetic beads as separation system for immunecomplexes containing HBcAg. Specificity was controlled for by competition with unlabelled HBcAg. RESULTS: 27 serum samples from the 22 patients could be retested. IP was positive in 7 MEIA negative sera, unspecific positive in 4 and negative in 16. Using 5 anti-HBe positive control sera, we found IP to be 1. 8 -fold (1. 3 - 2. 9) more sensitive than MEIA, but IP was 6. 5 -fold (5. 8 - 7. 4) more sensitive with 4 anti-HBe negative, anti-HBc positive sera. CONCLUSION: IP allowed specific detection of anti-HBc in about 25 % of MEIA negative chronic HBV patients. The majority of these seem to produce no or very little anti-HBc, however...|$|R

This inhibitory role in <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> also provides a possible mechanistic explanation for our previous demonstration of the efficacy of rsFc gamma RII as an inhibitor of immune complex-induced inflammation in the Arthus reaction in vivo. RsFc gamma RII inhibited <b>immune</b> complex <b>precipitation</b> in two different experimental systems.

Moreover, rsFc gamma RII inhibited the precipitation of ovalbumin (OVA) -anti-OVA complexes as determined by turbidimetric analysis, where the inhibition of <b>immune</b> complex <b>precipitation</b> by rsFc gamma RII was dose-dependent and was specifically blocked by prior incubation with Fab' fragments of a blocking MoAb to Fc gamma RII. RsFc gamma RII could inhibit the precipitation of BSA-anti-BSA complexes in the presence of excess bystander IgG and did not inhibit complement-mediated prevention of <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation,</b> demonstrating that rsFc gamma RII did not block C 1 binding to the BSA-anti-BSA complex.

C 1 -In and EDTA were both able to cause similar rapid precipitation of complexes prepared in the presence of C 1 and C 4, demonstrating that C 4 did not play a significant role in delaying the precipitation reaction. However, soluble complexes prepared in the presence of C 1 and C 4 were specifically precipitated by the addition of excess anti-C 4 antibody, attesting to the binding of C 4 to immune complexes.

40|$|<b>Immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{analysis}} of pulse-labeled proteins present in subcellular fractions of mouse embryo cells infected with Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} showed the presence of anti-gp 70 serum-precipitable viral envelope gene products mainly in the microsomal fractions of these cells. In contrast, anti-p 30 serum-specific gag (group specific antigen) gene products {{were found to be}} distributed in similar amounts in both the microsomal and postmicrosomal supernatant fractions of pulse-labeled cells...|$|R
40|$|Rabbit {{antibody}} {{fractions of}} different affinities for human serum albumin were prepared by an immunosorbent technique. The fractions {{were used in}} studies on the enhancement of the precipitin reaction by polymers. Dextran increased the <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> to about the same extent regardless of whether antibodies with high and low affinities were used. The effect should considerably facilitate the detection of antibodies with low precipitating ability in immunological assays. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a steric-exclusion mechanism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCytoskeleton {{preparations}} {{derived from}} lactoperoxidase-radioiodinated human erythrocytes {{were found to}} be enriched in a labelled component with the same apparent molecular mass as the Rhesus (D) (Rh(D)) antigen polypeptide. <b>Immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> from the cytoskeleton preparations confirmed that this component is the Rh(D) polypeptide. The results suggest that the Rh(D) polypeptide may be linked to the erythrocyte skeletal matrix. The possibility that the Rh(D) antigen is involved in maintaining the shape and viability of the erythrocyte is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Sera from 20 {{patients}} {{suffering from}} active pulmonary tuberculosis were examined {{for the presence}} of circulating immune complexes (CICs) by Complement Consumption assay (CC-assay) and Polyethelcne Glycol <b>precipitation</b> <b>assay</b> (PEG-assay). Simultaneously, sputum was examined for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) by Microscopy and Culture techniques. CICs levels determined by above methods correlated well with effectiveness of treatment. These determinants are thus considered useful in evaluating the success or otherwise of the treatment of patients...|$|R
40|$|Viral genomic RNA was {{purified}} from BHK- 21 cells {{infected with}} {{epizootic haemorrhagic disease}} virus and the 10 dsRNA genome segments were isolated by polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis. These genome segments were translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and the synthesized proteins were detected by <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> and gel electrophoresis. This allowed the assignment of protein coding to the genome segments and the identification of two additional virus-specified proteins not readily detectable in lysates of virus-infected cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of pregnancy-specific beta 1 -glycoprotein (SP 1) was studied in normal brain-derived and malignant glial-cell cultures. The normal brain-derived and glioma cells {{were found to}} contain SP 1 when studied by radioimmunoassay and by the triple-bridge immunoperoxidase technique. The active {{synthesis of}} SP 1 by these brain-derived cells was confirmed by metabolic labelling and subsequent <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of the culture medium. The SP 1 -like material produced by the brain-derived cells had the same molecular weight as purified placental SP 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of the enzyme dopa (3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine) decarboxylase, present in the epidermis cells of blowfly larvae, increases during the late third instar {{under the influence of}} the steroid hormone, ecdysone. By using the double-labelling technique and <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> with univalent antibody to dopa decarboxylase, we demonstrated that the increase in enzyme activity was due to a stimulation of synthesis of enzyme molecules de novo. In this respect, the action of ecdysone is similar to the action of other steroid hormones...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{purification}} of soluble {{products of}} guinea-pig lymphocyte activation (LAP) was undertaken by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulphate, ion-exchange and Sephadex chromatography, and by <b>immune</b> <b>precipitation</b> of inducing antigen and of contaminating serum protein. During these purification steps {{the activity of}} macrophage migration-inhibition factor (MIF) was concentrated up to 1300 -fold and separated from inducing antigen and serum protein. An endpoint assay was devised for expressing antigen-induced MIF activity of LAP fractions as weights of material giving 30 % inhibition of migration (MI 30 doses) ...|$|R
