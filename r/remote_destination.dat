He decides to write one final novel before death comes visiting. Anoop has a wife Meena(Sarayu), who never understands the writer in him. At the same time, Anoop is in love with dancer Gatha (Mamta Mohandas), with whom he shares a live-in relationship. Anoop always tells Gatha about his lost love Sathyabhama (Dhanya Mary Varghese), who was his lover in college. Excited about hearing Sathyabhama aka Bhama, Gatha wants to locate Bhama and goes to Anoop's tharavadu (ancestral house) with him. From there they go to Bhama's birthplace Vattakkulam to find Bhama. That place {{incidentally}} was the birthplace of Gatha's parents also. They returned, unsuccessful in finding Bhama. Gatha went to Kolkata for her dance performances while Anoop returned to Kerala. Three months later, Gatha got a call from Anoop. Gatha was shocked to hear that actually there was no girl as Bhama but was only an imaginary character created by Anoop for his final novel. Anoop was actually developing Bhama's story through Gatha. Anoop finally told Gatha that he sent the novel to Gatha and Gatha has the right to give it a title and publish and added that he is about to reach the end of his life, which he realised some time back.

50|$|Hertz {{convinced}} {{the client to}} purchase the 747 airplane, originally worth about $25 million when Boeing completed it in 1970, for US $30,000. Mark Thompson of Thompson Aviation sold the airplane and his team detoxified, cut apart, and transported the plane for airlift. Using a laser and the cut-off saws at the Victorville Airport, home of the second largest airplane graveyard in the nation, the cockpit and tail were removed and the fuselage cut longitudinally. Next, transverse sectioning reduced large segments of fuselage and the wings to a manageable size for transport. A truck carried the parts, measuring 47 ft. by 125 ft., successfully without damage. Seven California Highway Patrol vehicles escorted the truck during the night and closed multiple lanes of three major freeways, State Routes 2 and 15, and US Route 101, to accommodate the vehicle. The wings traveled from the Southern California Logistics Airport aircraft boneyard to Camarillo Airport in Oxnard, California, located 10 miles from the site. At that point, because each wing weighed approximately 20,000 pounds {{and the only way}} to transport such heavy, unwieldy sections to a <b>remote</b> <b>destination</b> was from above (navigation by truck was deemed impossible), the wings needed to be cut in two for proper positioning for transport by helicopter, which was completed by a Columbia Model 234 operated by Columbia Helicopters Inc. of Portland, Oregon and took over two hours to complete. The helicopter positioned the wings on a large pile of tires at the site. The wings were then spliced back together and lifted onto columnar supports, attaching the custom fabricated steel brackets on the columns to the engine mounts on the wings. The wings touched the ground at few points creating minimal foundation requirements.|$|E

40|$|The {{scaling laws}} of the {{achievable}} communication rates and the corresponding upper bounds of distributed reception {{in the presence of}} an interfering signal are investigated. The scheme includes one transmitter communicating to a <b>remote</b> <b>destination</b> via two relays, which forward messages to the <b>remote</b> <b>destination</b> through reliable links with finite capacities. The relays receive the transmission along with some unknown interference. We focus on three common settings for distributed reception, wherein the scaling {{laws of the}} capacity (the pre-log as the power of the transmitter and the interference are taken to infinity) are completely characterized. It is shown in most cases that in order to overcome the interference, a definite amount of information about the interference needs to be forwarded along with the desired message, to the destination. It is exemplified in one scenario that the cut-set upper bound is strictly loose. The results are derived using the cut-set along with a new bounding technique, which relies on multi letter expressions. Furthermore, lattices are found to be a useful communication technique in this setting, and are used to characterize the scaling laws of achievable rates.

An achievable rate with unrestricted agents, which are capable of decoding, is also given and then demonstrated by a numerical example for the Gaussian channel. I...|$|E
