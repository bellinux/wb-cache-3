40|$|AbstractUbiquitous {{healthcare}} system is becoming essential {{in the attempt}} to improve healthcare delivery. Not only it is able to facilitate two-way communication between physician and patient, but it is also useful for the caregivers to maximize efficiency in running daily activities. Managing ischemia heart disease, one of the deadly diseases, would definitely benefit from such ubiquitous {{healthcare system}}. The current treatment method for ischemia requires patients to be physically present at their respective treatment centres for regular monitoring. This increases the need for <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>method,</b> due to the urgent nature of treating ischemia heart attack. Therefore, this paper presents preliminary system architecture and feasibility study of HeartPals, a low-cost Android-based integrated wearable electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring system that enables ischemia patients to be remotely monitored by their physicians. We also propose TOFUSER, a Technology-Oriented Feasibility stUdy Scheme for End-useRs as an extended feasibility study scheme to allow users to verify the preliminary requirements of the technology and users’ requirements of HeartPals...|$|E

40|$|Background Many {{patients}} fail {{to receive}} β-blockers before cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, or receive {{them at a}} suboptimal dose, and require optimization after implantation.

A second group of 124 CRT-D candidates (Study Group) underwent up-titration visits every 2 weeks after implantation (target dose: 10 mg/day of bisoprolol or 50 mg/day of carvedilol). In the Study Group, <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> was undertaken in 66 patients, who received additional equipment for daily transmission of weight and blood pressure data, and scheduled titration telephone calls.

40|$|Background <b>Remote</b> patient <b>monitoring</b> is a {{safe and}} {{effective}} alternative for the in-clinic follow-up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). However, evidence on the patient perspective on <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> is scarce and inconsistent. Objectives The primary objective of the REMOTE-CIED study is to evaluate the influence of <b>remote</b> patient <b>monitoring</b> versus in-clinic follow-up on patient-reported outcomes. Secondary objectives are to: 1) identify subgroups of patients {{who may not be}} satisfied with remote monitoring; and 2) investigate the cost-effectiveness of <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Methods</b> The REMOTE-CIED study is an international randomised controlled study that will include 900 consecutive heart failure patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) compatible with the Boston Scientific LATITUDE® Remote Patient Management system at participating centres in five European countries. Patients will be randomised to <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> or in-clinic follow-up. The In-Clinic group will visit the outpatient clinic every 3 – 6 months, according to standard practice. The <b>Remote</b> <b>Monitoring</b> group only visits the outpatient clinic at 12 and 24 months post-implantation, other check-ups are performed remotely. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at five time points during the 2 -year follow-up. Conclusion The REMOTE-CIED study will provide insight into the patient perspective on <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> in ICD patients, which could help to support patient-centred care in the future.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the recent clinical trials of telemedicine in relation to store-and-forward, real time and <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods.</b> MethodArticles were obtained from November 2007 to November 2009 using the MEDLINE database. Studies reported on clinical trials were included and those indicating the use of telephony, electrical equipment and feasibility studies were excluded. Articles were abstracted and grouped for various disciplines for analysis. ResultsThere were three large sample Randomised Control Trials (RCTs), nine small sample RCTs, four prospective studies, three retrospective studies, one cohort study, four case control studies, and fifteen descriptive studies. The three large sample RCTs have been reported one each in neurology, diabetes and dermatology. Thirty nine articles selected were nine on neurology, four each on psychiatry, diabetes and cardiology, three each on ophthalmology and dermatology, two each on acute care, transplant and ENT and one each on child abuse, endoscopy, general practice, leprosy, nephrology and radiology. After further exclusion, rest of the 27 articles revealed that the outcome had improved in 41 %, comparable in 15 %, benefited in 33 % and not enhanced in 11 % when telemedicine was compared to conventional approaches. ConclusionsMost of studies reported have revealed advantages of telemedicine against conventional methods of care. However further large sample randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these results...|$|R

40|$|<b>Remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is not a}} new technology, and its {{application}} to safeguards relevant activities has been examined for a number of years. On behalf of the US Department of Energy and international partners, <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems have been emplaced in nuclear facilities and laboratories {{in various parts of the}} world. The experience gained from these field trials of <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems has shown the viability of the concept of using integrated monitoring systems. Although a wide variety of sensors has been used in the <b>remote</b> <b>monitoring</b> field trials conducted to date, the possible range of instrumentation that might be used has scarcely been touched.
