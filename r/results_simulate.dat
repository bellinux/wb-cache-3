In the present study, the effect of actinomycin D on the uptake of labeled vitamin A acid in normal epidermal cells and in the keratoacanthoma was studied by electron microscope radioautography. When actinomycin D is applied either in 1 or 2 doses prior to labeled vitamin A acid, very few grains are observed over the nuclei of the keratinocytes. Most of the grains are localized over the tonofibrils or the cytoplasmic ground substance. When labeled vitamin A acid is applied prior to actinomycin D, grains still predominate over the cytoplasm or its organelles when biopsies are taken 24 hrs after the last application of the antibiotic.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation model to project land-cover changes {{at a national}} scale for Sudano-sahelian countries. The {{aim of this study}} is to better understand the driving forces of land-use change and to reconstruct past changes. The structure of our model is heavily determined by its spatially aggregated level. This model represents, in a dynamic way, a simplified version of our current understanding of the processes of land-use change in the Sudano-sahelian region of Africa. For any given year, the land demand is calculated under the assumption that there should be an equilibrium between the production and consumption of basic resources derived from different land-uses. The exogenous variables of the model are human population (rural and urban), livestock, rainfall and cereals imports. The output are the areas allocated to fuelwood extraction, crops, fallow and pasture for every year. Pressure indicators are also generated endogenously by the model (rate of overgrazing and land degradation, labour productivity, average household "budget"). The parameters of the model were derived on the basis of a comprehensive review of the literature, mostly of local scale case studies of land-use changes in the Sahel. In agreement with farming system research, the model simulates two processes of land-use change: agricultural expansion at the most extensive technological level, followed by agricultural intensification once some land threshold is reached. The model was first tested at a national scale using data from Burkina Faso. <b>Results</b> <b>simulate</b> land-use changes at two time frequencies: high frequency, as driven by climatic variability, and low frequency, as driven by demographic trends.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} shows that the flow dynamics in the left ventricle (LV) reveal important information about cardiac health. This information can be used in early diagnosis of patients with potential heart problems. The current study introduces a patient-specific cardiovascular-modelling system (CMS) which simulates the flow dynamics in the LV to facilitate physicians in early diagnosis of patients before heart failure. Methods The proposed system will identify possible disease conditions and facilitates early diagnosis through hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging (4 -D MRI). The simulation is based on the 3 -D heart model, which can simultaneously compute fluid and elastic boundary motions using the immersed boundary method. At this preliminary stage, the 4 -D MRI is used to provide an appropriate comparison. This allows flexible investigation of the flow features in the ventricles and their responses. Results The <b>results</b> <b>simulate</b> various flow rates and kinetic energy in the diastole and systole phases, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing some of the important characteristics of the heart during different phases. However, some discrepancies exist in the pulmonary vein and aorta flow rate between the numerical and experimental data. Further studies are essential to investigate and solve the remaining problems before using the data in clinical diagnostics. Conclusions The results show that by using a simple reservoir pressure boundary condition (RPBC), we are able to capture some essential variations found in the clinical data. Our approach establishes a first-step framework of a practical patient-specific CMS, which comprises a 3 -D CFD model (without involving actual hemodynamic data yet) to simulate the heart and the 4 -D PC-MRI system. At this stage, the 4 -D PC-MRI system is used for verification purpose rather than input. This brings us closer to our goal of developing a practical patient-specific CMS, which will be pursued next. We anticipate that in the future, this hybrid system can potentially identify possible disease conditions in LV through comprehensive analysis and facilitates physicians in early diagnosis of probable cardiac problems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Due to a rapid yield decline, {{plantain}} {{fields in}} Southeastern Nigeria are reverted to fallow after two years. However, population pressure leads to shorter fallow periods and {{high rates of}} deforestation. This study investigates the potential of mulch-based systems for perennial plantain production. Two alley cropping technologies with Dactyladenia barteri and natural bush, and a cut-and-carry technique using Pennisetum purpureum are evaluated against traditional systems. ^ The analytical framework consists of a bio-economic model incorporating soil nutrient dynamics, plantain response function and returns maximization over a 30 -year horizon. The study indicates {{that the lack of}} capital limits the adoption of perennial production systems. Only the traditional systems allow plantain growers some production under average resource levels. To allow an economic assessment of alternative organic matter management systems, the model assumes that capital now used on three 0. 25 -ha plots can be concentrated on one plot. This would provide sufficient capital for additional resources required by mulch and fertilizer use. ^ Under baseline conditions, the alley cropping system with natural bush outperforms the other two improved technologies with a 154 % and 72 % increase in net returns over continuous and shifting traditional systems respectively. The cut-and-carry technique yields a 151 % and 70 % increase in net returns. Improved fallow with D. barteri ranks third with a 140 % and 62 % increase in net returns followed by continuous traditional cropping with fertilizer use, which shows a rise in returns by 121 % and 50 % over traditional systems without fertilizer. The traditional system had the worst performance when no fertilizer was used. ^ Model <b>results</b> <b>simulate</b> yields decline usually observed after two years of production under field conditions. When moderate amounts of mulch are used in improved systems, fertilizer application is still necessary to maintain soil fertility. Net returns in mulch-based systems decrease with the introduction of fallows though an improvement in the capacity of soil fertility restoration is observed. ^ A sensitivity analysis shows that the marginal benefit of fertilizer in the alley cropping and traditional systems is considerable. The negative effect of an increase in fertilizer price on net returns is less pronounced than the lack of access to fertilizer. ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{overall goal}} is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program: the development of new and improved parameterizations of cloud-radiation effects and related processes, using ARM data at all three ARM sites, and the implementation and testing of these parameterizations in global and regional models. To test recently developed prognostic parameterizations based on detailed cloud microphysics, we have first compared single-column model (SCM) output with ARM observations at the Southern Great Plains (SGP), North Slope of Alaska (NSA) and Topical Western Pacific (TWP) sites. We focus on the predicted cloud amounts and on a suite of radiative quantities strongly dependent on clouds, such as downwelling surface shortwave radiation. Our results demonstrate the superiority of parameterizations based on comprehensive treatments of cloud microphysics and cloud-radiative interactions. At the SGP and NSA sites, the SCM <b>results</b> <b>simulate</b> the ARM measurements well and are demonstrably more realistic than typical parameterizations found in conventional operational forecasting models. At the TWP site, the model performance depends strongly on details of the scheme, and the results of our diagnostic tests suggest ways to develop improved parameterizations better suited to simulating cloud-radiation interactions in the tropics generally. These advances have made it possible {{to take the next step}} and build on this progress, by incorporating our parameterization schemes in state-of-the-art 3 D atmospheric models, and diagnosing and evaluating the results using independent data. Because the improved cloud-radiation results have been obtained largely via implementing detailed and physically comprehensive cloud microphysics, we anticipate that improved predictions of hydrologic cycle components, and hence of precipitation, may also be achievable. We are currently testing the performance of our ARM-based parameterizations in state-of-the [...] art global and regional models. One fruitful strategy for evaluating advances in parameterizations has turned out to be using short-range numerical weather prediction as a test-bed within which to implement and improve parameterizations for modeling and predicting climate variability.
