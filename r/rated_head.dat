40|$|Abstract. A {{low head}} {{hydropower}} station {{is in the}} southwest of China, its Francis turbine ran well at a rated power and rated net head, but the turbine produced severe abnormal vibration and noise at higher head than the <b>rated</b> <b>head,</b> full load and overload. By analyzing, characteristic points on vibration conditions are inside the area of channel vortices on runner performance curve. CFD analysis indicates that unstable vortices exist between runner blades. The two results demonstrate that the vibration and noise of Francis turbine are caused by runner channel vortices at higher head than the <b>rated</b> <b>head,</b> full load and overload...|$|E
5000|$|For these reasons, a {{probabilistic}} method for pipe network analysis {{has recently been}} developed, based on the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. [...] In this method, a continuous relative entropy function is defined over the unknown parameters. This entropy is then maximized subject to the constraints on the system, including Kirchhoff's laws, pipe friction properties and any specified mean flow <b>rates</b> or <b>head</b> losses, to give a probabilistic statement (probability density function) which describes the system. This {{can be used to}} calculate mean values (expectations) of the flow <b>rates,</b> <b>head</b> losses or any other variables of interest in the pipe network. This analysis has been extended using a reduced-parameter entropic formulation, which ensures consistency of the analysis regardless of the graphical representation of the network. A comparison of Bayesian and maximum entropy probabilistic formulations for the analysis of pipe flow networks has also been presented, showing that under certain assumptions (Gaussian priors), the two approaches lead to equivalent predictions of mean flow rates.|$|R
