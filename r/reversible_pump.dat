Water is pumped up from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir, using surplus power available at times of low demand, and then allowed to fall by gravity from the upper reservoir back into the lower reservoir, passing through turbines along the way to generate electricity. The generating plant resides inside the mountain in a cavern measuring 250 * 70 * 90 ft, which houses four <b>reversible</b> <b>pump</b> turbines with a combined capacity of 292 megawatts. The upper reservoir is 19.4 m deep, has a capacity of [...] and covers an area of 40 acre. The power station is designed to generate electricity at times of peak demand and is instantly dispatchable: it can go from standstill to full generation within 13 seconds, compared with 12 hours for some thermal plants. It can generate electricity at full load for up to six hours per day and has a round trip energy efficiency of 75%. Since 2004, Turlough Hill has been the Hydro Control Centre (HCC) for the entire ESB hydroelectric portfolio, which comprises 19 generators in total. An overhaul of the plant was planned for 2011 following the failure of Unit 1's stator bars. A subsequent investigation led to serious defects being discovered, which led to the refurbishment of all four generating units.

METHODS: The Long-Term Sensor System project assessed the feasibility of glucose control by the combined implantation of a pump for peritoneal insulin delivery and a central intravenous glucose sensor, connected physically by a subcutaneous lead and functionally by PID algorithms. It was performed in 10 type 1 diabetic patients from 2000 to 2007. RESULTS: No harmful complication related to implants occurred. Insulin delivery was affected by iterative but <b>reversible</b> <b>pump</b> slowdowns due to insulin precipitation. Glucose measurement by the intravenous sensors correlated well with meter values (r = 0. 83 - 0. 93, with a mean absolute deviation of 16. 5 %) for an average duration of 9 months. Uploading of pump electronics by PID algorithms designed for closed-loop insulin delivery allowed in-patient 48 hourtrials.

40|$|This note {{describes}} the scour induced by tidal currents around piles under live-bed conditions, {{on the basis}} of physical model tests carried out at Aalborg University (DK). Fine sand was placed in a flume equipped with a <b>reversible</b> <b>pump.</b> Scour was leveled by an automatic laser profiler. Experimental time evolution of scour is satisfactorily given by a simple rule, function of the volume occupied by the pile, the test duration and the sediment mobility. Such rule allows for a quantitative description of erosion in equilibrium conditions, although with some uncertainty. The scour depth S is S/D≈ 1. 3 (D is the pile diameter). For unidirectional currents, eroded volume V at the pile is V/D 3 ≈ 13, the hole having an assymmetrical shape. For tidal currents, two cases are distinguished, when tidal period is much longer or much shorter than time scale of erosion: in the first case the hole is asymmetric and keeps “drifting with the tide” with volume V/D 3 ≈ 16; in the second case the hole is symmetric and is stable, with volume V/D^ 3 ≈ 13...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Most {{hydropower}} {{plants in}} Nepal are run-off type, which cannot supply the designed {{amount of energy}} during dry season and peak demand period resulting in energy crisis. Therefore, pumped storage plants can be an ideal solution to meet the current energy needs of the country. Most of these storage plants make use of a single unit acting both as turbine as well as pump; hence aptly called <b>Reversible</b> <b>Pump</b> Turbine (RPT). This paper explains the new application concept for use of such RPTs as auxiliary unit to supplement the main power unit in hydropower plants of Nepal. It also summarizes the design process of such runner {{with reference to the}} parameters available at Chilime region in central part of Nepal. The design is performed in two steps. The first step is an analytical design, which gives an initial geometry of the RPT runner. The process resulted in a runner of larger size than a normal Francis runner for same parameters since it has to work as pump as well. The next step is an optimization procedure involving CFD analysis under which the simulation of the RPT in turbine mode yielded an efficiency of 88. 71 %. The detail laboratory experiments on a model RPT will be performed later to validate the results from CFD and determine the characteristics of the designed runner at different mode and operating conditions...|$|E

Heat pump systems appear to be a more efficient alternative to electrical resistance heaters for the purpose of heating the car indoor environment. Heat pump systems could be easily implemented into cars by allowing the air-conditioning system to run in reverse. In order to check the technical feasibility of a <b>reversible</b> heat <b>pump</b> system, and to point out technical barriers, a prototype was built and tested. Experimental data was also used to calibrate and validate simulation models of components. A heat pump system model was finally built to investigate the operating conditions of the system. The first part of the paper describes the test rig (architecture, components, and measurement devices) and the experimental campaign. Performance of components (compressor, evaporator, condenser and heater core) is evaluated in terms of variation with the operating conditions. The second part of the paper presents the steady-state semi-empirical models of the components. Such lumped models retain and concentrate the main physical phenomena inherent to the components into successive elementary processes (pressure losses, heat transfers, etc.). They require a limited number of parameters that can be identified based on experimental data. The calibration and the validation of the proposed component models are detailed.

Even though <b>reversible</b> <b>pump</b> turbines are widely regarded as the most cost effective solution, their working range is still limited by problematic hysteresis/instability regions in their machine characteristics that could lead to problems such as severe self-excited oscillations in the hydro-mechanical system. In order to understand the underlying physical mechanism of pump-mode instability of a two stages reversible-pump turbine, pressure fluctuations were monitored at different flow rates by flush mounted micro pressure transducers in the guide vanes, in the bladed return channel and in the inflow. Moreover, unsteady numerical flow fields were analyzed by the commercial code ANSYS CFX 14. 0 to highlight the fluid-dynamical characteristic of the instabilities, and investigate their origin. Large-scale instabilities due to the dynamic interaction between rotor and stator were identified and characterized in the frequency and in the time-frequency domains. The analysis of the pressure signals highlighted the presence at part loads of a pulsating phenomenon at a frequency of St= 0. 33 both in the interaction zone between the diffuser and the return channel and along the blades of the return channel (Fig. 1). An unsteady reverse flow was identified inside the impeller on the blade suction side that moved along the blade, interacted with the wake zone near the impeller blade trailing edge and the diffuser flow field and even forced the instability in the return channel...|$|E

30|$|Hydro {{electricity}} generation is considered as an established renewable technology. A water flow from an upper {{to a lower}} level represents a hydraulic power potential. Pumped storage plants utilize a <b>reversible</b> <b>pumping</b> turbine to store hydro energy during off-peak electricity hours by pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir. This stored energy is then used to generate electricity during peak hours, when electricity is costly to produce, by flowing water from the upper to the lower reservoir. The pumped hydro storage system will store excess energy during the off-peak time which will be produced by six 65 -kW wind turbines, three 100 -kW wind turbines, and a diesel plant. The stored energy {{will be used to}} produce electricity during peak times throughout the day. Hydro turbines can be broadly categorized into either impulse or reaction turbines. Figure 12 shows a guide for selection of hydro turbine. For the Ramea site, the expected flow rate is 0.347 [*]m 3 /s, and head is 63 [*]m; therefore, the best selection from Figure 12 is a pelton- or turgo-type turbine.|$|R

Moreover, in presence of a large time scale separation between the fast pumping dynamics and the slow network dynamics, a finite current with zero dissipation may be produced.
