5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the notion of <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multi-valued mapping and to prove the strong {{convergence}} theorems of fixed point for <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multivalued mappings in Banach spaces. The <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multivalued mappings are more generalized than relatively nonexpansive multivalued mappings. In this paper, an example will be given which is a <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multivalued mapping but not a relatively nonexpansive multivalued mapping. In order to get the strong convergence theorems for <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multivalued mappings, a new monotone hybrid iteration algorithm with generalized (metric) projection is presented and is used to approximate the fixed point of <b>weak</b> <b>relatively</b> nonexpansive multivalued mappings.

5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is <b>relatively</b> <b>weak,</b> with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and <b>relatively</b> <b>weak</b> in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms <b>relatively</b> <b>weak</b> complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was <b>relatively</b> <b>weak.</b> He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

Among all the years, the upwelling characterized by up-sloping of 25 °C isotherm is <b>relatively</b> <b>weaker</b> and persisted until November during SMS of 2005 and is stronger during the SMS of 2002. As a result of prolonged upwelling, the sea surface temperature has shown cooling extending into the postmonsoon season. The estimated marine pelagic fish landings along the southwest coast of India (SWCI) have also shown increase until December. The governing mechanisms {{both in terms of}} local and remote forcings are examined to explain the observed anomalous upwelling during SMS of 2005. The equatorward alongshore wind stress (WS) along the KK XBT transect persisted in a transient manner beyond September only during SMS of 2005. The westerly wind bursts over the equator during the winter of 2004 – 2005 are both short-lived and <b>relatively</b> <b>weaker</b> triggering weaker upwelling Kelvin waves that propagated into LS in the following SMS of 2005. The observed distribution of negative sea surface height anomaly in the LS is <b>relatively</b> <b>weaker</b> during the SMS of 2005 and lasted longer. The correlation analysis suggests that the local alongshore WS off the SWCI and the remote forcing from the southern coast of Sri Lanka has greater influence on the observed interannual variability of upwelling in the LS when compared to the remote forcing from the equator...|$|R
