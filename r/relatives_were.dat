5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves with deep triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest relatives to be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch {{published}} {{a paper on}} early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. He found that although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were the only true cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however that further work on the group might reveal different conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{birds are}} highly social, often found living in flocks. There is general {{agreement}} that some {{behaviors that are}} common in birds, {{as well as in}} crocodiles (birds' closest living <b>relatives),</b> <b>were</b> also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Eve of 1924 {{brought more}} illness. Wise's uncle Fred Gienke, his wife, Lily, {{and several of}} their {{children}} all began suffering stomach pains similar to those Hasel had experienced before her death. Several family members were hospitalized, and Lily and Fred were both dead by February 1925. In total, seventeen <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> taken ill with similar symptoms {{in the fall and}} winter of 1924/1925. Four of the Gienke children were left partially paralyzed from the mysterious illness.|$|E
50|$|A first-degree <b>relative</b> <b>is</b> one's offspring, sibling or parent. It {{constitutes}} {{a category of}} family members that largely overlaps with the term nuclear family, but without spouses. First degree <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> a common measure used to diagnose risks for common diseases by analyzing family history.|$|R
50|$|Blood <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> {{not allowed}} to be {{witnesses}} or judges in the same case (Sanhedrin chapter 3 lists which blood <b>relatives</b> <b>are</b> included).

5|$|Romans also {{consumed}} {{lead through}} {{the consumption of}} defrutum, carenum, and sapa, musts made by boiling down fruit in lead cookware. Defrutum and its <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> used in ancient Roman cuisine and cosmetics, including as a food preservative. The use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard and copper cookware was used far more generally. There is also no indication how often sapa was added or in what quantity.|$|E
5|$|Several of Eadbald's near <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> {{involved}} in diplomatic marriages. King Anna of East Anglia married his daughter, Seaxburh, to Eorcenberht, {{and their daughter}} Eormenhild married Wulfhere of Mercia, {{one of the most}} powerful kings of his day. Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, married Oswiu, king of Northumbria and the last of the northern Angles Bede listed as holding imperium over southern England. Eadbald's granddaughter Eafe married Merewalh, king of the Magonsæte.|$|E
5|$|The tiger's closest living <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> {{previously}} {{thought to be}} the lion, leopard and jaguar, all of which are classified under the genus Panthera. Genetic analysis indicates that the tiger and the snow leopard diverged from the other Panthera species about 2.88 million years ago, and that both species may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, {{his body}} was {{transferred}} to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles there. His body survived the plundering of the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Constantine was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans. A number of <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews Dalmatius (who held the rank of Caesar) and Hannibalianus, presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, Constantina and Helena, wife of Emperor Julian.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{the second}} son of Rebecca Turner Johnson and John Johnson, a Baptist yeoman who lived in Everton, Liverpool. Religious Dissent marked Johnson from the {{beginning}} of his life, as two of his mother's <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> prominent Baptist ministers and his father was a deacon. Liverpool, at the time of Johnson's youth, was fast becoming a bustling urban centre {{and was one of the}} most important commercial ports in England. These two characteristics of his home—Dissent and commercialism—remained central elements in Johnson's character throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Luke Blackburn {{was born}} June 16, 1816, in Woodford County, Kentucky. He {{was the fourth}} of {{thirteen}} children born to Edward M. ("Ned") and Lavinia (Bell) Blackburn. Blackburn's great-uncle, Gideon Blackburn, was a well-known Presbyterian missionary and {{served as president of}} Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Many of Blackburn's <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> involved in politics. His maternal grandfather was a delegate to the 1799 Kentucky Constitutional Convention and his uncle, William Blackburn, was President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate and acting lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor James Turner Morehead. Noted statesman Henry Clay was also a distant cousin, and occasionally visited the Blackburn home.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day after}} the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that {{students}} would be able to seek compensation from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation to other forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack. <b>Relatives</b> <b>were</b> also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{starling}} (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of starling that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested {{to belong to the}} bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}}, {{also known}} as the Réunion starling or Bourbon crested starling (Fregilupus varius), is a species of starling which lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion, and became extinct in the 1850s. Its closest <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> the Rodrigues starling and the Mauritius starling from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought {{to be related to the}} hoopoe, from which its name is derived. Although a number of affinities have been proposed, it was confirmed as a starling in a DNA study.|$|E

5|$|To {{strengthen}} their hold on power, Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ established a patronage network. For instance Lê Đức Thọ's brother, Đinh Đức Thiện was appointed Minister of Communications and Transport; in April 1982 Đồng Sĩ Nguyên, a protégé of Lê Duẩn, became Minister of Transport. Mai Chí Thọ, brother of Lê Đức Thọ, was Chairman of the People's Committee of Hồ Chí Minh City (equivalent to a mayor) from 1978 to 1985. Several of Lê Duẩn's <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> appointed to {{offices in the}} propaganda and culture sector. However, {{with the exception of}} Mai Chí Thọ none of these figures reached the pinnacles of power in Vietnamese politics.|$|E
5|$|Wealthy Egyptians {{were buried}} with larger {{quantities}} of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, {{books of the}} dead {{were included in the}} grave, along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife. Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living <b>relatives</b> <b>were</b> expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.|$|E
