50|$|Guanosine monophosphate (GMP), {{also known}} as 5'-guanidylic acid or guanylic acid (conjugate base guanylate), is a {{nucleotide}} that {{is used as a}} monomer in RNA. It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside guanosine. GMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase guanine; hence it is a <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> Guanosine monophosphate is commercially produced by microbial fermentation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComplex {{metabolism}} {{is thought}} to occur exclusively in the crowded intracellular environment. Here we report that diluted enzymes from lysed human leukocytes produce extracellular energy. Our findings involve two pathways: the purine nucleotide catabolic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway, which function together to generate energy as NADPH. Glucose 6 P fuel for NADPH production is generated from structural ribose of purine <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates,</b> ADP, and ADP-ribose. NADPH drives glutathione reductase to reduce an oxidized glutathione disulfide-glutathione redox couple. Acid phosphatases initiate ribose 5 P salvage from purine <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates,</b> and transaldolase controls the direction of carbon chain flow through the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. These metabolic control points are regulated by pH. Biologically, this energy conserving metabolism could function in perturbed extracellular spaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol on the {{activity}} of acid phosphatase from wheat germ was studied, by using <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> as the enzyme substrates. The nucleotides were effectively degraded to the corresponding nucleosides {{in the presence of}} ethanol at all concentrations tested, including a 96 % (v/v) solution. However, the nucleotide dephosphorylation was accompanied by the liberation of orthophosphate only when the concentration of ethanol in the assay mixture did not exceed 15 %. No inorganic phosphate was liberated when ethanol was present at higher concentrations. Instead, monoethyl phosphate was formed in quantities expected for orthophosphate. The results are explained in terms of phosphatase-catalysed alcoholysis...|$|R
50|$|Inosinic acid or {{inosine monophosphate}} (IMP) is a {{nucleoside}} monophosphate. Widely {{used as a}} flavor enhancer, it is typically obtained from chicken byproducts or other meat industry waste. Inosinic acid is important in metabolism. It is the ribonucleotide of hypoxanthine and the first nucleotide formed during the synthesis of purine. It is formed by the deamination of adenosine monophosphate, and is hydrolysed to inosine. IMP is an intermediate <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> in purine metabolism. The enzyme deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, encoded by YJR069C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and containing (d)ITPase and (d)XTPase activities, hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) releasing pyrophosphate and IMP.|$|E
50|$|The steps {{contributing}} {{to the production of}} primary transcripts involve a series of molecular interactions that initiate transcription of DNA within a cell's nucleus. Based on the needs of a given cell, certain DNA sequences are transcribed to produce a variety of RNA products to be translated into functional proteins for cellular use. To initiate the transcription process in a cell's nucleus, DNA double helices are unwound and hydrogen bonds connecting compatible nucleic acids of DNA are broken to produce two unconnected single DNA strands. One strand of the DNA template is used for transcription of the single-stranded primary transcript mRNA. This DNA strand is bound by an RNA polymerase at the promoter region of the DNA.In eukaryotes, three kinds of RNA—rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA—are produced based on the activity of three distinct RNA polymerases, whereas, in prokaryotes, only one RNA polymerase exists to create all kinds of RNA molecules. RNA polymerase II of eukaryotes transcribes the primary transcript, a transcript destined to be processed into mRNA, from the antisense DNA template in the 5' to 3' direction, and this newly synthesized primary transcript is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA. RNA polymerase II constructs the primary transcript using a set of four specific <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> residues (Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), Cytidine monophosphate (CMP), Guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and Uridine monophosphate (UMP)) that are added continuously to the 3' hydroxyl group on the 3' end of the growing mRNA.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{release of}} amino acids from their vacuolar store was studied in situ, i. e. in cells with {{selectively}} permeabilized plasma membrane and functionally intact vacuoles. As we previously described [Roos et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 15849 – 15855], this transport process is regulated by extravacuolar adenylates at their physiological concentrations. We now show, using our test object Penicillium cyclopium, {{that not only}} purine but also pyrimidine nucleotides {{are involved in the}} control of efflux of vacuolar phenylalanine. At 0. 1 mM adenosine or guanosine phosphates inhibit, whereas cytidine or uridine phosphates stimulate the rate of efflux. At 1 mM the same nucleotides have no measurable impact on efflux but abolish the effects of other nucleotides present at 0. 1 mM. This argues for at least two interacting binding sites with different nucleotide affinities. The minimum structural requirement for any of the observed effects is a non-cyclic <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> In intact cells, cytosolic concentrations of ATP (representing purine nucleotides) and CTP (representing pyrimidine nucleotides) are 1 – 2 mM and 0. 05 – 0. 2 mM, respectively. ATP is therefore assumed to dominate transport control and allow optimum efflux (and uptake) rates. Short-time starvation of carbon and nitrogen adjusts CTP and ATP at levels that cause declining efflux rates. During prolonged starvation both nucleotides fall below their transport-controlling concentrations and thus allow increasing rates of efflux from the still maintained vacuolar pool. Hence, efflux control under nutrient limitation includes an interplay of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides which precisely regulates the release of vacuolar amino acids and enables flexible adjustment to either amino acid saving or cell survival...|$|E
40|$|The {{degraded}} {{nucleic acids}} and ribosomes of its prey cell provide Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109 J with {{a source of}} <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> and deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates for biosynthesis and respiration. We demonstrate that bdellovibrios, in contrast to almost all other bacteria, take up these nucleoside monophosphates into the cell in an intact, phosphorylated form. In this way {{they are able to}} assimilate more effectively the cellular contents of their prey. Studies with UMP and dTMP demonstrate that they are transported and accumulated against a concentration gradient, achieving internal levels at least 10 times the external levels. Treatment of the bdellovibrios with azide or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone eliminates their ability to either transport or maintain accumulated UMP and suggests the presence of a freely reversible exchange mechanism. There are at least two separate classes of transport systems for nucleoside monophosphates, each exhibiting partial specificity for either <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> or deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates. Kinetic analyses of UMP transport in different developmental stages of strain 109 J indicate that each stage expresses a single, saturable uptake system with a distinct apparent substrate affinity constant (Kt) of 104 microM in attack phase cells and 35 microM in prematurely released growth phase filaments. The capacity for transport of UMP by the growth phase filaments was 2. 4 times that of the attack phase cells. These data, in addition to the apparent lack of environmental control of UMP transport capacity in attack phase cells, suggest that there are two transport systems for UMP in bdellovibrios and that the high-affinity, high-capacity growth phase system is developmentally regulated...|$|R
40|$|In mammals four {{deoxyribonucleoside}} kinases, with {{a relatively}} restricted specificity, catalyze the phosphorylation of the four natural deoxyribonucleosides. When cultured mosquito cells, originating from the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, were examined for deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities, only a single enzyme was isolated. Subsequently, the corresponding gene was cloned and over-expressed. While the mosquito kinase (Ag-dNK) phosphorylated all four natural deoxyribonucleosides, it displayed an unexpectedly higher relative efficiency for the phosphorylation of purine versus pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides than the fruit fly multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 145). In addition, Ag-dNK could also phosphorylate some medically interesting nucleoside analogs, like stavudine (D 4 T), 2 -chloro-deoxyadenosine (CdA) and 5 -bromo-vinyl-deoxyuridine (BVDU). Although the biological significance of multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinases and their diversity among insects remains unclear, the observed variation provides {{a whole range of}} applications, as species specific and highly selective targets for insecticides, they have a potential {{to be used in the}} enzymatic production of various (di-) (deoxy-) <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates,</b> and as suicide genes in gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} identity {{and integrity of}} the genome is challenged by the incorporation of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) in place of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) during replication. Misincorporation {{is limited by the}} selectivity of DNA replicases. We show that accumulation of <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> (rNMPs) in the genome causes replication stress and has toxic consequences, particularly in the absence of RNase H 1 and RNase H 2, which remove rNMPs. We demonstrate that postreplication repair (PRR) pathways—MMS 2 -dependent template switch and Pol ζ-dependent bypass—are crucial for tolerating the presence of rNMPs in the chromosomes; indeed, we show that Pol ζ efficiently replicates over 1 – 4 rNMPs. Moreover, cells lacking RNase H accumulate mono- and polyubiquitylated PCNA and have a constitutively activated PRR. Our findings describe a crucial function for RNase H 1, RNase H 2, template switch, and translesion DNA synthesis in overcoming rNTPs misincorporated during DNA replication, and may be relevant for the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome...|$|R
40|$|During intraperiplasmic {{growth of}} Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109 J on Escherichia coli some 30 to 60 % {{of the initial}} E. coli RNA-ribose {{disappeared}} as cell-associated orcinol-positive material. The levels of RNA-ribose in the suspending buffer after growth together with the RNA-ribose used for bdellovibrio DNA synthesis accounted for 50 % or less of the missing RNA-ribose. With intraperiplasmic growth {{in the presence of}} added U- 14 C-labeled CMP, GMP, or UMP, radioactivity was found both in the respired CO 2 and incorporated into the bdellovibrio cell components. The addition of exogenous unlabeled ribonucleotides markedly reduced the amounts of both the 14 CO 2 and 14 C incorporated into the progeny bdellovibrios. During intraperiplasmic growth of B. bacteriovorus on [U- 14 C]ribose-labeled E. coli BJ 565, ca. 74 % and ca. 19 % of the initial 14 C was incorporated into the progeny bdellovibrios and respired CO 2, respectively. Under similar growth conditions, the addition of glutamate substantially reduced only the 14 CO 2; however, added ribonucleotides reduced both the 14 CO 2 and the 14 C incorporated into the progeny bdellovibrios. No similar effects were found with added ribose- 5 -phosphate. The distribution of 14 C in the major cell components was similar in progeny bdellovibrios whether obtained from growth on [U- 14 C]ribose-labeled E. coli BJ 565 or from E. coli plus added U- 14 C-labeled ribonucleotides. After intraperiplasmic growth of B. bacteriovorus on [5, 6 - 3 H-]uracil-[U- 14 C]ribose-labeled E. coli BJ 565 (normal or heat treated), the whole-cell 14 C/ 3 H ratio of the progeny bdellovibrios was some 50 % greater and reflected the higher 14 C/ 3 H ratios found in the cell fractions. B. bacteriovorus and E. coli cell extracts both contained 5 '-nucleotidase, uridine phosphorylase, purine phosphorylase, deoxyribose- 5 -phosphate aldolase, transketolase, thymidine phosphorylase, phosphodeoxyribomutase, and transaldolase enzyme activities. The latter three enzyme activities were either absent or very low in cell extracts prepared from heat-treated E. coli cells. It is concluded that during intraperiplasmic growth B. bacteriovorus degrades some 20 to 40 % of the ribonucleotides derived from the initial E. coli RNA into the base and ribose- 1 -phosphate moieties. The ribose- 1 -phosphate is further metabolized by B. bacteriovorus both for energy production and for biosynthesis, of non-nucleic acid cell material. In addition, the data indicate that during intraperiplasmic growth B. bacteriovorus can metabolize ribose only if this compound is available to it as the <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate...</b>|$|E

The enzyme appears to have a molecular weight of 58500 as determined by Sephadex-column chromatography. Optimal enzymic activity was observed at pH 8. 0; however, the enzyme remained active over a broad pH range of 5. 5 - 9. 0. Several deoxyribonucleoside and <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> and triphosphates were tested as effectors of catalytic activity. Effective inhibitors were dGMP [Ki(app.) = 7. 6 x 10 (- 5) M] and dGTP [Ki(app.) = 2. 1 x 10 (- 5) M]. Both of these inhibitors acted in a competitive manner. A Km(app.) of 3. 2 x 10 (- 7) M was measured for deoxyguanosine and a Km(app.) of 3. 3 mM was determined for MgATP.

Separation of tryptic phosphopeptides has permitted identification of two sites as Ser- 312 and Ser- 389, and permitted analysis of the types of phosphate bonds. The peptide containing Ser- 312 separates electrophoretically into three charged forms; two are resistant to dephosphorylation by both alkaline phosphatase and alkaline hydrolysis, suggesting a phosphodiester. The carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide containing Ser- 389 was alkaline phosphatase-resistant and liberated four <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> upon base or RNase hydrolysis, suggesting that Ser- 389 may be covalently linked to RNA. Phosphorylation of Ser- 389 decreased markedly at the nonpermissive temperature in simian virus 40 tsA 58 -transformed cells, indicating a dependence on native T antigen function and a possible role in transformation by T antigen.

40|$|We have cloned {{the gene}} for polyphosphate:AMP {{phosphotransferase}} (PAP), the enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation of AMP to ADP {{at the expense of}} polyphosphate [poly(P) ] in Acinetobacter johnsonii 210 A. A genomic DNA library was constructed in Escherichia coli, and crude lysates of about 6, 000 clones were screened for PAP activity. PAP activity was evaluated by measuring ATP produced by the coupled reactions of PAP and purified E. coli poly(P) kinases (PPKs). In this coupled reaction, PAP produces ADP from poly(P) and AMP, and the resulting ADP is converted to ATP by PPK. The isolated pap gene (1, 428 bp) encodes a protein of 475 amino acids with a molecular mass of 55. 8 kDa. The C-terminal region of PAP is highly homologous with PPK 2 homologs isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. Two putative phosphate-binding motifs (P-loops) were also identified. The purified PAP enzyme had not only strong PAP activity but also poly(P) -dependent nucleoside monophosphate kinase activity, by which it converted <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> and deoxyribonucleoside <b>monophosphates</b> to <b>ribonucleoside</b> diphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, respectively.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 receptor with RNA and synthetic polynucleotides has been examined by using receptor from rachitic chicken intestine. Total intestinal RNA inhibited the binding of receptor to calf thymus DNA-cellulose with an efficiency equivalent to single-stranded DNA. A comparison of the inhibitory activity of several polyribonucleotides gave the following order of activities: poly(I) = poly(G) {{greater than or equal}} to double-stranded DNA greater than single-stranded DNA = poly(U). Poly(A), poly(C), and the <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> AMP, GMP, CMP, and UMP had minimal activity. A preference for single-stranded homopolymers was observed [i. e., poly(I) and poly(U) were active, whereas poly(I) :poly(C) and poly(U) :poly(A) were not]. The ability of nucleic acids to displace receptor from DNA-cellulose was also measured. Both poly(G) and poly(I) were more active than double-stranded DNA in this assay. Furthermore, differences were noted between intestinal RNA fractions separated on the basis of poly(A) content. Receptor also bound to immobilized intestinal RNA and polynucleotides. The KCl concentration necessary to disrupt binding to a given polynucleotide generally paralleled the activity of that molecule in DNA-cellulose inhibition and displacement assays.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} RNA can serve as a template for double-strand break (DSB) repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using synthetic RNA-containing oligonucleotides (oligos). Following this initial work, we show that the RNA tract of RNA-containing oligos can be copied into DNA to transfer a genetic change at the chromosomal level also in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in human cells. Exploiting the use of oligos containing <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> (rNMPs), we developed a molecular approach to generate RNA/DNA hybrids of chosen sequence and structure at the chromosomal level in both yeast and E. coli cells. Such technique allows us to study how rNMPs present in the DNA genome of cells are tolerated by cells, what factors recognize and target rNMPs in DNA and to what extent the embedded rNMPs may alter genome integrity. Here we proved that mispaired rNMPs embedded into genomic DNA, if not removed, serve as templates for DNA synthesis during chromosomal replication and produce a genetic change. We discovered that mispaired rNMPs that are embedded in genomic DNA are not only targeted by ribonucleases H (RNases H) but also by the mismatch repair (MMR) system both in yeast and in E. coli. Our data reveal novel substrates for the MMR system, and also uncover an unpredicted competition between RNase H and MMR for the RNA/DNA mispairs.

Exploiting the use of oligonucleotides containing rNMPs in a molecular approach to generate various RNA/DNA hybrids of chosen sequence and structure at the chromosomal level in cells, we show that mispaired rNMPs embedded into genomic DNA are not only targeted by ribonucleases H (RNases H) {{but also by the}} mismatch repair (MMR) system both in E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells. In addition, we discovered that paired rNMPs in DNA are targets of both RNase H type 2 and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in yeast. Also, we report atomic force microscopy (AFM) -based single molecule elasticity measurement, molecular dynamics simulation, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy results, showing that rNMPs in short DNA duplexes can change the elastic and structural properties of DNA. Lastly, we developed ribose-seq, a method for capturing rNMPs embedded in DNA. High-throughput sequencing of rNMP-captured molecules from the yeast S. cerevisiae revealed widespread but non-random rNMP distribution with preferences in base composition of rNMPs and neighboring DNA sequence context in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. With ribose-seq, systematic profiling of rNMP incorporation into genomic DNA is achieved, potentially allowing determination of specific signatures of rNMPs in DNA which could help to better understand the nature of rNMP repair mechanisms, effect of rNMPs on DNA mechanical properties and structure, and eventually rNMP impact on genome integrity.

Top 1 generates a distinctive mutation signature characterized by deletions in short, tandem repeats, and a similar signature is associated with <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> (rNMPs) in DNA. DNA polymerases incorporate rNMPs into genomic DNA, and such rNMPs are efficiently removed in an error-free manner by ribonuclease (RNase) H 2. In the absence of RNase H 2, persistent rNMPs give rise to short deletions via a mutagenic process initiated by a Top 1 incision at an rNMP. There is only partial overlap, however, between Top 1 -dependent deletion hotspots identified in highly transcribed DNA and those associated with rNMPs, suggesting the existence of both rNMP-dependent and rNMP-independent events. Here I present evidence that rNMP-independent hotspots reflect processing of a trapped Top 1 cleavage complex (Top 1 cc), and that rNMP-dependent hotspots reflect sequential Top 1 reactions. A sequential-cleavage model for rNMP-dependent deletions is tested in vivo and in vitro, employing Top 1 cleavage and ligation assays. In addition, I report that rNMP-dependent hotspot activity is significantly enhanced when Top 1 incises the non-transcribed strand of an actively transcribing reporter gene.

Transformed cells are able to continually produce progeny virus particles. Evidence is given that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is present in virus infected cells. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase isolated from AMV-infected myeloblasts had an absolute requirement for heteropolymer RNA, and 64 S RNA from AMV was the preferred primer for RNA synthesis. Under assay conditions where ribonuclease activity was inhibited by polyvinylsulfate, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesized RNA in vitro which had the velocity sedimentation properties of 64 S RNA from AMV. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was separated by CM-Sephadex chromatography into two polymerase activities which did not incorporate all four <b>ribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> equally into RNA product. In particular, a polymerase fraction was obtained which incorporated only UMP into RNA product, but maintained the specificity for high molecular weight RNA as primer. An RNA polymerase activity was also obtained by detergent solubilization procedures which synthesized RNA from a template associated with the enzyme fraction. The activity was largely resistant to deoxyribonuclease. Under appropriate assay conditions the detergent- solubilized RNA polymerase also synthesized RNA product which had velocity sedimentation properties of 64 S RNA from AMV. RNA tumor virus particles contain DNA polymerase. Evidence is presented that both RNA and DNA will serve as templates for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase from AMV and MC 29 virus. AMV particles and MC 29 virus were banded isopycnically in preformed glycerol density gradients. DNA polymerase activity was located at a buoyant density (1. 16 gm/cc) characteristic of tumor virus particles. Virus-associated DNA polymerase was also isolated from chick myeloblasts infected with AMV and from chick embryo culture (CEC) cells infected with MC 29 virus. The virus-associated DNA polymerasE banded isopycnically at a buoyant density of 1. 16 gm/cc. RNA polymerase also banded at the same buoyant density.
