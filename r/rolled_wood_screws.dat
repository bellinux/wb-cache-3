40|$|The {{experimental}} study {{presented in this}} paper consists of two series of tests concerned with jointing performance of <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> for particleboard. In the first series of test, withdrawal test of wood wcrews from the face or edge of particleboard were performed. In withdrawal tests, the sizes of <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> and pilot hole were varied and the driving torque was also measured. In the second series of tests, two specimens (rail and post) of particleboard were constructed in the form of L-type with <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> Knife thread insert nuts or adhesive, and the rail was placed in the flat position. The bending load (out-of-plane force) was applied to it, and static and repetitive bending tests of L-type construction were carried out. And from the measured results, the angular stiffness of the L-type construction was calculated from Eq. (82 ̆ 7). The results obtained are as follows. (1) Under a constant diameter of <b>wood</b> <b>screw,</b> driving torque and withdrawal resistance increase with increase of the length of screw. However, under a constant length of <b>wood</b> <b>screw,</b> driving torque increases with increase of the diameter of screw, but withdrawal resistance decreases. These results indicate that it is more effective to use longer <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> than to use thicker screws. (2) Withdrawal resistance of each size of <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> is affected by the diameterratio of pilot hole to <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> and it shows the largest value at the diameter ratio 0. 5. Considering a labor efficency at the jointing work, however, it seems better to use the diameter ratio 0. 6 to 0. 7. (3) The bending fracture load of L-type constructinos connected with <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> is affected considerably by the length of <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> and is under control of the internal bond strength of particleboard. The angular stiffness of L-type construction depends on both withdrawal resistance and the resistanceto the deformation of the <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> caused by bending load. The fracture load and the angular stiffness show larger values in the case that the L-type construction is connected with insert nuts than those in the case of <b>wood</b> <b>screws.</b> (4) The strength and the stiffness of L-type construction are improved by jointing with both <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> and adhesive. Especially, by use of epoxy resin, the strength increases remarkably. (5) The fatigue strength of L-type construction connected with each type of joints is in proportion approximately to their static strength. パーティクルボードを供試材料として,その接合部の性能を評価するための基礎資料を得る目的から,案内孔寸法と木ねじのねじ込みトルクおよび引抜き抵抗との関係,ならびに木ねじ,ねじ込み式ナットおよび接着剤による接合部の静的あるいは繰返し曲げ荷重に対する強度および剛性について基礎実験を行ない,以下の結論を得た. (1) 長さの異なる木ねじについては,引抜き抵抗はねじ込みトルクに比例して増加するが,直径の異なる場合は,ねじ込みトルクの増加に伴う引抜き抵抗の増加が少ない. また,各寸法の木ねじに対して,その引抜き抵抗は案内乳棒比がほぼ 0. 5 のときに最大値をとる. (2) 木ねじにより接合したしL字試験片に此げ荷重を加えた場合,その破壊荷重は木ねじの長さおよび棚板の内部結合力に支配される. また,角度変化に関する剛性は,木ねじの引抜き抵抗および曲げあるいさません断=よる変形に対する抵抗に支配される. (3) ねじ込み式ナットを用いて接合した場合は,圧入式のAタイプを除いて, 強度および剛性ともに木ねじの場合より高い値を示す. (4) 木ねじと接旨剤を併用することにより,強度および剛性ともに改善することができる. とくに,エポキシ樹脂接着剤を用いた場合,強度を著しく向上することができ,その破壊形態にも頓著な差異が認められる. (5) 繰返し曲げ試験では,いずれの接合法においても,荷重と破壊繰返し数との間には,両対数グラフ上で負の直線相関が認められる. また,疲労強度は静的強度に支配される...|$|R
