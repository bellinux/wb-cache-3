40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} examine changes in daily <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> {{associated}} with open market share repurchases. Design/methodology/approach – Univariate analyses, control sample analyses, and {{multiple regression analyses}} are employed to explore relations between daily <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> {{and a number of}} variables. Findings – This study finds evidence that an open market share repurchase firm, by actively buying back its shares when the share price falls, reduces daily <b>return</b> <b>volatility.</b> The results suggest that it is the subsequent actual buyback trading activity, not the announcement, that is significantly negatively associated with changes in daily <b>return</b> <b>volatility.</b> CAPM beta, a measure of systematic risk, decreases only when the firm is in the market actively repurchasing its shares.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between volume and <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> using the transaction data. We introduce transaction and volume imbalance measures to capture the information content of trades. These two information measures are shown to have a strong explanatory power for <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> and contain incremental information about the asset values over and above that conveyed by the size and frequency of trades. Also, <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> is significantly correlated with the percentage of trading volume taking place at NYSE. This result suggests that NYSE trades are more informative and contribute more to price discovery. There is evidence that price discovery concentrates in more heavily traded stocks, particularly the Dow Jones Stocks. Finally, <b>return</b> <b>volatility</b> is found to be persistent at the intraday level. The persistence level is higher for less frequently traded stocks. <b>Return</b> <b>volatility</b> also exhibits temporal variations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Clustering Method to {{understand}} whether stock market volatility can be predicted at all, and if so, {{when it can}} be predicted. The exercise has been performed for the Indian stock market on daily data for two years. For our analysis we map number of clusters against number of variables. We then test for efficiency of clustering. Our contention is that, given a fixed number of variables, one of them being historic <b>volatility</b> of NIFTY <b>returns,</b> if {{increase in the number}} of clusters improves clustering efficiency, then volatility cannot be predicted. Volatility then becomes random as, for a given time period, it gets classified in various clusters. On the other hand, if efficiency falls with {{increase in the number of}} clusters, then volatility can be predicted as there is some homogeneity in the data. If we fix the number of clusters and then increase the number of variables, this should have some impact on clustering efficiency.
