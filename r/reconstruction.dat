5|$|Phylogenetic <b>reconstruction</b> and ancestral state <b>reconstruction</b> proceed by {{assuming}} that evolution has occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic <b>reconstruction,</b> and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{progress}} toward <b>reconstruction</b> was seen under {{the administration of}} President Marc Ravalomanana (2001–2009) who created the Comité national du patrimoine (CMP, or National Heritage Committee) responsible for overseeing the effort.

Efforts to restore the chapel, the monument least affected by the fire due to its stone structure, focused particularly on restoring its roof, steeple and wooden pews along with altar panels that had burned in the fire. Work on the chapel was completed in 2003. <b>Reconstruction</b> work on Mahitsy began in 2001 and was completed in January 2003, while planning for the <b>reconstruction</b> of Besakana began in December 2003 but stalled in 2009. The restoration of the nine royal tombs in the Rova complex was completed in October 2003. In early January 2006, Phase1 of the Manjakamiadana <b>reconstruction</b> commenced. This phase was scheduled for completion in May 2008. The <b>reconstruction</b> of the larger wooden palaces, such as Tranovola and Manampisoa, has not been planned.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{investigated}} Si-rich <b>reconstructions</b> of 4 H-SiC (0011) surfaces {{by means of}} low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and angle-resolved ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS).

40|$|Objective: Implant-based breast <b>reconstructions</b> are conceptually {{simple but}} prone to {{surgical}} revisions. Additional procedures {{often fail to}} address the problems associated with the reconstructive outcome, especially in patients who have received radiotherapy.

5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that <b>reconstruction</b> in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major <b>reconstruction</b> efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial <b>reconstruction</b> projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that <b>reconstruction</b> was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle <b>reconstruction</b> on a national scale. As more US military <b>reconstruction</b> units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E

Proxy-based sea-level <b>reconstructions</b> place the instrumentally observed rates of recent sea-level rise in a longer term context by providing data that extend the instrumental sea-level record into past centuries. This paper presents the first sea-level <b>reconstructions</b> based on analyses of testate amoebae, to test their ability to produce high-precision <b>reconstructions</b> of past sea level. We present two <b>reconstructions</b> for the past 100 yr from sites in Maine (USA) and Nova Scotia (Canada) based on short cores from salt marshes, and modern training data from North America and the United Kingdom. These are compared with tide-gauge records and <b>reconstructions</b> based on foraminifera from the same cores. The <b>reconstructions</b> show good agreement with both the tide-gauge data and the foraminifera-based <b>reconstructions.</b> The UK data perform well in predicting known elevations of North American surface samples and produce sea-level <b>reconstructions</b> {{very similar to those}} based on the North American data, suggesting the methodology is robust across large geographical areas. We conclude that testate amoebae have the potential to provide robust, higher precision sea-level <b>reconstructions</b> for the past few centuries if modern transfer functions are improved and core sites are located within the main zone of testate amoebae occurrence on the salt marsh...|$|R

40|$|AbstractQuantitative {{palaeoclimate}} <b>reconstructions</b> {{are widely}} used to evaluate climate model performance. Here, {{as part of an}} effort to provide such a data set for Australia, we examine the impact of analytical decisions and sampling assumptions on modern-analogue <b>reconstructions</b> using a continent-wide pollen data set. There is a high degree of correlation between temperature variables in the modern climate of Australia, but there is sufficient orthogonality in the variations of precipitation, summer and winter temperature and plant–available moisture to allow independent <b>reconstructions</b> of these four variables to be made. The method of analogue selection does not affect the <b>reconstructions,</b> although bootstrap resampling provides a more reliable technique for obtaining robust measures of uncertainty. The number of analogues used affects the quality of the reconstructions: the most robust <b>reconstructions</b> are obtained using 5 analogues. The quality of <b>reconstructions</b> based on post- 1850 CE pollen samples differ little from those using samples from between 1450 and 1849 CE, showing that European post-settlement modification of vegetation has no impact on the fidelity of the <b>reconstructions</b> although it substantially increases the availability of potential analogues. <b>Reconstructions</b> based on core top samples are more realistic than those using surface samples, but only using core top samples would substantially reduce the number of available analogues and therefore increases the uncertainty of the <b>reconstructions.</b> Spatial and/or temporal averaging of pollen assemblages prior to analysis negatively affects the subsequent <b>reconstructions</b> for some variables and increases the associated uncertainties. In addition, the quality of the <b>reconstructions</b> is affected by the degree of spatial smoothing of the original climate data, with the best <b>reconstructions</b> obtained using climate data from a 0. 5 ° resolution grid, which corresponds to the typical size of the pollen catchment. This study provides a methodology that can be used to provide reliable palaeoclimate <b>reconstructions</b> for Australia, which will fill in a major gap in the data sets used to evaluate climate models...|$|R

Using synthetic nondifferential data we calcu-late the error in the reconstructed images of optical properties as functions of source modulation frequency, noise level in measurement, and diffusion extrapolation length. We observe that the differences between diffusion and transport <b>reconstructions</b> are large when highmodulation frequencies and noise-free data are used in the <b>reconstructions.</b> When the noise in data reaches a certain level, approximately 12 % in our simulations, the differences between diffusion- and transport-based <b>reconstructions</b> become almost indis-tinguishable.
