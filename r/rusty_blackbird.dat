500|$|The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has {{listed the}} park as Pennsylvania Important Bird Area (IBA) #1, and it {{considered}} one of the best birdwatching sites on Pennsylvania. The diversity of habitats on the peninsula makes it an ideal home for over 320species of birds. (For comparison, the United States has about 925bird species.) Forty-five of the bird species found in the park are listed as [...] "endangered" [...] or [...] "threatened", including the piping plover, cerulean warbler, <b>rusty</b> <b>blackbird</b> and saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow. Waterfowl and wading birds live at Presque Isle year round. Four species of gull and three species of tern can be seen at Gull Point during the summer months. The majority of collection during the annual Christmas Bird Count, which has been held in Erie County since 1956, is garnered from observations made by volunteers within the park. Many different species of plants and animals can also be found at Presque Isle State Park due to the wide variety of ecological zones.|$|E

However, this issue has been analyzed and found to be non-significant and not discussed by Avery (2013). [...] <b>Rusty</b> <b>blackbirds</b> primarily feed on invertebrates in wet woodlands and near streams throughout the year. Even though they roost with other <b>blackbirds,</b> <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbirds</b> usually will not feed with them. It should be noted that <b>rusty</b> <b>blackbirds</b> are a species not likely to be taken protecting crops because they mostly feed in wet woodland bottoms on acorns, pine seeds, fruits, and animal matter during winter, but sometimes will be found in feedlots (Avery 2013). Even at the highest potential nontarget take with Starlicide, few, if any, would be taken and not a cause a decline in their population. Habitat issues, possibly on their Canadian breeding habitat and on wintering grounds in the southeastern United States such as the decline of wetlands, is likely the primary reason for their decline.|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, these owls may prey on {{threatened}} species. Following {{the devastation}} to its populations from DDT, the reintroduction of the peregrine falcon to the Mississippi and Hudson Rivers was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night. Similarly, as mainly recorded in New England, attempts to reintroduce ospreys, {{after they were}} also hit hard by DDT, were effected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of roseate terns. Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the Pacific Northwest, spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation. While at least the ospreys and peregrines have rebounded admirably nonetheless, bird and mammal species that are much rarer overall sometimes fall prey to great horned owls, many in which even sporadic losses can be devastating. Among the species considered threatened, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN which are also known to be killed by great horned owls are Townsend's ground squirrels (Urocitellus townsendii), Pacific pocket mice (Perognathus pacificus), giant kangaroo rats, Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), black-footed ferrets, greater and lesser prairie chickens, marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), ivory-billed woodpeckers, Florida scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), pinyon jays, Kirtland's warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) and <b>rusty</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (Euphagus carolinus). The American Bird Conservancy's “green list” includes birds with considerable population declines (many classed as near threatened by the IUCN) or other immediate threats and/or restricted populations.

40|$|Red-winged Blackbirds (RWBL) and Common Grackles (COGR) are the {{two most}} {{abundant}} blackbird species on the continent; Brewer’s Blackbirds (BRBL) are a much less common, but closely related species, and along with European Starlings (EUST), they are two of the most common groups of birds in North America, with combined populations that reach into the several hundreds of millions; making up {{a significant portion of the}} avian population. Although one of the most common birds on the continent, certain regions have seen declines in RWBL for a number of decades. In Ohio and North Dakota, this has been attributed to certain agricultural practices. Population sizes of <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbirds,</b> a related species, have also been on the decline for some time due largely to habitat loss, while populations of COGR, BRBL, and EUST are either stable or increasing. Despite the decline of the RWBL in certain areas, farmers continue to endure annual monetary losses to depredation by these crop pests. In some areas, complaints of blackbird depredation have increased, giving impressions that populations in those areas are on the rise instead of decline. Damage to sunflower has been estimated at 2 - 4 % of the value of the crops, or approximately $ 4 -$ 11 million dollars. Yearly losses to corn and rice growers in the US are even higher, estimated at $ 25 million and $ 21. 5 million respectively. A better understanding of blackbird population trends and how and where populations select wintering roosts would permit quicker responses and reduce the costs of identifying and managing roosts for the purposes of resource protection, and disease outbreak prevention...|$|R

50|$|Rusty {{blackbirds}} {{have declined}} significantly in recent decades. The reasons are unclear, but habitat loss is likely {{a major contributor}} to the decline.

Deliberate poisoning of mixed-species blackbird flocks, targeting brown-headed cowbird, common grackle and red-winged blackbird, in the southeastern U.S. may also be playing a role; there is currently no estimate of the number of rusty blackbirds killed by these poisonings.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> (Euphagus carolinus) has {{suffered}} significant population declines across its entire geographic range and the mechanisms {{associated with this}} decline are poorly understood. Although much of the <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> breeding habitat in Alaska has remained relatively unaltered by anthropogenic activities, this species continues to decline by an estimated 5 % annually. As part of a collaborative effort to obtain data on the reproductive ecology, breeding success, and habitat requirements of this species throughout their range, a total of 42 nests were found and monitored for two consecutive breeding seasons (2009 – 2010) on the Copper River Delta in south-central Alaska. Nests were monitored every 2 - 4 days to calculate nest success, survival rates, clutch initiation date, clutch size, egg viability, and fledging rates. In 2010, chick provisioning rates, chick diet, and aquatic invertebrate availability in <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> foraging habitats were also investigated. Mean clutch size ranged from 5 to 7 eggs both years (2009 = 5. 41 ± 0. 15, 2010 = 5. 67 ± 0. 13). Daily nest survival rate averaged over both seasons was high, at 0. 9913 ± 0. 0043 (95 % CI 0. 9772 - 0. 9967) and most eggs were viable (N = 31 nests), with 0. 8922 ± 0. 0275 of eggs over both seasons hatching. Approximately 85 % of clutches were initiated within a two week period for both years of the study. Clutch-initiation date (CID) was significantly different between years (p-value < 0. 0001), with mean CID of 10 May (x̅ = 10. 476 ± 0. 95) in 2010 and May 18 (x̅ = 18. 421 ± 1. 13) in 2009. The mean provisioning rate was 0. 84 (± 0. 06; 95 % CI: 0. 72 to 0. 95) invertebrate food items per chick per hour. Large odonate nymphs, specifically dragonflies, made up the bulk (97. 2 %) of the observed food items provisioned to chicks. Weekly pond sampling revealed four taxonomic groups of invertebrates that were of the size observed provisioned to chicks (Coleoptera, Hirudinea, Zygoptera, Anisoptera) and Anisoptera were among the rarest collected (16. 2 %) of this size. Although the least common large invertebrate collected, Anisoptera nymphs were present in all weekly samples. The week with the most abundant Anisoptera collection coincided with the week of peak hatching during 2010 of the study. Thus, availability of dragonfly nymphs appear to be important to <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> reproductive success on the Copper River Delta and {{may have contributed to}} the high nest success observed in this study...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> {{is listed}} as a species of "special concern" by the Committee On the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada, and has shown steep {{population}} declines in recent decades.

The number of lakes on which this species occurred {{does not appear to have}} declined significantly in the past three decades when a correction for survey duration was applied. The range-wide decline of 5. 1 %/yr based on Christmas Bird Count data would have resulted in 2006 occupancy at ≈ 5 lakes. We estimate that with correction this would have increased to ≈ 26. However, naive or unadjusted analyses with a Chi-squared test showed a significant decline. A simulated resampling of the historical data was performed using a repeatability factor of 62 % that was derived from a subset of historical lakes that was visited twice in the 1970 s. Only 8 of 13 lakes resurveyed had the same results on both historical visits. Our unadjusted 2006 results are a likely outcome, i. e., a 14. 9 % chance of finding this result, when this repeatability factor is considered, and the likelihood of no change is higher when our corrected data are considered. The possibility of double counting in the historical data further reduced the likelihood of a large decline in relative abundance. Therefore, <b>Rusty</b> <b>Blackbird</b> occurrence does not appear to have changed significantly in the past 33 yr in the Mackenzie Valley. We conclude with a qualitative discussion that supports the notion that declines in the southern parts of their range may be a large factor in the observed rates of population decline...|$|E

Behavioral observations were employed to identify the social mating system and parental nest investment in relation to genetic contributions. In contrast to previous studies, my results indicate that male Rusty Blackbirds are not socially monogamous; over 15 % of nests belonged to polygynous males. There was no evidence of polyandry or egg dumping, but extra-pair paternity (EPP) occurred in ??? 33 % of nests. There was no correlation between the proportion of young that a male sired in a nest and either feeding rate or nest defense. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of environmental and social factors on mating systems and the rates of polygamy and EPP in Rusty Blackbirds...|$|E
