25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack.

2500|$|Falasca {{noted the}} 2009 {{testimony}} of Sister Margherita Marin (b. 1941), {{who was one}} of the two nuns that found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 September. John Paul I had made it a practice to have a morning coffee in the sacristy and then go into the chapel to pray before tending to the day's matters. Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails. Sister Vincenza said: [...] "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: [...] "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" [...] because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems. Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did. Marin testified that [...] "he was in bed with a slight smile" [...] on his face. The <b>reading</b> <b>light</b> over the headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets. Luciani was still in his pajamas with a few typewritten sheets in his hands. His hear was slightly turned to the right and his eyes were partially closed; his glasses rested on his nose.|$|E

The outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature, and, thanks to the energetic efforts of the District authorities, is now almost at an end.
