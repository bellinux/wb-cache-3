In August 2011, GMG announced {{a deal with the}} magazine publisher IPC whereby Smooth Radio would sponsor the TV Times Awards. A trip to Kenya was given away in association with the Kenya Tourist Board in the lead up to the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton; the winners would stay at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the royal couple became engaged. High Street retailer Boots UK launched The Feel Good Forum, a health and beauty lifestyle programme that began airing for an eight-week run on <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Smooth from March 2013. The show, presented by Kate Thornton was a collaboration between the broadcaster, Boots and other partners, including the Mumsnet website. Some online content was also produced to supplement the programme. In July 2013, <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Smooth secured a deal with the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games to be the Official Media Partner for its Ticketing Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Between 1961 and 1989, when Real {{dominated}} La Liga, only Atlético {{offered it}} any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético {{became the first}} team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable. A high point coming in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 0–4 victory at Atlético at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013. In 2013–14, <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Atlético were finalists of UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from same city. Real Madrid triumphed with 4–1 in extra time. On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss. On 28 May 2016, <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Atlético met again for the Champions League title in Milan which resulted in a win for Real Madrid via Penalty Shootout.|$|E

Formally, variables <b>and</b> <b>real</b> constants are expressions, as any arithmetic operator over other expressions. Variables, constants (zero-arity-function symbols), and expressions are terms, as any function symbol applied to terms. In other words, terms are built over expressions, while expressions are built over numbers and variables. In this case, variables ranges over <b>real</b> numbers <b>and</b> terms. In other words, a variable can take a real number as a value, while another takes a term.|$|R

5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Smooth. <b>Real</b> <b>and</b> Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E
