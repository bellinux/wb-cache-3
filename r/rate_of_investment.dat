40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at the {{evaluation}} of {{a relationship between the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings in selected Central European countries. A reference period for the analysis is 1995 – 2009. In all analysed Central European countries, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> permanently exceeded (but exceptions) the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings in the period under investigation. Through fitting the development series of a calculated indicator as a difference <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings in monitored countries by a polynomial of the second degree it was possible to compare developmental trends of this indicator in particular countries involved in this analysis. Polynomial trends of the difference indicator <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings in Central European countries in the monitored period indicate similar developmental tendencies characterized (at the beginning of the reference period) by increasing the imbalance <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings (on average until about 2003) and then by follow-up tendencies towards the gradual return to the balance. For the purpose of comparison, a difference was also monitored between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings in EU 15 countries as a whole, which permanently fluctuated around zero. The mean value of this indicator amounted to 0. 11 % for the period 1995 – 2009. Thus, in EU 15 countries, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> roughly corresponded to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings (on a long-term basis). Based on this analysis, it follows that there is a correlation between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> savings. Calculated parameters of particular regression functions are presented as Results in this paper. Indices of correlation and types of a regression function were calculated for particular countries. For the Czech Republic, these results are statistically highly significant using all three types of regression functions. In Poland, they can be indicated as statistically significant using the polynomial of the second and third degrees similarly as in Slovakia. In Hungary, already the use of a polynomial of the first degree results in statistically significant results. Using a polynomial of the third degree gives statistically highly significant results. The intertemporal analysis <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and savings presented in this paper can be also used and developed as part of the problem of an intertemporal approach to the balance of payments...|$|R

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, [...] "more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in education. Both are reflected in higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and therefore growth." ...|$|R

If per capita income is increased above the minimum subsistence level, it encourages growth in population. The population growth, in turn pushes down per capita income again to subsistence level.

50|$|While {{the overall}} level of {{investment}} within the agricultural sector did not change much during the reform period, substantial changes took place in investment patterns.

Whereas communes had invested considerable sums in agriculture, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> from the newly formed economic cooperatives was far below the rate before the reform. The revitalization and extension of the rural banking system (the Agricultural Bank and rural credit cooperatives) and favorable lending policies did provide a small but steady source of investment funds for the sector. The major change, however, was that after 1978 farm families were allowed to invest funds, and their investment in small tractors, rural industry, and housing was substantial. In 1983 rural households invested ¥21 billion in housing compared with ¥11 billion from state sources.|$|E
