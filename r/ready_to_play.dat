Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.|$|E
5|$|When Kerry Collins made {{it known}} {{that he did not}} want to stay with the Giants until they {{eventually}} demoted him for Manning, the Giants released Collins. They later signed quarterback Kurt Warner, to serve as the interim quarterback until Manning was deemed <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> Warner had led the St. Louis Rams to two Super Bowls, winning one of them. However, Warner had been affected by injuries, specifically a broken hand, which reduced his effectiveness and led to his release by the Rams.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian {{embassy in}} Moscow {{learned of the}} Soviets' {{interest}} in a series initially through reading {{an article in the}} Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, read that the Soviets were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series.|$|E
5|$|On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for {{the first}} time in his career in 2005, Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to {{activate}} Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options; but told that he would be back, Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket. Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options, he got a call-up—prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice—one August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before a game. Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games, he packed his car, drove the 40 miles to Boston, walked into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his jersey and cleats, and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the Canucks' Game 7 loss, Kesler was awarded the Selke Trophy after {{finishing}} as a runner-up the previous two years. He received 1,179 voting points in comparison to runners-up Jonathan Toews' 476 and Pavel Datsyuk's 348. Kesler was also ranked eighth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting as the league's most valuable player. Later in the off-season, Kesler underwent arthroscopic surgery for the torn labrum in his hip. Unrelated to his labrum tear in 2007, he had adopted a program to recuperate from the injury naturally until a specialist advised him to have surgery in late-July 2011. The Canucks announced on August 2 that Kesler had successfully undergone the procedure, while it was also reported {{he would not be}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> until mid-October. On schedule, he returned to the lineup on October 18 against the New York Rangers after missing the first five games of the 2011–12 season. Appearing in 77 contests, Kesler recorded his lowest scoring total in four years with 22 goals, 27 assists and 49 points. On a team basis, the Canucks remained a successful regular season team, winning their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy. They failed to defend their Western Conference playoff title, however, losing in the first round to the Los Angeles Kings in five games. Kesler recorded three assists in the series.|$|E

5|$|Including Bradley, the Capitals lost {{six players}} {{who played for}} them in the playoffs, as well as back-up goaltender Semyon Varlamov. To replace some of the {{departed}} players, Washington traded its 2011 first round draft pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for veteran winger Troy Brouwer, {{who was a member of}} the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup championship team in 2010. They then signed Joel Ward as a free agent, adding grit and the hopes that he could duplicate his 2011 playoff success. Ward scored seven goals and 13 points in 12 playoff games with the Nashville Predators, after scoring 10 goals and 29 points in 80 regular season games. In net, they added veteran Tomas Vokoun, who was considered to be one of the top goaltenders in the 2011 free agent class. He signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract, well below his believed market value, to have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup. After making these and other off-season moves, the Capitals were over the NHL salary cap. The expectation was that defenseman Tom Poti would not be able to play due to injury and Washington would be forced to place him on long-term injured reserve, where his $2.9 million salary would not count against the cap total. Unexpectedly, Poti told the Capitals that he would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> by training camp. Poti, however, failed his medical exam prior to training camp and was placed on long-term injured reserve.|$|E

25|$|Davis was {{originally}} a billiards player; he called billiards 'his first love' {{and he won}} the British Boys Under 16 Billiards Championship in 1929. He turned professional automatically under {{the rules of the}} Billiards Association and Control Council in 1929. By the time that he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> competitive billiards, the sport was in sharp decline, although he did beat Kingsley Kennerley to win the United Kingdom Professional Billiards Championship in 1951. Davis remarked that once snooker had come to the fore he assumed that he would never play another billiards match.|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} system of two time intervals between plays are established (and would be timed using the play clock): For normal plays, the offensive team has 45 seconds to snap the ball after the previous play is signaled dead.

25|$|Tuners {{are used}} by guitar {{technicians}} who are hired by rock and pop bands {{to ensure that all}} of the band's instruments are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at all times. Guitar technicians (often called guitar techs) tune all of the instruments (electric guitars, electric basses, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc.) before the show, after they are played, and before they are used onstage. Guitar techs also retune instruments throughout the show. Whereas amateur musicians typically use a relatively inexpensive quartz tuner, guitar technicians typically use expensive, high-end tuners such as strobe tuners. Most strobe tuners, counter-intuitively, also use quartz crystal oscillators as time references, although the responses are processed differently by the different units.|$|E
25|$|During his career, Houston {{was known}} for his three-point {{shooting}} prowess. Despite the on-court accolades, though, Houston's lasting legacy may be something that happened off the court: In 2001, Houston signed a six-year, $100.4 million contract extension with the Knicks. Houston's yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury problems would burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950–51 Ashes series the MCC {{tour manager}} Freddie Brown arrived at Melbourne for the Fifth and final Test having lost the series 4–0, but won the match {{and won a}} great ovation from the Australian crowd who admired his {{fighting}} spirit throughout the series. He now arrived with Peter May's team hoping {{to do the same}} and the players were keen to salvage something from the tour. Arthur Milton was sent home with his broken finger, Brian Statham and Peter Loader had been injured in a car accident when their tyre blew, Godfrey Evans was still recovering from his broken finger and Willie Watson suffered a groin strain bowling in the nets. This reduced the touring team to 13 fit players, but Jim Laker was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> and returned to the team with Ted Dexter and Roy Swetman. Tony Lock's 5 wickets had cost 75.20 and was dropped in favour of debutant off-spinner John Mortimore. This was a surprise for the Australians, but even more so to Lock, who heard the news on the radio. The home team dropped batsman Les Favell in favour of the fast bowler Ian Meckiff whose bruised foot had healed. Mel McInnes was replaced as umpire by Les Townsend in his only Test as umpire.|$|E

40|$|Return from {{athletic}} injury can be {{a lengthy}} and difficult process. The injured athlete commonly receives care from several providers during rehabilitation.

25|$|In {{the next}} 2009–10 season, he again had to {{battle with a}} couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a lot worse than original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the season, he {{had surgery}} on his right ankle and foot to correct {{deformities}} because of an abnormal arch that caused him to stretch his ankle tendons. He was expected to have the same surgery done on his left foot and to be sidelined until January, but a doctor considered he did not need it and he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> by the start of the 2006–07 NHL season. On 14 September 2006, Forsberg became the Flyers' 15th captain in team history, after Keith Primeau retired. The season was troubled for him: as the Flyers were having their worst season ever, Forsberg had not fully recovered from his right foot problems and had doubts about his future. With his contract ending at {{the end of the}} season and with no commitment on Forsberg's part to signing a new contract or to retire, on 15 February 12 days before the trade deadline, the Flyers traded him to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Ryan Parent, Scottie Upshall and Nashville's first- and third-round 2007 picks to boost Nashville's playoff run. At the Predators' last regular season game, Forsberg returned to Denver for the first time since leaving the Colorado Avalanche. He assisted on another former Avalanche player Paul Kariya's game-winning goal that eliminated any chances the Avalanche had of progressing to the playoffs, the first time ever the franchise had failed to do so since moving to Colorado. The Predators lost in the first round of the playoffs against the San Jose Sharks, with Forsberg scoring four points in the five game series. Forsberg had an average of less than one point per game in the regular season for the first time in his career and for the second time in the playoffs.|$|E
