5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. To open this canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E

5|$|From Yemen, as from Egypt, the Ayyubids {{aimed to}} {{dominate}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> trade routes which Egypt depended on and so sought to tighten their grip over the Hejaz, where an important trade stop, Yanbu, was located. To favor trade {{in the direction of}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea,</b> the Ayyubids built facilities along the Red Sea-Indian Ocean trade routes to accompany merchants. The Ayyubids also aspired to back their claims of legitimacy within the Caliphate by having sovereignty over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The conquests and economic advancements undertaken by Saladin effectively established Egypt's hegemony in the region.|$|E

5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea.</b> The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea.</b> Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|The ship's career {{spanned the}} globe, and {{ranged from a}} {{deployment}} to China to help suppress the Boxer Rebellion in 1899–1901, to tours in the Americas throughout the 1900s, {{and a trip to}} Australia in 1905. During the Italo-Turkish War, she was transferred to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea,</b> where she bombarded Ottoman troops and ports and helped to enforce a blockade before returning to Italy in April 1912 for a refit. The ship continued to serve in the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> during World War I and as a result, did not see action. She was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and then a training ship in early 1924, before being sold for scrap in November 1924.|$|E

All was not lost, since he and the estimated 70 other passengers passed the week playing games and dancing.|$|E
5|$|Animals without blood {{were divided}} into soft-shelled Malakostraka (crabs, lobsters, and shrimps); {{hard-shelled}} Ostrakoderma (gastropods and bivalves); soft-bodied Malakia (cephalopods); and divisible animals Entoma (insects, spiders, scorpions, ticks). Other animals without blood included fish lice, hermit crabs, <b>red</b> coral, <b>sea</b> anemones, sponges, starfish and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.|$|R

5|$|They are {{relatively}} abundant from the poles to the equator and {{are found in}} all the oceans. They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while {{their presence in the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> may account for their absence. The Black Sea's lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. First ever sighting in Pakistan was made in 2017. First ever record on west coast of Korean Peninsula (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one on Ganghwa Island in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} in 1932–33, the D class {{formed the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla {{assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet. The flotilla toured the Persian Gulf and the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> in September–November 1933. After refitting in the UK during 1934, the flotilla {{was transferred to the}} China Station, arriving at Hong Kong in January 1935 and renumbered as the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. Most of the flotilla was sent to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935–36. They returned to the Hong Kong in mid-1936 and remained there until World War II began. Diamond {{was in the midst of}} a refit that lasted until November, but the rest of the flotilla was immediately transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Daring was kept in the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> for escort duties until November, but the rest of the flotilla was used on contraband patrol duties upon arrival. They all needed repairs which were made before the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the first}} Gulf War the Royal Australian Navy {{periodically}} deployed a ship to the Gulf or <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> to assist in maintaining sanctions against Iraq.

These operations were conducted by boarding parties from the RAN warships.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{habitats}} exist within the site.

50|$|The cliff-top {{grassland}} is species-rich, with a {{range of}} different plant communities. Where the limestone is at the surface, calcareous wildflowers are abundant, notably quaking grass, rock-rose and wild thyme. Other localities have neutral, deeper soil and cowslips, dog-violets and bird's foot trefoil are common. Nearer the sea, salt spray gives a maritime grassland community, including <b>red</b> fescue, <b>sea</b> carrot and buck's-horn plantain.|$|R

5|$|Aksum's {{currency}} {{served as}} a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity). It also facilitated the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> trade on which it thrived. The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings {{due to the lack}} of extensive archaeological work in the area.|$|E
5|$|Chinese envoys {{had been}} sailing through the Indian Ocean to India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, {{yet it was}} during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese {{maritime}} presence could be found in the Persian Gulf and <b>Red</b> <b>Sea,</b> into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt, Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{neutralization}} of Ottoman {{naval forces}} in the region, Aretusa {{and the rest of}} the Italian ships then commenced a bombardment campaign against the Turkish ports in the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January. On 27 July and 12 August, Aretusa, her sister ship Caprera, and Piemonte conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah. During the second attack, they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump. With the threat of an Ottoman attack greatly reduced, the High Command thereafter began to withdraw forces from the <b>Red</b> <b>Sea</b> Squadron. By the end of August, the unit was reduced to three protected cruisers, Aretusa, Caprera and two auxiliaries. On 14 October, the Ottoman government agreed to sign a peace treaty, ending the war. Aretusas career ended shortly thereafter; the Regia Marina discarded the ship in December and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
