40|$|Using {{data from}} a {{large-scale}} corpus, this paper establishes the claim that in Japanese rap rhymes, the degree of similarity of two consonants positively correlates with their likelihood of making a <b>rhyme</b> <b>pair.</b> For example, similar consonant pairs like {m-n}, {t-s}, and {r-n} frequently rhyme, whereas dissimilar consonant pairs like {m-Σ}, {w-k}, and {n-p} rarely do.

This study thus supports the claim that speakers possess rich knowledge of psychoacoustic similarity (Steriade 2001 ab, 2003). 1...|$|E

40|$|Articulatory suppression, the {{production}} of speech which is strictly irrelevant to the task in hand, has been considered as an experimental manipulation which might interfere with the translation of written stimuli into a phonological code, and it has therefore been used to investigate the role of phonology in normal reading. However, previous research is equivocal even on the basic question of whether articulatory suppression disrupts judgements of the phonemic similarity of orthographic stimuli. In the present experiment, different groups of subjects made homophony judgements or rhyme judgements on homo-phonic, <b>rhyming,</b> and nonrhyming <b>pairs</b> of irregular words and pronounceable nonwords. There was no evidence at all that articulatory suppression disrupted homophony judgements, which implies {{that it does not}} interfere with the construction or comparison of phonological representations and is therefore irrelevant to the investigation of the role of phonology in reading. Articulatory suppression did produce more errors and (with practised subjects) slower latencies in the case of rhyme judgements, though only on <b>rhyming</b> <b>pairs,</b> which implies that it has a selective effect on the processes of phonemic segmentation and deletion...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between P 200 and phonological processing in Chinese word recognition. Participants did a semantic judgment task on pairs of words. The critical pairs were all semantically unrelated in one of three conditions: homophonic, rhyme, or phonologically unrelated. Noting the possibility that P 200 may be affected by phonological similarity and orthographic similarity and that literature studies may not have assessed such effects separately, the present study used visually dissimilar word pairs sharing no phonetic radicals. Relative to the control pairs, both the homophonic and <b>rhyme</b> <b>pairs</b> elicited a significantly larger P 200 with a scalp distribution centering at the centroparietal areas. The results present strong evidence that P 200 can be modulated by lexical phonology alone, independent of sub-lexical phonology, or lexical or sub-lexical orthography. P 200 effects were comparable in amplitude and topography between the homophonic and the rhyme conditions, suggesting that P 200 is sensitive to phonology at both the syllabic and the sub-syllabic levels.

50|$|Rhyme was {{introduced}} into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect.

Vowel <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme</b> - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme</b> if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.|$|R

40|$|A long-standing {{controversy}} in the interface between phonetics and phonology involves the nature of sonority. This dissertation seeks to help resolve this problem by showing that the sonority hierarchy is both physically and psychologically real. This is accomplished by reporting the results of two rigorous and in-depth experiments. The first of these involves phonetic (instrumental) measurements of five acoustic and aerodynamic correlates of sonority in English and Spanish: intensity, frequency of the first formant, total segmental duration, peak intraoral air pressure, and combined oral plus nasal air flow. Intensity values are found to consistently yield a correlation of at least. 97 with typical sonority indices. Consequently, sonority is best {{defined in terms of}} a linear regression equation derived from the observed intensity results. ^ The second major experiment—this one psycholinguistic in nature—involves a common process of playful reduplication in English. A list of 99 hypothetical <b>rhyming</b> <b>pairs</b> such as roshy-toshy was evaluated by 332 native speakers. Their task was to judge which order sounds more natural, e. g., roshy-toshy or toshy-roshy. The data again confirm the crucial importance of sonority in accounting for the observed results. Specifically, the unmarked (preferred) pattern is for the morpheme beginning with the more sonorous segment in each pair to occur in absolute word-initial position. A generalized version of the Syllable Contact Law is utilized in the formal analysis of this phenomenon in terms of Optimality Theory. Finally, a complete and universal sonority hierarchy is posited by building on the findings of the two experiments as a whole. ...|$|R
40|$|In typical readers, orthographic {{knowledge}} {{has been shown}} to influence phonological decisions. In the present study, we used visual rhyme and spelling tasks to investigate the interaction of orthographic and phonological information in adults with varying reading skill. Word pairs that shared both orthography and phonology (e. g., throat/boat), differed in both orthography and phonology (e. g., snow/arm), shared only orthography (e. g., farm/warm), and shared only phonology (e. g., vote/boat) were visually presented to university students who varied in reading ability. For rhyme judgment, participants were slower and less accurate to accept <b>rhyming</b> <b>pairs</b> when words were spelled differently and to reject non-rhyming pairs when words were spelled similarly. Similarly, for spelling judgments, participants were slower and less accurate when indicating that word endings were spelled differently when words rhymed, and slower and less accurate when indicating that words were spelled similarly when words did not rhyme. Crucially, while these effects were clear at the group level, there were large individual differences in the extent to which participants were impacted by conflict. In two separate samples, reading skill was associated with the extent to which orthographic conflict impacted rhyme decisions such that individuals with better nonword reading performance were less impacted by orthographic conflict. Thus, university students with poorer reading skills may differ from their peers either in the reading strategies they use or in {{the degree to which they}} automatically access word form information. Understanding these relationships is important for understanding the roles that reading processes play in readers of different skill...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} how event-related electrical {{activity in the}} brain relates to cognitive functioning {{in a group of}} 27 normally aging females (68 - 73 years of age), participants were separated into high and low groups based on their performance on cognitive measures of three domains: Verbal working memory; Immediate auditory recall; and Inhibition. The aim {{of the study was to}} expand our understanding of language processing in normal aging, and to characterize how neural indices mediating phonologic processing are related to inhibitory and working memory abilities in healthy, elderly women. Participants were challenged with a visual word <b>pair</b> <b>rhyme</b> judgment task, from which eventrelated brain potentials, reaction time, and accuracy were recorded. Consisting of a prime and target, <b>rhyming</b> word <b>pairs</b> (orthographically congruent: THROWN-OWN and incongruent: CONE-OWN) and non-rhyming word pairs (orthographically congruent: GOWN-OWN, and incongruent: CAKE-OWN) were used. Verbal Working Memory: High performers were distinguished from low performers on both reaction time and accuracy. High performers also distinguished themselves electrophysiologically by an increased amplitude contingent negative variation, a working memory indicator, and by displaying earlier N 100 peak latencies, an indicator of early cortical visual processing. Immediate Auditory Recall: Reaction time and accuracy were similar for low and high performers, although high performers displayed an increased N 400, the component elicited by the rhyme judgment stimuli. High performers displayed increased rhyme effect mean amplitudes, which are believed to reflect processes underlying the ability to determine whether or not congruent <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme.</b> Inhibition: High performers displayed faster reaction times and greater accuracy. Additionally, high performers displayed earlier N 100 peak latencies under congruent conditions, which was significant over the left hemisphere in incongruent conditions. Lastly, high performers exhibited increased amplitude “later” rhyme effects for incongruent conditions when compared to low performers. In summary, the results of this study clearly demonstrate that differences in behavioral and cognitive abilities mediating verbal working memory, immediate auditory recall, and inhibition predict neural functions for language processing in the elderly, hinting at future opportunities for developing new biomarkers of successful aging. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined phonological priming {{effects on}} reaction times, error rates, and event-related brain potential (ERP) measures in an auditory lexical decision task. In Experiment 1 related prime-target <b>pairs</b> <b>rhymed,</b> and in Experiment 2 they alliterated (i. e., shared the consonantal onset and vowel). Event-related potentials {{were recorded in}} a delayed response task. Reaction times and error rates were obtained both for the delayed and an immediate response task. The behavioral data of Experiment 1 provided evidence for phonological facilitation of word, but not of nonword decisions. The brain potentials were more negative to unrelated than to <b>rhyming</b> word-word <b>pairs</b> between 450 and 700 msec after target onset. This negative enhancement was not present for word-nonword pairs. Thus, the ERP results match the behavioral data. The behavioral data of Experiment 2 provided no evidence for phonological Facilitation. However, between 250 and 450 msec after target onset, i. e., considerably earlier than in Experiment 1, brain potentials were more negative for unrelated than for alliterating word and word-nonword pairs. It is argued that the ERP effects in the two experiments could be modulations of the same underlying component, possibly the N 400. The difference in {{the timing of the}} effects is likely to be {{due to the fact that}} the shared segments in related stimulus pairs appeared in different word positions in the two experiments...|$|R

2500|$|Researchers {{believe that}} [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] {{has no effect}} on {{implicit}} processing, but instead is the cause of impairments in the explicit task of speech production. They believe that explicit characteristics of reading involve only the conscious production of speech (reading). Information about written words is internalized without awareness (implicitly); the ability to access this information and process it into words that can be read or spoken is an explicit process. [...] Implicit knowledge involves phonological awareness, understanding of the morphology, and a semantic understanding of written words. This implicit aspect of reading may be completely intact, and yet reading errors can still occur through defects in explicit output, or production. Researchers have studied the dissociation of implicit and explicit processes to thus unravel the underlying deficiencies in deep dyslexia. Studies in support of [...] "failure of inhibition" [...] show intact implicit processing of deep dyslexics. For instance, studies have shown deep dyslexics that are equally fast in a lexical decision task with a <b>rhyming</b> <b>pair</b> of words (book-took) in comparison to a non-rhyming pair of words (bough-tough), indicating that the patients are able to use implicit phonological knowledge and phonics to process the words. Additionally, they are faster in a lexical decision task with words that sound like they are spelled (couch, pouch) than they are with words that do not sound like they are spelled (touch), again showing that patients are using phonology. These data show that implicit processing is in fact occurring in deep dyslexic patients. Thus, some researchers believe that the impairments present in deep dyslexics are only in explicit phonological output (i.e., reading aloud). They believe that the problems of deep dyslexics are due to production errors, and that deep dyslexics have normal phonological processing at the implicit level. This is supported by the fact that deep dyslexia is often present in patients suffering from production errors resulting from Expressive aphasia.|$|R
5000|$|Wulfstan’s homilies were {{intended}} {{not to be}} read, but for public delivery. This necessitated many devices for clarity, “…notably a rephrasing of expressions which might be misunderstood, introduced by þæt is”. [...] One such rephrasing appears at lines 74-75 (An is ælmihtig God on þrym hadum, þæt is fæder and suna and halig gast) {{when he tries to}} explain the holy trinity, a concept that might confuse lay-people. Another notable feature of Wulfstan’s work is the large number of intensifying words…such as æfre, swyðe ealles to swyðe, georne, mid rihte, ofer ealle oðre þing, swyðe georne, oft and gelome, wide, witode. While several of these examples are present within De falsis deis, one marker, swyðe, was particularly evident, showing up in lines 2 (twice), 37, 38, 41, 53, 66 and 73. Rhyme can also be found within De falsis deis at line 47 when it lists and saca and wraca. There are also an abundance of instances in which Wulfstan used alliteration, such as line 29 (woruldmen þe mihtige wurdan on woruldafelum”) and line 42 (“se sunu wæs swaþeah swyðor). Alliteration and rhyme were prevalent in many works of Wulfstan’s time, and Betherum points out that “alliterative and <b>rhyming</b> <b>pairs</b> of words…became so ingrained that when Wulfstan rewrote another person’s composition…the substitution of two words for one is almost invariable” (232). Other elements indicative of Wulfstan’s style include word or sentence parallelism, alliteration and rhyme. Sentence parallelism occurs in lines 9, 12, 14, 42, 56 and 64 with the expression þurh deofles lare. Repetition of such a phrase indicates its importance to listeners, who will then be more likely to remember these points. A great example of word parallelism can be found in line 25, mid muðe and mid modes. In short, Bethurum was quite accurate when she stated that Wulfstan “did not rely upon the inspiration of the moment; his effects are carefully planned” (233).|$|R
