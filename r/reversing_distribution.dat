In recent years, {{the notion of a}} <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> network has been put forth as a possible solution to remedy not only the volatility of the supply chains but also as an indispensable approach for sustainable development. This paper examines {{the current state of the}} literature on <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> networks from a system perspective. Two major findings were identified. Firstly, there are no clear grounds for decision making regarding supply network development. Secondly, collaborations offers great opportunities to develop <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> networks and build robust supply chains...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972 coupled with ever-increasing consumerism, product recall has become a common problem confronting many manufacturing organizations. <b>Reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> activities involving the removal of defective and/or hazardous products from the hands of customers are more crucial to the survival of some companies than are forward distribution activities because the companies' permanent goodwill is at stake. Nevertheless, not much attention has been given to the design of effective <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. This paper attempts to develop effective product recall strategies which not only minimize distribution costs of recall, but also maintain companies' goodwill. Generally, better customer service, prerequisite to companies' goodwill, can be maintained by a swift recall process that results in higher distribution expenses. In an effort to consider tradeoffs between <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> costs and customer service, we propose a weighted goal programming model. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a coordinated location-inventory model under uncertain {{demands for a}} closed loop supply chain comprising of one plant, forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> centers, and retailers.

The proposed model determines the location of forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> centers and the associated capacities, the review intervals of the inventory policy at distribution centers, and the assignments of retailers to the distribution centers. We model six different coordination strategies. All the models are formulated as nonlinear integer programs with chance constraints and transformed to conic quadratic mixed-integer programs that can be efficiently solved by CPLEX.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> {{systems are}} {{the topic of}} this thesis. The term 'reverse' refers to the {{collection}} ofproducts at end-of-life for the purpose ofrecovery and waste management. We specifically study the area of electrical and electronic product waste. Such distribution systems are becoming a more visible and commercially {{significant part of the}} modern business environment, and this makes them interesting to study. The importance of understanding the interaction effects between the coordination mechanisms of two crucial flows, physical flows and commercial interests, in distribution systems is the main thrust ofthis study. This is something that has largely gone unnoticed in the distribution literature because these flows are essentially explored in two different research traditions. Physical flows have been the focus of attention in the logistics and supply chain management literature, while commercial interests have been tackled by the governance literature. A major theoretical contribution of this thesis, therefore, has been to reunite these complementary aspects of the distribution system in order to make sense of how the two flows work together to create coordinated action, which in turn enables system goals to be achieved. Therefore, our problem statement is: How do the coordination mechanisms for physical flows and commercial interests interact in order to achieve coordinated action in <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> systems? A case study research strategy has been chosen because we are dealing with a relatively new phenomenon that is studied in its real life context. We use three cases, which relate to three different <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> systems - all of which deal with electrical and electronic (EE) products at end-of-life. Each case covers a five-year period, which starts out from the time the initiative was introduced in Norway (1999). The data collection consists of interviews with the different types of actors that take part in the systems and different sources of secondary data. The system has been our unit of analysis, which we believe is a contribution in its own right and another reason for utilizing the case study strategy. Our results show that there are interaction effects between the coordination of physical flows and commercial interests. The choice of coordination mechanisms is interdependent between the two types of flows. We argue that each flow addresses different categories of costs and provides different categories of service and value to the end-consumer segments. In one case we are able to highlight that a lack of coordination across the flows increases costs and reduces service and value, and thus does not achieve coordinated action in the <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> system. In contrast, another case shows that coordination across the flows contributes to lower costs and higher service and value, which suggest that the <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> system achieves coordinated action. Each of three systems has chosen different combinations of coordination mechanisms, which have resulted in different levels of costs, service and value in the <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. To conclude our study, we summarize our fmdings as a set ofpropositions. We also discuss at length two particularly interesting matters that arise from the study, which are the role of a coordinator in the systems and the significance of the collection function.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>distribution,</b> or the {{management}} of product return flows, induced by various forms of reuse of products and materials, has received growing attention throughout this decade. In this paper we discuss <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution,</b> and propose a mathematical programming model for {{a version of this}} problem. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, we introduce a heuristic solution methodology for this problem. The solution methodology complements a heuristic concentration procedure, where sub-problems with reduced sets of decision variables are iteratively solved to optimality. Based on the solutions from the sub-problems, a final concentration set of potential facility sites is constructed, and this problem is solved to optimality. The potential facility sites are then expanded in a greedy fashion to obtain the final solution. This “heuristic expansion ” was also performed using the solution found with a greedy heuristic to provide a short-list of potential facility sites. Computational tests demonstrate a great deal of promise for this solution method, as high-quality solutions are obtained while expending modest computational effort...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCoal {{resource}} {{is one of}} the energy resources with large reserves in the world, and its exploitation and consumption rank among the highest energy development. China is both a great coal producer and consumer. Due to rapid economic and social development as well as resource distribution characteristics with more coal and less oil, coal energy will always dominate China's energy consumption. However, water resource, as the support element and basic ecological element of coal development, is both accelerated and affected by the exploitation of coal resource, which has caused a series of problems related to water. In the face of water deficit as well as large demand of coal resource and its influence on water resource and ecological environment during its exploitation, therefore, this paper analyzes the functional relation between coal energy development and water resource in terms of the space distribution of China's coal and water resources, the consumption of coal resource exploitation on water resource and a series of problems caused; and puts forward the countermeasures to coordinate regional economic, ecological and environmental development based on balanced development of coal production and consumption areas by synthesizing the <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> of such space distribution and the unbalanced distribution characteristics of coal consumption and production areas...|$|R

Several comprehensive mixed-integer-programming models are developed for the strategic integrated design of domestic and global supply chain networks with remanufacturing capacity. The models allow simultaneous determination of supplier selection, manufacturing and distribution facility selection and allocation, production quantities, transportation flows, <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution</b> facility selection, and disassembly plant allocation. Additionally, our models incorporate bill of material (BOM) both in the manufacturing process and in disassembly process. Management policies are also considered in the model formulation so that specific management choices, such as multi- sourcing strategy or single sourcing strategy, can be fulfilled in the strategic supply chain network design. Global factors considered in the model include currency exchange rates, transfer prices, allocation of transportation costs, local content requirements, local income taxes, and tariffs. The models are verified by medium-sized numerical examples. Compared to previous literature, the proposed models have two distinctive features. First, the corresponding integrated logistics problem of a global supply chain is formulated with a generalized mathematical form, and thus {{is not limited to}} applications for specific industries. Such a methodological measure is rare in previous literature, and has exhibited its potential advantages in addressing complicated global supply chain problems.

Using x-ray microanalysis, the distribution of calcium between vacuoles in different cell types of leaves of rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) was investigated. Calcium was accumulated principally in palisade, spongy mesophyll, and crystal-containing idioblast cells. It was low in epidermal and bundle sheath cells. Potassium showed the <b>reverse</b> <b>distribution.</b> Rubidium and strontium were used as tracers to examine the pathways by which potassium and calcium reached these cells. Comparisons of strontium and calcium distribution indicated that strontium is a good tracer for calcium, but rubidium did not mirror the potassium distribution pattern. The amount of strontium accumulated was highest in palisade cells, lowest in bundle sheath and epidermal cells, and intermediate in the spongy mesophyll. Accumulation of strontium in palisade and spongy mesophyll was accompanied by loss of potassium from these cells and its accumulation in the bundle sheath. Strontium moved apoplastically from the xylem to all cell types, and manipulation of water loss from the adaxial leaf surface suggested that diffusion is responsible for strontium movement to {{this side of the}} leaf.
