5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the <b>ridge</b> <b>rib</b> of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of {{the introduction of the}} intermediate rib is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the <b>ridge</b> <b>rib</b> is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall rib and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the <b>ridge</b> <b>rib.</b> Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of MÃ¼hlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency {{to increase the number of}} ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in {{the earliest}} examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a <b>ridge</b> <b>rib</b> was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the <b>ridge</b> <b>rib.</b> In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the <b>ridge</b> <b>rib,</b> which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E

50|$|One major {{architectural}} {{feature of}} Lincoln Cathedral are the spectacular vaults. The varying vaults within the cathedral {{are said to}} be both original and experimental. The vaults especially, clearly define the experimental aspect seen at Lincoln. There are several different kinds of vaults that differ between the nave, aisles, choir, and chapels of the cathedral. Along the North Aisle there is a continuous <b>ridge</b> <b>rib</b> with a regular arcade that ignores the bays. Meanwhile, on the South Aisle there is a discontinuous <b>ridge</b> <b>rib</b> that puts an emphasis on each separate bay. The North West Chapel has quadripartite vaults and the South Chapel has vaults that stem from one central support columns. The use of sexpartite vaults allowed for more natural light to enter the cathedral through the clerestory windows, which were placed inside of each separate bay. Saint Hugh's Choir exhibits extremely unusual vaults. It is a series of asymmetrical vaults that appear to almost be a diagonal line created by two ribs on one side translating into only a single rib {{on the other side of}} the vault. This pattern divides up the space of the vaults and bays, perfectly placing the emphasis on the bays. The chapter house vaults are also interesting. It is a decagonal building with a single, central column that twenty ribs rise from. Each separate area of Lincoln can be identified solely by the different vaults of the space. Each vault, or each variation of the vault, is fresh and original. They illustrate innovative thinking and great creativity. There is no doubt that these vaults, and all of the other experimental aspects of Lincoln came with a slight risk.|$|E

40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{elements in}} the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral, in the vaulting and elevations, {{can be compared to}} the geometries described by Robert Grosseteste in his cosmologies.

The proposition is that the geometries of the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral can be understood in relation to the geometries which are the basis of the cosmologies of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln 1235 â 53, in particular De lineis, angulis et figuris (On Lines, Angles and Figures, c. 1235), and De luce (On Light, c. 1215). Many of the architectural forms at Lincoln Cathedral are unprecedented in their appearance or use, and they form the basic vocabulary for the entire development of English Gothic architecture. Their radically new appearance has never been adequately explained. Vocabulary elements such as the ridge pole, tierceron or non-structural rib, lierne or segmented <b>ridge</b> <b>rib,</b> flying rib, conoid springer vault or cone of ribs rising from the springer pole in the elevation, triradial vaulting or three ribs meeting at the ridge pole, double syncopated or overlapping arcading, and the bundled and ribbed umbrella column, all originate in some form or are developed for the first time in Lincoln. All of the geometries which appear for the first time in the architecture appear in the cosmologies of Grosseteste, for the purpose of explaining the generation, emanation, reflection, refraction, and rarefaction of light as it forms the material world in geometrical configurations. The cathedral would thus be a catechism of the geometrical substructure of the physical world, in the tradition of the Timaeus of Plato. There is no evidence that the concepts were dictated by Grosseteste directly to masons, but it is well known that such concepts permeated medieval architecture and city planning, and that they were filtered down through all trades involved in construction of the city and the cathedral. Grossetesteâs cosmologies represent a core achievement of Scholasticism, the synthesis of classical philosophy (cosmology) and Catholic theology (light mysticism), which is embodied in the architecture of the cathedral...|$|E

Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between.

We focus on assessing body condition, a new application of camera traps. Body condition indices must relate to the percent body fat {{if they are to be}} useful. To acquire measurements of body fat, most body condition indices require capture or mortality of animals to estimate, which has limitations when applied to free-ranging animals. We developed a non-invasive, visual body condition index (VBCI) to assess body condition of mule deer that can be applied to camera trap images or videos. The VBCI was based on the visibility of five bone regions, the scapula, spinal <b>ridge,</b> <b>ribs,</b> tuber ischium, and tuber ilium, which are covered in varying amounts of subcutaneous fat. We compared the VBCI to known values of ingesta-free body fat, obtained from ultrasonography and physical palpation of captured mule deer. Our VBCI was positively related to percent ingesta-free body fat (R 2 = 0. 23, p 3 Ìc 0. 001). Additionally, the bone regions evaluated were each correlated with the percent ingesta-free body fat. Using Spearmanâs correlation, the scapula is the region most highly correlated to ingesta-free body fat (0. 44, p 3 Ìc 0. 001), followed by the ischium (0. 36, p 3 Ìc 0. 001), ilium (0. 35, p 3 Ìc 0. 001), spinal ridge (0. 31, p 3 Ìc 0. 001), and ribcage (0. 12, p 3 Ìc 0. 01). Based on the relationships between VBCI and ingesta-free body fat, we developed two visual body condition indices, one that requires a broadside orientation to the camera (VBCI- 1) and one that is applicable when a deer is quartered towards the camera (VBCI- 2). Potential applications of the VBCI include evaluating relationships between body condition and habitat enhancements, habitat disturbances, population performances, and weather...|$|R

Consequently, the male with the layers that are ~ 270 nm thick reflects light of UV~ 560 nm (green) and the female with the layers that are ~ 191 nm thick reflects light of UV~ 400 nm (violet). T. aeacus does not produce the iridescent sheen which T. magellanus does. No iridescent sheen is ascribed to microrib layers, which are perpendicular to the scale plane, so that they cannot reflect any backscattering. The structures of these butterflies would provide us helpful hints to manipulate light in photoelectric devices, such as blue or UVÂ LEDs...|$|R
40|$|Achenes {{morphology}} in taxa from Potentilla collina s. l. i. e., P. collina Wibel s. s., P. leucopolitana P. J. MÃ¼ller, P. thyrsiflora HÃ¼lsen ex Zimmet., P. thyrsiflora var. isosepala Th. W., P. silesiaca Uechtr. And P. wimanniana GÃ¼nther and Schummel {{was examined}} with stereoscope and scanning electron microscopy. Achenes of these taxa varied slightly in shape, size and colour, while marked {{differences among them}} appeared in the surface sculpture and in the dimensions of aril, dorsal <b>ridge</b> and <b>ribs.</b> SEM analyses allowed to distinguish two distinct morphological types of achenes. Type I - with ruminate sculpture and aggregates of some material, various in shape and size, at the surface of partly destroyed epidermal cells covering fruit wall in P. leucopolitana, P. wimanniana and P. thyrsiflora. Type II - with ruminate-reticulate sculpture due to well preserved epidermal cells in P. silesiaca and P. thyrsiflora var. isosepala. The obtained results have supported BÅockiâs suggestion to treat P. thyrsiflora var. isosepala as a separate species named P. isosepala. However, similarities in the surface sculpture of achenes in some taxa of P. collina group did not facilitate their classification, therefore this feature may be a valuable taxonomical criterium only in combination with others...|$|R
