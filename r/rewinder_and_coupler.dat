Several tests have been carried out to characterize the behavior of PLC modems <b>and</b> <b>couplers</b> in presence of the most common types of disturbances and electromagnetic interferences (EMI) which can be expected in LV distribution networks.

30|$|As the {{structural}} diversity of domestic EMUs, especially the <b>coupler</b> <b>and</b> draft gear system, the possible combinations of train to train rescue scenarios are complicated. This {{makes it difficult}} to formulate the operation regulation for train to train rescue. Thus, the systemic studies of longitudinal train dynamics for EMUs under rescue are conducted to give insight into its occurring mechanism and safety relevant issues. In this paper, the field and laboratory tests were introduced to investigate the longitudinal impact <b>and</b> <b>coupler</b> rotational behavior. The dynamic models of train <b>and</b> <b>coupler</b> system were developed considering accurate boundary conditions and braking characteristic. The safety indices and its allowable limits for the EMUs under rescue were defined. The running safety for different train to train rescue scenarios was evaluated.|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} {{presents a}} spectral-domain, polarization-sensitive {{optical coherence tomography}} (PS-OCT) system based on a fiber interferometer using single-mode fibers <b>and</b> <b>couplers.</b> The two orthogonal polarization components which define the polarization state are sequentially detected by a single line camera. Retardance measurements can be affected by polarimetric effects in fibers <b>and</b> <b>couplers.</b> This configuration bypasses such issues by performing the polarization selection before the collection fiber, employing {{a combination of a}} polarization rotator and a linear polarizer. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the tolerance of the proposed configuration to fiber-based disturbances; this was further experimentally verified with similar net retardance maps of a birefringent phantom being obtained for two different settings of induced fiber birefringence. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R

The design procedure is described, <b>and</b> <b>couplers</b> formed by single-aperture and dual-aperture configurations are presented. It is demonstrated that the coupling can be as tight as 1 dB but that weaker coupling leads to more broadband <b>and</b> flatter <b>coupler</b> performance.

30|$|The fourth-stage {{test for}} CRH 380 A–CRH 380 A rescue was {{conducted}} to give insight into the coupler jackknifing mechanism {{as well as to}} verify the longitudinal dynamic model, see Fig.  2 d. The instrumented couplers were used to measure the in-train forces. The displacement transducers were arranged to determine the relative movement in the train <b>and</b> <b>coupler</b> system. The accelerometers were also installed on the carbody to measure the braking deceleration. The indirect method for the wheel–rail force measurement was adopted to obtain the wheel unloading ratio [15]. It was indicated that the pitch motion of train <b>and</b> <b>couplers</b> only occurred under compressed coupler forces. Consequently, the pitch motion of the carbody generated a vertical displacement between adjacent carbodies, which further led to geometric interference of in-train devices.|$|R
