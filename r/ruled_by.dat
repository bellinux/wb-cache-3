Both <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> reason and <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> love require the decision-maker to be accountable for his/her actionshowever, <b>rule</b> <b>by</b> edict does not require accountability since choices are not available to the employee.

5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was <b>ruled</b> <b>by</b> a {{succession}} of seven kings.

With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive).
