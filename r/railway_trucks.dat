The prisoners escorted by 5th Light Horse Regiment, less one squadron at Amman with one squadron 7th Light Horse attached, moved off to Amman at 07:15. All arms and equipment were collected and put in <b>railway</b> <b>trucks.</b> This task was finished by 15:30. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment remained to guard the sick until transport was organised. One hundred sick walking cases were sent on to Amman in New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade transport wagons and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade commenced its return journey to Amman. They arrived at 21:00, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remained in charge at Ziza.|$|E
5|$|At about 08:00, the 4th Cavalry Division's 2nd Lancers (10th Cavalry Brigade) and the 5th Cavalry Division's 29th Lancers (Deccan Horse) (14th Cavalry Brigade) entered Afulah. Here about 75 German and 200 Ottoman {{prisoners were}} {{captured}} at the railway station, along with ten locomotives and 50 <b>railway</b> <b>trucks</b> or wagons in the sidings. A hospital, an aerodrome with three undamaged aircraft, a large quantity of petrol, and large stocks of champagne and hock were also captured. Armoured cars continued the pursuit, capturing 12 German lorries {{on the road}} to Beisan, while the railway running south and east from Afulah was cut; the line to the west had already been cut by the 13th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division).|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{arrived at}} 05:30 on 30 September {{to take over}} the {{position}} and the care of the 534 sick, as well as collecting the 14 guns, 35 machine guns, two automatic rifles, three railway engines, 25 <b>railway</b> <b>trucks,</b> lorries and large amounts of ammunition and stores. After assurances by Brigadier General Ryrie commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, that the sick and wounded Ottoman soldiers would be cared for, the Ottoman force concentrated at dawn near Ziza railway station while the light horsemen took the bolts from the Ottoman rifles. Two Anatolian battalions remained armed in case the Beni Sakhr attacked during the march. The 5th Light Horse Regiment marched between 4,068 and 4,082 prisoners, including walking wounded, north to Amman. They were followed by 502 sick.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army {{had been forced}} from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had fallen on the western and {{central part of the}} Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menen–Ypres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using <b>railway</b> <b>trucks</b> to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypres–Passchendaele–Roulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop between themselves and the Belgian southern flank on the Ypres–Lille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, and they would be blamed for it.|$|E

From him she obtained the use of two <b>railway</b> <b>trucks,</b> subject to the approval of the army commander, Lord Kitchener, which she received two weeks later, although it only allowed her to travel as far as Bloemfontein and take one truck of supplies for the camps, about 12 tons.|$|E
2500|$|This steam tramway {{opened in}} 1887 [...] using small railway {{locomotives}} and carriages. In 1891 two conventional steam tram motors were {{built for the}} line by Henry Vale. Six C1 type trailers replaced the railway carriages around the same period. The tramway operated for 50 years until it was replaced by an electric trolleybus service in 1937. It connected with trains at Kogarah station {{by way of a}} large balloon loop through the streets, then passed south down Rocky Point Road to Sans Souci, Sandringham and Dolls Point. Small depots at Sandringham and Kogarah serviced the line. The line was single track at each end with a double-track middle section down Rocky Point Road. Track on the line was laid to railway standards to allow <b>railway</b> <b>trucks</b> to haul goods over the line.|$|E

2500|$|O'Brien was {{promoted}} to captain in the Australian Garrison Artillery on 2 February 1932. He was posted to the 10th Field Artillery Brigade as its acting adjutant and temporary quartermaster on 15 November 1932, and transferred to the Australian Field Artillery on 6 December 1933. He became acting commander of the 24th Battery in June 1936. This appointment became substantive when he {{was promoted}} to major on 19 March 1937. [...] He joined the United Stevedoring Company, a subsidiary of P, in 1932. He worked on a project to improve the unloading of coal, which had been accomplished by shovelling it into baskets and hoisting them down to the wharf. He replaced these with clamshell buckets, which hoisted the coal directly onto <b>railway</b> <b>trucks.</b> In 1938, he went into business with his former boss at United Stevedoring, Captain Jack Williams, founding a general engineering company called Fleet Forge Pty Ltd. A major contract was from the Royal Australian Navy to equip defensively equipped merchant ships. He married Gwen Victoria Goddard Britton, a [...] saleswoman, on 31 March 1934 at St Columba's Church in Elwood, Victoria. He wore his Army uniform for the ceremony.

60|$|What {{struck the}} ship-keeper most was the absent, unseeing {{expression}} of the captain, striding after the girl.

From this slight the ship-keeper drew a conclusion unfavourable to the strange girl. He gave them time to get down on the wharf before crossing the deck to steal one more look at the pair over the rail.

6000|$|Now {{and then}} one sees afar off an {{ammunition}} dump, many hundreds of stacks of shells--without their detonators as yet--being unloaded from <b>railway</b> <b>trucks,</b> transferred from the broad gauge to the narrow gauge line, or loaded onto motor trolleys. Now {{and then one}} crosses a railway line. The railway lines run everywhere behind the British front, the construction follows the advance day by day. They go up {{as fast as the}} guns. One's guide remarks as the car bumps over the level crossing, [...] "That is one of Haig's railways." [...] It is an aspect of the Commander-in-Chief that has much impressed and pleased the men. And at last we begin to enter the region of the former Allied trenches, we pass the old German front line, we pass ruined houses, ruined fields, and thick patches of clustering wooden crosses and boards where the dead of the opening assaults lie. There are no more reapers now, there is no more green upon the fields, there is no green anywhere, scarcely a tree survives by the roadside, but only overthrown trunks and splintered stumps; the fields are wildernesses of shell craters and coarse weeds, the very woods are collections of blasted stems and stripped branches. This absolutely ravaged and ruined battlefield country extends now along the front of the Somme offensive for a depth of many miles; across it the French and British camps and batteries creep forward, the stores, the dumps, the railways creep forward, in their untiring, victorious thrust against the German lines. Overhead hum and roar the aeroplanes, away towards the enemy the humped, blue sausage-shaped kite balloons brood thoughtfully, and from this point and that, guns, curiously invisible until they speak, flash suddenly and strike their one short hammer-blow of sound.|$|E
60|$|It {{does not}} follow that because a course is the manifestly right and {{advantageous}} course for the community {{that it will be}} taken. I am reminded of this by a special basket in my study here, into which I pitch letters, circulars, pamphlets and so forth as they come to hand from a gentleman named Gattie, and his friends Mr. Adrian Ross, Mr. Roy Horniman, Mr. Henry Murray and others. His particular project is the construction of a Railway Clearing House for London. It is an absolutely admirable scheme. It would cut down the heavy traffic in the streets of London to about one-third; it would enable us to run the goods traffic of England with less than half the number of <b>railway</b> <b>trucks</b> we now employ; it would turn over enormous areas of valuable land from their present use as railway goods yards and sidings; it would save time in the transit of goods and labour in their handling. It is a quite beautifully worked out scheme. For the last eight or ten years this group of devoted fanatics has been pressing this undertaking upon an indifferent country with increasing vehemence and astonishment at that indifference. The point is that its adoption, though it would be of general benefit, would be of no particular benefit to any leading man or highly placed official. On the other hand it would upset all sorts of individuals who {{are in a position to}} obstruct it quietly--and they do so. Meaning no evil. I dip my hand in the accumulation and extract a leaflet by the all too zealous Mr. Murray. In it he denounces various public officials by name as he cheats and scoundrels, and invites a prosecution for libel.|$|E
60|$|The {{wind was}} still easterly, {{accompanied}} with rather a heavy swell of sea for the operations in hand. A landing was, however, made this morning, when the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off the upper {{course of the}} building, in order to apply the moulds of the first course of the staircase, that the joggle-holes might be marked off in the upper course of the solid. This was also necessary previously to the writer's fixing {{the position of the}} entrance door, which was regulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the building, indicating the direction of the heaviest seas, {{on the opposite side of}} which the door was placed. The landing-master's crew succeeded in towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praam-boat with the balance-crane, which had now been on board of the praam for five days. The several pieces of this machine, having been conveyed along the railways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge, were elevated to its level, or thirty feet above the rock, in the following manner. A chain-tackle was suspended over a pulley from the cross-beam connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge, which was worked by a winch-machine with wheel, pinion, and barrel, round which last the chain was wound. This apparatus was placed on the beacon side of the bridge, at the distance of about twelve feet from the cross-beam and pulley in the middle of the bridge. Immediately under the cross-beam a hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge, measuring seven feet in length and five feet in breadth, made to shut with folding boards like a double door, through which stones and other articles were raised; the folding doors were then let down, and the stone or load was gently lowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on <b>railway</b> <b>trucks</b> towards the lighthouse. In this manner the several castings of the balance-crane were got up to the top of the solid of the building.|$|E
