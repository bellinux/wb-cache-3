50|$|Bancroft et al. in 1967 {{described}} the first experiments to isolate and characterise the virus. Since that time, {{due to the}} relative ease with which it is grown and isolated, many researchers have focused their attention on the virus. The interest {{of the scientific community}} for this virus is also due to a conspicuous property: it is possible to disassemble the virus and <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material,</b> the RNA. Then, under slightly acidic pH and with relatively high amounts of salts, it is possible to stimulate the self-assembly of the protein subunits, into a shell of identical size to the virus. This yields an empty capsid which has a number of interesting properties. Several successful attempts are reported to incorporate other materials, such as inorganic crystals, inside the capsid.|$|E
5000|$|Differences {{in basic}} number of chromosomes. These {{differences}} could {{have resulted from}} successive unequal translocations which <b>removed</b> all <b>the</b> essential <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion. Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes. Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, {{and many of the}} genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.|$|R
50|$|Fundamentally, the viral {{coat protein}} {{functions}} as protection for <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> inside <b>the</b> virus, {{and as an}} aid to infecting the host cell with virus DNA. Essentially, the coat protein (CP) is a link between <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> and infecting <b>the</b> host. Since <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in <b>the</b> virus consists of RNA the coat protein contains RNA binding sites. Additionally, the coat protein contains conserved histadine amino acid residues which help the virus to spread.|$|R
50|$|In modern {{molecular}} biology and genetics, a genome is <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of <b>the</b> mitochondria and chloroplasts.|$|R
25|$|We know {{relatively}} {{little about the}} actual purpose of meganucleases. It is widely thought that <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> that encodes meganucleases functions as a parasitic element that uses the double-stranded DNA cell repair mechanisms to its own advantage {{as a means of}} multiplying and spreading, without damaging <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of its host.|$|R
50|$|The DNA of an {{individual}} is the same in somatic (nonreproductive) cell. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together randomly to create a unique combination of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> in a new cell, so <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of {{an individual}} is derived from <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of both their parents in equal amounts. This <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> {{is known as the}} nuclear genome of the individual, because it is found in the nucleus.|$|R

5000|$|The pronuclear {{injection}} of mouse sperm {{is one of}} the two most common methods for producing transgenic animals (along with <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> engineering of embryonic stem cells). [...] In order for pronuclear injection to be successful, <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> (typically linear DNA) must be injected while <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from <b>the</b> oocyte and sperm are separate (i.e., the pronuclear phase). In order to obtain these oocytes, mice are commonly superovulated using gonadotrophins. [...] Once plugging has occurred, oocytes are harvested from the mouse and injected with <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> <b>The</b> oocyte is then implanted in the oviduct of a pseudopregnant animal. While efficiency varies, 10-40% of mice born from these implanted oocytes may contain the injected construct. [...] Transgenic mice can then be bred to create transgenic lines.|$|R

50|$|Hershey and Chase {{concluded}} that DNA, not protein, was <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> They {{determined that a}} protective protein coat was formed around the bacteriophage, but that the internal DNA is what conferred its ability to produce progeny inside a bacterium. They showed that, in growth, protein has no function, while DNA has some function. They determined this from the amount of radioactive material remaining outside of the cell. Only 20% of the 32P remained outside the cell, demonstrating that it was incorporated with DNA in <b>the</b> cell's <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> All of <b>the</b> 35S in the protein coats remained outside the cell, showing it was not incorporated into the cell, and that protein is not <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
