25|$|Green {{building}} (also {{known as}} green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a {{structure and the}} application of processes that are environmentally responsible and <b>resource-efficient</b> throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no single {{definition}} for what constitutes a Green Building, some elements recur in describing the concept. A Green Building can thus be defined as a high-performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a <b>resource-efficient</b> manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, human health and the natural environment. Some examples of green building features are choice of site and orientation, efficient use of materials and resources, indoor environmental quality and innovation.|$|E
25|$|The sub-centers {{will always}} report any {{search and rescue}} alarm to JRCC SN, but will by default take action {{themselves}} unless JRCC NN chooses to take command itself. Actions are taken based on pre-defined plans. JRCC NN is prepared to handle situations related to land, sea and air, operations tied to offshore constructions and missions requiring international cooperation. This model is chosen for being cost-efficient and <b>resource-efficient,</b> and is unique in the world. The two Norwegian JRCCs are redundant and both can take over the other centers operations if necessary. This most commonly takes place when one center is fully occupied with a major incident and the other center takes over responsibility for the entire country. In case of war the JRCC NN will cease to operate and the employees and resources will be transferred to Norwegian Joint Headquarters, with the Norwegian Armed Forces taking over available resources.|$|E
