Results showed that the addition of CSS increased the total organic carbon and nitrogen content more than with RCW and as a result, the C/N ratio in the CSS soil was {{higher than in the}} RCW and non-amended (NE) soil, reflecting the high decomposition of soil organic matter in the CSS soil compared with the other soils. The RCW and CSS amendments increased the hydrogen index (HI) values and the oxygen index (OI) values compared with the NE soil, especially for the soil treated with CSS which contained more aliphatic than aromatic compounds. The addition of CSS to the techno-soil significantly increased the percentage of C org associated with the HA fractions compared with the RCW and NE soils. The soil amended with CSS showed the highest E 4 /E 6 ratio and the lowest E 2 /E 3 ratio of FA.

The experiment consisted of nine main treatment blocks: (A) 3 X unamended soil (NE), (B) 3 X soil amended with RCW and (C) 3 X soil amended with mature CSS. Total dissolved TE concentrations were determined in soil pore water (SPW) sampled by Rhizon samplers. The soil exposure intensity was assessed by standard Chelex 100 DGT (diffusive gradient in thin films) probes. TE phytoavailability was characterized by growing dwarf beans on potted soils and analyzing their foliar TE concentrations. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the addition of fresh RCW and CSS has a positive effect on contaminated technosols. RCW decreased the mobility of all the studied TE in the SPW, whereas CSS reduced the mobility of Mo, Cr and Co, while it increased the mobility of Zn, Cu and As compared with the NE soil. The Zn soil exposure intensity assessed by DGT was not significantly changed by the addition of RCW and CSS, while the Cr soil exposure intensity was significantly decreased after RCW addition compared with the soil treated with CSS and the NE soil. In contrast Cu and Co were non labile in the three soils.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Forest and Wood Science)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2005. In {{this study}} the {{mechanical}} pulping characteristics of Solanum mauritianum (Bugweed) were investigated using Thermomechanical (TMP), Chemithermomechanical (CTMP) and Biothermomechanical (BTMP) methods. Results {{were compared with}} those obtained from Pinus patula pulps treated under similar conditions. In the TMP pulping trials, the pretreatment of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> involved soaking of chips in water overnight prior to refining. The CTMP pulping trials involved first the impregnation of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> with 3 % sodium sulfite and 2 % sodium carbonate solution for 24 hours before refining. Coculture of hemicellulolytic Aspergillus flavipes and ligninolytic Pycnoporus sanguineus were inoculated to the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> in BTMP trials, to enhance <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> breakdown. Solanum mauritianum (Bugweed) <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> produced the highest pulp yields and less shive content compared to Pinus patula treated under similar pulping conditions. This could be ascribed to easier fibre separation and lesser fibre damage, {{as well as its}} lower extractive content. Results showed that the pretreatment of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> prior to TMP pulping increased paper strength properties compared to the pulp prepared from the untreated <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Chemically pretreated <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> consumed a larger amount of refining energy. With regard to brightness levels, handsheets from Pinus patula pulps recorded lower brightness values than those from Bugweed pulps. This was related to the lighter colour of the Bugweed <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and the higher extractive content of Pinus patula. The high brightness level of the CTMP pulps could be attributed to a modification of the lignin chromophores and the extractive removal, which contributed to a lower absorption coefficient of the pulp. Handsheets from BTMP pulps showed a reduction in brightness compared to the TMP and CTMP pulps. This was caused by the darkening of the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> during the fungal incubation period. Pulp and paper properties of Bugweed compared favourably to those results published for other hardwoods.

Biomass from periodical cutting down of hedgerows is often unutilized litter. The study assesses different ways {{how to use}} <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from hedgerows, and quantifies the biomass potential for either mulching arable land with <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> or, alternatively, for bioenergy use. The calculations are based on experiments at the experimental station for organic farming Kleinhohenheim and on literature. The yield of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> was clearly too low to mulch the total arable land of the model farm. Hedgerows on an area equal to 1 % of the farm area yielded <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for 0. 05 ha if 160 m 3 ha- 1 were applied. This layer significantly reduced weeds. Hedgerows covering 5 % or 20 % of the farmland would provide <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for about 0. 2 or 1 ha for mulching or, used as firewood, they would cover the corresponding fuel oil demand {{of more than one}} average household. Compared to poplars in short rotation coppice on the same area, the energy output is low. Since an energy use of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is ecological and economical inefficient, mulching seems a reasonable way to use <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from cutting hedgerow, in spite of low yields. <b>Wood</b> <b>chips</b> should be applied to thoroughly selected areas, such as slopes (protection from soil erosion), crops with wide inter-row-distance or to perennial, high-value crops...|$|R

The measured basic bulk properties are in good overall agreement with the literature. However, discrepancies were discovered between two standardized methods for determination of the bulk density. The results for the driving torque, mass flow and mass-related energy consumption showed that different grades of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> can alter these values considerably. Between two <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> grades, a twice as high torque was recorded, while a third grade could not be fed due to jamming.
