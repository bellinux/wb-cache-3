However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Kennedy was {{recruited}} {{as a professor}} at Washington University in St. Louis, and was installed as Chairman of the Department of Chemistry in 1946, a role he continued in until his death. Kennedy brought with him Wahl, Lindsay Helmholz, David Lipkin, Herbert Potratz, and Samuel Weissman, who all served on the faculty at Washington University. Up to this time, Washington University was primarily concerned with undergraduate teaching. Kennedy is credited with transforming it into a university that also has boasts strong graduate and <b>research</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the evolution of a}} Dutch cultural-historical <b>research</b> <b>program,</b> called Developmental Education. Since the 1970 s the program elaborates a first generation version of the activity theory approach to learning and development, closely following the works of Vygotskij and Leont'ev. The <b>research</b> <b>program</b> is connected to a broad actor network bringing teachers, educators, and researchers together who share the commitment to Vygotskij's developmental theory and methodology. The mission of the <b>research</b> <b>program</b> is the collaborative constitution of a Vygotskian form of school education. In the elaboration of the <b>research</b> <b>program</b> it is demonstrated how this <b>research</b> <b>program</b> problematises some of the core concepts of current Vygotskian theory, and how these conceptual and associated empirical and practical problems are solved. On account of the problem solving potential of the <b>research</b> <b>program,</b> it is argued that this <b>research</b> <b>program</b> has proven to be progressive over the past decades. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{provided}} {{universities and colleges}} with grants to acquire small nuclear reactors for <b>research</b> <b>programs.</b> The University of Washington began nuclear engineering classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E

5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>programs,</b> {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler On Wheels (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many questions that still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E
5|$|The University Honors Program, {{administered}} by The Burnett Honors College {{is designed for}} 500 accomplished incoming undergraduates annually.

Honors students have the option to reside in a specifically designed living-learning community, composed entirely of honors students, in Tower III at Knights Plaza.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression saw a {{consistent}} squeeze on Georgia Tech's budget, but World War II-inspired research activity combined with post-World War II enrollment more than {{compensated for the}} school's difficulties. Georgia Tech desegregated peacefully and without a court order in 1961, in contrast to other southern universities. Similarly, it did not experience any protests due to the Vietnam War. The growth of the graduate and <b>research</b> <b>programs</b> combined with diminishing federal support for universities in the 1980s led President John Patrick Crecine to restructure the university in 1988 amid significant controversy. The 1990s were marked by continued expansion of the undergraduate programs and the satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia and Metz, France. In 1996, Georgia Tech {{was the site of}} the athletes' village and a venue for a number of athletic events for the Summer Olympics. Recently, the school has gradually improved its academic rankings and has paid significant attention to modernizing the campus, increasing historically low retention rates, and establishing degree options emphasizing research and international perspectives.|$|E
