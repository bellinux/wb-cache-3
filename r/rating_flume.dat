Robinson (1960) at Colorado State University. The purpose of Robinson’s investigation was to accurately calibrate and standardize the design of small Parshall measuring <b>flumes.</b> The <b>rated</b> <b>flumes</b> were constructed of galvanized sheet metal. Data was collected for Parshall flumes having throat widths of 1 -, 2 -, and 3 - inches. Calibration tables or curves were prepared for both free and submerged flow. The dimensions of the Parshall <b>flumes</b> <b>rated</b> by Robinson are shown in Figure 1. The study reported herein was made to illustrate that the analysis of submergence developed at Utah State University (Hyatt, 1965) for trapezoidal flumes is applicable to small Parshall flumes. The data reported by Robinson (1960) is analyzed by the submergence parameters reported by Hyatt (1965) and the resulting equations and calibration curves are listed in this report...|$|R

50|$|Some {{varieties}} of flumes {{are used in}} measuring water flow of a larger channel. When {{used to measure the}} flow of water in open channels, a flume is defined as a specially shaped, fixed hydraulic structure that under free-flow conditions forces flow to accelerate in such a manner that the flow <b>rate</b> through the <b>flume</b> can be characterized by a level-to-flow relationship as applied to a single head (level) measurement within the flume. Acceleration is accomplished through a convergence of the sidewalls, a change in floor elevation, or a combination of the two.|$|R
40|$|Quantification {{of river}} bedform {{variability}} and complexity {{is important for}} sediment transport modeling {{as well as for}} characterization of river morphology. Alluvial bedforms are shown to exhibit highly non- linear dynamics across a range of scales, affect local bed roughness, and vary with local hydraulic, hydrologic, and geomorphic properties. This paper examines sediment sorting on the crest and trough of gravel bed- forms and relates it to bed elevation statistics. The data analysed here are the spatial and temporal series of bed elevation, grain size distribution of surface and subsurface bed materials, and sediment transport <b>rates</b> from <b>flume</b> experiments. We describe surface topography through bedform variability in height and wavelength and multiscale analysis of bed eleva- tions as a function of discharge. We further relate bedform migration to preferential distribution of coarse and fine sediments on the troughs and crests, respectively, measuring directly surface and subsurface grain size distributions, and indirectly the small scale roughness variations as esti- mated from high resolution topographic scans...|$|R
40|$|A Montana flume is a Parshall flume {{without a}} {{diverging}} downstream section {{and is used}} to measure open channel flow. Under free-flow conditions, the Parshall flume and the Montana flume have the same calibration characteristics, but under submerge flows, their calibrations significantly differ. Tests were conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory on an acrylic 15. 2 -cm (6 -in.) Montana flume {{to determine the effects}} of submergence on the flow readings. This type of investigation has not been previously analyzed. It was found that a standard Parshall <b>flume</b> <b>rating</b> curve overpredicted flow rates in the submerged Montana flume, up to 48 %. Parshall submergence corrections were applied to the submerged Montana <b>flume,</b> and flow <b>rates</b> were underpredicted by up to 19 %.

40|$|Theoretical process-based {{models of}} braided {{alluvial}} architecture suggest that aggradation rate {{is a primary}} controlon the geometry, stacking and heterogeneity of sedimentary deposits. This hypothesis is tested at the scale of thechannel and bar using a combined field and flume modelling study, which quantifies {{the impact of a}} change inaggradation rate on the frequency of occurrence and geometry of the key depositional units that dominate coarsegrained,braided alluvial architecture. Aggradation of a 1 : 50 scale model of the braided Ashburton River, NewZealand, produces realistic alluvial architecture that closely corresponds to 7 km of logged field prototype outcrop. A twofold change in aggradation <b>rate</b> in the <b>flume</b> model and an order-of-magnitude change in the field outcrop,have no influence on the geometry and vertical distribution of fine- and coarse-grained depositional niches. Braided alluvial architecture at the channel scale therefore is determined by the local ‘instantaneous’ aggradationrate, related to individual flood events, rather than the long-term, regional aggradation rate...|$|R
40|$|Shortcomings of the ISO Standard 4359 flumes {{have been}} pointed out, {{focused on the}} concept of a {{boundary}} layer, applied for computing flow rate through Venturi and Palmer–Bowlus flumes. Two different approaches to flow <b>rate</b> measurements by <b>flumes</b> have been compared. The first one requires and the second approach does not require crossing of critical depth by the liquid free surface somewhere in a flume throat. Computing the critical depth position in a flume throat was described and a method of improving flow rate computations accuracy suggested. This method differs from the ISO Standard 4359 in computing the distance by which depth and width of liquid stream in a throat should be modified according to the boundary layer concept. While the ISO Standard 4359 prescribes in calculating this distance for the end of a flume throat, the authors suggest calculating it for a cross section of critical depth. Some examples of flow rate computations are presented, showing a visible improvement in flow rate computations after applying this suggestion...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringLarry A. GlasgowFeedlots, animal {{production}} facilities, and agricultural lands are point and non-point sources for nutrient enrichment of surrounding waterways {{and result in}} human enhanced eutrophication. Artificial elevation and increased enrichment from animal wastes, fertilizer, and runoff greatly increase the speed of this natural process and leads to degraded water quality, algae blooms, and fish kills. Phosphorous is typically the limiting nutrient for plant growth, and thus is {{the main focus of}} this paper. Phosphates enable excessive and choking plant growth that lead to depleted dissolved oxygen and excessive decaying plant matter, subsequently damaging the aquatic ecosystem. In order to provide an inexpensive and feasible solution to minimize phosphate eutrophication, a passive, vortex generating flume has been proposed to provide the necessary mixing for the removal of phosphorus from waste waters. Preliminary tests with dye tracers and electrolyte pulse injections have been conducted to model the flow characteristics and determine the residence time under a variety of flow conditions, angle of inclination and flow <b>rate.</b> The <b>flume</b> was modeled by two methods: four continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) in series and as four CSTRs in series operating in parallel with a plug flow reactor (PFR). The hydraulic model fit a total of five parameters to the experimental data: Residence time, the inlet concentrations of the electrolyte pulse tracer, and the injection times of the tracer to both types of reactors. The kinetic model was built based on data collected from a different study of swine lagoons using magnesium chloride to precipitate phosphorus as the mineral struvite. The precipitation kinetics were modeled using first order and irreversible reaction and incorporated into the hydraulic model. The vortex generating flume provided an operating space that sufficiently removed phosphorus from the waste stream. Future work will include pilot scale testing of the model using waste streams and the investigation of a scour to minimize solid formation in the flume...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, a {{white light}} {{particle}} image velocimetry (WL PIV) system which employs a light sheet generated with a flash was used. The system {{was developed in}} order to provide a cost-efficient and safe alternative to laser systems while keeping the accuracy limits required for hydraulic model tests. To investigate the accuracy of WL PIV method under different flow conditions, experiments were done at three different values of flow rates. Then the velocity vectors of each flow <b>rate</b> through the <b>flume</b> were calculated by means of cross-correlation of the two subsequent images. Flow velocity and Reynolds stress of each experiment were measured. The accuracy and integrity of the experiments were validated by comparison to the results which were obtained with empirical models of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress distribution in the boundary layer. Excellent agreement between the experimental and empirical results was observed. The whole flow field from the entrance of the experimental flume to its outlet was also modeled computationally using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the k-ε turbulence model of FLUENTTM code. It was found that the WL PIV measurements had a deviation of about 0. 5 to 1. 5 % from the computational results whic...|$|R

An alternative method for determining maximum heart rate by each swimmer. Methods: Due to {{the basis of the}} pilot study, a methodology for heart rate max. testing was created. A sample of probands was chosen to study Physical Education and Sport of the students who are former or still active swimmers. A sporttester was used to detect a heart rate. Data processing was made by Polar Precision Performance programe. For the submaximal swimmer speed detection probands went through a CSS test. Speed obtained from this test was further used for warming of probands before the graded strain test started up to the maximal heart rate of probands. Results: By the CSS test is obtained the individual speed of swimming at the ANP level of each of the probands in meters per second. This was further used as the speed for warming in the graded test up to the maximal heart rate of probands. The results are showing that four of six probands reached the maximum heart rate level in comparison with a theoretical calculation of the maximum heart rate.

40|$|When under {{competition}} for fertilisations, males {{are thought to}} increase their reproductive success by releasing as many sperm as possible into the reproductive arena and in many species, this prediction holds. For marine invertebrates, which utilise the ancestral strategy of broadcast spawning eggs and sperm, however, it appears that males tend to release their sperm more slowly than females release their eggs. Marine invertebrate eggs typically have a relatively slow permanent block to polyspermy (whereby eggs become impermeable to further sperm attachment), and for several minutes after fertilisation, sperm can continue to attach to a fertilised egg. We hypothesised that releasing sperm slowly minimises the 2 ̆ 7 wastage 2 ̆ 7 of sperm on already fertilised eggs. We simulated different sperm release <b>rates</b> in a <b>flume</b> using the broadcast spawning polychaete, Galeolaria caespitosa. Sperm release rates strongly affected overall fertilisation success: higher release rates resulted in lower fertilisation rates. Laboratory studies confirmed that the 2 ̆ 7 permanent 2 ̆ 7 block to polyspermy in G. caespitosa took {{less than a minute}} to form but this lag was sufficient to result in some sperm wastage. Thus upstream, fertilised eggs that have not formed a permanent block to polyspermy can remove sperm from the pool that would otherwise fertilise downstream sibling eggs. We suggest that while electrical blocks to polyspermy evolved in response to excess sperm, permanent blocks to polyspermy could have evolved in response to sperm limitation (insufficient sperm) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVolumetric water {{metering}} is {{a critical}} need for rationalizing abiana (water tariff) rates in the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). Measuring water flows in a mogha (small irrigation outlets) is extremely challenging due to various problems of scale. Due to the extremely large number of such outlets in IBIS (numbering tens of thousands), a manual measurement and reporting system is completely infeasible. An ICT powered automation is an obvious approach towards solving this scalability problem. However, the challenges for an electronic solution are enormously high. While such an automation has been successfully demonstrated for distributary irrigation canals (10 s- 100 s of cusecs) in the IBIS by our group using a smart water metering approach, measuring such flows at the outlet level (< 3 cusecs) is hampered by challenges in hydraulics, frequent siltation, unavailability of grid energy to power electronics, unreliable telecommunications backbone and institutional support to service the meters. In this paper, we report our development and deployment of a test unit for discharge measurement on an outlet using a Low Power Wireless Smart Water Meter, and a long throated flume to generate a modular flow of water to measure discharge in small rectangular channels and to analyse the accuracy of measurement of unit. The deployed solution {{can be used to}} remotely transmit depth of water, discharge, state of channel, therefore, free flow or submerged using GSM/GPRS module. Two ultrasonic sensors take reading of depth of water in channel, one on the approach section h 1 and another on tail water section h 2 for estimation of state of <b>flume.</b> <b>Rating</b> curve of the discharge measurement unit is generated by WinFlume and results of real system discharge measurements are compared for accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The role of multi-species benthic diatom films (BDF) in the {{settlement}} of late pediveliger larvae of the bivalve Macoma balthica was investigated in still-water bioassays and multiple choice flume experiments. Axenic diatom cultures that were isolated from a tidal mudflat inhabited by M. balthica were selected to develop BDF sediment treatments characterized by a different community structure, biomass, and amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Control sediments had no added diatoms. Although all larvae settled and initiated burrowing within the first minute after their addition in still water, regardless of treatment, only 48 - 52 % had completely penetrated the high diatom biomass treatments after 5  min, while on average 80 and 69 % of the larvae had settled and burrowed into the control sediments and BDF with a low diatom biomass (3. 5 µg Chl a g 1 dry sediment), respectively. The percentage of larvae settling and burrowing into the sediment was negatively correlated with the concentration of Chl a and EPS of the BDF. This suggests higher physical resistance to bivalve penetration by the BDF with higher diatom biomass and more associated sugar and protein compounds. The larval settlement <b>rate</b> in annular <b>flume</b> experiments at flow velocities of 5 and 15 cm s 1 was distinctly lower compared to the still-water assays. Only 4. 6 - 5. 8 % of the larvae were recovered from BDF and control sediments after 3 h. Nonetheless, a clear settlement preference was observed for BDF in the flume experiments; i. e., larvae settled significantly more in BDF compared to control sediments irrespective of flow speed. Comparison with {{the settlement}} of polystyrene mimics and freeze-killed larvae led {{to the conclusion that}} active selection, active secondary dispersal and, at low flow velocities (5 cm s 1), passive adhesion to the sediment are important mechanisms determining the settlement of M. balthica larvae in estuarine biofilms...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the behaviour of the turbulence during laboratory simulations of floods in rivers with mild bed slopes was undertaken. Computer control of the flow <b>rate</b> into the <b>flume</b> enabled reproducible flood waves to be generated. To rigorously model the energy gradients in a long channel, an interactive sluice gate control was developed for the downstream end of the flume. Mean flow unsteadiness effects on the turbulence were evaluated by considering different duration hydrographs with similar shapes and magnitudes. The investigation {{was limited to the}} longitudinal component of turbulence, as a one-component laser Doppler anemometer was employed for the determination of point velocities. Flow visualisation using a dye plume supplemented velocity data. It was observed that for events having a shorter duration the peak turbulent intensity had a greater magnitude, and occurred relatively earlier on the rising limb of the flood. The turbulent energy peak coincided with the maximum flow rate divergence. For increasing flow divergence magnitude, which only occurs on the rising limb, the production of turbulence was larger than dissipation, with the transport of turbulence providing an additional sink for turbulent energy. After the depth had peaked the flow experienced pseudo-equilibrium conditions, where the transport mechanism was insignificant and the rate of production approximated dissipation. A feature of the falling limb was a period of inactivity, in which the magnitudes of production and dissipation were at minimum. A second - 5 / 3 slope region was observed in the energy spectra. The length scale associated with an energy source for this double structure was two orders of magnitude larger than the Kolmogorov dissipation length scale. Decay times for flow structures of this size are similar to the duration of these hydrographs. It is possible that the unsteady flow created vortex structures that persisted for some time after the flow which generated them had moved downstream. These vortex structures, which provide a turbulence memory mechanism, and the state of pseudo-equilibrium on the falling limb are responsible for residual turbulent energy in the flow throughout the falling limb and immediately following the passing of the flood wave. In addition, it is suggested that mean flow controls both the production and dissipation of turbulence, with the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy being controlled by the diffusion of momentum during low speed streaks. The Kolmogorov scale may be interpreted as defining the critical damping condition along these streaks where Reynolds stresses balance viscous forces...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} is nowadays {{an important}} tool for predicting river flows and sediment transport. Two dimensional (2 D) models give more detailed information than the often used one dimensional (1 D) models, and 2 D models have the advantage over three dimensional (3 D) models that the simulation times are reduced, and therefore could be more attractive to use in many applied cases, where 3 D flow effects are not so important. When using numerical models in predicting sediment transport, the non-uniformity of the bed material has to be considered, especially in natural environments, where {{it is very likely}} to have different particle sizes. Sediment transport is highly dependent on the grain size distribution of the sediment mixture of the river bed. The main goal for this thesis was to see if the 2 D model CCHE 2 D could assess accurately the sediment transport in a case with non-uniform material. A physical model study carried out by S. Lanzoni in 2000 was selected for this purpose. In the laboratory, a straight flume with a bimodal sediment mixture was used. Experiments on sediment transport were conducted in the flume, where bed load was the dominating transport mode, alternate bars developed during the experiment and equilibrium conditions were reached. The data from the physical model was the input for the numerical model used in this thesis. CCHE 2 D was capable of replicating the bed load transport <b>rate</b> in the <b>flume,</b> with only a 1. 5 % difference between the measured average value and the simulated value. From the numerical modelling study, it was concluded that the modified Ackers and White formula for calculating sediment transport capacity gave the best results compared to the other available formulae in CCHE 2 D. This formula includes the hiding and exposure effects, which are important for a sediment mixture like the one used in the studied case. During the study, the main parameters that influenced the sediment transport process were identified. The numerical simulations proved to be very sensitive to the roughness height, the adaptation length and the mixing layer thickness. The study showed that the bed load transport rate calculation is also strongly dependent on the boundary conditions. Uncertainties on parameters and boundary conditions were solved by calibration and sensitivity analyses. The CCHE 2 D model could be applicable to cases where depth averaged values are accurate enough for the prediction of the physical processes that are being modeled, especially, in cases where helical flows have minor influence on the results. The time required for the simulations and the computational resources were adequate for carrying out this study. However, an applied case with a more complex geometry would require much more computational resources. Additionally, assessment of the parameters requires measured data and calibration. </p...|$|R
