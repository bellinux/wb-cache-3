40|$|M-C Power Corporation will design, fabricate, install, {{test and}} {{evaluate}} a 250 kW Proof-of-Concept Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) Power Plant. The plant {{is to be}} located at the Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. This report summarizes the technical progress that has occurred in conjunction with this project in 1994. M-C Power has completed the tape casting and sintering of cathodes and is proceeding with the tape casting and sintering of anodes for the first 250 cell stack. M-C Power and San Diego Gas and Electric relocated the fuel cell demonstration project to an alternate site at the Naval Air Station Miramar. For the new project location at the Naval Air Station Miramar, an Environmental Assessment has been prepared by the Department of Energy {{in compliance with the}} National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Environmental Assessment resulted in a categorical exclusion of the proposed action from all environmental permit requirements. Bechtel Corporation has completed the reformer process design coordination, a Process Description, the Pipe and Instrumentation Diagrams, a Design Criteria Document and General Project Requirement Document. Bechtel developed the requirements for soils investigation report and issued the following equipment bid packages to the suppliers for bids: Inverter, Reformer, Desulfurization Vessels, Hot Gas <b>Recycle</b> <b>Blower,</b> Heat Recovery Steam Generator, and Recycle Gas Cooler. SDG and E has secured necessary site permits, conducted soils investigations, and is working on the construction plan. They are in final negotiations with the US Navy on a site agreement. Site drawings are required for finalization of the agreement...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine (SOFC-GT) hybrid system design is conducted {{with the intention of}} determining the thermodynamically based design space constrained by modern material and operating limits. The analysis is performed using a thermodynamic model of a generalized SOFC-GT system where the sizing of all components, except the fuel cell, is allowed to vary. Effects of parameters such as pressure ratio, fuel utilization, oxygen utilization, and current density are examined. Operational limits are discussed in terms of maximum combustor exit temperature, maximum heat exchanger effectiveness, limiting current density, maximum hydrogen utilization, and fuel cell temperature rise. It was found that the maximum hydrogen utilization and combustor exit temperature were the most significant constraints on the system design space. The design space includes the use of cathode flow recycling and air preheating via a recuperator (heat exchanger). The effect on system efficiency of exhaust gas recirculation using an ejector versus using a blower is discussed, while both are compared with the base case of using a heat exchanger only. It was found that use of an ejector for exhaust gas recirculation caused the highest efficiency loss, and the base case was found to exhibit the highest overall system efficiency. The use of a cathode <b>recycle</b> <b>blower</b> allowed the largest downsizing of the heat exchanger, although avoiding cathode recycling altogether achieved the highest efficiency. Efficiencies in the range of 50 - 75 % were found for variations in pressure ratio, fuel utilization, oxygen utilization, and current density. The best performing systems that fell within all design constraints were those that used a heat exchanger only to preheat air, moderate pressure ratios, low oxygen utilizations, and high fuel utilizations.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the potential for}} Solid-Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) to provide electrical generation on-board commercial aircraft. Unlike a turbine-based auxiliary power unit (APU) a solid oxide fuel cell power unit (SOFCPU) would be more efficient than using the main engine generators to generate electricity and would operate continuously during flight. The focus {{of this study is}} on more-electric aircraft which minimize bleed air extraction from the engines and instead use electrical power obtained from generators driven by the main engines to satisfy all major loads. The increased electrical generation increases the potential fuel savings obtainable through more efficient electrical generation using a SOFCPU. However, the weight added to the aircraft by the SOFCPU impacts the main engine fuel consumption which reduces the potential fuel savings. To investigate these relationships the Boeing 787 ­ 8 was used as a case study. The potential performance of the SOFCPU was determined by coupling flowsheet modeling using ChemCAD software with a stack performance algorithm. For a given stack operating condition (cell voltage, anode utilization, stack pressure, target cell exit temperature), ChemCAD software was used to determine the cathode air rate to provide stack thermal balance, the heat exchanger duties, the gross power output for a given fuel rate, the parasitic power for the anode <b>recycle</b> <b>blower</b> and net power obtained from (or required by) the compressor/expander. The SOFC is based on the Gen 4 Delphi planar SOFC with assumed modifications to tailor it to this application. The size of the stack needed to satisfy the specified condition was assessed using an empirically-based algorithm. The algorithm predicts stack power density based on the pressure, inlet temperature, cell voltage and anode and cathode inlet flows and compositions. The algorithm was developed by enhancing a model for a well-established material set operating at atmospheric pressure to reflect the effect of elevated pressure and to represent the expected enhancement obtained using a promising cell material set which has been tested in button cells but not yet used to produce full-scale stacks. The predictions for the effect of pressure on stack performance were based on literature. As part of this study, additional data were obtained on button cells at elevated pressure to confirm the validity of the predictions. The impact of adding weight to the 787 - 8 fuel consumption was determined as a function of flight distance using a PianoX model. A conceptual design for a SOFC power system for the Boeing 787 is developed and the weight estimated. The results indicate that the power density of the stacks must increase by at least a factor of 2 to begin saving fuel on the 787 aircraft. However, the conceptual design of the power system may still be useful for other applications which are less weight sensitive...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) systems have the {{potential}} to generate exhaust gas streams of high temperature, ranging from 400 to 800 C. These high temperature gas streams can be used for additional power generation with bottoming cycle technologies to achieve higher system power efficiency. One of the potential candidate bottoming cycles is power generation by means of thermoelectric (TE) devices, which have the inherent advantages of low noise, low maintenance and long life. This study was to analyze the feasibility of combining coal gas based SOFC and TE through system performance and cost techno-economic modeling in the context of multi-MW power plants, with 200 kW SOFC-TE module as building blocks. System and component concepts were generated for combining SOFC and TE covering electro-thermo-chemical system integration, power conditioning system (PCS) and component designs. SOFC cost and performance models previously developed at United Technologies Research Center were modified and used in overall system analysis. The TE model was validated and provided by BSST. The optimum system in terms of energy conversion efficiency was found to be a pressurized SOFC-TE, with system efficiency of 65. 3 % and cost of $ 390 /kW of manufacturing cost. The pressurization ratio was approximately 4 and the assumed ZT of the TE was 2. 5. System and component specifications were generated based on the modeling study. The major technology and cost barriers for maturing the system include pressurized SOFC stack using coal gas, the high temperature <b>recycle</b> <b>blowers,</b> and system control design. Finally, a 4 -step development roadmap is proposed for future technology development, the first step being a 1 kW proof-of-concept demonstration unit...|$|R
