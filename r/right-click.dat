5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply <b>right-click.</b> After items are used, a <b>right-click</b> returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E

25|$|The Mighty Mouse {{does not}} report whether {{the right and}} left sensors are {{activated}} simultaneously. In fact, it reports a <b>right-click</b> only when there is no finger contact {{on the left side of}} the mouse. Thus a <b>right-click</b> requires lifting the finger off the mouse, then right-clicking. This also means that the Mighty Mouse cannot support mouse chording, used by CAD software, games, and other applications where multiple functions are mapped to the mouse.|$|E
25|$|This update can be {{activated}} with a Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 product key {{as well as}} Windows 10 product keys.

25|$|Warcraft III was {{announced}} as a role-playing-strategy game (RPS) with flexible camera movement. The first version shown at ECTS 1999 had no notable interface, however {{it did have}} portraits for the heroes. Various articles showed that abilities and items were used via <b>right-click</b> on a unit and an appearing icon collar.|$|E
25|$|The Fax {{service and}} model are fully account-based. Fax-aware {{applications}} such as Windows Fax and Scan can send multiple documents in a single fax submission. The Fax Service API generates TIFF files for each document and merges them into a single TIFF file. Users can <b>right-click</b> a document in Windows Explorer and select Send to Fax Recipient.|$|E
2500|$|Watching Movies {{with the}} Sound Off {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 73, based on 17 reviews. David Renshaw of NME said, [...] "It's {{hard not to}} notice that the production outshines the delivery, with Pharrell and Diplo beats topped only by the slick 'SDS' courtesy of Brainfeeder boss Flying Lotus. At least it all diverts attention from that naked album cover, mind." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "Without the hooks or the lofty lyrics, the album seems made exclusively for Miller's fans or those who <b>right-click</b> indie rap mixtape links on the daily. Those audiences should find it an interesting trip, admirable artistic growth, and an attractive, entertaining {{step in the right}} direction. Others will likely be flummoxed." ...|$|E

5000|$|Several {{features}} were deprecated in later versions. For example, the gauge meter showing the free space on a file system {{was replaced with}} a percentage in AmigaOS 2.0. Under Workbench 1.x, <b>right-clicking</b> on icons opens a display of the files' metadata; whereas from Workbench 2.0 onwards, <b>right-clicking</b> activates pull-down menus only. The default [...] "busy" [...] pointer (a comic balloon showing [...] "Zzz...") was replaced with a stopwatch in later versions.|$|R
5000|$|Users can {{populate}} these panels {{with other}} completely customizable menus and buttons, including new menus, search boxes, and icons, with the icons in particular (called launchers) performing functions {{similar to the}} quick-launch feature found in the Microsoft Windows 98-Vista taskbar.
