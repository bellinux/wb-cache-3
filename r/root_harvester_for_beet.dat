40|$|Production of the açai {{fruit is}} mainly {{accomplished}} through manual collection; {{but there is}} a strong trend towards the implementation of commercial crops. Fruit harvesting is carried out exclusively by climbers who risk injury to themselves, besides not being very efficient at harvesting. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce design concepts <b>for</b> self-propelled açai <b>harvesters</b> <b>for</b> dry-land forest environments, floodplain forest environments and commercial crops. To this end we used the design methodology of a morphological matrix. The results obtained were the design concepts for the following new harvesters: an açai <b>harvester</b> <b>for</b> native floodplain forests in the wet season; a <b>harvester</b> <b>for</b> both dry-land and native floodplain forests in the dry season; a <b>harvester</b> <b>for</b> commercial crops...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of my {{research}} on Shuswap (Secwépemc) and Okanagan (Syilx) peoples’ root digging protocols that I carried out between January and July 2012 with three communities in the Secwépemc Nation (Skeetchestn, Simpcw and Tk’emlups) and two communities in the Syilx Nation (Westbank First Nation and Penticton First Nation). For thousands of years, a variety of native root plants have made important contributions to the sustenance of Secwépemc, Syilx and other indigenous peoples of the Interior Plateau. Important among these were, and still are, skwenkwinem (Claytonia lanceolata – springbeauties) and spitl’em/llekw’pin (Lewisia redeviva – bitterroot). Using a grounded theory approach, but also informed by indigenous research methods and my own connection to both nations, I present information from Secwépemc and Syilx root diggers gathered during interviews and root digging expeditions. My focus is on gaining understanding of practices, norms, and rules that Secwépemc and Syilx <b>root</b> <b>harvesters</b> narrated about their techniques of digging and processing of roots, but also about the way that root digging connects them to spiritual and cultural concepts and values. To describe these, I use the term protocols in that it follows present First Nations conventions of referring to what anthropologists call “culture. ” Although western market foods are commonly available in our communities, the enacted protocols of root-digging continue to connect Secwépemc and Syilx people to their identities, ancestors and lands, and can shape the identities of present and future generations. I found that Secwépemc harvesters focused on skwenkwinem, while Syilx harvesters focused on sp̓iƛ̓əm. This is partly due to the ecological conditions in their respective territories. However, as I show, these preferences also reflect important historical and spiritual associations of the respective <b>roots</b> that <b>root</b> <b>harvesters</b> explained to me. These differences, in turn, mark national identities of root diggers and knowledge keepers as being Syilx or Secwépemc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wireless sensor node (WSN) system where an electromagnetic (EM) energy <b>harvester</b> is utilized <b>for</b> charging its rechargeable batteries while {{the system is}} operational. The capability {{and the performance of}} an in-house low-frequency EM energy <b>harvester</b> <b>for</b> charging rechargeable NiMH batteries were experimentally verified in comparison to a regular battery charger. Furthermore, the power consumption of MicaZ motes, used as the WSN, was evaluated in detail for different operation conditions. The battery voltage and current were experimentally monitored during the operation of the MicaZ sensor node equipped with the EM vibration energy harvester. A compact (24. 5 cm 3) in-house EM energy harvester provides approximately 65 µA charging current to the batteries when excited by 0. 4 g acceleration at 7. 4 Hz. It has been shown that the current demand of the MicaZ mote can be compensated for by the energy <b>harvester</b> <b>for</b> a specific low-power operation scenario, with more than a 10 -fold increase in the battery lifetime. The presented results demonstrate the autonomous operation of the WSN, with the utilization of a vibration-based energy harvester...|$|R
