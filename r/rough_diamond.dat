25|$|H.R. 1415 has 13 sections, {{the first}} of which names the act as the “Clean Diamond Trade Act”. The Act defines the {{motivation}} behind the passage as due to the human rights issues associated with the <b>rough</b> <b>diamond</b> trade. It also addresses previous action that has been taken to address threats due to conflicts coming from <b>rough</b> <b>diamond</b> trade. The act mentions the United Nations Security Council prohibiting states from exporting weapons to countries affected by diamond conflicts, in addition to mandating that states prohibit importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia (3). The United States subsequently restricted the importation of diamonds to those containing a certificate of origin.|$|E
5|$|The Kimberley Process was {{developed}} to monitor the trade in <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> are certificated {{by the government of}} the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> within a country.|$|R
50|$|The Kimberley Process was {{initiated}} in May 2000 by South Africa. Canada {{was a major}} supporter of passing this. Canada has passed several laws that help stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The laws deal with the export and import of <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds,</b> and also how they are transferred. In December 2002 the Export and Import of <b>Rough</b> <b>Diamonds</b> Act {{was passed by the}} Canadian government. This law acts as a system that helps control the importing, exporting and transporting of <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> through Canada. The Export and Import of <b>Rough</b> <b>Diamonds</b> Act also states that the Kimberley Process is the minimum requirement of certifying <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> and a certificate is also required for all shipments of diamonds. This certificate is called the Canadian Certificate, it gives permission for an officer to seize any shipment of diamonds that does not meet the requirements of the Export and Import of <b>Rough</b> <b>Diamonds</b> Act.|$|R
50|$|Trading of <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> {{takes place}} through two {{channels}} - De Beers Global Sightholder Sales (GSS) and De Beers Auction Sales.

25|$|The series {{became an}} instant hit because, {{although}} a comedy, {{in the context of}} its time it did deal with aspects of working-class life comparatively realistically. It addressed racial and political issues at a difficult time in British society. Mitchell imbued the character of Alf Garnett with an earthy charm that served to humanise Alf and make him likable.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{implementation}} of the CDTA in accordance with KPCS, in 2012 Census reported only $462.1million worth of rough diamonds, a 28.5% decrease from the 2011 report of $646.7 million. The Census Bureau in 2012 reported that the United States received <b>rough</b> <b>diamond</b> imports from approximately 24 KP participants including Liberia, Mexico, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Israel, and Japan. Within the data reports of imports from countries such as these the carat weight and value of the diamonds are also included. To continue to provide the most accurate data the Census compares and checks its monthly data with data it receives from USKPA to ensure that there are no discrepancies between imports and exports.|$|E

Net exports and imports have dropped due to the ongoing Global financial crisis, particularly within the Eurozone and the United States.

Above the pear-shaped diamond is the amethyst surmounted by a cross pattée encrusted with an emerald and small diamonds.

500|$|Maslin {{called the}} film an {{impressive}} directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, and Klady saying the only failings came when Darabont focused {{for too long}} on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. The Hollywood Reporter said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film's long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film's mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a [...] "bunch of swell and softhearted guys" [...] to cast the prison experience in a [...] "rosy glow". Klady summarized the film as [...] "estimable and haunting entertainment," [...] comparing it to a <b>rough</b> <b>diamond</b> with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy's and Red's reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works {{because it is not}} about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.|$|E

40|$|The Kimberley Process {{is a joint}} governments, {{industry}} and civil society initiative aimed at preventing “conflict diamonds” – <b>rough</b> <b>diamonds</b> used by rebel movements to finance military activity against legitimate governments – from entering the global trade.

Mary also inherited CullinanVI from Alexandra, and she left all the Cullinan diamonds to her granddaughter Queen ElizabethII in 1953.

2500|$|While {{fracture}} filling as {{a method}} to enhance gems {{has been found in}} gems over 2,500 years old, the diamond's unique refractive index required a more advanced solution than simple wax and oil treatments. This technology became available roughly 20 years after the time the laser drilling technique was developed. Simply put, [...] "fracture filling" [...] makes tiny natural fractures inside diamonds less {{visible to the naked eye}} or even under magnification. Fractures are very common inside diamonds and are created during the diamond's creation in the earth's crust. As the <b>rough</b> <b>diamond</b> travels up from the earth's crust through volcanic pipes it comes under extreme stresses and pressures, and during this travel tiny fractures can form inside the diamond. If these fractures are visible and damaging to the beauty of the diamond, it will have much lower demand and won't be as salable to jewelers and the general public, making them candidates for fracture filling and thus visually improve the appearance of the diamond.|$|E
