5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by <b>rinsing</b> it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special <b>rinsing</b> solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by <b>rinsing</b> and then draining them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by <b>rinsing</b> in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the impact of the final <b>rinse</b> technique on smear layer removal ability of 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Methods: Sixteen single-rooted human teeth were instrumented and divided into 2 groups at the final <b>rinse</b> step according to the following final <b>rinse</b> techniques used: continuous <b>rinse</b> group, continuous <b>rinse</b> with EDTA during 3 minutes, and <b>rinse</b> and soaking group, <b>rinse</b> with 1 mL of EDTA, soaking of the canal for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and <b>rinse</b> completion with the remaining 4 mL for 30 seconds. The specimens were split lengthwise and observed under scanning electron microscope. Results: Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. The continuous <b>rinse</b> group presented more debris-free surfaces when compared with the <b>rinse</b> and soaking group (P. 05).

40|$|This study {{compared}} the staining potential of two experimental amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> (A and B), a phenolic/essential oil <b>rinse</b> (C) and a negative control, water, <b>rinse</b> (D). The {{study was a}} single centre, randomized, single-blind, four treatment crossover study design among healthy participants. Prior to each study period, participants received a dental prophylaxis. On the Monday of each period, subjects suspended oral hygiene, and under supervision, <b>rinsed</b> with the allocated mouth <b>rinse</b> immediately followed by a warm black tea solution at hourly intervals eight times a day for 4 days. On Friday, the area and intensity of staining on the teeth, the primary outcome measure and dorsum of tongue were assessed.

The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of a novel nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) desensitizing oral <b>rinse</b> to occlude dentine tubules compared to selected commercially available desensitizing oral <b>rinses.</b> Methods. 25 caries-free extracted molars were sectioned into 1 [*]mm thick dentine discs. The dentine discs (n= 25) were etched with 6 % citric acid for 2 minutes and <b>rinsed</b> with distilled water, prior to a 30 -second application of test and control oral <b>rinses.</b> Evaluation was by (1) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the dentine surface and (2) fluid flow measurements through a dentine disc.

Although the novel nHA oral <b>rinse</b> demonstrated the ability to occlude the dentine tubules and reduce the fluid flow measurements, some of the other oral <b>rinses</b> appeared to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in fluid flow through the dentine disc, in particular the arginine/PVM/MA copolymer oral <b>rinse...</b>|$|R

40|$|While oral <b>rinses</b> {{used for}} {{cosmetic}} purposes only {{do not necessarily}} have to be antiseptic, antimicrobial activity is required for medical indications, including oral and periodontal surgery. So the question arises—is the antimicrobial activity of oral <b>rinses</b> associated with any destructive changes in cell viability in vitro? To answer this question, we examined twelve oral <b>rinses</b> {{with respect to their}} antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. Antimicrobial activity was screened against five bacterial strains using disc diffusion. Cytotoxicity was determined by mitochondrial reductase activity with primary gingival fibroblasts, L 929 cells, and HSC- 2 epithelial cells. Phase contrast microscopy and trypan blue staining were then performed to reveal cell morphology. Cells remained vital after exposure to oral <b>rinses</b> that were only used for cosmetic purposes. Moderate cytotoxic effects were observed for oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 05 % chlorhexidine, ethanol, or pegylated hydrogenated castor oil and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and cocamidopropyl betaine exhibited strong cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity. Strong cytotoxic but moderate antimicrobial activity was observed in oral <b>rinses</b> containing cetylpyridinium chloride. The in vitro data show that oral <b>rinses</b> are heterogeneous with respect to their cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.

Patients <b>rinsed</b> four times a day with a CP mouth <b>rinse.</b> Patients not willing to <b>rinse</b> with the CP mouth <b>rinse</b> served as control.

In the present study, the two-solution <b>rinse</b> and two NaF <b>rinses</b> with F contents of 250 ppm and 1000 ppm were evaluated in an intra-oral remineralization model.

Materials and Methods: The sample for the study consisted of 75 school children aged 8 – 12 years with four or more (decay component) of decayed, missing, and filled teeth index. Children were divided randomly into three equal groups and were asked to <b>rinse</b> with the prescribed mouth <b>rinse</b> once daily for 2 weeks after breakfast under supervision.

The statistically significant reduction in the mean S. mutans and lactobacilli counts were more in 0. 12 % chlorhexidine group than in the combination mouth <b>rinse</b> and 0. 5 % green tea mouth <b>rinse</b> group.
