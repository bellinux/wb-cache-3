5|$|The <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> Brown and Modell only widened as the 1962 season progressed.

Jim Brown was not the NFL's leading rusher for the only time in his career.|$|E

5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} himself from the legacy of the robbery may {{have been one of the}} sources of the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|After Finn {{agrees to}} help Marceline record {{one of her}} musical compositions, she begins to sing a song—"The Fry Song"—about the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> herself and her father, Hunson Abadeer. Finn, feeling sorry for her, decides to summon her father from the hellish Nightosphere, failing to realize that her father is the domain's dark leader and that he consumes souls. He materializes before Marceline and Finn, {{attempts}} to kill Finn, and successfully steals Marceline's axe bass. Finn and Marceline give chase.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to occupy the}} neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Béla, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept AndrewII's suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szörény) in 1231. Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E

50|$|The {{movement}} was characterised by <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> Oxfam {{and the other}} participating organisations, partly over tactics and partly due to concerns that Oxfam {{was too close to}} Tony Blair and New Labour.|$|R
50|$|Similar criticisms {{have been}} voiced by Red Pepper {{magazine}} and Katherine Quarmby in the New Statesman. The latter article detailed growing <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> Oxfam {{and other organizations}} within the Make Poverty History movement.|$|R
5|$|As {{the chief}} aide and closest friend of Emperor Andronikos III, Kantakouzenos became regent for the underage John V upon Andronikos's death in June 1341. While Kantakouzenos was absent from Constantinople in September the same year, a coup d'état led by Alexios Apokaukos and the Patriarch John XIV secured {{the support of}} Empress Anna and {{established}} a new regency. In response, Kantakouzenos' army and supporters proclaimed him co-emperor in October, cementing the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> himself and the new regency. The split immediately escalated into armed conflict.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
5|$|By {{trapping}} initially and blackmailing later, Shankar gets hold of Delhi Suri with whose help, {{he creates}} a <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> Damodar and Nagaraju {{which leads to}} the latter's murder.

However, the fact that Mallikharjun was gay, which was concealed by him for a long time, was believed by none. He is murdered by eating poisoned food.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken the West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{sought and}} gained the 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} deeply divided between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Atrash {{hosted a}} dinner aimed at healing the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> the ruling Ba'ath governments of Syria and {{neighboring}} Iraq.

25|$|Primakov's {{appointment}} restored {{political stability}} {{because he was}} seen as a compromise candidate able to heal the <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> Russia's quarreling interest groups. There was popular enthusiasm for Primakov as well. Primakov promised to make the payment of wages and pensions his government’s first priority and invited members of the leading parliamentary factions into his Cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|Cirrocumulus {{stratiformis}} {{is a type}} of cirrocumulus cloud. The name cirrocumulus stratiformis {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "stretched out".

There can be spaces or <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> the individual cloudlets in the layer.|$|R
5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, {{which would have}} protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers {{and an end to}} the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|New York {{decided to}} hire a general manager {{for the first time}} in {{franchise}} history following the 1978 season. The search grew contentious and fractured the relationship between owners Wellington and Tim Mara. Finally, the Maras asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to step in with a recommendation. Rozelle recommended George Young, who worked in personnel for the Miami Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts. Young was hired, but the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> the Maras lasted for several years.|$|E
5|$|Social conditions, the {{standard}} of living and the self-confidence of the workers gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while {{the standard}} of living rose among the common people, the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E
50|$|Small-scale {{clashes between}} Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India {{insisted on the}} disputed McMahon Line being {{regarded}} as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claimed not to have retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses. China's suspicion of India's involvement in Tibet created more <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> the two countries.|$|R
5|$|Despite the Governor and Lieutenant Governor {{being elected}} {{on the same}} party ticket, very often there have been public <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> the two; for {{instance}} Gov.

T. Krishnamachari.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, {{it may be that the}} gathering was intended to heal a <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> king and church.|$|E
5|$|After {{following}} his father {{into the local}} politics of his home county, Clements agreed to chair the gubernatorial campaign of Thomas Rhea in 1935. Already committed to Rhea, he turned down an offer from Happy Chandler to chair his campaign, beginning the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> the two men. Clements {{went on to the}} Kentucky Senate in 1941. In 1944, he was selected as Democratic floor leader of the senate and successfully campaigned for a larger budget than that proposed by Republican governor Simeon Willis. His stand against Willis made him popular in the Democratic Party, and he went on to serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1944 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>rift</b> <b>between</b> {{the players}} and Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

25|$|Archbishop Péter Pázmány reorganized Royal Hungary's Roman Catholic Church and led a Counter-Reformation that {{reversed}} the Protestants' gains in Royal Hungary, using persuasion rather than intimidation. The Reformation caused <b>rifts</b> <b>between</b> Catholics, who often {{sided with the}} Habsburgs, and Protestants, who developed a strong national identity and became rebels in Austrian eyes. Chasms also developed between the mostly Catholic magnates and the mainly Protestant lesser nobles.|$|R
