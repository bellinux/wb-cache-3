Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen <b>Remand</b> <b>Centre</b> in the ACT but usually gaoled in New South Wales. The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130million.

40|$|This article {{describes}} three studies on {{several aspects of}} police custody in The Netherlands. The first study shows {{that the quality of}} accommodation, facilities, interaction and differential treatment are substandard in Dutch police stations, but dependent of the organisational size, degree of specialisation of the custodial task and extensiveness of duty-prescriptions and registration. Detention circumstances in police stations are worse than in <b>remand</b> <b>centres.</b> The second study reveals high prevalence rates of symptoms of depression and somatisation (SCL- 90) among police custody detainees. Police custody detainees' symptom levels are higher than those in a jail population and a male general population. The third study addresses the prevalence rates of suicides and other deaths in Dutch police custody in the period 1983 - 1993 and shows that the mortality rate, suicide rate and deadly poisoning rate are higher than those in <b>remand</b> <b>centres</b> and the general population. The findings of the three studies demonstrate that police custody is an area of concern. Â© 2001, MCB UP Limite...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a desperate}} need for {{effective}} {{mental health services}} for prisoners and ex-prisoners einstitutionalisation in Australia has seen the number {{of public and private}} psychiatric hospital beds fall from 30 000 in the early 1960 s to 8000 today. The population of Australia doubled during this time. There is no doubt that many people with serious mental illness are not being managed well in the community. 1 Some mental health researchers, 2 - 4 as well as the popular press, argue {{that there has been a}} recent related transmigration of people from psychiatric beds to <b>remand</b> <b>centres</b> (which house prisoners who have been charged with an offence but not yet convicted) and prisons.

25|$|On Friday April 26, 2013, Correctional Peace Officers across Alberta {{walked off}} the job or {{actively}} refused to enter Correctional Centers in solidarity to the wildcat strike started at the Edmonton <b>Remand</b> <b>Centre.</b> The initial event that started the strike is cited by the AUPE as the indefinite suspension of two union members after they voiced concerns over health and safety issues at the Edmonton <b>Remand</b> <b>Centre.</b> However, emails to the site's Executive Director which contained crude and disrespectful comments were the driving force for the union members' suspension. The centre had only been in use for two weeks; it received its first inmates on April 12, 2013, even though the AUPE - which represents the Correctional Officers - submitted a five-page list of deficiencies on April 11, 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1950 amended an Act of 1885 {{to bring}} prostitutes {{within the law}} and {{safeguard}} them from abduction and abuse.

40|$|Australian <b>remand</b> <b>centres</b> often {{contain more}} seriously mentally ill people than general {{hospital}} mental health inpatient units. However, {{it is unclear}} whether the apparent rise in prevalence of mental illness among prisoners reflects a genuine increase or an improvement in detection rates. Statistical modelling of the effect of deinstitutionalisation on the number of prisoners with mental health problems is fraught with methodological challenges and the absence of longitudinal data. 5 This debate has tended to overshadow other major areas of concern about mental illness among prisoners. 6 As Herrman et al pointed out 15 years ago, whatever the cause, services for people with mental illness in Australian prisons are inadequate and in need of urgent reform...|$|R

25|$|A prison, {{also known}} as a correctional facility, {{detention}} center (US English), jail (US and Australia), gaol (dated) (British English), penitentiary (sometimes used in American English) or <b>remand</b> <b>centre</b> is a facility in which inmates are forcibly confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until they are brought to trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. Besides their use for punishing crimes, jails and prisons are frequently used by authoritarian regimes against perceived opponents.|$|E
25|$|By {{the morning}} of Saturday April 27, all 10 correctional centres in Alberta (in Calgary, Edmonton, Peace River, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge & Red Deer) were all {{actively}} participating in the wildcat strike. The Alberta Provincial Government petitioned the Alberta Labour Relations Board and, after the Board ruled that the strike was illegal, filed an Injunction against the Correctional Officers demanding they cease strike actions and return to work. The injunction was ignored and officers have continued striking throughout Saturday and Sunday. Support for the officers was apparently from as far as Saskatchewan as a bus full of Saskatchewan Correctional Officers arrived at the Edmonton <b>Remand</b> <b>Centre</b> on Sunday afternoon to march with the AUPE members in solidarity. Correctional Officer positions were filled using RCMP Officers and Tactical Team Members of local Police Services as available.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 the staffs of the {{directors}} of convict prisons and of the Prison Commission were merged, and under the Prisons Act 1898 the office of commissioner was made to carry that of director also. The commission thus became responsible for all prisons in England and Wales. It was {{closely associated with the}} Criminal Department of the Home Office and was frequently referred to as the Prison Department of the Home Office. The commission later took charge of borstal institutions (1908) and <b>remand</b> <b>centres</b> and detention centres (1948), and from 1877 to 1895 was responsible for maintaining the register of habitual criminals; in the latter year this was returned to the Metropolitan Police Office. The commission developed secretariat, establishment and finance branches, as well as an Industries and Stores Division concerned with industries in the prisons and borstals and a Works Division dealing with buildings.|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} Professor Rustin {{discusses}} {{the method of}} Work Discussion. This is a technique of self observation for clinical practitioners where individual practitioners observe themselves while actively involved in work situations and reflect on the implications of what is seen and experienced. A Work Discussion seminar supervises and reflects on each memberâs observations in order to share knowledge between practitioners with similar work situations. He discusses {{the ways in which}} Working discussion might become a means of improving professional practice and policy-making outside of âcontinuing professional developmentâ or CPD programmes. The chapter concludes that there is scope for the Work Discussion method to influence institutional design however the engagement of more experienced researcher-practitioners is required alongside a focus on selected contexts of work â e. g. day nurseries, infant schools, childrenâs wards, university classes, <b>remand</b> <b>centres.</b> More accountable methods of data collection and analysis are also recommended...|$|R

Mr. Norman, along with other persons, operated a âprogramâ by which he and others solicited âinvestorsâ to advance funds in exchange for the promise of significant returns on their investments {{in a short period of}} time.
