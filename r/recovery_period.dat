5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> for those infected with malaria.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{duration}} of subsequent depressive episodes and <b>periods</b> of <b>recovery,</b> and much is based on potentially biased retrospective data. We therefore prospectively assessed whether duration of depressive episodes and recoveries is correlated within subjects and across episodes, and whether duration of subsequent depressive episodes and recoveries increases or decreases over time. Methods: From a sample of 267 depressed primary care patients enrolled in a RCT, we identified 279 depressive episodes and 455 <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> during a 3 -year follow-up. We correlated durations of depressive episodes and of recovery within subjects, and compared within subjects the duration of first depressive episodes after index depression with second and third episodes, and similarly with <b>recovery</b> <b>periods.</b> Results: No significant correlations were found between duration of depressive episodes or between <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> within subjects (Rs ranging from − 0. 17 to 0. 08; all Ps > 0. 05). Median duration of first and second depressive episodes was 11 (IQR 6 - 19) and 9 weeks (IQR 5 - 14). Median duration of first and second <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> was 16. 5 (IQR 7 - 31) and 17. 5 weeks (IQR 9 - 32). No significant increase or decrease was observed in duration of consecutive depressive episodes, nor in <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> across episodes (all Ps > 0. 05). Conclusions: In this prospective study, we found no correlation between duration of depressive episodes or between <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> within subjects. Moreover, we found no support for an increase or decrease in subsequent duration of depressive episodes or a decrease in <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> across episodes. These findings do not support the notion that experiencing multiple depressive episodes results in a growing vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: High {{intensity}} {{interval training}} (HIIT) {{has been proposed}} as a time-efficient format of exercise to reduce the chronic disease burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Changes in oxygen utilisation at the local tissue level during an acute session of HIIT could be the primary stimulus for the health benefits associated with this format of exercise. The <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> of HIIT effect the physiological responses that occur during the session. It was hypothesised that in sedentary individuals, local and systemic oxygen utilisation would be higher during HIIT interspersed with active <b>recovery</b> <b>periods,</b> when compared to passive <b>recovery</b> <b>periods.</b> Methods: Twelve sedentary males (mean ± SD; age 23 ± 3 yr) completed three conditions on a cycle ergometer: 1) HIIT with passive <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> between four bouts (HIITPASS) 2) HIIT with active <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> between four bouts (HIITACT) 3) HIITACT with four HIIT bouts replaced with passive periods (REC). Deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb) in the vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius (GN) muscles and the pre-frontal cortex (FH), oxygen consumption (VO 2), power output and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously during the three conditions. Results: There was {{a significant increase in}} HHb at VL during bouts 2 (p = 0. 017), 3 (p = 0. 035) and 4 (p = 0. 035) in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS. Mean power output was significantly lower in HIITACT, compared to HIITPASS (p < 0. 001). There was {{a significant main effect for}} site in both HIITPASS (p = 0. 029) and HIITACT (p = 0. 005). There were no significant differences in VO 2 and HR between HIITPASS and HIITACT. Conclusions: The increase in HHb at VL and the lower mean power output during HIITACT could indicate that a higher level of deoxygenation contributes to decreased mechanical power in sedentary participants. The significant differences in HHb between sites indicates the specificity of oxygen utilisation...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the <b>recovery</b> <b>period.</b> This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E

Therefore, as stated by Poole and Jones [12], recovery time between phases does not appear to be critical, although shorter periods may be more time-efficient. Notwithstanding, it is still necessary to experimentally confirm this in older adults and clinical populations. In addition, research investigating the relationship between the recovery of certain physiological responses (e.g. phosphocreatine and metabolic acidosis), the time between incremental test and verification phase and the V̇O 2 max achieved during the verification phase is also warranted.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} applied an individualised {{approach}} to repeated sprint exercise (RSE), whereby participants {{are given the}} freedom to self-determine inter-interval <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> based on individual perceptions of recovery (Glaister et al, 2010; Phillips et al, 2014). These {{studies have suggested that}} such an approach may be a useful alternative to RSE with the aim of maintaining sprint performance. However, these studies have been conducted exclusively on adults, with no research conducted in young athletes. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate the influence of using self-selected <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> with the aim of maintaining sprint time on performance and the physiological responses to repeated sprint exercise (RSE) in elite youth association football players. A second aim of the thesis was to assess the influence of maturation on the ability to self-determine recovery intervals between sprints. Chapter three assessed performance during a 10 x 30 m sprint task with a 30 -second standardised <b>recovery</b> (SR) <b>period,</b> using self-selected <b>recovery</b> with no external cue (NEC), and facilitated by the use of a perceived readiness (PR) scale to assist with self-guidance of recovery intervals, whilst also examining differences in performance and recovery duration between more and less mature players. Twenty-eight elite youth association football players (aged 13 ± 0. 9 years) were recruited for the study, with participants split into a more mature (aged 14 ± 0. 5 years) and less mature group (aged 13 ± 0. 9 years) based on stage of growth in relation to peak-height-velocity. The results demonstrated that participants displayed a tendency to underestimate the recovery time required to maintain performance during the NEC and PR trials, resulting in impaired performance when compared with the SR trial, in which recovery intervals were significantly longer and performance was better maintained. Despite exhibiting less fatigue when SR periods were used, less mature participants displayed an impaired ability to guide recovery intervals with NEC, as displayed by the moderately higher sprint decrement compared with the more mature group. Chapter four evaluated the physiological, neuromuscular and perceptual responses to RSE with self-guided (SG) <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> compared with a 30 -second standardised <b>recovery</b> (SR) <b>period</b> in 11 participants (aged 13 ± 0. 9 years). This study suggests that using SG recovery induces a significantly higher physiological and metabolic stress on participants, with significantly higher post-exercise blood lactate values and moderately higher average HR values compared with the SR trial, likely due to the significantly shorter <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> used. These studies provide novel insight into the influence of using self-selected <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> on performance and the physiological response to RSE in young athletes...|$|R
