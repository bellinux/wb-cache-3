500|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), which <b>relaxed</b> <b>certain</b> <b>controls</b> in the Gun Control Act and {{permitted}} licensed firearm dealers to conduct business at gun shows. Specifically, FOPA made it legal for FFL holders to make private sales, provided the firearm {{was transferred to}} the licensee's personal collection at least one year prior to the sale. Hence, when a personal firearm is sold by an FFL holder, no background check or Form 4473 is required by federal law. According to the ATF, FFL holders are required to keep a record of such sales in a bound book. The United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) said the stated purpose of FOPA was to ensure the GCA did not [...] "place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens, but it opened many loopholes through which illegal gun traffickers can slip." [...] The scope of those who [...] "engage in the business" [...] of dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to have a license) was narrowed to include only those who devote [...] "time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms." [...] FOPA excluded those who buy and sell firearms to [...] "enhance a personal collection" [...] or for a [...] "hobby," [...] or who [...] "sell all or part of a personal collection." [...] According to the USDOJ, this new definition made {{it difficult for them to}} identify offenders who could claim they were operating as [...] "hobbyists" [...] trading firearms from their personal collection. Efforts to reverse a key feature of FOPA by requiring criminal background checks and purchase records on private sales at gun shows were unsuccessful.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} simple new {{approach}} to EMbased microwave modeling and design. It is a special case of a novel concept we call Implicit Space Mapping. We propose to calibrate a suitable coarse model against a fine model (full wave EM simulation) by <b>relaxing</b> <b>certain</b> coarse model preassigned parameters. Our algorithm updates these preassigned parameters through parameter extraction, reoptimizes the coarse model to suggest a new EM design and terminates when relevant stopping criteria are satisfied. We illustrate our approach through an HTS filter example. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{singularity}} {{arising from}} the violation of the Lipschitz condition in the simple Newtonian system proposed recently by Norton (2003) is so fragile as to be completely and irreparably destroyed by slightly <b>relaxing</b> <b>certain</b> (infinite) idealizations pertaining to elastic phenomena in this model. I demonstrate that this is also true for several other Lipschitz-indeterministic systems, which, unlike Norton's example, have no surface curvature singularities. As a result, indeterminism in these systems should rather {{be viewed as an}} artefact of certain infinite idealizations essential for these models, depriving them of much of their intended metaphysical import...|$|R

An HMM can loosely be understood as a CRF with very specific feature functions that use constant probabilities to model state transitions and emissions. Conversely, a CRF can loosely be understood as a generalization of an HMM that makes the constant transition probabilities into arbitrary functions that vary across the positions in the sequence of hidden states, depending on the input sequence.|$|R

In this paper, we show that Marotto's theorem is indeed correct for analyzing the existence of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke even after <b>relaxing</b> <b>certain</b> assumptions in the proof.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} learning to parse sentences to lambda-calculus representations of their underlying semantics and present an algorithm that learns a weighted combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). A key idea is to introduce non-standard CCG combinators that <b>relax</b> <b>certain</b> parts of the grammar—for example allowing flexible word order, or insertion of lexical items— with learned costs. We also present a new, online algorithm for inducing a weighted CCG. Results for the approach on ATIS data show 86 % F-measure in recovering fully correct semantic analyses and 95. 9 % F-measure by a partial-match criterion, a more than 5 % improvement over the 90. 3 % partial-match figure reported by He and Young (2006) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} Generalized Snapshot Isolation (GSI) has been {{recently}} proposed as a suitable extension of conventional Snapshot Isolation (SI) for replicated databases. In GSI, transactions may use older snapshots {{instead of the}} latest snapshot required in SI, being able to provide better performance without significantly increasing the abortion rate when write/write conflicts among transactions are low. We study and formally proof a sufficient condition that replication protocols with SI replicas following the deferred update technique must obey to achieve GSI. They must provide global atomicity and commit update transactions in the very same order at all sites. However, as this is a sufficient condition, {{it is possible to}} obtain GSI by <b>relaxing</b> <b>certain</b> assumptions about the commit ordering of certain update transactions. ...|$|R
