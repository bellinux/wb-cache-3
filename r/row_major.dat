Search-oriented file systems, where data and metadata are indexed for fast search, are increasingly viewed as a necessity, everywhere from desktops to HPC. However, current techniques have been designed and tested for file system metadata, such as POSIX metadata, and fail {{to account for the}} wide variety of metadata users would like to search. In particular, the scientific world has been vocal about a desire to search extended and content metadata. While file system metadata is well characterized by a variety of workload studies, scientific metadata is much less well understood. We characterize scientific metadata, in order to better understand the implications for index design. We demonstrate that previously suggested index structures, such as k-d trees, R-trees, and <b>row</b> <b>major</b> databases, are not well suited to scientific metadata. Finally, we provide suggestions for a system design based on our findings. ...|$|E

The problem has applications in divide-and-conquer algorithms and to "packing" problems. Keywords: Mesh-connected computer, Sorting, Zero-one, Packing 1. Introduction A common situation that arises in divide-and-conquer style algorithms is: having decided which input items belong to which subproblems the items must be rearranged to bring all the items relating to a given subproblem together (e. g., pivoting in quicksort).

40|$|Memory access consumes a {{significant}} amount of energy in data transfer intensive applications. The selection of a memory location from a CMOS memory cell array involves driving row and column select lines. A switching event on a row select line often consumes significantly more energy in comparison to a switching event on a column select line. In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel data layout method that aims to minimize row switching activity by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of minimum row switching data layout has been formulated as a multi-way mesh partitioning problem. The constraints imposed on the problem formulation ensure that the complexity of the address generator required to implement the optimized data layout is bounded and that the data layout optimization can be applied to all address generator synthesis methods. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce row transition counts over <b>row</b> <b>major</b> data layout. 1...|$|E

40|$|For {{high-level}} programming languages, {{linear array}} layout (e. g., column major and <b>row</b> <b>major</b> orders) have de facto been the sole form of mapping array elements to memory. The increasingly deep and complex memory hierarchies present in current computer systems expose several deficiencies of linear array layouts. One such deficiency is that linear array layouts strongly favor locality in one index dimension of multidimensional arrays. Secondly, the exact mapping of array elements to cache locations {{depend on the}} array's size, which effectively renders linear array layouts non-analyzable with respect to cache behavior. We present and evaluate an alternative, semihierarchical, array layout which differs from linear array layouts by being neutral with respect to locality in different index dimensions and by enabling accurate and precise analysis of cache behaviors at compile-time. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed layout may exhibit vastly improved TLB behavior, leading to clearly measurable improvements in execution time, despite a lack of suitable hardware support for address computations. Cache behavior is formalized in terms of conflict vectors, and it is shown how to compute such conflict vectors at compile-time...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a fragile}} {{watermarking}} technique using Legendre transform (LT) {{has been proposed}} for color image authentication (LTCIA). An initial pixel adjustment is used {{to ensure that it}} never exceeds the range of a valid pixel component. The Legendre transform (LT) is applied on each pair of pixel components of the carrier image in <b>row</b> <b>major</b> order. The transformed components of each transformed pair are used to fabricate one/two/three watermark bits starting from the first bit position (LSB- 1) based on the perceptibility of human eye on red, green and blue channel. An adjustment method has been incorporated to keep the embedded transformed components closer to the original without hampering the fabricated watermark bits. The inverse Legendre transform (ILT) is applied on each adjusted pair as post embedding operation to re-generate the watermarked image in spatial domain. At the receiving end the whole watermark can be extracted based on the reverse procedure thus authentication is done through message digest.

40|$|Data {{transfer}} intensive applications {{consume a}} significant amount of energy in memory access. The selection of a memory location from a memory array involves driving row and column select lines. A signal transition on a row select line often consumes significantly more energy than a transition on a column select line. In order to exploit this difference in energy consumption of row and column select lines, we propose a novel address assignment methodology that aims to minimize high energy row transitions by assigning spatially and temporally local data items to the same row. The problem of energy efficient address assignment has been formulated as a multi-way graph partitioning problem and solved with a heuristic. Our experiments demonstrate that our methodology achieves row transition counts very close to the optimum and that the methodology can, for some examples, reduce row transition count by 40 - 70 % over <b>row</b> <b>major</b> mapping.
