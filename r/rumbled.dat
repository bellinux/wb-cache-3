5|$|Arguments <b>rumbled</b> on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} the Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived outside the village of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach <b>rumbled</b> into the village, {{although}} the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, {{and in the end}} the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. Settling for the night, they prepared to engage the next day.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake <b>rumbled</b> through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E

However, it appeared that shoulder <b>rumble</b> strips do not further reduce head-on+sideswipe-opposite-direction crashes than applying centerline <b>rumble</b> strips in isolation.|$|R

25|$|A year later, the Grand Prix was {{a race of}} {{controversy}} which <b>rumbled</b> on {{for most of the}} season; Hill was barely ahead of Schumacher on the grid and on the green flag lap the young German sprinted ahead of the Englishmen which is not allowed under the rules, cars being required to maintain station during the green flag lap. The race authorities informed Benetton that their man had been penalised 5sec for his transgression but they did not realise that it was a stop/go penalty and did not call Schumacher in, so he was black-flagged; which he ignored for six laps. For failing to respond to the black flag, Schumacher was disqualified, having finished second on the road. Hill won the race at 125.609mph from Jean Alesi in the Ferrari and Mika Häkkinen (McLaren).|$|E

He sought to intervene in the Chilean Civil War in February 1891 by arranging a peace agreement between the forces of President José Manuel Balmaceda and those of the National Congress of Chile who opposed the President. Unfortunately Hotham was shot at while going ashore, no agreement was signed and the Civil War <b>rumbled</b> on until August 1892 when a much larger international peace-keeping force arrived to restore order.

After a kickoff, Atlanta started their next drive at the 22-yard line. After two incompletions, on third down, Ryan was intercepted by Sabby Piscitelli, who returned {{the ball to the}} 17-yard line. Matt Bryant capped off the turnover with a field goal, and a 17–0 lead. Atlanta finally got onto the scoreboard with 12 seconds remaining in the half, with a Jason Elam field goal.|$|E

25|$|Inevitable {{tensions}} arose, however, as {{the players}} were receiving only a 30 shillings ($3) per week, yet were training to a professional standard. Adding to the players' dissatisfaction was the increased money coming into the game – Carlton's revenue had doubled {{since the time of}} Worrall's appointment. Worrall's sometimes brusque approach to dealing with individuals and his puritanical attitude to alcohol and other distractions didn't help the situation. Early in 1909, Carlton's players revolted over money and Worrall's disciplinary demands, and some refused to take the field in the opening round. The matter <b>rumbled</b> on for a number of weeks, {{with a small group of}} players insisting on Worrall's resignation, which was duly given mid-season. He continued on as secretary, but resigned that position at the end of the season when the disharmony was still not repaired.

25|$|Arkansas {{scored on}} its first drive when running back Knile Davis took the ball in from six yards out. The Hogs also scored on their next possession, a Broderick Green run over right guard for a touchdown. On the ensuing possession, EMU quarterback Kyle McMahon was intercepted by Freddie Burton, who {{returned}} the ball 50 yards for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Ryan Mallett would find Joe Adams on a ten-yard crossing pattern for a score. Following a missed Alex Tejada field goal, Patrick Treppa would punt for EMU, leaving the Razorbacks with the ball on their own one-yard line. However, on the next play, Broderick Green broke through the line and <b>rumbled</b> 99 yards for a touchdown. The score was the longest play in Arkansas Razorbacks history, longer than the previous record of 90 yards set by Billy Moore against Tulsa back in 1962. Following another EMU punt, Mallet would find Adams for a 78-yard touchdown pass, giving the Hogs a 42-0 lead as the teams went to halftime. The Razorback defense did not allow EMU a single first down in the first half.|$|E
25|$|This joy was {{short-lived}} {{as a major}} dispute broke out in 2005 between the West Indian Players Association (WIPA) and the Cricket Board. The point of contention was clause 5 of the tour contract which gave WICB the sole and exclusive right to arrange for sponsorship, advertising, licensing, merchandising and promotional activities relating to WICB or any WICB Team. Digicel were the sponsors of the West Indian Team, {{while most of the}} players had contracts with Cable & Wireless. This conflict, coupled with a payment dispute meant that the West Indies initially announced a team absent Lara {{and a number of other}} leading West Indians for South Africa's visit in 2004–05, leading to Shivnarine Chanderpaul becoming captain. Some of these players did, in the end, compete. However, the dispute had not been resolved and <b>rumbled</b> on, leading to a second-string side being named for the tour of Sri Lanka in 2005. A resolution did not arise until October 2005, when a full-strength side was finally named for the 2005–06 tour of Australia. It was on this tour that Brian Lara overtook Australian Allan Border as the highest run-scorer in Test match cricket, despite the West Indies losing the series 3–0.|$|E

25|$|Sherrard's {{touchdown}} {{made the}} score 21-10 going into halftime, {{and it turned}} out to be the final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers 15-yard three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance to get back in the game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who <b>rumbled</b> 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E
