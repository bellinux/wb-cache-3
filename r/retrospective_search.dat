40|$|Purpose The rare {{association}} between {{breast cancer and}} pregnancy means that few oncologists gain an expertise in this area. In particular, there are few published data concerning the use of chemotherapy for breast cancer during pregnancy. In this retrospective case series, we describe the experiences of five hospitals in London, United Kingdom, and how they manage this condition. Patients and Methods <b>Retrospective</b> <b>searches</b> were performed at five London hospitals {{in order to identify}} women who received chemotherapy for breast cancer while pregnant. Results Twenty-eight women were identified who had received chemotherapy for breast cancer during pregnancy. Twenty-four women received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer, and four women received palliative chemotherapy for metastatic disease. A total of 116 cycles of chemotherapy were administered during pregnancy. Sixteen women were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 12 received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. All but one of the women were treated after the first trimester. One spontaneous abortion occurred in the woman treated during her first trimester; otherwise, there were no serious adverse consequences for the mothers or neonates. Conclusion These data provide evidence that in terms of peripartum complications and immediate fetal outcome, chemotherapy can be safely administered to women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the problem of how structured linguistic representations interact with the architecture of human memory. Much recent work has attempted to unify real-time linguistic memory with a general content-addressable architecture (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005; McElree, 2006). Because grammatical principles and constraints are strongly relational in nature, and linguistic representation hierarchical, this kind of architecture is not well suited to restricting the search of memory to grammatically-licensed constituents alone. This dissertation investigates under what conditions real-time language comprehension is grammatically accurate. Two kinds of grammatical dependencies were examined in reading time and speeded grammaticality experiments: subject-verb agreement licensing in agreement attraction configurations ("The runners who the driver wave to [...] . "; Kimball & Aissen, 1971, Bock & Miller, 1991), and active completion of wh-dependencies. We develop a simple formal model of agreement attraction in an associative memory that makes accurate predictions across different structures. We conclude that dependencies that can only be licensed exclusively retrospectively, by searching the memory to generate candidate analyses, are the most prone to grammatical infidelity. The exception may be <b>retrospective</b> <b>searches</b> with especially strong contextual restrictions, as in reflexive anaphora. However dependencies that can be licensed principally by a prospective search, like wh-dependencies or backwards anaphora, are highly grammatically accurate...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{productivity}} (both economic and otherwise) of trainees within a radiology department at our institution. Materials and methods: Productivity {{was measured in}} three ways: (1) independent workload contribution, (2) impact on on-call services, and (3) impact on day-to-day practice as perceived by consultant radiologists. Data were collected using <b>retrospective</b> <b>searches</b> on computerized radiology information system (CRIS), analysis of trainees and consultant rotas, and a questionnaire to consultants and trainees. Where possible, productivity was quantified in terms of number of programmed activities (PAs). Results: The contribution of independent work by trainees in a single week was 52. 75 PAs (or 1. 45 PAs per trainee per week). In addition, the on-call contribution was 23. 1 PAs per week (or 0. 93 PAs per trainee per week). When both trainees and consultants report independently, productivity in a single list in most cases increased and can {{be as much as}} 197 %. On calculating the economic impact, this amounts to significant savings of around £ 1. 2 million per year at our institution. Conclusion: Based upon objectively measurable areas of service provision, the employment of trainees yields considerable economic benefit. Furthermore, based upon qualitative methods we have shown that trainees contribute positively in those areas, which are much harder to quantifiably evaluate. These are benefits in addition to fundamental requirement to train future competent radiologists. © 2011 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
