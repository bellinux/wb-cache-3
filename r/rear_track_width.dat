40|$|Advances in {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) {{research}} are dependent on quality animal models, which in turn rely on sensitive outcome measures able to detect functional differences in animals following injury. To date, most measurements of dysfunction following SCI rely either on the subjective rating of observers or the slow throughput of manual gait assessment. The present study compares the gait of normal and contusion-injured mice using the TreadScan system. TreadScan utilizes a transparent treadmill belt and a high-speed camera to capture the footprints of animals and automatically analyze gait characteristics. Adult female C 57 Bl/ 6 mice {{were introduced to the}} treadmill prior to receiving either a standardized mild, moderate, or sham contusion {{spinal cord injury}}. TreadScan gait analyses were performed weekly for 10 weeks and compared with scores on the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS). Results indicate that this software successfully differentiates sham animals from injured animals on a number of gait characteristics, including hindlimb swing time, stride length, toe spread, and track width. Differences were found between mild and moderate contusion injuries, indicating a high degree of sensitivity within the system. <b>Rear</b> <b>track</b> <b>width,</b> a measure of the animal's hindlimb base of support, correlated strongly both with spared white matter percentage and with terminal BMS. TreadScan allows for an objective and rapid behavioral assessment of locomotor function following mild-moderate contusive SCI, where the majority of mice still exhibit hindlimb weight support and plantar paw placement during stepping...|$|E

Three <b>track</b> <b>width</b> settings namely 140, 160, 180 cm and two working depths, shallow and deep were used to evaluate their effects on the engine fuel consumption, rear wheel slip, available drawbar power and the tractive power efficiency, using a mounted disc plough or trailed offset disc harrow.

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThis master thesis {{concerns}} {{the design and}} analysis of the suspension for the Formula Student Team UiS racing car for the Formula Student 2013 student competition. To analyze how parameters such as <b>track</b> <b>width,</b> wheelbase, weight distribution, CoG height and total weight affected the overall performance a virtual racetrack was constructed. Calculations were then done to find the cars lap time as the various parameters were altered. Results showed that reduced weight and CoG height and increased <b>track</b> <b>width</b> and wheelbase all improved the performance of the car. The analysis do not incorporate the necessary weight increase to increase <b>track</b> <b>width</b> and wheelbase, thus, further calculations are needed to determine the full effect of changing these parameters. Nevertheless the <b>rear</b> <b>track</b> was increased from 1188 mm to 1240 mm to improve cornering ability. The analysis revealed an increase in performance with increased rearwards weight distribution as high as 70 / 30 rear/front. This weight distribution causes the cornering ability to deteriorate but gave sufficient improvement for acceleration and braking to reduce the total lap time. The car was still designed with a 50 / 50 weight distribution due to all the complicating effects of reduced cornering ability such as over/understeer but this is a recommended area for further analysis. Bump stiffness was designed based on required ground clearance during maximum acceleration. Since the <b>track</b> <b>width</b> is smaller than the wheelbase the car is inherently softer during lateral acceleration as opposed to longitudinal (e. g. braking) but the use of ARBs effectively increased the lateral stiffness (i. e. roll stiffness) without too much increase in bump stiffness. The use of adjustable ARBs also allows the roll stiffness and the sprung weight transfer distribution to be adjusted. The suspension geometry was designed to minimize scrub and jacking while having good camber gain and roll center height. The camber gain front and rear is 0. 0369 °/mm and 0. 0426 °/mm respectively corresponding to a camber loss fraction of 0. 58 and 0. 54 respectively. The roll center front and rear is 58. 3 mm and 61 mm above the ground respectively. This height ensures that jacking and scrub are kept low while there is a large roll moment giving a large amount of sprung weight transfer which can be distributed between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>track</b> depending on chosen ARB stiffness’s...|$|R

5000|$|Tape {{speed is}} not the only factor {{affecting}} the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include <b>track</b> <b>width,</b> tape formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability (wow-and-flutter), head gap size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design—how well and precisely it can be aligned) electro-mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The <b>track</b> <b>width</b> of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N not to be a factor), the other being tape speed.
