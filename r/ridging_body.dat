40|$|Freeform feature fitting is a {{technique}} underlying different applications, including reverse engineering, object recognition and conceptual shape design. The latter application poses specific requirements to the fitting technique with regard to speed, robustness and interactivity. On the other hand, the spatial accuracy and {{the density of the}} input data can be permitted to be relatively low. We have performed freeform feature fitting to physical shapes using both a high-density mechanical scanning device and a low-cost desktop laser scanner. The performance of these technologies have been compared. The fitting technique is based on direct template matching, where a template is a 3 D shape feature under control of 6 placement parameters (defining the <b>ridged</b> <b>body</b> transformation) and a number of intrinsic form parameters. We found that template matching remained reliable even for sparse and partly missing data. A low-cost, high-speed scanner can hence function as a 3 D digital shape copier and be a supportive tool for conceptual product design. Limitations and extension of the technology are addressed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{simulate}} the basic two-dimensional dynamics of swarming E. coli bacteria {{on the surface}} of a moderately soft agar plate. Individual bacteria are modelled by self-propelled <b>ridged</b> <b>bodies</b> (agents), which interact with each other only through inelastic collision and with the highly viscous environment through damping forces. The motion of single agents is modelled closely corresponding to the behaviour of swimming bacteria. The dynamics of the model were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements of swimming E. coli K 12. Accordingly, simulations with loosely packed agents (p= 0) show typical run-and-tumble statistics. In contrast, simulations with densely packed agents (p= 0. 3 - 0. 7) are dominated by interactions (collisions) between agents which lead to the emergence of swarming behaviour. In addition, we model the motion of single agents on the base of modified run-and-tumble dynamics, where the bacteria do not turn actively during the tumble. We show that simulations with densely packed modified agents lead as well the emergence of swarming behaviour, if rotational diffusion is considered. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the ocean}} sunfishes (Molidae) has a complicated history. Currently, three genera and four species are recognized, including two in the genus Mola (M. mola and M. ramsayi). In 2009, a genetic study revealed a potential third species, Mola species C, in Southeast Australian waters. Concentrating on this region, we obtained samples and morphological data from 27 Mola sp. C specimens, genetically confirmed {{the existence of this}} species (mtDNA D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase 1), and established its morphology across a size spectrum of 50 – 242 cm total length. Mola sp. C is diagnosed by clavus meristics [15 – 17 fin rays (13 – 15 principal, 2 minor), 5 – 7 ossicles, paraxial ossicles separate], clavus morphology (prominent smooth band back-fold, rounded clavus edge with an indent), and body scale morphology (raised conical midpoints, non-branching). This species does not develop a protruding snout, or swollen dorso- or ventrolateral <b>ridges.</b> <b>Body</b> proportions remain similar with growth. A review of the historic literature revealed that Mola sp. C is a new, hitherto undescribed species, M. tecta, which we describe and diagnose, and that it is the first proposed addition to the genus Mola in 125 years. Its core distribution is likely in the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} cross-shore and longshore seasonal intertidal beach dynamics along the macro-tidal beach of Cleveleys (UK). The studied beach is characterised {{by the presence}} of shore-parallel runnel (channels) and <b>ridges</b> (tabular <b>bodies),</b> and intersecting drainage channels. Argus video images and in-situ field measurements have been used in order to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of the complex and dynamic runnel-ridge system. In the short-term, the impact of a major storm has been analysed and correlated to the changes in intertidal bathymetry. The long-term ridge position has been determined using the Argus image contouring technique and existing beach surveys since 1991. It has been demonstrated that the frequent cross-shore ridge migration mainly occurs during high energy conditions and is governed by surf zone processes. The longshore ridges' migration occurs at larger time scales and is associated with the dynamics of intersecting or mini rip channels. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
