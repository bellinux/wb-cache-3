Pressure-mediated ELISA (PELISA), carried out in 1 h shows more than a 2 -fold increase in absorbance value than the control experiment carried out {{at the same time and}} temperature without applying pressure. Estimation of analyte by the 1 -h PELISA method gives similar absorbance value to that obtained by 3 -h heat-mediated ELISA (HELISA) on an activated surface. As PELISA is sensitive, specific, and reproducible, it could be an excellent alternative to HELISA or conventional ELISA procedure. ### Introduction The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique is the back-bone of the diagnostic assay for detection of infectious and allergic diseases. Conventional ELISA is a time-consuming 18 h procedure. Earlier, we have shown that photoactivated microtiter plate (1) can reduce ELISA timing to around 7. 5 hours by binding an antigen or antibody by covalent bond rather than adsorption (2). We have further shortened the ELISA timings to around 3 h by doing it at higher incubation temperature on an activated polystyrene microtiter plate with results comparable to conventional ELISA carried out in 18 h (3). In this protocol, we reported a novel and rapid method for ELISA technique in which ELISA steps are carried out in one hour under pressure (4). ### Materials 1. 1 -fluoro- 2 -nitro- 4 -azidobenzene (FNAB, IUPAC nomenclature: 4 -azido- 1 -fluoro- 2 -nitrobenzene) can be purchased from Apollo scientific ltd, UK (cat no. 248 - 878 - 6). Alternatively, it can be made from 4 -fluoro- 3 -nitroaniline by a simple diazotization reaction as described earlier (1, 5) CAUTION. FNAB is explosive and should be handled with care, especially when using large quantities. We did not encounter any untoward incident while working with FNAB in last 12 years. - Polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany). - Anti-human IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 3382) CAUTION Store all reagents at 2 - 8 ºC. If slight turbidity occurs upon prolonged storage clarify the solution by centrifugation before use. - Human IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 4506). - Anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. A 8419). - Rabbit IgG, (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. I 4508) - Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Sigma (USA). CRITICAL BSA solution should be filtered prior to use to avoid microbial contamination. - o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), (Sigma Aldrich, USA cat. no. P 1526). Store in cool place. Recommended storage temperature: - 20 °C; Keep container tightly closed. CAUTION Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid formation of dust and aerosols. - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was prepared by mixing 0. 85 % Sodium chloride to 0. 01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7. 2). To make 0. 01 M phosphate buffer add 1. 217 g disodium phosphate, 0. 379 g monosodium phosphate. Add distilled water to make 1 liter solution. - Washing buffer was made by adding 0. 1 % Tween 20 to PBS. - Substrate -dye buffer was prepared by mixing 12 ml of citrate buffer (0. 025 M citric acid and 0. 05 M sodium phosphate dibasic, pH 5), 5 µl of hydrogen peroxide (30 % w/v), and 4 mg of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. - Stop Solution- 5 % sulphuric acid ### Equipment 1. Refrigerator (Godrej, India) - UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, USA) - Polystyrene microtiter plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany) - ELISA reader (Biorad iMark™ Microplate Reader, USA). - Pressure cooker (Hawkins Cookers Ltd., Mumbai, India). - 1 -m pressure tube made of natural rubber having i. d. 6 mm and o. d. 16 mm (Local supplier, Delhi, India) - Pressure gauge (Laser Gasses India, New Delhi, India) - Laboratory cylinder filled with argon gas (Laser Gasses India, New Delhi, India) ### Procedure 1. Activation of polystyrene surface The wells of a polystyrene plate were activated by coating with FNAB followed by photoactivation by UV light for 15 min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described (1). - CRITICAL We have decreased UV exposure time for activation of microtiter plate from 20 minutes to 15 minutes without any significant difference in results. 2. Designing of a pressure incubator Pressure incubator was designed from a 5 -L pressure cooker (Domestic kitchen pressure cooker, Hawkins Cookers Ltd., Mumbai, India). The pressure <b>regulator</b> (<b>vent</b> weight) from the lid was removed and one end of a 1 -m pressure tube (or laboratory high vacuum tube) was inserted through the vent pipe of the pressure cooker; the other end of the tube was connected to a three-way connector. One of the outlays of the connector is connected to a pressure gauge through a rubber tube and further connected to a laboratory argon cylinder. Third outlay of the connector was used for release of excess pressure and also release of pressure after each ELISA step. All PELISA steps were carried out inside the pressure incubator. 3. Detection of analyte - PELISA steps in the pressure incubator In the activated and untreated wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate capture molecule (anti-human IgG) was added and the plate was kept inside the pressure incubator. The pressure cooker was closed and a pressure of 1. 5 × 105 Pa was applied by opening the gas cylinder. In this pressure the plate was kept for 10 minutes after which the pressure was released. During this time capture molecule was immobilized in the activated and untreated wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate. After wshing, blocking was carried out similarly by applying pressure of 1. 5 × 105 Pa for 10 minutes. After the stipulated time period, the pressure was released and the plate was washed by washing buffer. Binding of analyte was carried out by adding the analyte to the wells and incubating the plate inside the pressure incubator 20 minutes by applying pressure of 2 × 105 Pa. Binding of secondary antibody-conjugate was also carried out similarly by applying pressure of 2 × 105 Pa for 20 minutes. After all the four ELISA steps were carried out inside the pressure incubator, the color development was done by adding 100 µl of substrate- dye buffer at room temperature outside pressure cooker. Color development was stopped by adding 20 µl of 5 % sulfuric acid and absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. - CRITICAL - CAUTION Pressure must be carefully monitored. Excess pressure may lead to explosion. Applying and release of pressure should be slow/ gradual and should not be abrupt. ### Timing 1. Activation of polystyrene surface –approx. 25 minutes - a) Coating of FNAB to polystyrene surface 5 - 10 minutes - b) UV light exposure- 15 minutes - c) Washing and drying – 5 minutes - Detection of Analyte – 1 hour + washing time after each step - a.) Immobilization of capture molecule (0. 25 μg/ 100 μL 0. 01 M carbonate buffer, pH 9. 6 /well) onto the photoactivated surface- 10 minutes by applying pressure of 150000 Pa (0. 15 megapascals) - b.) Blocking (200 µl/ well of 2 % BSA) - 10 minutes by applying pressure of 150000 Pa (0. 15 megapascals) - c.) Incubation of analyte (0. 25 μg/ 100 μL 0. 01 M PBS, pH 7. 2 /well) - 20 minutes by applying pressure of 200000 Pa (0. 20 megapascals) - d.) Incubation time of secondary antibody – enzyme conjugate (100 μLof 1 : 5000 v/v dilution /well) – 20 minutes by applying pressure of 200000 Pa (0. 20 megapascals). ### Anticipated Results - Pressure-mediated ELISA showed 2 - 3 -fold increase in absorbance value than control experiment carried out in the same time and temperature without applying pressure (fig 1). - PELISA is as good as 18 -h conventional ELISA or 3 -h HELISA. - PELISA is found to reduce assay time to 1 h without affecting specificity or sensi-tivity and could be a good substitute for immunoassay procedures widely used in clinical and research laboratories. ### References 1.

40|$|After {{the annual}} {{maintenance}} period {{and during the}} refilling of the canal downstream of a regulator the tail water depth of this canal is small and not sufficient to produce a hydraulic jump inside the solid apron. This results in a severe local scour problem for the canal bed. A traditional solution of this problem is to place crushed rock in the scour hole to prevent further scour; however, this method has not {{proved to be a}} permanent solution. To investigate this local scour problem a physical model for a one <b>vent</b> <b>regulator</b> was constructed and a non-uniform granular material was used to simulate the canal bed. This experimental studies revealed that there are five distinct flow regimes in the region of the scour hole, namely: (1) a jet attached to the bed, (2) breaking wave and adverse hydraulic jump, (3) a travelling hydraulic jump, (4) wave jump and diving jet, and (5) surface jet with entrainment from below. The initial tests produced an asymmetrical scour hole; however, a midstream flow divider or vane, made the scour hole more symmetrical. Two depressions were observed inside most of the symmetrical scour holes. It was found that the scour hole that forms immediately after the apron, which {{is referred to as the}} short-term scour, reaches an equilibrium depth within a few minutes of the start of flow while the scour hole formed farther from the apron (long-term scour) continues to increase, at a decreasing rate for several days. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is caused mainly by the attached jet while the short-term scour in a trapezoidal channel is produced by the jet attachment and the drilling effect of the vertical vortices caused by the sudden enlargement at the end of the control structure. The short-term scour in a rectangular channel is found to be a function of the initial Froude number, the initial jet depth and the particle size. The long-term scour depth is caused by the wave jet or diving jet as well as the surface jet; the scour depth was found to be a function of time, densimetric Froude number, initial jet depth and particle size. The changes in the surficial size distribution and settling velocity were determined for short-term and long-term scour at various locations within and downstream of the scour hole. The Gumbel distribution yields a good fit to both fall diameter and mass based equivalent diameter particle frequency distribution. As the scour hole develops, the D 50 decreases as does the ratio D 90 /D 10. An unsteady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole pattern and duration of phase 1 (attached jet). This model verified the rapid development of the short-term scour depth and reflected the observed effects of head, flow, and grain size. A steady state short-term scour model was developed to predict the scour hole dimensions immediately downstream of the apron. This model confirmed that the short-term scour depth is mainly a function of the initial Froude number, and initial jet depth, although it was found to be weakly dependent on the particle size. A theoretical consideration for the maximum long-term scour depth supports the concept that this depth is dependent on the densimetric Froude number, the jet expansion characteristics and the Shields constant.
