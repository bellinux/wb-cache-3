40|$|<b>Reduction</b> <b>clearing</b> is {{commonly}} carried {{out as an}} after-treatment to remove deposits of disperse dye and other residual impurities {{from the surface of}} dyed polyester. The research described in this thesis establishes the positive effect of conventional <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing</b> using aqueous sodium dithionite under alkaline conditions on the colour and fastness properties of polyester dyed with a series of selected commercial disperse dyes at a range of depths of shade. Because of certain environmental, technological and economic disadvantages associated with traditional <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing,</b> there is industrial interest in alternative processes. This research also describes a study of some alternative approaches to clearing by means of the development of an understanding of the principles of clearing and its effect on the properties of polyester dyed with disperse dyes. The study involved the use of three organic reducing agents, formamidine sulphinic acid (thioureadioxide), hydroxyacetone and glucose, and also a previously-reported method using a simple detergent wash-off procedure. Besides the organic reducing agents, this study presents investigations concerning the use of enzymes and electrochemical methods in the <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing</b> of polyester. The relative merits of the alternative processes, in terms of the efficiency of surface dye removal, the effect on fastness and colour properties, the biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand of the residual treatment liquors are discussed. The redox potential values of the reducing agents under application conditions have also been compared. The results throughout correlate closely with the efficiency of surface dye removal as assessed by acetone extraction of the dyed samples. Scanning electron microscopic investigations of dyed samples before and after <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing</b> are qualitatively consistent with the observations. The outcome of the clearing process varies with the particular dye used. Explanations have been suggested based on mechanisms proposed for the clearing processes in relation to specific characteristics of the molecular structures of the dyes...|$|E

The wastewater obtained from the bead wash-off of disperse dyes contained considerably lower concentrations of chloride ion as well as lower TDS compared to that secured using a conventional <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing</b> process, which was attributed to the beads having adsorbed vagrant chloride ions. In contrast, bead wash-off of reactive dyes did not reduce either the chloride ion concentration nor TDS content of the wastewater produced, because of the swamping effect of the very high chloride ion concentration.

For this purpose, cationic dyeable polyester and cotton blended fabrics were dyed as traditional technique based on formulations approach and the colour strength (K/S), dye uptake (%) and the whiteness index properties were evaluated. The results of color strength indicated that dye was more uniformly absorbed by the blended fabric compared to the untreated fabric. In addition, when untreated fabric was dyed {{in the presence of}} a leveling agent (Lyogen DFTN), the K/S and levelness of dye uptake (%) values were enhanced.

40|$|The {{biological}} efficacy as {{judged by}} mortality against Anopheles gambiae s. s. of three net samples, one white and two colored, treated with deltamethrin by conventional dipping was compared. Efficacy {{as well as}} chemical analysis results showed that uptake of insecticide by white net material was much higher than by colored nets. After a single wash, efficacy of colored nets was reduced significantly below 80 % mortality, which is the minimum acceptable level for a field application. This unexpected result could be because of either low uptake of insecticide by colored fibers or high alkalinity on the fibers, resulting from the dyeing process (<b>reduction</b> <b>clearing).</b> alpha-Cyanopy-rethroids, such as deltamethrin, have a low stability in alkaline conditions and rapidly degrade.

They are usually applied from a fine aqueous dispersion containing some dissolved dye. This definition changes the emphasis of that given in the Colour Index (I) to stress the most important fibers and to {{reflect the fact that}} it is the aqueous solution from which dyeing normally takes place, despite the 'low water solubility of the dye. Solutions are characterized by the presence of the solute (dye) as single molecules; i. e., in a monomolecular form.

The monomer for PLA is lactic acid obtained from the fermentation of sugar and vegetables like corn and cassava. This study investigated the effect of heatsetting and wet processes on the tensile properties of treated and untreated Ingeo ™ Poly (Lactic acid) PLA knitted fabrics. PLA samples of dimension 200 mm x 200 mm were subjected to heatsetting at a temperature of 130 oC and increasing times of 15 s, 30 s, 45 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s and 240 s respectively using the Werner Mathis infra-red heatsetting equipment and subsequently treated to wet processes including scouring, alkaline <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing,</b> dyeing and softening. Four tensile parameters were determined in warp and weft direction using the KES-FB system of fabric evaluation. These tensile parameters were tensile extension EM [%], linearity of load extension LT [-], tensile energy WT [g. cm/cm 2] and tensile resilience RT [%]. The results showed (i) a consistent increase in tensile extension of treated PLA (unlike untreated PLA knitted fabric) with increasing time of heatsetting and wet finishing applications suggesting that treated PLA may tend to exhibit enhanced fabric hand or softness and increased formability (ii) Treated PLA to exhibit lower LT with increasing time of heatsetting and wet treatments implying a better formability and in-plane compressibility of treated PLA when compared to untreated PLA (iii) Treated PLA to display a greater tensile energy than untreated PLA, implying that treated PLA has greater flexibility, softness, gentleness and smoothness than the untreated PL...|$|E
40|$|With the {{discovery}} of synthetic dyes all colour industries, not only textile industry had turned to the more economical, reproducible, high colour fast {{and easy to use}} synthetic dyes and abandoned the natural dyeing tradition which had prevailed as the only colouring technology till then. But recently a revival in the natural dye in technology has occurred as solutions to the environmental pollution arising out of the wet processing of textiles {{as well as to the}} growing trend of dye toxicity and all ergie s to the textile consumers. Natural dyes provide not only a good alternative to the environmental pollution arising from synthetic dyes but also provide low toxicity and allergic reactions while giving unique and fascinating colours which are not achieve able from synthetic dyes. A thorough review to the historic background of the origin and progression of natural dyeing techniques in the world with specific concern to Sri Lanka was carried out. During this review a search was also made into the reasons for the erosion of this valuable tradition of natural dyeing. Through a survey of the natural dye producing plants world over, a list of indigenous dye producing plants in Sri Lanka was preparedand investigated the possibility of using one of these plant sources to develop a new natural dye based on its extraction. In selection of this plant source the major concern was given to the fact that it should be abundant as a waste material in Sri Lanka. Black tea, which is highly available as a waste (dust) from tea factories and domestic sources (brewed tea) were used to extract polyphenols, which are an abundant form of natural compounds in tea. These were used as the coupling component to produce a zocompounds by coupling with different diazonium salts. Both polyphenols and azo compounds were separated and solidified and thus obtained azo compounds had variable colour shades depending on their respective diazonium salts. The possibility of applying these azo compounds as in-situ azo dyes on 100 % cotton and ready-madeinsoluble disperse azo dyes using HTHP conditions on 100 % polyester, 100 % nylonand 100 % wool were investigated. Different azo compounds produced different colourshades on different fabric types as well as on the same fabric type. Optimisation of dye bath conditions to improve the take up of polyphenols by cotton using the in-situ application of azo dyes was also carried out. The colours produced on cotton were not very bright and showed moderate colour fastness to washing, good colour fastness to rubbing while the brilliant colours produced on polyester showed good to very good wash, rub and sublimation fastness, after <b>reduction</b> <b>clearing.</b> The colour depth and fastness on nylon and wool were better than those on polyester. The light fastness of all the azo dyed samples was poor and should be improved using suitable after treatments. The percentage yield of polyphenols for both used and unused black tealeaves and the percentage yield of different azo compounds obtained from unused black tea leaves were calculated. The study was basically carried out with the aim of investigating the traditional dyeing techniques and indigenous dye producing plant sources in Sri Lanka and to assess the possibility of using polyphenols from one of the selected plant resources. Tea, which is abundantly available as tea waste (dust) from factories and brewed tea leaves fromdomestic sources was selected as the natural source of dye or dye intermediate for textile dyeing...|$|E
