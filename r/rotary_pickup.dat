50|$|The Violin Bass had two {{extended}} range pickups; polished neck with binding; adjustable master bridge channel; <b>rotary</b> <b>pickup</b> selector and precision machine heads, with no active electronics.|$|E
50|$|Mazda quickly rose in prominence, {{helped in}} large part to their use of Wankel engines. 1974 was the year of the rotary with the {{introduction}} of both the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Pickup</b> and RX-4. In fact, the 808 and B1600 were the only piston-engined Mazdas offered in the United States that year. 1975 had a similar lineup, minus the retired RX-2.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Rotary</b> <b>Pickup</b> (REPU) was the world's {{first and}} only Wankel-engined pickup truck. It was sold from 1974 to 1977 and appears to only have been {{available}} in the US and Canada. The Rotary-Engined Pickup (REPU) had a four-port 1.3-liter 13B four-barrel carbureted engine, flared fenders, a battery mounted under the bed, a different dash, a front grille, and round taillights.|$|E
5000|$|The B-Series was {{introduced}} to the United States with the 1972 B1600. In 1974, the similar rotary-powered <b>Rotary</b> <b>Pickup</b> was released in the US. The engine was enlarged to 1.8-liters for 1975's B1800, a model that had been available to Canadian customers since around 1970. It was known in the Japanese market as the [...] "Proceed", where it was also sold as the Ford Courier. Its strong sales in the US market—mostly with Ford badging—relieved Mazda's pressing cash flow troubles in the period following the 1970s energy crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Pickups are {{designed}} and wound in-house. While {{most of the}} pickups are humbuckers, some are actually a pair of single coils wound in opposing directions, one intended for the neck {{and one for the}} bridge position. Through the use of a unique <b>rotary</b> <b>pickup</b> selector switch, PRS pickups offer 5 different sounds: a combination of thick humbucking Gibson-like tones, and thinner single-coil Stratocaster-like tones. The standard treble and standard bass pick ups use magnetic pole pieces in the non-adjustable inner coil, and a rear-placed feeder magnet in order to achieve a more authentic single-coil tone when split by the rotary switch ...|$|E
5000|$|Hardware and {{electronic}} component differences aside, {{the configuration of}} the Fender variant was almost identical to that of the Squier, with the only notable differences being the use of a full thickness Stratocaster alder body instead of a thinner (by approximately one quarter of an inch) basswood body, and a string-through-body hardtail Stratocaster bridge instead of a top-load bridge. The '51's signature features were all retained, including the Telecaster neck and headstock style, the Stratocaster body shape, and the original Precision Bass pickguard and control plate, humbucking bridge and single coil neck pickups, as well as the <b>rotary</b> <b>pickup</b> selector, single volume control with push-pull coil-tap switch, and absent tone control.|$|E
50|$|During 1968, Mazda started formal {{operations}} in Canada (MazdaCanada) although Mazdas {{were seen in}} Canada as early as 1959. In 1970, Mazda formally entered the American market (Mazda North American Operations) and was very successful there, {{going so far as}} to create the Mazda <b>Rotary</b> <b>Pickup</b> (based on the conventional piston-powered B-Series model) solely for North American buyers. To this day, Mazda remains the only automaker to have produced a Wankel-powered pickup truck. Additionally, it is also the only marque to have ever offered a rotary-powered bus (the Mazda Parkway, offered only in Japan) or station wagon (within the RX-3 and RX-4 lines for certain markets). After nine years of development, Mazda finally launched its new model in the U.S. in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1961, the EB-3 (based on {{an earlier}} model, the EB-0)was one of the bass guitar {{equivalents}} of the popular Gibson SG. It featured a slim SG-style body, a short 30.5" [...] scale, and two pickups (a large humbucking pickup in the neck position and a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position). The electronics consisted of a four-way <b>rotary</b> <b>pickup</b> selector switch (for Series 1 basses; neck pickup with midrange notch, bridge, bridge and neck with low end rolled off neck pickup, neck pickup with choke) and volume and tone knobs for each pickup. The standard finish was cherry red (like the SG guitar models), though EB-3s were also produced in other finishes such as Polaris White, Pelham Blue, Walnut, and Ebony. By the time production ceased in 1979, a total of 14167 instruments had been built.|$|E
