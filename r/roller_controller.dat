The cables connecting the system {{are attached to the}} side of the controllers, making them difficult to grasp comfortably. Since the controllers are too small to possess numeric keypads, a single numeric keypad is present on the console itself. Any ColecoVision game that requires two keypads cannot be used. A difference in the Dina's controller wiring prevents use of Coleco's <b>Roller</b> <b>Controller</b> and Super Action Controllers and games dependent on either one.|$|E

The online WIS consists of <b>roller</b> equipment, coordination <b>controller,</b> switch controller, a number of cameras, image management system and management server. Coordination controller based on FPGA design and the LVDS interface, CAN bus interface, is connected through the line with <b>roller</b> equipment, switch <b>controller</b> {{and a number of}} camera management server. The CCD camera is connected through the line with image processing systems, and the image processing system connected with management server. Coordinated controller uses a modular design to coordinate control system operation, reduce the CPU load and improve the efficiency of paper defect detection. It is also highly integrated, and able to reduce cabling and costs, so as to raise the efficiency of the controller development, reduce staff workload and improve the working environment...|$|R

Thanks to smart metering, HEMIS provides real time and easy access to multiple physical properties including energy consumption, temperature, air quality This collected data {{is used by the}} system in order to activate predefined scenarios enabling home automation and energy saving. The system acts on the environment via actuators such as heater <b>controllers,</b> <b>roller</b> shutters on windows or doors, alarms The HEMIS consists of two layers: cognitive multiagent systems where concepts which are easily understood and used by the users, are represented by cognitive agents and a reactive layer closer to the physical world.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop and {{implement}} a microcontroller based blind and shuter controller. Shutter controllers are considered as one of the important issues for energy saving, comfortable and secure environment. Several types of controllers and stutters offered in the market today. All manufacturers are competing with each other producing a well-designed system that satisfies people’s needs and budgets. The purpose of my thesis is to design a <b>roller</b> shutter <b>controller</b> model. In the first section of my thesis I will give a brief theoretical introduction beginning with the roots of the idea of control then, I will explain the window shutters and their components. Also in this section I am going to describe the general operation of the shutters and their technology of operation. At the end of this section I describe in brief the KNX standard. After that, in the second section, I will give short description about my design, its main units and its operation. In the third section, I will describe the hardware design phases: schematics, PCB, and enclosures. Then, in the forth section I will show the MCU programming and the development board used for this purpose and its applications. The fifth section will be about the full system installation and wiring. I will start with mechanical part fixation then system wiring and how to set the UP/DOWN limits. In the last section I will present a list of all used components in the form of tables. Each component is linked to its datasheet in the References. BscElectrical Engineerin...|$|R

Vi vill skapa en fördjupad förståelse för controllerrollen och hur rollen påverkas av förväntningar från olika nivåer i företaget och controllerns {{position}} i företaget. Bakgrund Controllerrollen är under ständig förändring och det finns mycket forskning kring controllers. Det finns dock ett kunskapsgap som vi vill fylla när det gäller hur <b>controllers</b> <b>roller</b> påverkas utifrån förväntningar och {{position i}} företaget. Problemformulering Hur påverkar förväntningar och position i företaget <b>controllers</b> <b>roller</b> i ett företag? Metod Denna kvalitativa undersökning bygger på en induktiv ansats för att försöka fördjupa läsarens förståelse för området. Insamlade teorier och genomförda intervjuer tolkas genom ett hermeneutiskt synsätt. Vi har genomfört intervjuer på två stora svenska företag med sex olika controllers. Slutsats Varje controllerroll är unik och det är svårt att kategorisera controllers i bestämda fack. För varje controller som undersöks uppstår en ny kombination av controllerroller. Osäkerhet i rollen kan leda till att controllers tar hjälp av sin chef för att prioritera i sin roll. Överlag har controllers ingen formell beslutsmakt utan är indirekt aktiva i beslutsfattandet genom att ta fram beslutsunderlag, och besitter därigenom informell makt istället. <b>Controllers</b> <b>roller</b> påverkas även av ledningens tillit och graden av frihet som tilldelas controllern. Genom att controllers agerar flexibelt kan de motverka rolltvetydighet. Controllers påverkas även av var de är positionerad i företaget då de förväntas vara mest lojala mot den delen av organisationen de är anställda i.  Purpose Our {{purpose of this}} paper is to describe and explain the controllers different roles in two large companies who work with their controller function at various levels. We want to create a deeper understanding of controller roles and how the role is influenced by expectations from various levels of the company and the controller's position in the company. Background The controller role is constantly changing and there is much research on the controllers. However, there is a knowledge gap we want to fill in terms of how expectations and position in the company affects controllers roles. Research question How do expectations and position in the company affect controllers roles in a company? Methods This qualitative study is based on an inductiv approach to try to deepen the reader's understanding of the area. Collected theories and conducted interviews are interpreted by a hermeneutic approach. We conducted interviews at two large Swedish company with six different controllers. Conclusion Each controller role is unique and it is difficult to categorize the controllers in specific compartments. With every studied controller there is a new combination of controller roles. Insecurity in the role can result in controllers taking help of his boss to priority in their role. Overall, controllers have no formal power in decision making but is indirectly active in decision-making by providing decision basic data, and instead posses informal power in decision making. Controllers roles are also affected by the trust of the management and the degree of freedom controllers have been assigned. By acting flexible, controllers can work against role ambiguity. The position in the company also affects the controllers as they are expected to be most loyal to the part of the organization they are employed in. ...|$|R
30|$|Filtered and heparinized bovine blood (20  U/mL) was {{collected}} {{fresh from the}} slaughterhouse the day of testing per ASTM standards (F 1841 – 97) [27]. The gas exchange loop was modified for hemolysis testing by removing the bypass tubing parallel to the ULFED, the commercial oxygenator, the secondary reservoir, and the ULFED gas pathway components. The ULFED was evaluated in two circuits so that overall hemolysis reflected that of clinical setups. A reasonable cannula for ECCO 2 R at the target 250  mL/min of blood flow (13 Fr Avalon Elite DLC 10013; Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) and a pediatric centrifugal pump (PediMag; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) were selected for the ULFED “standard circuit”. Blood (1000  mL) was continuously recirculated for 3  h. The reservoir was submerged in a heated water bath to maintain a circuit temperature of 37 ° ±  1  °C. ULFED rotation was set to the minimum speed necessary where CO 2 removal {{did not differ significantly}} from the maximum rate achieved. The second ULFED circuit (“dialysis configuration”) evaluated performance using a hemodialysis <b>controller</b> <b>roller</b> pump (Prisma; Baxter, Deerfield, IL) and cannula. A larger bore 14 -Fr, 15 -cm dialysis cannula (AK- 22142 -F; Teleflex, Morrisville, NC) was used in the second circuit due to availability of parts recommended for the target blood flows.|$|R
