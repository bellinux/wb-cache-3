25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
500|$|After {{recovering}} from the injury, Urlacher stated, [...] "I feel more powerful. I’m running to the football, my keys {{are a lot more}} clear now, and I’m playing downhill... So I think it did help my body kind of calm down and <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. [...] " [...] During the 2010 offseason, Bears general manager Jerry Angelo bolstered the team's defense by signing free agent Julius Peppers.|$|E
6000|$|Brown smiled reassuringly. [...] "I almost think I {{could answer}} for his general abstemiousness. Still, there are {{occasions}} upon which {{even the most}} sedate of us are apt to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and wish to share our satisfaction with our friends." ...|$|E
60|$|Mordecai's grasp <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{but he was}} panting with a tearless sob.|$|R
60|$|Rafaravavy <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{and fixed}} her fine dark {{eyes on the}} youth searchingly, but said nothing.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} so modest, yet so fearless, in the youth's tone and bearing, that the Queen's brows <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b>|$|R
60|$|But Faith {{had been}} persuaded to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from this severity. They were married on the Sabbath, and the {{following}} day Content and Dudley left the valley, in quest of the distant tribe on which the scion of another stock {{was said to have}} been so violently engrafted.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me searchingly out of his keen dark eyes, but I sipped my coffee leisurely {{and seemed to be}} quite {{unconscious}} of his scrutiny. Apparently he was satisfied, for I saw the hard lines of his mouth <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and he smiled--a disagreeable smile of contemptuous triumph.|$|E
60|$|Lady St. Maurice {{left her}} with a sigh, and went downstairs. She had hoped to see the cold proud face <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at the many signs of thought in the {{preparations}} which had been made for her, and she was disappointed. She entered her sitting room thoughtfully, {{and went up to}} her husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, {{since we}} have no cause to quarrel, we may as well become friends," [...] {{continued}} Beth, her features <b>relaxing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> their set expression.|$|R
60|$|Her mouth <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> The glasses turned upon Bradley again, {{and looked}} upon him so {{steadily}} {{that he was}} able to see her gray eyes.|$|R
60|$|His {{attentive}} face <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> But I {{saw one of}} his feet, softly, quietly, incessantly {{beating on}} the carpet under the table, and I {{felt that he was}} secretly as anxious as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well for the club, but you might <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> here. Scarborough will take another cigar." [...] But even Mountjoy was too prudent. He {{did not take the}} cigar, but he did win the rubber. [...] "You're in for a good thing to-night, I feel as certain of it as though the money were in your pocket." ...|$|E
6000|$|My aunt, who was {{perfectly}} indifferent to public opinion, drove the grey pony through Dover in a masterly manner; sitting high and stiff like a state coachman, keeping a steady eye upon him wherever he went, {{and making a}} point of not letting him have his own way in any respect. When we came into the country road, she permitted him to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> however; and looking at me down in a valley of cushion by her side, asked me whether I was happy? ...|$|E
60|$|The calamitous {{effects of}} the system had reached the humblest {{concerns}} of human life. Provisions had risen to an enormous price; paper money was refused at all the shops; the people had not wherewithal to buy bread. It had been found absolutely indispensable to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from the suspension of specie payments, and to allow small sums to be scantily exchanged for paper. The doors of the bank and the neighboring streets were immediately thronged with a famishing multitude, seeking cash for bank notes of ten livres. So great was the press and struggle that several persons were stifled and crushed to death. The mob carried three of the bodies to {{the courtyard of the}} Palais Royal. Some cried for the regent to come forth and behold the effect of his system; others demanded the death of Law, the impostor, who had brought this misery and rum upon the nation.|$|E
6000|$|Erickson <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "Well, Mr. Thacher, it's {{in a good}} cause. I'm {{sure you}} have no love for Mars, either. No Terran does. And I see you're leaving {{with the rest of}} us." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the band}} {{developed}} (and <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little),</b> and the line-up changed and then settled, Lazarus Clamp began to allow other influences to show through - English folk music, American country, and some rather deadpan humour.|$|R
6000|$|While the King ate, the rigour of {{his royal}} dignity <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{and with his}} growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--"I think thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} I awaited with {{considerable}} perturbation of mind {{the arrival of}} my nun. I felt assured that, after the occurrences of the previous day, there must certainly {{be some sort of}} a change in her. She could not go on exactly as she had gone on before. The nature of this anticipated change concerned me very much,--too much, I assured myself. Would she be more rigid and repellent than she had been before the advent of the wasp? But this would be impossible. On the other hand, would she be more like other people? Would she <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and work like common secretaries? Or,--and I whistled as I thought of it,--having once done so, would she permanently cut loose from the absurdities enjoined upon her by the House of Martha people, and look at me and talk to me in the free, honest, ingenuous, frank, sincere, and thoroughly sensible manner in which she had spoken to me the day before? ...|$|E
60|$|Finding it {{unnecessary}} {{to plead}} for the Tullivers, {{it was natural}} that aunt Pullet should <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in her anxiety for them, and recur to the annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that apparently ill-fated house. Mrs. Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative, to which Mr. Pullet's remarkable memory furnished some items; and while aunt Pullet pitied poor Bessy's bad luck with her children, and expressed a half-formed project of paying for Maggie's being sent to a distant boarding-school, which would not prevent her being so brown, but might tend to subdue some other vices in her, aunt Glegg blamed Bessy for her weakness, and appealed to all witnesses who should be living when the Tulliver children had turned out ill, that she, Mrs. Glegg, had always said {{how it would be}} from the very first, observing that it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true.|$|E
60|$|Korak, {{momentarily}} forgetful of {{his bloody}} mission, permitted {{the fingers of}} his spear hand to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> their grasp upon the shaft of his formidable weapon. It slipped, almost falling; but the occurrence recalled The Killer to himself. It reminded him of his purpose in slinking stealthily upon the owner of the voice that had attracted his vengeful attention. He glanced at the spear, with its well-worn grip and cruel, barbed head. Then he let his eyes wander again to the dainty form below him. In imagination he saw the heavy weapon shooting downward. He saw it pierce the tender flesh, driving its way deep into the yielding body. He saw the ridiculous doll drop from its owner's arms to lie sprawled and pathetic beside the quivering body of the little girl. The Killer shuddered, scowling at the inanimate iron and wood of the spear as though they constituted a sentient being endowed with a malignant mind.|$|E
60|$|Her warm breath playing, flying rhythmically {{over his}} ear, seemed to relax the tension. She {{could feel his}} body {{gradually}} <b>relaxing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> losing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his limbs, his muscles, going over him spasmodically.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jeff! Thar, now--yer gittin' all dough!" [...] Nevertheless, {{the hard}} face <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> Something of <b>a</b> smile stole round her mouth, showing {{what she might}} have been before {{theology}} and bitters had supplied the natural feminine longings.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps Sir Patrick <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of his vigilance, {{since the}} good {{behaviour}} of his troop had won his confidence, {{and they were}} less likely to be regarded as invaders than by the inhabitants of the district nearer their own frontier.|$|R
60|$|This Atli was {{an unusually}} {{intelligent}} man, {{a man of}} great influence in his district, and one who, like Erling the Bold, was determined to resist the tyranny of Harald Fairhair. A large force had been gathered by him towards the end of winter, and at the time of Hauskuld's visit he was living in his own house with about seventy chosen men. Unfortunately for these, the peaceful winter had induced them to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> in vigilance. Knowing from the report of spies that the King was still feasting in the Drontheim district, they felt quite safe, and for some time past had neglected to set the usual night watch, which, in time of war, was deemed indispensable. Thus it happened that when Hauskuld and his men came upon them in the dead of a dark night, they found everything quiet, and went up {{to the door of the}} house unchallenged. On trying the latch they found it fast, but from the sounds within they knew that a great many men were sleeping there. Hauskuld and Hake had approached the house alone. They now returned to their companions, who were concealed in the deep shades of the neighbouring woods.|$|E
60|$|As time flew on, {{there were}} changes of visitors, chiefly among the single men. At {{the end of}} the first week after Coningsby's arrival, Lord Eskdale appeared, {{bringing}} with him Lucian Gay; and soon after followed the Marquess of Beaumanoir and Mr. Melton. These were all heroes who, in their way, interested the ladies, and whose advent was hailed with general satisfaction. Even Lucretia would <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to Lord Eskdale. He was one of her oldest friends, and with a simplicity of manner which amounted almost to plainness, and with rather a cynical nonchalance in his carriage towards men, Lord Eskdale was invariably a favourite with women. To be sure his station was eminent; he was noble, and very rich, and very powerful, and these are qualities which tell as much with the softer as the harsher sex; but there are individuals with all these qualities who are nevertheless unpopular with women. Lord Eskdale was easy, knew the world thoroughly, had no prejudices, and, above all, had a reputation for success. A reputation for success has as much influence with women as a reputation for wealth has with men. Both reputations may be, and often are, unjust; but we see persons daily make good fortunes by them all the same. Lord Eskdale was not an impostor; and though he might not have been so successful a man had he not been Lord Eskdale, still, thrown over by a revolution, he would have lighted on his legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{daughter}} of General Porky Waterford, Barbara {{is the classic}} officer's wife, assisting with the families of her husband's command. She is amused {{by some of the}} junior officers and often reminds her husband to <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with them.|$|E
5000|$|In his Der Vollkommene Capellmeister (Hamburg, 1739), Johann Mattheson {{wrote of}} the bourrée, [...] "its {{distinguishing}} feature resides in contentment and a pleasant demeanor, {{at the same time}} it is somewhat carefree and <b>relaxed,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> indolent and easygoing, though not disagreeable".|$|R
60|$|The boy gave {{a sort of}} sulky nod, but Lady Annabel {{received}} it so graciously and expressed herself so kindly to him that his features <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> though he was quite silent {{and sat on the}} edge of his chair, the picture of dogged indifference.|$|R
60|$|On {{the last}} of these six days Major Hannay was {{severely}} wounded. At night the enemy's fire <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and the ladies took advantage of it to go up onto the terrace for air, while the men gathered for a council round the Major's bed.|$|R

5000|$|It was a {{good fit}} because, {{throughout}} his career, Cardiff has been a willing supporter of social causes and an advocate for mental health.

50|$|Elena changes {{her mind}} and arrives at the party seeing Lexi and Stefan having fun while playing pool. Lexi gets to the bar to order some drinks when she sees Elena. She {{approaches}} her {{and the two of}} them have a nice talk about Stefan making Elena <b>relax</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit about Stefan being a vampire, to give him some time and he will soon be totally himself around her. When Lexi goes back to Stefan, Stefan thanks her for what she did.|$|E
60|$|The same sober color predominated. There was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{life and}} gayety in their speech here. Their grim, harsh faces <b>relaxed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{and now and}} then broke into unwonted smiles as they stood about devouring their food and {{discussing}} the meeting, which they counted a success. Everywhere were hearty handshakings and fraternal greetings.|$|R

60|$|Of {{the three}} {{remaining}} vagrants, two, Goggles and Indiana Tom, reclined lazily upon convenient lumber and regarded Whistling Dick with undisguised disfavour.

Whistling Dick arose presently and strolled leisurely {{up and down}} keeping carefully within the territory assigned him.|$|R
