5|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. Voyager 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly <b>reflective</b> <b>surface</b> devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, <b>reflective</b> <b>surface</b> and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E

Gold on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inert material, so gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem.

25|$|Heat gain is {{the heat}} {{accumulated}} {{from the sun}} in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect {{in this case is}} the ability of a <b>reflective</b> <b>surface</b> to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a heat storage vault.|$|E

25|$|Many other solar kitchens in India {{use another}} unique concentrating {{technology}} {{known as the}} Scheffler reflector. This technology was first developed by Wolfgang Scheffler in 1986. A Scheffler reflector is a parabolic dish that uses single axis tracking to follow the Sun's daily course. These reflectors have a flexible <b>reflective</b> <b>surface</b> that is able to change its curvature to adjust to seasonal variations in the incident angle of sunlight. Scheffler reflectors {{have the advantage of}} having a fixed focal point which improves the ease of cooking and are able to reach temperatures of 450-650°C. Built in 1999 by the Brahma Kumaris, the world's largest Scheffler reflector system in Abu Road, Rajasthan India is capable of cooking up to 35,000 meals a day. By early 2008, over 2000 large cookers of the Scheffler design had been built worldwide.|$|E

Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision. Battery-powered wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.|$|R

25|$|The ISS {{is visible}} to the naked eye as a slow-moving, bright white dot because of {{reflected}} sunlight, and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark. The ISS takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another, and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the Earth's shadow. Because of the size of its <b>reflective</b> <b>surface</b> area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky, excluding flares, with an approximate maximum magnitude of −4 when overhead (similar to Venus). The ISS, like many satellites including the Iridium constellation, can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of Venus as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces. The ISS is also visible during broad daylight conditions, albeit with a great deal more effort.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. This study concerning a built-in oven is intended to reduce the energy consumption by using <b>reflective</b> <b>surfaces</b> which increase the effect of radiation. Therefore, positions of <b>reflective</b> <b>surfaces</b> that are thought to increase the effect of radiation were decided primarily. The Monte Carlo method was used in order to calculate shape factors belonging to the surfaces placed in different positions. On the framework of investigating the effects of radiation, CFD analysis was carried out only for the cases without brick, which necessitates the usage of models valid for participating mediums. Thus, radiative heat transfer is modeled by the means of S 2 S model. By changing the positions of <b>reflective</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the cavity, energy consumption and {{the duration of the}} cooking were measured. In designing the minimum energy consuming model, the value of the view factors had also taken into account. Indeed, the decided model with the least energy consumption had surfaces with shape factors greater than the others. dc 201...|$|R

500|$|Voyager 2 was {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to observe Enceladus's surface in detail, in August 1981. Examination of the resulting highest-resolution imagery revealed at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth (young) terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas. In addition, extensive linear cracks and scarps were observed. Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains, these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old. Accordingly, Enceladus must have been recently active with [...] "water volcanism" [...] or other processes that renew the surface.
