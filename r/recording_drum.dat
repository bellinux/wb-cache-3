500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences. In {{an interview with}} Terrorizer magazine, Mustaine, taking note of the connection to the unlucky number 13, explained [...] "This is our 13th studio record, and we've already {{had a bunch of}} weird things happen. Car problems, stuff disappearing, a guy who worked for me that was the most white-laced guy you could imagine falling out on drugs and disappearing... but this one's got me excited!" [...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered. In an interview, Drover had said nothing weird occurred until after he finished <b>recording</b> <b>drum</b> tracks for the album.|$|E

Despite ongoing issues between the two parties, the new Fear Factory went ahead with the recording process. In late July 2009, a short video shot with a cell telephone showed Cazares <b>recording</b> <b>drum</b> tracks with longtime contributor Rhys Fulber. On November 6, 2009, blabbermouth.net said a new album, Mechanize, would be released on February 9, 2010, on Candlelight Records.
