5|$|On June 1, 2010, {{by a vote}} of 5–4, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's decision. In the Opinion of the Court, written by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that Thompkins' silence during the interrogation did not invoke his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and that he had waived his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim. Thompkins then filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal District Court but it denied his request. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins' <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Loughner, a 22-year-old Tucson {{man who was}} {{fixated on}} Giffords, was arrested at the scene. Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent to stand trial based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent to stand trial on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E

5000|$|At 9:45 p.m. on Monday, October 24, 1966, Yukl {{called the}} police to report the finding of the nude body of 25-year-old Suzanne Reynolds, his $5-per-hour student and a native Floridian, in a vacant {{apartment}} in his building. He told Patrolman Charles McMillen of the 13th Precinct that after her regular voice lesson he had [...] "returned from walking his dog, noticed the apartment door open, entered, found the body, and promptly notified the police," [...] according to assistant district attorney Robert K. Tanenbaum. After hours of questioning, backup detectives, noticing unusual stains on Yukl's shoes, asked him to accompany them to the precinct house on East 21st Street, to which he consented. Not having direct evidence, police continued the questioning, with coffee and cigarette breaks, until 6:45 a.m., when [...] "one of the detectives suddenly noticed stains on Yukl's trousers", leading immediately to a reading of Yukl's <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> {{as defined by the}} U.S. Supreme Court only four months earlier.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{expanded}} into a caution during arrest under Republic Act 7438. Previously, informing arrested persons {{of their rights}} occurred long after arrest, if it ever occurred at all. Any public officer or employee, or anyone acting under his order or his place, who arrests, detains or investigates any person for the commission of an offense shall inform the latter, in a language known to and understood by him, of his <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and <b>to</b> have competent and independent counsel, preferably of his own choice, who shall at all times be allowed to confer privately with the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation. If such person cannot afford the services of his own counsel, he must be provided with a competent and independent counsel by the investigating officer. [...] Punishments for law enforcement officers who fail to read suspects their rights, under RA7438, are severe: besides a fine of 6,000 Philippine pesos, officials may be jailed for between eight and ten years.|$|R
40|$|It is {{recognized}} that {{the burden of proof}} in criminal justice is on the shoulder of the prosecution. Likewise, the presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of human rights concerning fair trials, <b>rights</b> of person <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and principle of innocence until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubts. However, the burden of proof can be shifted from the prosecutor to the defendant in some cases like in cases of money laundering, tax evasion, smuggling, terrorism and illicit enrichment. Hence, this article argues that the right of accused must be balanced against the right of society. This article found that some scholars and in some jurisdictions reject the shifting of onus of proof to the defendant to protect the fundamental provisions of human rights. This article also argues that the burden of proof should be understood as an instrument to curb corruption and deprive corruptors from the proceeds of crimes rather than the exaggeration the presumption of innocence...|$|R
25|$|Essex Police sent initial {{papers to}} the Crown Prosecution Service {{regarding}} the allegations and Huhne exercised his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> {{in response to}} police questions in May. On 25 June 2011, Essex Police said that a judge at the Crown Court at Chelmsford had granted them {{a court order to}} take possession of a recording from The Sunday Times in which the ex-couple apparently discuss the case. It then emerged that Huhne had again been interviewed by police concerning the allegations, and on 28 July the police handed the file to prosecutors. On 17 August 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service remitted the matter to Essex Police with a direction to investigate the matter further. On 25 August 2011, Essex Police re-submitted their allegations to the CPS. A decision on whether criminal proceedings would be instituted for the alleged offence was expected to be made by the end of September 2011.|$|E

500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> {{as part of}} their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Remaining silent is optional—they may speak or be silent as they wish. The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners {{to make sure that the}} suspect is aware they have that right prior to questioning, in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right (and would have relied upon it had they been aware). Miranda v. Arizona [...] and related cases contemplate that a suspect might invoke their rights (make clear they wish to rely on them), waive their rights (make clear they do not wish to rely on them), or do neither of these. A number of cases such as the present one, refine Miranda by addressing when and at what point a suspect, who is aware that they have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> is said to have begun to rely on that right, as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it.|$|E

500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> nor {{that he did not want}} to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E
500|$|At {{least one}} scholar {{has argued that}} Thompkins {{effectively}} gutted Miranda. In The <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Remain</b> <b>Silent,</b> Charles Weisselberg argues that [...] "the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v. Arizona’s prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails {{to protect the rights}} of suspects." [...] and that [...] "But in Thompkins, neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied waiver after lengthy questioning. Thompkins persevered for almost three hours before succumbing to his interrogators. In finding a waiver on these facts, Thomphins gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids." ...|$|E
500|$|The case of North Carolina v. Butler [...] {{showed that}} a waiver of Miranda rights may be implied through [...] "the defendant's silence, coupled with an {{understanding}} of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver". The court held that where a Miranda warning had been given and was understood by the accused, an accused's uncoerced statement established an implied waiver of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> Thompkins answer to the police question, having understood but not chosen to invoke his rights, was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. Further corroboration was that he had sporadically made other comments as well.|$|E
