500|$|Unlike {{the coup}} of June 1798, the Augereau coup did present a sharp {{break with the}} recent past. The new {{constitution}} reduced {{the role of the}} legislative branch (which now did not have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative),</b> and expanded the powers of the Executive, which [...] now became known as the Staatsbewind (Regency of State). The elective principle was reduced to a formality: the Staatsbewind, originally consisting of the three directors taking part in the coup, expanded its membership by co-optation to twelve. This executive then appointed the first 35 members of the legislature. As vacancies arose, these were filled, as far as possible, on a provincial rota and according to national quotas of representatives of each province (much like the old States-General). Except for Holland, the old provinces were reconstituted. The local and provincial administrative organs continued to be elected - no longer by universal manhood suffrage, but by a system of census suffrage.|$|E

"The Court {{does not}} {{question}} [...] sovereign right {{to maintain an}} initiative process, or the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> proponents to defend their initiatives in [...] courts. But standing in federal court {{is a question of}} federal law, not state law. No matter its reasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this Court’s settled law to the contrary. Article III’s requirement that a party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a personal, particularized injury serves vital interests going {{to the role of the}} Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers. States cannot alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse." [...] (Hollingsworth v. Perry) ...|$|E

50|$|One {{innovation}} was made, namely, {{that the}} Legislative Body {{was elected by}} universal suffrage, but it had no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative,</b> all laws being proposed by the executive power. This new political change was rapidly followed by the same consequence as had attended that of Brumaire. On 2 December 1852, France, still under the effect of Napoleon's legacy, {{and the fear of}} anarchy, conferred almost unanimously by a plebiscite the supreme power, with the title of emperor, upon Napoleon III.|$|E

50|$|Itself {{a product}} of the Progressive Era reforms, the {{constitution}} adopted by Arizona upon admission to the Union in 1912 reflects the sentiment that direct democracy was sacred. The first section of the constitution dealing with the powers of the Legislature is quick to reserve the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> and referendum for the people. These rights are also granted specific protections, being exempt from veto by the governor as well as not being subject to repeal by the legislature. Citizen initiatives may only be overturned by subsequent initiatives.|$|R

In constitutional matters, the electorate also had a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> if one tenth of the primary assemblies decided to review the national level. The Constitution itself was adopted by referendum from July to August 1793, although some have reservations about the democratic nature of the latter. This constitution was never applied.|$|E

Popular initiatives were now to be submitted to popular vote within ten months after the end of parliamentary debates so that no deadline was planned earlier, which sometimes led to abuse.

5000|$|One recent {{controversy}} {{involving the}} constitution {{is the right to}} referendum which is mentioned in the Constitution. The constitution states that [...] "The exercise <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiative</b> and referendum shall be prescribed by law", but legislation prescribing the practices had been blocked by the pan-blue coalition largely out of suspicions that proponents of a referendum law would be used to overturn the ROC Constitution and provide a means to declare Taiwan independence. A referendum law was passed on 27 November 2003 and signed by President Chen Shui-bian on 31 December 2003, but the law sets high standards for referendums such as the requirement that they can only be called by the President in times of imminent attack.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rejected}} Treaty {{establishing a}} Constitution for Europe (TCE) included a limited indirect initiative right (Article I-46(4)).
