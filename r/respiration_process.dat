40|$|Lactic {{fermentation}} and respiration {{are important}} metabolic pathways on which life is based. Here, {{the rate of}} entropy in a cell associated to fermentation and <b>respiration</b> <b>processes</b> in glucose catabolism of living systems is calculated. This is done for {{both internal and external}} heat and matter transport according to a thermodynamic approach based on Prigogine’s formalism. It is shown that the rate of entropy associated to irreversible reactions in fermentation processes is higher than the corresponding one in <b>respiration</b> <b>processes.</b> Instead, this behaviour is reversed for diffusion of chemical species and for heat exchanges. The ratio between the rates of entropy associated to the two metabolic pathways has a space and time dependence for diffusion of chemical species and is invariant for heat and irreversible reactions. In both fermentation and <b>respiration</b> <b>processes</b> studied separately, the total entropy rate tends towards a minimum value fulfilling Prigogine’s minimum dissipation principle and is in accordance with the second principle of thermodynamics.

50|$|Hay baled {{before it}} is fully dry can produce enough heat to start a fire. Haystacks produce {{internal}} heat due to bacterial fermentation. If hay is stacked with wet grass, the heat produced can be sufficient to ignite the hay causing a fire. Farmers {{have to be careful}} about moisture levels to avoid spontaneous combustion, which is a leading cause of haystack fires. Heat is produced by the <b>respiration</b> <b>process,</b> which occurs until the moisture content of drying hay drops below 40%. Hay is considered fully dry when it reaches 20% moisture. Combustion problems typically occur within five days to seven days of baling. A bale cooler than 120 F is in little danger, but bales between 120 and 140 F need to be removed from a barn or structure and separated so that they can cool off. If the temperature of a bale exceeds more than 140 F, it can combust.|$|E
50|$|The study {{cautioned against}} cutting down of these trees for the metro station, arguing that {{relocation}} of trees {{is not an}} option. Giant trees with more than 150 cm girth and 10 m height would not sustain the shock due to relocation. The present tree population would be subjected to major threat due to air pollution, rise in local temperature and water logging of the soil. The removal of trees in the garden area will remove the green cover around the garden; this would lead to rise in the temperature.

50|$|As dissimilatory nitrate {{reduction}} to ammonium is an anaerobic <b>respiration</b> <b>process,</b> marine microorganisms {{capable of}} performing DNRA are most {{commonly found in}} environments low in O2, such as oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the water column, or sediments with steep O2 gradients.DNRA has been documented in prokaryotes inhabiting the upper layer of marine sediments. For example,Benthic sulfur bacteria in genera such as Beggiatoa and Thioploca inhabit anoxic sediments on continental shelves and obtain energy by oxidizing sulfide via DNRA. These bacteria are {{able to carry out}} DNRA using intracellular nitrate stored in vacuoles. The direct reduction of nitrate to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction, coupled with the direct conversion of ammonium to dinitrogen via Anammox, has been attributed to significant nitrogen loss in certain parts of the ocean; this DNRA-Anammox coupling by DNRA and Anammox bacteria can account for nitrate loss in areas with no detectable denitrification, such as in OMZs off the coast of Chile, Peru, and Namibia, as well as OMZs over the Omani Shelf in the Arabian Sea. While denitrification is more energetically favourable than DNRA, there is evidence that bacteria using DNRA conserve more energy than denitrifiers, allowing them to grow faster. Thus, via DNRA-Anammox coupling, bacteria using DNRA and Anammox may be stronger competitors for substrates than denitrifiers.|$|E

40|$|Tree species-rich {{tropical}} rainforests {{are characterized}} by a highly variable quality of leaf litter input to the soil at small spatial scales. This diverse plant litter is {{a major source of}} energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms, particularly in rainforests developed on old and nutrient-impoverished soils. Here we tested the hypothesis that the variability in leaf litter quality produced by a highly diverse tree community determines the spatial variability of the microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>process</b> in the underlying soil. We analyzed a total of 225 litter-soil pairs from an undisturbed Amazonian rainforest in French Guiana using a hierarchical sampling design. The microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>process</b> was assessed using substrateinduced respiration (SIR) and compared {{to a wide range of}} quality parameters of the associated litter layer (litter nutrients, carbon forms, stoichiometry, litter mass and pH). The results show that the variability of both litter quality and SIR rates was more important at large than at small scales. SIR rates varied between 1. 1 and 4. 0 mg g_ 1 h_ 1 and were significantly correlated with litter layer quality (up to 50 % of the variability explained by the best mixed linear model). Total litter P content was the individual most important factor explaining the observed spatial variation in soil SIR, with higher rates associated to high litter P. SIR rates also correlated positively with total litter N content and with increasing proportions of labile C compounds. However, contrary to our expectation, SIR rates were not related to litter stoichiometry. These data suggest that in the studied Amazonian rainforest, tree canopy composition is an important driver of the microbial <b>respiration</b> <b>process</b> via leaf litter fall, resulting in potentially strong plant-soil feedbacks. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{and develop a}} new real‐time human <b>respiration</b> <b>process</b> {{analysis}} method using a high‐time‐sampling gas concentration sensor based on ultrasound. A unique point about our proposed gas concentration sensor is its 1 kHz gas concentration sampling speed.

First, we describe the proposed new ultrasound sound speed measurement method and the signal processing, and present the measurement circuit diagram. Next, we analyse the human respiration gas variation patterns of five healthy subjects using a newly developed gas‐mask‐ type respiration sensor. This reveals that the rapid gas exchange from H 2 O to CO 2 contains air specific to the human being.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} stimuli {{are known}} to affect the structure and function of microbial communities, {{their impact on the}} metabolic network of microorganisms has not been well investigated. Here, geochemical analyses, high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes and transcripts, and isolation of potentially relevant bacteria were carried out to elucidate the anaerobic <b>respiration</b> <b>processes</b> stimulated by nitrate (20 mM) amendment of marine sediments. Marine sediments deposited by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 were incubated anaerobically in the dark at 25 °C for 5 days. Nitrate in slurry water decreased gradually for 2 days, then more rapidly until its complete depletion at day 5; production of N 2 O followed the same pattern. From day 2 to 5, the sulfate concentration increased and the sulfur content in solid-phase sediments significantly decreased. These results indicated that denitrification and sulfur oxidation occurred simultaneously. Illumina sequencing revealed the proliferation of known sulfur oxidizers, i. e., Sulfurimonas spp. and Chromatiales bacteria, which accounted for approximately 43. 5 % and 14. 8 % of the total population at day 5, respectively. They also expressed 16 S rRNA to a considerable extent, whereas the other microorganisms, e. g., iron(III) reducers and methanogens, became metabolically active {{at the end of the}} incubation. Extinction dilution culture in a basal-salts medium supplemented with sulfur compounds and nitrate successfully isolated the predominant sulfur oxidizers: Sulfurimonas sp. strain HDS 01 and Thioalkalispira sp. strain HDS 22. Their 16 S rRNA genes showed 95. 2 − 96. 7 % sequence similarity to the closest cultured relatives and they grew chemolithotrophically on nitrate and sulfur. Novel sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were thus directly involved in carbon fixation under nitrate-reducing conditions, activating anaerobic <b>respiration</b> <b>processes</b> and the reorganization of microbial communities in the deposited marine sediments...|$|R

Besides temperature, many emerging controlling factors {{have not yet been}} incorporated into ecosystem-scale models. We synthesize recent research that has partitioned soil <b>respiration</b> into its <b>process</b> components to evaluate effects of nitrogen, temperature and photosynthesis on autotrophic flux from soils at the ecosystem level. Despite the widely used temperature dependence of root respiration, gross primary productivity (GPP) can explain most patterns of ecosystem root respiration (and to some extent heterotrophic respiration) at within-season time-scales. Specifically, heterotrophic respiration is influenced by a seasonally variable supply of recent photosynthetic products in the rhizosphere. The contribution of stored root carbon (C) to root respiratory fluxes also varied seasonally, partially decoupling the proportion of photosynthetic C driving root respiration. In order to reflect recent insights, new hierarchical models, which incorporate root respiration as a primary function of GPP and which respond to environmental variables by modifying C allocation belowground, are needed for better prediction of future ecosystem C sequestration...|$|R
