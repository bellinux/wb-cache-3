40|$|Clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> is an {{increasing}} challenge {{for the development of}} low-noise transmissions. Efforts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of combustion engines combined with a decrease of the idle speed cause increasing cyclic irregularities within modern drivelines which result in {{an increasing}} clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and can even lead to serious damage of driveline components. Beside these aspects, the improvement of transmission efficiency as part of the powertrain efficiency and therefore fuel consumption of the vehicle is a major task during {{the development of a new}} transmission. In order to design future transmissions that implicate improvements on both tasks simultaneously, new grounds were broken by the Institute of Machine Components (IMA) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany in the field of clatter and <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> free automotive transmissions. This is achieved in principle by decoupling all gears which are not in the power flow.

40|$|Sound {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. The noise produced by specific components and mechanisms in the engine can play a significant role in determining the perceived quality of the overall noise and in turn the perceived quality of the engine. The goal of the present research is to characterize the sounds produced by the phenomenon known as gear rattle and to develop a model that can be used to assess gear rattle levels in a way that connects directly with human perception of rattle. Most previous work in this area has been focused on rating the overall sound quality of diesel engines, but little has been done to develop models of perception of <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> in particular. Various engine recordings in which gear rattle was present were first compiled. These signals were analyzed to identify how sounds changed with increased levels of rattle. A method to simulate gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. This procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle for use in a psychoacoustic test. The test was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increases in annoyance due to the presence of gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared with those of a more general population. The subjects with diesel engine experience were found to be better at detecting gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The outcome of this research will be a method to predict how people perceive gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> so that component noise targets can be set that directly relate to human perception of gear rattle. When coupled with noise generation predictions, this approach can be used to optimize the quality of the component noise. ...|$|E

40|$|Automotive seat rattle {{has a large}} {{contribution}} in customer NVH satisfaction, {{as there is a}} close interface between the passengers and seat. The vibration from the road and other sources in the car like the engine are transmitted to the seat through the different paths which can be the cause of rattling noise in different frequency ranges from the seat. Seat structure as well as its components can be sources of <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> based on their physical characteristics. Therefore the main objective of this project was to characterize the acoustic signature of the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> which can be used for noise source identification and structural NVH optimization. For this purpose, different noise measurement and structural tests were done on a Holden VE passenger seat manufactured by FUTURIS Company. A sine sweep from 5 - 100 Hz was used as the input vibration for the tests to simulate the real life driving conditions and the vibration and noise responses of the seat were measured and analysed using different equipment and software packages. The methods used included modal testing and analysis, noise measurement and impact hammering test on different seat components. The seat was divided in to 3 main areas including: Rails, Seatback and Headrest. The obtained major <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> frequencies were correlated with corresponding structural modal frequencies. This comparison and additional impact hammering results lead us to identify the acoustic signatures and corresponding sources of the seat <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> The acoustic signatures database has therefore been developed for the automotive seat...|$|E

For validation purposes, a specific instrumentation of a gearbox is set up.

40|$|The {{vehicle seat}} rattles or, in general, BSR (buzz, squeak, and rattle) noises {{are one of}} the major issues, which are {{directly}} linked to the NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) quality of the vehicle.

The automotive seat structural {{noise and vibration}} {{is caused by the}} transmission of the power train or road vibration into the seat. The characterization of seat structural dynamics behavior in early design phase assists to effectively improve the NVH quality of the seat. The seat nonlinear buzz, squeak, and rattle (BSR) noise are the major issues which are directly linked to the NVH quality of the vehicle. For this purpose, a practical CAE (computer-aided engineering) concept modeling method is introduced and developed for full BIW (body-in-white) and seat separately.

Subjects listened to sounds over headphones and were asked to report their annoyance. Annoyance to different rattles was shown to vary significantly according to rattle object size. In addition, the combination of low-amplitude sonic booms and rattles can be more annoying than the sonic boom alone. Correlations and regression analyses for the combined sonic boom and rattle sounds identified the Moore and Glasberg Stationary Loudness (MGSL) metric as a primary predictor of annoyance for the tested sounds. Multiple linear regression models were developed to describe annoyance to the tested sounds, and simplifications for applicability to a wider range of sounds are presented...|$|E
40|$|Component {{sound quality}} is an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. One component noise that causes complaints is the gear rattle that originates in the front-of-engine gear train which drives the fuel pump and other accessories. The rattle is caused by repeated tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the driving gears. These impacts generate a broadband, impulsive noise that is often perceived as annoying. In most previous work, the overall sound quality of diesel engines has been considered without specifically focusing on predicting the perception of gear rattle. Gear rattle level has been quantified based on angular acceleration measurements, but those measurements can be difficult to perform. Here, the emphasis was on developing a metric based on subjective testing of the perception of gear rattle. In the first part of the present work, a method to simulate gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. That procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle within the total engine noise signal. The simulations were then used in a psychoacoustic test that was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increase in annoyance due to the presence of gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise.</b> Forty subjects participated in the threshold detection tests and a paired comparison annoyance test. The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared to those of a more general population. The subjects with diesel engine experience were found to be better at detecting gear <b>rattle</b> <b>noise</b> and found rattle more annoying than the other subjects, particularly at high rattle levels.
