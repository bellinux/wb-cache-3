5000|$|Family Phengodidae - Usually {{known as}} glowworm beetles. Contains around 250 species endemic to the New World. This family also {{includes}} <b>railroad</b> <b>worms,</b> which are unique among all terrestrial bioluminescent organisms in producing red light.|$|R
5|$|The larvae of <b>railroad</b> <b>worms</b> (Phrixothrix) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to {{glow with}} green light; these {{are thought to}} have a {{defensive}} purpose. They also have organs on the head which produce red light; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light of this colour.|$|R
50|$|Larval and larviform female glowworms are predators, {{feeding on}} millipedes and other {{arthropods}} occurring in soil and litter. The winged males, {{which are often}} attracted to lights at night, are short-lived and probably do not feed. Females are {{much larger than the}} males and are completely larviform. Males may be luminescent, but females and larvae have a series of luminescent organs on trunk segments which emit yellow or green light, and sometimes an additional head organ which emits red light, as in <b>railroad</b> <b>worms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{apple maggot}} (Rhagoletis pomonella), {{also known as}} a <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the Phrixothrix beetle larvae also called that), is a pest of several fruits, mainly apples. Before the arrival in America of apples from Europe, it was found mainly in hawthorns.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> is a larva or larviform female adult of a beetle of {{the genus}} Phrixothrix in the family Phengodidae, {{characterized}} by the possession of two different colors of bioluminescence. [...] It has {{the appearance of a}} caterpillar. The eleven pairs of luminescent organs on their second thoracic segment through their ninth abdominal segment can glow yellowish-green, while the pair on their head can glow red; this is probably due to different luciferases in their bodies, as the reaction substrate, called luciferin, is the same.|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{are crucial}} {{elements}} in mammalian signal transduction, and {{are considered to}} represent potent drug targets. We have previously developed a GPCR assay system in cultured cells based on complementation of split fragments of click beetle (Pyrearinus termitilluminans) luciferase. The interaction of GPCRs with its target, β-arrestin, resulted in strong emission of bioluminescence upon stimulation with its specific ligand. In this study, we improved precision of the GPCR assay system by using <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> (Phrixothrix hirtus) luciferase as an internal control. We generated stable cell lines harboring the <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> luciferase and quantitatively evaluate the extent of GPCR-β-arrestin interactions. We showed concentration-dependent bioluminescence responses for four GPCRs: β 2 -adrenoceptor, endothelin receptor type A, α 2 -adrenoceptor and human μ-opioid receptor. We also demonstrated that the variation of responses was reduced significantly by normalizing the data with bioluminescence from <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> luciferase. This assay system represents a simple and reliable approach for screening drug candidates in a high throughput manner...|$|E
40|$|The oxyluciferin {{molecule}} in its anionic form {{is responsible}} for light emission from fireflies and some <b>railroad</b> <b>worms</b> and click beetles. Here we have studied {{the breakdown of the}} ions after photoexcitation by 550 -nm light, and identified the atom composition of eight fragment ions based on mass spectrometric experiments on isotope-labeled compounds. A sector instrument with an electrospray ion source and a pulsed laser system was used for the experiments. After photoexcitation the time for dissociation was up to about 15 μs, which is much shorter than the 100 -μs time constant for dissociation after one-photon absorption. The laser power was therefore kept high to allow the oxyluciferin anions to absorb two photons to produce enough fragment ions on the instrumental relevant time scale. The reaction energies leading to these ions were obtained from density functional theory calculations. The dominant fragment ion was deprotonated 2 -cyano- 6 -hydroxybenzothiazole. Interestingly this behavior mirrors that of oxyluciferin both in vivo in insects, where the same nitrile is an intermediate in the postulated regeneration of d-luciferin from oxyluciferin or in vitro in near-neutral aqueous buffer. Dissociation of the oxyluciferin anion into this fragment ion was calculated to require 1. 86 eV, which is less than the energy of one photon (2. 25 eV). Experiments done on 5, 5 -dimethyloxyluciferin revealed a similar fragmentation pattern...|$|R
40|$|Bioluminescence, the {{conversion}} of chemical energy into light in living organisms, is dependent on two principal components, an enzyme luciferase and the substrate luciferin. Light emission occurs in many different species in phylogenetically diverse organisms with estimates that bioluminescence may have arisen independently as many as 50 times {{in the course of}} evolution. In beetles {{only a small percentage of}} species are luminescent and most are found in three coleopteran families within the superfamily Elateroidea; the Lampyridae (fireflies and glow-worms), the Phengodidae (<b>railroad</b> <b>worms)</b> and the Elateridae (click beetles). The enzyme responsible for bioluminescence in beetles, firefly luciferase, is highly conserved between families, although changes in amino acid residues can impact on the colour of the light emitted. It has been hypothesised that luciferase evolved from a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase gene deriving a novel bioluminescent function (neofunctionalization) after a gene duplication event. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown extensive gene duplication of luciferase within the Coleoptera and luciferase-like genes driving the hypothesis that beetle luciferase may have arisen from a process of subfunctionalization as opposed to neofunctionalization early on in Elateroidea evolution. The impact of gene duplication on shaping the evolution of bioluminescence is further highlighted in the colour of light emitted by bioluminescent beetles. Recent evidence has shown that intergenic exchange between duplicated luciferase loci is common in some members of the Elateridae. Furthermore, gene flow and intergenic exchange shuffled substitutions have given rise to new colour phenotypes in Jamaican click beetles. Herein is presented a review on the evidence for functional divergence of duplicated luciferase genes in bioluminescent beetles that have given rise to the first luminescent beetles and the evolution of bioluminescent colour...|$|R
40|$|A {{luciferase}} {{from the}} <b>railroad</b> <b>worm</b> (Phrixothrix hirtus) {{is the only}} red-emitting bioluminescent enzyme in nature that is advantageous in multicolor luciferase assays and in bioluminescence imaging (BLI). However, it is not used widely in scientific or industrial applications because of its low activity and stability. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we produced red-emitting mutants with higher activity and better stability. Compared with the wild-type (WT), the luminescent activities from extracts of cultured mammalian cells expressing mutant luciferase were 9. 8 -fold in I 212 L/N 351 K, 8. 4 -fold in I 212 L, and 7. 8 -fold in I 212 L/S 463 R; and the cell-based activities were 3. 6 -fold in I 212 L/N 351 K and 3. 4 -fold in N 351 K. The remaining activities after incubation at 37 °C for 10 min were 50. 0 % for I 212 L/S 463 R, 31. 8 % for I 212 L, and 23. 0 % for I 212 L/N 351 K, but only 5. 2 % for WT. To demonstrate an application of I 212 L/N 351 K, cell-based BLI was performed, and the luminescence signal was 3. 6 -fold higher than in WT. These {{results indicate that the}} mutants might improve the practicability of this signaling in bioassays and BLI...|$|E
