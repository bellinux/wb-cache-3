60|$|He {{had hardly}} spoken when there came the tread of many heavy feet upon the deck. Then {{there was a}} pause with no sound but the gentle lipping of the water against the sides of the pirate vessel. Finally, a {{crashing}} blow as from a pistol-butt fell upon the door, and an instant afterwards Sweetlocks himself, a tall, dark man, with a deep <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> blazing upon his cheek, strode into the cabin. His swaggering air sank somewhat as he looked into those pale and filmy eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Aylmer is a {{brilliant}} and recognized scientist and philosopher who has dropped his focus from his career and experiments to marry the beautiful Georgiana (who is physically perfect except for a small <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> {{in the shape of}} a hand on her cheek).|$|E
5000|$|Dermatologists divide birthmarks {{into two}} types. Pigmented birthmarks caused by excess skin pigment cells include moles, café au lait spots, and Mongolian spots. Vascular <b>birthmarks,</b> also called <b>red</b> <b>birthmarks,</b> {{are caused by}} {{increased}} blood vessels and include macular stains (salmon patches), hemangiomas, and Port-wine stains. A little over 1 in 10 babies have a vascular birthmark present by age 1. Several birthmark types {{are part of the}} group of skin lesions known as nevi or naevi, which means [...] "birthmarks" [...] in Latin.|$|R
50|$|Cavernous hemangiomas {{can arise}} nearly {{anywhere}} in the body where there are blood vessels and {{are considered to be}} benign tumours. They are often described as raspberry-like because of the bubble-like caverns. Unlike the capillary hemangiomas, cavernous ones can be disfiguring and do not tend to regress. Most cases of cavernomas are congenital, however they can develop {{over the course of a}} lifetime. While there is no definitive cause, research shows that genetic mutations result in the onset. Congenital hemangiomas that appear on the skin are known as either vascular or <b>red</b> <b>birthmarks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Higbie {{eventually}} gets {{in touch}} with a former bartender who saw one of the murders, who tells him that at least one man was killed by a man-sized black widow spider. Checking further, he finds out that Leigh and Laura's father {{died in a plane crash}} several years ago, and one of the girls was nearly bitten to death by spiders. Higbie finds out that the plane landed in an old vineyard owned by the Lockwoods, and meets the aging Indian who found the girls. The Indian says that according to an old legend, some women are affected by an ancient curse passed through the female line. During the full moon, these women turn into giant spiders in times of stress, kill their victims, encase them in webbing and feed on them. These women have a <b>red</b> hourglass <b>birthmark</b> on their abdomens, similar to those found on black widow spiders. They are practically indestructible in spider form; the only thing that can kill them is fire. The twin who was bitten by the spiders is the one affected with the curse.|$|R
50|$|Nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) is a flat, <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> {{caused by}} a {{capillary}} (small blood vessel) malformation. Children with BWS often have nevus flammeus on their forehead or {{the back of their}} neck. Nevus flammeus is benign and commonly does not require any treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Liu Tang is from Dongluzhou (東潞州; {{believed}} to be present-day Changzhi, Shanxi). The novel describes him as a muscular man with a dark complexion, a wide face, a <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> on his face, and crimson hair. He is nicknamed [...] "Red Haired Devil" [...] for his birthmark and unique hair colour. He is well-trained in combat skills and specialises in using the pudao. He wanders around the jianghu in his early life and does some illegal trading in Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{all of this}} is the {{obsession}} of one man bent on destroying Oliver and his reputation, even {{going so far as to}} try to have him murdered. Monks (Oliver Cotton), who has a distinguishing <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> over his right eye, has learned that although he and Oliver are born of different mothers, they are of the same father. Monks learns that their father has disinherited him in favor of Oliver, though he inherited what should have been Oliver's inheritance after his mother's death. Though Monks is legitimate, he also has aspirations of wealth and stature that his inheritance would provide. Thus, he also sees the relationship between them as socially scandalous. His efforts prove unsuccessful in the end, however.|$|E
5000|$|Sometime later Higbie is at Leigh's {{beach house}} for dinner while Jennifer is shown {{playing on the}} beach with her dog. Leigh {{explains}} that Jennifer is adjusting to living with her, though she still has occasional nightmares, but with diminishing frequency. She has returned to school and is making new friends. She tells Higbie that although Jennifer doesn't really look like her, sometimes she reminds her of Laura. Jennifer asks to go for one more swim before dinner at which time she turns and waves to Higbie and Leigh on the balcony, revealing a <b>red</b> hourglass shaped <b>birthmark</b> on her abdomen, {{the same one that}} Laura had, indicating that Laura was her mother and that she has inherited the [...] "curse of the black widow." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of Yiguandao, Zhang Tianran's status as a divine patriarch (shizun) was strengthened, with a large number of {{pamphlets}} published to justify his divinity. The following one is an example: When our great teacher was born, his eyes and eyebrows were perfectly shaped, and there was depth and wisdom in his eyes. ... On his forehead, he had a third eye. His nose was straight like that of a dragon, and his head was like that of a god. His mouth was perfect and he already had a long beard. His earlobes touched his shoulders, and his arms were very long (all signs of great wisdom and ability). He walked beautifully and perfectly, with long strides, and was obviously not of the mortal world. On his left hand, he had a <b>red</b> <b>birthmark</b> shaped like the sun and on his right one like the moon; they were so red that they would leave a mark when he touched his hand to paper. On his left foot, he had the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and on his right foot, the six stars of the Southern Dipper. Because of this, although he had been born into the mortal world, everyone knew that he was one with the Universe—the living enlightened Jigong, who was sent by heaven to save humanity.|$|E

5000|$|I still {{remember}} in July, one Sunday morning, Song brought someone, later I {{learned that his}} name was Sun Lu, {{he was a student}} at Tsinghua university. Afterwards we went with him on a bus to enter the city, he brought us to a church. In the washroom, he introduced us to another person, he got us to select someone to go out and meet the guide. I was selected to go outside of that Xuanwumen church, and there I saw Kathleen Hall. I felt that she was very warm, honest and greatly willing to help the Chinese fight the Japanese. I told her about the thoughts of my friend and I, she asked some questions. Then she told me to set a time to come to Beiping to buy some medicine supplies for the liberated zone. I told my dorm mates, they felt that Kathleen's plan was too dangerous, to just head straight to Baoding. So one afternoon, the three of us went to find her, asking her if she had another method to reach the liberated zone. She thought a bit, she said that she was planning on heading back there soon, but that we could not travel with her. She told us to go on a train by ourselves to Ding county, then find a village named Gaomei, and wait for her there. She carefully explained how to bypass the Japanese-controlled rail paths, and how to get to Gaomei. She said in Gaomei at a particular area on a street, there was a small family inn, the owner's face had a <b>red</b> <b>birthmark.</b> 'You tell him, I made you stay at the inn to wait for me' she said, 'he will then let you stay there.' She said that she would meet us there, and then take us to the liberated zone. We agreed with her plan, but were very worried about the bomb-making materials. She said that it was too dangerous to carry these things, she was willing to do it for us. Therefore, that night we went to the church one more time, and we handed the things over to her. The next day we went out according to her words, and safely got to the little inn in Gaomei. We slept there two nights. On the third day, Ms. Hall appeared, telling us that she had brought 3 nurses from Beiping, and wanted to bring them to the hospital in Anguo. After she made arrangements for them, she would come back to look for us. After she came back again, she made us put on farmer's clothes, the Liberation Army said that we would only get past the Japanese lines by following her. Along the way we saw many people, they enthusiastically welcomed her, spoke with her, telling her where the Japanese forces were. The people treated her like they would treat a great person from their home, she was very familiar with the local area. Sometimes we had to keep our heads down moving forward, in irrigation ditches, canals, dry riverbeds crawling forward. Sometimes we had to lie down a long time, waiting for Japanese to pass. Without her guidance, we would never get anywhere. In the end we got to Songjiazhuang, but the contact person she mentioned was not found there. However, she still wrote an introduction letter to give to a department of the government of the liberated zone. It was at that time when the message was passed, someone said that the Japanese were currently closing in on the village. She quickly finished writing the letter, and sent us off to the mountain road. She said she still wanted to return to Anguo to meet with the three nurses. We got to the new headquarters of the zone, which had been moved because of a retreat from the Japanese forces at Songjiazhuang. Not long after we received a letter from Ms. Hall, saying she was still at Songjiazhuang. She said that our bags the bomb-making materials had reached the village and been placed in the church, but the Japanese destroyed the church and our bags were also destroyed. We felt very bad, not only because of our bags, but because we feared that maybe our bags had brought about the suspicion of the Japanese. Later we heard that Kathleen Hall returned to New Zealand. She was a great foreign friend who truly loved the Chinese people, enduring danger to do many things, and took people like me to the liberated zone.' ...|$|E
