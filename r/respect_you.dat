You've {{got to make}} them <b>respect</b> <b>you.</b> You've got to punish tacklers. You've got to deal out more misery than the tacklers deal out to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd hurt you when you tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on him a little to keep him down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Princeton {{professor}} April Alliston wrote, [...] "Though no literary masterpiece, Fifty Shades is {{more than}} parasitic fan fiction based on the recent Twilight vampire series." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the book a [...] "B+" [...] rating and praised it for being [...] "in a class by itself." [...] British author Jenny Colgan in The Guardian wrote [...] "It is jolly, eminently readable and as sweet and safe as BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism) erotica can be without contravening the trade descriptions act" [...] and also praised the book for being [...] "more enjoyable" [...] than other [...] "literary erotic books". The Daily Telegraph noted that the book was [...] "the definition of a page-turner", noting that the book was both [...] "troubling and intriguing". A reviewer for the Ledger-Enquirer described the book as guilty fun and escapism, and that it [...] "also touches on one aspect of female existence [...] And acknowledging that fact – maybe even appreciating it – shouldn't be a cause for guilt." [...] The New Zealand Herald stated that the book [...] "will win no prizes for its prose" [...] and that [...] "there are some exceedingly awful descriptions," [...] although {{it was also an}} easy read; [...] "(If you only) can suspend your disbelief and your desire to – if you'll pardon the expression – slap the heroine for having so little self <b>respect,</b> <b>you</b> might enjoy it." [...] The Columbus Dispatch stated that, [...] "Despite the clunky prose, James does cause one to turn the page." [...] Metro News Canada wrote that [...] "suffering through 500 pages of this heroine's inner dialogue was torturous, and not in the intended, sexy kind of way". Jessica Reaves, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote that the [...] "book's source material isn't great literature", noting that the novel is [...] "sprinkled liberally and repeatedly with asinine phrases", and described it as [...] "depressing".|$|E
