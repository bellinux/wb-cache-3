5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, {{so many of the}} reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the <b>ring</b> <b>form</b> at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
25|$|The open-chain {{form of a}} {{monosaccharide}} often coexists with {{a closed}} <b>ring</b> <b>form</b> where the aldehyde/ketone carbonyl group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a hemiacetal with a new C–O–C bridge.|$|E

25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between the top ring, called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring. A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow hitches on the crown ring and bottom <b>ring</b> <b>form</b> loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow hitches on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|E

A brass ball, {{two and a half}} inches in diameter, being made {{positively}} inductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 inches of mercury. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at high degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over the positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at last very luminous; and it also stood up like a low flame, half an inch or more in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected, assumed a <b>ring</b> <b>form,</b> like a crown {{on the top of the}} ball, appeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e. about four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place within the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor (1551. Note.).|$|E

50|$|The {{primary reason}} that {{fructose}} is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose {{has been reported}} in the range of 1.2-1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered <b>ring</b> <b>form</b> of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered <b>ring</b> <b>form</b> tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered <b>ring</b> <b>form.</b> Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at lower temperatures.|$|E
