50|$|GCDH {{is mainly}} {{known for the}} {{oxidative}} decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA and carbon dioxide, which is common in the mitochondrial oxidation of lysine, tryptophan, and hydroxylysine. The way it completes this task is {{through a series of}} physical, chemical, and electron-transfer steps. It first binds glutaryl-CoA substrate to the oxidized form of the enzyme and abstracts the alpha-proton of the substrate by the Glu370 catalytic base. Hydride is then transferred from the beta-carbon of the substrate to the N(5) of the FAD, yielding the 2e−-reduced form of FAD. Thus, this allows for the decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA, an enzyme-bound intermediate, by breaking the Cγ-Cδ bond, resulting in formation of a dienolate anion, a proton, and CO2. The dienolate intermediate is protonated, resulting in crotonyl-CoA and a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> from the active site. Finally, the 2e−-reduced form of FAD is oxidized to two 1e− steps by an external electron acceptor to complete the turnover.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} companion books to Sailor Moon. Kodansha released some of these books {{for each of the}} five story arcs, collectively called the Original Picture Collection. The books contain cover art, promotional material and other work by Takeuchi. Many of the drawings are accompanied by comments on the way she developed her ideas, created each picture and commentary on the anime interpretation of her story. Another picture collection, Volume Infinity, was released as a self-published, limited-edition artbook {{after the end of the}} series in 1997. This artbook includes drawings by Takeuchi and her friends, her staff, and many of the voice actors who worked on the anime. In 1999, Kodansha published the Materials Collection; this contained development sketches and notes for nearly every character in the manga, and for some characters that never appeared. Each drawing includes notes by Takeuchi about costume pieces, the mentality of the characters and her feelings about them. It also includes timelines for the story arcs and for the real-life <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and materials relating to the anime and manga. A short story, Parallel Sailor Moon is also featured, celebrating the year of the rabbit.|$|E
