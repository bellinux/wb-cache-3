In 1956 Trix switched to DC and in 1967 to two-rail as used by most competitors.

The Inteli-touch control included a three-button (changed later to four buttons) wall controller, a PC board inside the fan's housing, {{and a small}} piezo buzzer to emit electronic beeps to verify fan functions. The control was innovative because it had new features that could completely automate the ceiling fan, including Safe Exit, which gave the user 30 seconds to exit the room while the fan's light kit gradually dimmed to off, Fan Minder which would start the fan at a high speed and gradulally slow the fan down to its slowest speed, while still staying on, and Home Safe, which would turn the fan's light kit on and off at random times {{to make it look}} as if someone is in the home. The system also had 6 fan speed settings and variable light settings, while also offering a <b>reversing</b> <b>function.</b> This control system made its way onto many Casablanca fans, and still exists today.|$|E

Keeping the data intended for the group in confidential manner is the most important security feature need to be sustained for the group communication. An efficient group key management mechanism named as Hybrid Broadcast Group Management Protocol (HBGMP) is devised based on the <b>Reverse</b> <b>Function</b> (RF) and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The distinctive security among the subgroups is ensured by the <b>reverse</b> <b>function</b> and the session ID of each subgroup is calculated by employing Chinese remainder theorem.

The significance of this protocol is the group member needs to store only two different values during the entire life span and also the rekey message is broadcasted which brings down the communication cost to O(1). The protocol is defined generally for any applications in hybrid architecture.

40|$|AbstractFirst, {{our main}} {{result is the}} reverse theorem in {{mathematical}} programming problems, where objective and constraint functions satisfy “separability” and “strict monotonicity” in dynamic programming. Second, the <b>reverse</b> <b>functions</b> to such functions are defined anew, and their properties and explicit forms are specified. The definition of <b>reverse</b> <b>function</b> is a sequentially parametric extension of the usual definition of inverse function. Third, it is shown that a reverse operation commutes with dual and inverse operations provided that dual and inverse theorems hold, respectively. Finally, three multiconstraint main programs, together with their reverse ones, including a linear main program together with its reverse, dual and reverse-dual ones, five single-constraint main programs together with their inverse, reverse and reverse-inverse ones, and three unconditional main programs with their reverse ones are analytically solved by applications of the reverse theorem...|$|R
