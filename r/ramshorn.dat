5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (<b>Ramshorn)</b> (1824–26). In Glasgow, the <b>Ramshorn</b> Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E
5|$|John Alexander Macdonald {{was born}} in <b>Ramshorn</b> parish in Glasgow, Scotland, on 11 January 1815. His father was Hugh Macdonald, an {{unsuccessful}} merchant, who had married John's mother, Helen Shaw, on 21 October 1811. John Alexander Macdonald was the third of five children. After Hugh Macdonald's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to Kingston, in Upper Canada (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of Macdonald relatives and connections.|$|E

60|$|First {{came the}} infernal band. It {{consisted}} of five hundred performers, mounted on different animals. Never {{was such a}} melodious blast. Fifty trumpeters, mounted on zebras of all possible stripes and tints, and working away at huge <b>ramshorns</b> with their cheeks like pumpkins. Then there were bassoons mounted on bears, clarionets on camelopards, oboes on unicorns, and troops of musicians on elephants, playing on real serpents, whose prismatic bodies indulged in the most extraordinary convolutions imaginable, and whose arrowy tongues glittered with superb agitation at the exquisite sounds which they unintentionally delivered. Animals there were, too, now unknown and forgotten; but I must not forget the fellow who beat the kettledrums, mounted on an enormous mammoth, and the din of whose reverberating blows would have deadened the thunder of Olympus.|$|R
5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool <b>ramshorn</b> snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the <b>ramshorn</b> snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
25|$|Compatible fish include rudd, tench, orfe and koi, but {{the latter}} require {{specialised}} care. <b>Ramshorn</b> snails are helpful by eating any algae that {{grows in the}} pond. Without some form of animal population control, goldfish ponds can easily become overstocked. Fish such as orfe consume goldfish eggs.|$|E
2500|$|The Flying V Ranch was {{established}} in 1921 as a dude ranch, but was sold in 1935 to Gustav Koven and Paul Petzoldt, who intended to operate the ranch as a climbing school. After changing the name to the <b>Ramshorn</b> Dude Ranch, the partnership fell apart. After acquisition by the Park Service in 1956 the <b>Ramshorn</b> was operated as a concession under the Elbo Ranch name, which had been displaced from its previous location {{at the foot of}} the mountains when the original Elbo-Manges ranch was purchased and used for Park Service personnel housing. The <b>Ramshorn</b> now houses the Teton Science School. Another 1920s establishment was Leek's Lodge on upper Jackson Lake, close to the AMK, which continued to operate as a concession associated with the Signal Mountain Lodge into the 1970s. Although the Park Service had removed most of the buildings, the main lodge stood until 1998, when it was destroyed by fire, leaving only the lodge's chimney standing. The original Jackson Lake Lodge {{was established}} nearby by Eugene Amoretti, and featured the first hot and cold running water in the valley. [...] It was replaced by the present Jackson Lake Lodge in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Ramshorn</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} symbols associated with the College of Engineering. Its origins as such can be traced back to over a century ago, when T.U. Taylor, the first engineering faculty member and first dean of the College, began drawing the elaborate checkmark on students' work. A mark reserved for perfect papers, Taylor overheard a student remark he had received a [...] "ramshorn" [...] in 1905, from which the symbol took on its current interpretation and significance. For current engineering students, it is a reminder of the high quality standards associated with all UT Austin engineers, past and present.|$|E
60|$|Wise. What I have said, I {{believe is}} true, {{but as for}} the proud Dames in England that profess, they have Moses and the Prophets, and if they will not hear them, how then can we hope that they should recieve good by such a dull {{sounding}} <b>Ramshorn</b> as I am? However, I have said my mind, and now if you will, we will proceed to some other of Mr. Badmans doings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope Osborne has sown {{his wild}} oats," [...] said Mrs. Magenis to Mrs. Bunny. [...] "If a {{reformed}} rake {{makes a good}} husband, sure it's she will have the fine chance with Garge," [...] Mrs. O'Dowd remarked to Posky, who had lost her position as bride in the regiment, and was quite angry with the usurper. And as for Mrs. Kirk: that disciple of Dr. <b>Ramshorn</b> put one or two leading professional questions to Amelia, to see whether she was awakened, whether she was a professing Christian and so forth, and finding from the simplicity of Mrs. Osborne's replies that she was yet in utter darkness, put into her hands three little penny books with pictures, viz., the [...] "Howling Wilderness," [...] the [...] "Washerwoman of Wandsworth Common," [...] and the [...] "British Soldier's best Bayonet," [...] which, bent upon awakening her before she slept, Mrs. Kirk begged Amelia to read that night ere she went to bed.|$|E
60|$|They were all, however, glad {{enough to}} go to Lady Clavering's parties, when her ladyship took the Hotel Bouilli in the Rue Grenelle at Paris, and blazed out in the polite world there in the winter of 183--. The Faubourg St. Germain took her up. Viscount Bagwig, our {{excellent}} ambassador, paid her marked attention. The princes of the family frequented her salons. The most rigid and noted of the English ladies resident in the French capital acknowledged and countenanced her; the virtuous Lady Elderbury, the severe Lady Rockminster, the venerable Countess of Southdown--people, in a word, renowned for austerity, and of quite a dazzling moral purity:--so great and beneficent an influence had the possession of ten (some said twenty) thousand a year exercised upon Lady Clavering's character and reputation. And her munificence and good-will were unbounded. Anybody (in society) who had a scheme of charity was sure to find her purse open. The French ladies of piety got money from her to support their schools and convents; she subscribed indifferently for the Armenian patriarch; for Father Barbarossa, who came to Europe to collect funds for his monastery on Mount Athos; for the Baptist Mission to Quashyboo, and the Orthodox Settlement in Feefawfoo, the largest and most savage of the Cannibal Islands. And it is on record of her, that, on the same day on which Madame de Cricri got five Napoleons from her in support of the poor persecuted Jesuits, who were at that time in very bad odour in France, Lady Budelight put her down in her subscription-list for the Rev. J. <b>Ramshorn,</b> who had had a vision which ordered him to convert the Pope of Rome. And more than this, and {{for the benefit of the}} worldly, her ladyship gave the best dinners, and the grandest balls and suppers, which were known at Paris during that season.|$|E
6000|$|And, {{now having}} her new friend to herself, the impetuous Mrs. O'Dowd {{proceeded}} to pour out such {{a quantity of}} information as no poor little woman's memory could ever tax itself to bear. She told Amelia a thousand particulars relative to the very numerous family of which the amazed young lady found herself a member. [...] "Mrs. Heavytop, the Colonel's wife, died in Jamaica of the yellow faver and a broken heart comboined, for the horrud old Colonel, with a head as bald as a cannon-ball, was making sheep's eyes at a half-caste girl there. Mrs. Magenis, though without education, was a good woman, but she had the divvle's tongue, and would cheat her own mother at whist. Mrs. Captain Kirk must turn up her lobster eyes forsooth {{at the idea of}} an honest round game (wherein me fawther, as pious a man as ever went to church, me uncle Dane Malony, and our cousin the Bishop, took a hand at loo, or whist, every night of their lives). Nayther of 'em's goin' with the regiment this time," [...] Mrs. O'Dowd added. [...] "Fanny Magenis stops with her mother, who sells small coal and potatoes, most likely, in Islington-town, hard by London, though she's always bragging of her father's ships, and pointing them out to us as they go up the river: and Mrs. Kirk and her children will stop here in Bethesda Place, to be nigh to her favourite preacher, Dr. <b>Ramshorn.</b> Mrs. Bunny's in an interesting situation--faith, and she always is, then--and has given the Lieutenant seven already. And Ensign Posky's wife, who joined two months before you, my dear, has quarl'd with Tom Posky a score of times, till you can hear'm all over the bar'ck (they say they're come to broken pleets, and Tom never accounted for his black oi), and she'll go back to her mother, who keeps a ladies' siminary at Richmond--bad luck to her for running away from it! Where did ye get your finishing, my dear? I had moin, and no expince spared, at Madame Flanahan's, at Ilyssus Grove, Booterstown, near Dublin, wid a Marchioness to teach us the true Parisian pronunciation, and a retired Mejor-General of the French service to put us through the exercise." ...|$|E

It has had various names, both official and unofficial: North West Parish Kirkyard; St David's Kirkyard; and <b>Ramshorn</b> and Blackfriars. The latter name tells of its link to Blackfriars Church, linking in turn to the pre-Reformation connection to the Blackfriars Monastery in Glasgow.|$|E

50|$|The falling {{population}} of <b>Ramshorn</b> illustrates well the general {{move from the}} countryside to towns and cities. A factor in the urbanisation of Britain was increasing demand for manpower in mills and factories, coupled with changes in agriculture requiring reduced manpower.
