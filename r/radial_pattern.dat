This work tackles the {{categorization}} of general linear <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> {{by means of}} the valleys and ridges detection and the use of descriptors of directional information, which are provided by steerable filters in different regions of the image.

40|$|The <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> of 13 {{elements}} (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Co) {{were analyzed}} {{in the tree}} rings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The study site was located in an 'unpolluted' beech ecosystem in Mavrovo National Park. Thus, the obtained <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> in the beech trees {{were considered to be}} physiologically driven without significant pollution influence. The influence of the main climatic factors (temperature and rainfall) was tested. The <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> of individual trees were compared in order to find individual responses to environmental impacts. For most of the elements, higher concentrations were recorded in the pith and outer-most rings and lower in the middle part of the wood. The concentration of heavy metals was low, and followed the physiological patterns of other biogenic elements...|$|R

40|$|Summary Knowledge of {{sap flow}} {{variability}} in tree trunks {{is important for}} up-scaling transpiration from the measuring point to the whole-tree and stand levels. Natural variability in sap flow, both radial and circumferential, was studied in the trunks and branches of mature olive trees (Olea europea L., cv Coratina) by the heat field deformation method using multi-point sensors. Sapwood depth ranged from 22 to 55 mm with greater variability in trunks than in branches. Two asymmetric types of sap flow <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed: Type 1, rising to a maximum near the mid-point of the sapwood; and Type 2, falling continuously from a maximum just below cambium to zero at the inner boundary of the sapwood. The Type 1 pattern was recorded more often in branches and smaller trees. Both types of sap flow <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed in trunks of the sample trees. Sap flow <b>radial</b> <b>patterns</b> were rather stable during the day, but varied with soil water changes. A decrease in sap flow in the outermost xylem was related to water depletion in the topsoil. We hypothesized that the variations in sap flow ra-dial pattern in a tree trunk reflects a vertical distribution of wa-ter uptake that varies with water availability in different soil layers...|$|R

25|$|As {{the highest}} ground in England, Scafell Pike {{naturally}} {{has a very}} extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland to Snowdonia in Wales. The Lake District {{takes the form of}} a roughly circular upland massif deeply dissected by a broadly <b>radial</b> <b>pattern</b> of major valleys whose character is largely the product of repeated glaciations over the last 2million years. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable bedrock hollows, often with tracts of relatively flat ground at their heads. Smaller lakes known as tarns occupy glacial cirques at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District.|$|E
2500|$|Emeralds {{in antiquity}} were mined by the Egyptians and in Austria, {{as well as}} Swat in {{northern}} Pakistan. A rare type of emerald known as a trapiche emerald is occasionally found in the mines of Colombia. A trapiche emerald exhibits a [...] "star" [...] pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a six-pointed <b>radial</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is named for the trapiche, a grinding wheel used to process sugarcane in the region. Colombian emeralds are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from three main emerald mining areas in Colombia: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as Zambia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Russia.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of plants exhibits a striking symmetry, visible in the regular arrangement of leaves and flowers. Plant development is carefully controlled {{at the molecular level}} by gene regulatory networks, and the symmetry of plants can be observed also in the molecular patterns of gene expression. This thesis investigates the molecular basis for spatial patterns of gene expression in plant development with computer models. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for regulating plant development can provide important cues for developing new technologies and methods, improving conditions in agriculture and forest industry. Papers I, II and III investigates spatial gene patterns important in the creation of new plant organs such as leaves and flowers. In Paper I, signalling of the plant hormone auxin is investigated, a key player in the initiation of new plant organs. For Paper I, we developed a model, closely connected to the experimental data, explaining how the depletion of auxin can stabilize the distribution of auxin in a novel plant mutant. For Paper II, we developed a model connecting the <b>radial</b> <b>patterning</b> of the plant shoot to a model for generating peaks of auxin marking new plant organs. With this model, it was shown how the <b>radial</b> <b>patterning</b> of the shoot can restrict the initiation of new organs to a ring of cells around the meristem. Paper III investigates models for creating a mutually exclusive patterning including a gap, observed in the <b>radial</b> <b>patterning</b> of the genes KANADI and REVOLUTA in the shoot. By investigating a collection of different model interactions, we found that diffusion was required to facilitate a mutually exclusive patterning including a gap. We then mapped this result onto a biological network including the genes REVOLUTA, KANADI and diffusing microRNAs, and continued to develop an integrated model describing how the <b>radial</b> <b>patterning</b> affect the dynamics of organ initiation. Papers IV and V investigate models for the initiation of root hairs. Prior to root hair outgrowth, the root hair cells become polarized with a local patch of Rho-of-Plant proteins appearing {{at one end of the}} cell. In Paper IV, a molecular model for creating such a patch of Rho-of-Plants proteins is investigated in relation to models of mechanical stresses in root hair cells. Paper V investigates the molecular model of root hair initiation in more detail, demarcating regions of patterning, and extending the single cell model to a root hair cell file, explaining the distant polarization of root hair cells in the root...|$|R
