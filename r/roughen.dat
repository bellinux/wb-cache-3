40|$|Abstract. To {{understand}} the free surface <b>roughening</b> phenomena of polycrystalline metals, the surface <b>roughening</b> behaviors of {{three kinds of}} metal sheets were investigated under uniaxial tension. The materials used were AZ 31 magnesium alloy, SPFC 590 Y steel, and A 5052 -O aluminum alloy. In the in-situ observation of surface <b>roughening</b> for AZ 31 magnesium alloy, {{it seemed that the}} surface of each grain <b>roughened</b> independently and the roughness increases with increasing plastic strain. In contrast to A 5052 -O and SPFC, the anisotropy of free surface <b>roughening</b> was observed for AZ 31 magnesium alloy. Compared with planar anisotropy r ∆, the microscopic anisotropy of surface <b>roughening</b> is not related to r ∆. In AZ 31 magnesium alloy, the anisotropy of surface <b>roughening</b> arises and, instead of the r-value, another parameter is needed to evaluate the anisotropy of free surface <b>roughening...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of surface roughness on light scattering by Gaussian-random-rough particles. Altogether, we consider four kinds of <b>roughened</b> surfaces: small-scale or large-scale <b>roughening</b> of the particle surface layers that are either thin or thick. We have performed computations for two realistic values of refractive indices corresponding to water ice (m= 1. 313 + 0 i) and silicates (m= 1. 6 + 0. 0005 i). We vary the circumscribing-sphere size parameter xcs from 2 up to 12 {{in the case of}} silicate particles and up to 14 in the case of icy particles. For all sets of parameters, scattering of light by <b>roughened</b> particles is noticeably different from scattering by unroughened Gaussian particles. The parameter most sensitive to <b>roughening</b> is the degree of linear polarization of the scattered light when illuminated by unpolarized incident light. Except for the backscattering regime, <b>roughening</b> of particles increases the degree of polarization. Near backscattering, the dependence is more complicated. In the case of icy particles, <b>roughening</b> typically decreases the amplitude of the negative polarization surge; whereas, in the case of silicate particles, the dependence is non-monotonic: for xcs< 10, <b>roughening</b> neutralizes the surge; whereas, for xcs= 10 and 12, it makes the surge more pronounced. Particles with large spatial scale roughness produce less negative polarization than those with small-scale roughness. Particles with thin <b>roughened</b> surface layers generally produce larger negative polarization surges than those with thick layers. The intensity of scattered light is sensitive to <b>roughening</b> mostly near the backscattering although, for silicate particles with thick layers of <b>roughened</b> surface, we detect its influence also near forward scattering. In the case of icy particles, for xcs= 12 and 14, thick-layer roughness amplifies the intensity of backscattering; whereas, for other cases, <b>roughening</b> results in decreased backscattering. Particles with thick <b>roughened</b> layers produce typically more gentle angular profiles of intensity near backscattering than the unroughened particles or particles with thin <b>roughened</b> layers...|$|R

A member of the Rac family of GTPases, denoted the rotund racGAP gene, was previously identified in the rotund region.

We have isolated the rotund gene and show that it {{is a member of the}} Krppel family of zinc finger genes. The adjacent <b>roughened</b> eye locus specifically affects the eye and is genetically separable from rotund. However, <b>roughened</b> eye and rotund are tightly linked, and we have therefore also isolated the <b>roughened</b> eye transcript.

40|$|Kinetic <b>roughening</b> {{is not a}} phase {{transition}} and, as such, it lacks an exact definition. Many criteria are used to mark the onset of kinetic <b>roughening.</b> Criteria stemming from the classical two-dimensional nucleation theory are widely used. On the other hand, experimentalists observe a transition from flat to rounded crystal facets at certain driving forces. And measuring the growth rate {{as a function of}} driving force, a change from exponential to linear growth kinetics is frequently found. It is assumed that these experimental phenomena coincide with the onset of kinetic <b>roughening.</b> These experimental criteria, three classical criteria for kinetic <b>roughening</b> and statistical mechanical criteria based on the interface width and the surface roughness, are compared with each other by means of Monte Carlo simulations on a Kossel (100) SOS model. Surface diffusion is neglected, and only attachment/detachment kinetics is considered. The change from flat to rounded facets with increasing driving force turns out to be quite gradual. Nevertheless, this experimental criterion is made explicit by defining a critical driving force for which the curvature of a facet becomes visible by optical microscopy. The conditions for an experiment to detect kinetic <b>roughening</b> using this criterion are described. The different criteria for kinetic <b>roughening</b> yield different values for the critical driving force, although most of the criteria studied show a similar, almost linear, dependence of the critical driving force on the nearest neighbor bond strength.

Real-gas Navier-Stokes calculations of model flowfields, including {{laminar boundary layer}} development in these flowfields, were conducted to predict values of key dimensionless parameters used to correlate transition on such configurations in hypersonic flow. For these large bluntness cases, predicted axial distributions of the roughness Reynolds number showed (for each specified freestream pressure) that this parameter was a maximum at the physical beginning of the <b>roughened</b> zone and decreased with increasing run length along the <b>roughened</b> surface. Roughness-induced transition occurred downstream of this maximum roughness Reynolds number location, and progressed upstream towards {{the beginning of the}} <b>roughened</b> zone as freestream pressure was systematically increased. Roughness elements encountered at the upstream edge of the <b>roughened</b> frusta thus acted like a finite-extent trip array, consistent with published results concerning the tripping effectiveness of roughness bands placed on otherwise smooth surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of solid}} source {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE) lattice-matched GaInP-GaAs heterostructures has been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is shown that atomic-scale <b>roughening</b> occurs in the first several (;five) interfaces, and beyond which <b>roughening</b> is developed into micrometer-scale. The { 113 } faceted <b>roughening</b> occurs in the GaInP-on-GaAs interfaces, leading {{to the formation of}} V-shaped grooves. Dislocation dipoles are observed in the top, facet surface and bottom regions of the grooves, and there is no obvious difference. For GaInP layers exhibiting atomic-scale <b>roughening,</b> a small number of dislocations, mostly 608 -type and in a dipole configuration, are confined in a zone of approximately 5. 0 nm in width along the interface, and dislocations are rare deep inside the layers. For GaInP layers, in contrast, there is a high density of dislocations in both the regions, and it has remarkable interfacial <b>roughening.</b> Based on their distribution and configurations, the dislocations are believed to result from the compositional modulation occurred in the GaInP layers. The interplay of <b>roughening,</b> dislocations and compositional modulation has been discussed {{in the light of the}} morphological features. 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Various {{fabrication}} {{methods are}} used to improve the stability and osseointegration of screws within the host bone. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>roughened</b> surface titanium screws fabricated by electron beam melting can provide better stability and osseointegration as compared with smooth titanium screws in sheep cervical vertebrae. METHODS: <b>Roughened</b> surface titanium screws, fabricated by electron beam melting, and conventional smooth surface titanium screws were implanted into sheep for 6 or 12 weeks (groups A and B, respectively). Bone ingrowth and implant stability were assessed with three-dimensional imaging and reconstruction, as well as histological and biomechanical tests. RESULTS: No screws in either group showed signs of loosening. Fibrous tissue formation could be seen around the screws at 6 weeks, which was replaced with bone at 12 weeks. Bone volume/total volume, bone surface area/bone volume, and the trabecular number were significantly higher for a define region of interest surrounding the <b>roughened</b> screws than that surrounding the smooth screws at 12 weeks. Indeed, for <b>roughened</b> screws, trabecular number was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks. On mechanical testing, the maximum pullout strength was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks, as expected; however, no significant differences were found between smooth and <b>roughened</b> screws at either time point. The maximum torque to extract the <b>roughened</b> screws was higher than that required for the smooth screws. CONCLUSIONS: Electron beam melting is a simple and effective method for producing a <b>roughened</b> surface on titanium screws. After 12 weeks, <b>roughened</b> titanium screws demonstrated a high degree of osseointegration and increased torsional resistance to extraction over smooth titanium screws...|$|R
