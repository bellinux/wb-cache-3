40|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, {{countries}} can meet treaty obligations {{by investing in}} projects that reduce or sequester greenhouse gases elsewhere. Prior to ratification, treaty participants agreed to launch country-based pilot projects, referred to collectively as Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ), to test novel aspects of the project-related provisions. Relying on a 10 -year history of projects, the authors investigate the determinants of AIJ investment. Their findings suggest that national political objectives and possibly deeper cultural ties influenced project selection. This characterization differs from the market-based assumptions that underlie well-known estimates of cost-savings related to the Protocol's flexibility mechanisms. The authors conclude that if approaches developed under the AIJ programs to approve projects are <b>retained,</b> <b>benefits</b> from Kyoto's flexibility provisions will be less than those widely anticipated.

They taught a hybrid introductory college science course (containing online assignments) simultaneously with a traditional lecture course (containing passive lectures). Completion rates of online homework were greater than attendance rates to passive lectures, and this difference increased with higher class rank. Results suggest that hybrid course formats might be effective for increasing student attendance, particularly upperclassmen, in introductory life sciences and natural resource courses.

40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} that hinder database trigger systems from their wide deployment {{is the lack of}} tools that aid users in creating trigger rules. Similar to understanding and specifying database queries in SQL 3, it is di#cult to visualize the meaning of trigger rules. Furthermore, it is even more di#cult to write trigger rules using such text-based trigger rule language as SQL 3. In this paper, we propose TBE (Trigger-By-Example) to remedy such problems in writing trigger rules visually by using QBE (Query-By-Example) ideas. TBE is a visual trigger rule composition system that helps the users understand and specify active database triggers. TBE <b>retains</b> <b>benefits</b> of QBE while extending features to support triggers. Hence, TBE is a useful tool for novice users to create simple triggers in a visual and intuitive manner. Further, since TBE is designed to hide the details of underlying trigger systems from users, it {{can be used as a}} universal trigger interface...|$|R
