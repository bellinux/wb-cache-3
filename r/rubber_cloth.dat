25|$|The Cenote Sagrado was a {{place of}} pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, {{according}} to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought. Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed {{from the bottom of the}} cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, <b>rubber,</b> <b>cloth,</b> as well as skeletons of children and men.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1965 the Spitfire Mark II was launched. It {{was very}} similar to the Mark I but {{featured}} a more highly tuned engine, through a revised camshaft design, a water-cooled intake manifold, and tubular exhaust manifold, increasing the power to [...] at 6000 rpm. The coil-spring design clutch of the Mark I was replaced with a Borg and Beck diaphragm spring clutch; North American models retained the coil-spring housing and were also equipped with AC-Delco distributors. The exterior trim was modified with a new grille and badges. The interior trim was improved with redesigned seats and by covering most of the exposed surfaces with <b>rubber</b> <b>cloth.</b> The original moulded rubber floor coverings were replaced with moulded carpets.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} used for many productions, for example, the most common types of puppets are clay puppets, as used in The California Raisins, Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep by Aardman, and figures made of various <b>rubbers,</b> <b>cloths</b> and plastic resins, such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Sometimes even objects are used, such as with the films of Jan Švankmajer.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{he trained}} as a doctor he joined the {{business}} of his brother George. The firm of George Spill & Co. manufactured waterproof textiles in Stepney Green, East London [...] by spreading <b>rubber</b> onto <b>cloth.</b> The material was much in demand for capes and groundsheets for soldiers in the wet conditions of the Crimean War.|$|R
50|$|Stress balls, {{especially}} {{those used in}} physical therapy, can also contain gel of different densities inside a <b>rubber</b> or <b>cloth</b> skin. Another type uses a thin rubber membrane surrounding a fine powder. The latter type can be made at home by filling a balloon with baking soda. Some balls similar to a footbag are marketed and used as stress balls.|$|R

50|$|The poncho {{was first}} used {{on a regular basis}} in the 1850s for {{irregular}} U.S. military forces operating on the U.S. Western Plains. These early military ponchos were made of gutta percha muslin, a latex-coated, waterproof cloth. Ponchos made of gutta-percha or India <b>rubber</b> coated <b>cloth</b> were officially adopted during the American Civil War, both as rain clothing and as a ground sheet for sleeping. While originally intended for cavalry forces, they were widely used by infantry as well; General Sherman's Union troops, lightly equipped and living off procurement demand from the local populace, wore ponchos during wet weather encountered during the march through Confederate Georgia to the sea.|$|R
60|$|All {{were soon}} at the water's edge and looking in all {{directions}} for the missing rowboat. What had been left of the outfit had been stored in the stern and tied down with a <b>rubber</b> <b>cloth,</b> to keep off the heavy dew. They stirred up the campfire still more, and each provided himself with a firebrand as a torch.|$|E
60|$|At last Merwell and Haskers {{were within}} fifty feet {{of those around}} the dying campfire. They had been talking in a low voice, but now both were silent, as {{if this had been}} agreed upon. Merwell was {{slightly}} in advance and he pointed to the outfit of the Morr crowd. This lay between some rocks and covered with a <b>rubber</b> <b>cloth,</b> so that the eatables might not be spoiled by the weather.|$|E
60|$|The {{next few}} minutes things {{happened}} so rapidly that {{it is almost impossible}} to describe them. The bob cat rolled over and over, clawing at the <b>rubber</b> <b>cloth</b> and ripping it to shreds. The boys tried to get another shot, but did not dare to fire for fear of hitting each other. But the dog leaped in and caught the bob cat by the back of the neck, and an instant later cat and canine went whirling over the side of the boat into the waters of the lake.|$|E
50|$|Dominion started {{operations}} as Brown, Hibbard and Bourne, established in 1854. In 1866, the company registered as the Canadian Rubber Company of Montreal Limited and became prosperous manufacturing waterproof <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber</b> footwear and machinery belts.

50|$|The {{museum was}} {{established}} in 1994, and now contains a permanent {{collection of more than}} 500 French dolls. Dolls are arranged chronologically from about 1800 to the present, and feature construction of bisque, composition, <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber,</b> celluloid, and plastic. Exhibits are displayed with scale-model furniture, accessories, and toys from the appropriate periods. One room focuses on doll-making and the materials used in dolls. The museum also presents temporary exhibits and lectures.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Delgado, {{stop motion}} models where {{typically}} made from clay, which {{was difficult to}} adjust between shots. Delgado built a skeleton for his models. This skeleton was made from Dural {{and it was then}} filled in with foam <b>rubber</b> or cotton <b>cloth</b> and covered with latex to serve as skin, giving his models a more natural and realistic look, while simultaneously making it easier to handle them. Sometimes he also incorporated an inflatable bladder that helped him simulate breathing.|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be no help for it, and having {{anchored}} the rowboat {{in the middle of the}} stream, the young hunters proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible on board. They had the <b>rubber</b> <b>cloth,</b> and this they propped up on half-raised oars, making a sort of awning. They had to rest on the hard seats, with boxes and bundles between, and it was anything but comfortable. They were so close together Giant said it reminded him of sardines in a tin box. A sound sleep was out of the question, and they slumbered only by fits and starts.|$|E

50|$|Die cutting is {{the process}} of using a die to shear webs of {{low-strength}} materials, such as <b>rubber,</b> fiber, foil, <b>cloth,</b> paper, corrugated fiberboard, paperboard, plastics, pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes, foam and sheet metal. In the metalworking and leather industries, the process is known as clicking and the machine may be referred to as a clicking machine. When a dinking die or dinking machine is used, the process is known as dinking. Commonly produced items using this process include gaskets, labels, corrugated boxes, and envelopes.|$|R
25|$|A huge bust of Kong's head, neck, {{and upper}} chest {{was made of}} wood, <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber,</b> and bearskin by Delgado, E. B. Gibson, and Fred Reefe. Inside the structure, metal levers, hinges, and an air {{compressor}} were operated by three men to control the mouth and facial expressions. Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.|$|R
50|$|Falleni {{was arrested}} at a hotel {{on the corner of}} Parramatta Road and Johnston Street, Annandale on 5 July 1920. At the time of his arrest he asked to be placed in the women's cells He had been living with Lizzie in a house in Stanmore but {{requested}} that his wife be not apprised that he was not a cisgender male.

50|$|A coated {{abrasive}} comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as paper, <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber,</b> resin, polyester or even metal, {{many of which}} are flexible. Sandpaper is a very common {{coated abrasive}}. Coated abrasives are commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.|$|R
50|$|The term cable {{originally}} {{referred to}} a nautical line of specific length where multiple ropes are combined to produce a strong thick line {{that was used to}} anchor large ships. As electric technology developed, people changed from using bare copper wire to using groupings of wires and various sheathing and shackling methods that resembled the mechanical cabling so the term was adopted for electrical wiring. In the 19th century and early 20th century, electrical cable was often insulated using <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber</b> or paper. Plastic materials are generally used today, except for high-reliability power cables. The term has also come to be associated with communications because of its use in electrical communications.|$|R
5000|$|A sauna suit is {{a garment}} made from {{waterproof}} fabric {{designed to make}} the wearer sweat profusely. A sauna suit is sometimes called a [...] "rubber suit" [...] because the early types were made of <b>rubber</b> or rubberized <b>cloth.</b> Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated nylon cloth. The construction is typically {{in the style of}} a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants. The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment. In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat.|$|R

It was located in the town of Castletown, county of Richmond.|$|E
5000|$|Most bicycle rims are [...] "{{clincher}}" [...] rims for {{use with}} clincher tires. These tires have a wire or aramid (Kevlar or Twaron) fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has spoke holes, they must be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually <b>rubber,</b> <b>cloth,</b> or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.|$|E

2500|$|Since the mid-20th Century, {{advances}} in <b>rubber,</b> plastics, synthetic <b>cloth,</b> and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques. Leather, {{which had been}} the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but athletic shoes often {{have little or no}} real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on. Many of these newer materials, such as rubber and plastics, have made shoes less biodegradable. It is estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill. [...] In the late 2000s, some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from degradable materials, such as the Nike Considered.|$|R
50|$|Every level {{begins with}} the Armadillo, the goal, various nodes and, most of the time, some pieces which cannot be moved. The larger nodes are fixed in place; these are indestructible, and are used as {{mounting}} points. The player has access to rope, metal bars, metal sheets, <b>cloth,</b> <b>rubber,</b> elastic and rockets as machine building materials. The player can also change the tension {{of most of the}} components, as well as setting a timer for some of the components to break. In some levels, certain features or materials are not available. It is up to the player to ensure the structure gets the Armadillo to the goal within the budget for that level, and holds it there for five seconds.|$|R
