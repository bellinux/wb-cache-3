5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E
5|$|St. Lucia and Dominica {{activated}} their Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) response {{systems to}} help assess and correct the storm's damages. CDERA acknowledged their <b>requests</b> <b>and,</b> based on preliminary damage assessments, initiated a Level Two response which {{allowed for the}} event to be managed at the country level with regional assistance limited to technical support and resources where required. Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada also activated their CDERA response systems. Although they were not directly affected by the hurricane they used the opportunity to test the systems' operating procedures. The other affected islands of the Lesser Antilles, Martinique and Guadeloupe, are not members of CDERA.|$|E

At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mules. The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, {{for which he is}} rewarded.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{transport}} paradigm, called asynchronous multicast push (AMP) {{that leads to}} much more efficient use of network bandwidth, to higher throughput, and to reduced server load.

5|$|Archbishop Sava {{tried to}} stop the conflict. He most likely sympathized with Radoslav, as he was the {{legitimate}} ruler. However, to stop the conflict, which could become more serious, Vladislav was crowned king upon Radoslav's departure from Serbia. Thanks to Sava, Vladislav married the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Sava then abdicated in favour of his apprentice, Arsenije, at the end of 1233. Radoslav contacted Archbishop Sava, who welcomed him back to Serbia. Radoslav took monastic vows, and took the name Jovan (John). According to Teodosije, Sava did this to protect Radoslav from Vladislav. In 1235, while visiting the Bulgarian court, Sava died while {{on his way home from}} a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He was respectfully buried at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo. Sava's body was returned to Serbia after a series of <b>requests,</b> <b>and</b> was then buried in the Mileševa monastery, built by Vladislav in 1234. Sava was canonized, and his relics were considered miraculous; his cult remained throughout the Middle Ages and the Ottoman occupation.|$|E
5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the action}} the Tripolitanians had lost their three largest vessels and {{suffered}} heavy casualties, while the Sardinians only had two dead and five wounded. Later in the day while Sivori was making preparations for another attack on the city, a Dutch brig sailed out of port saluting him and signaling that it wished to communicate with him. Upon contacting the squadron, the brig's captain sent Sivori the congratulatory remarks of the British consul at Tripoli. The Sardinian commander sent the Dutch vessel back into port with a message to Karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations, further military action would be taken against the city. Rather than suffer continued action from the Sardinians, Karamanli acceded to the Sardinian <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> sent an envoy out to the Sardinian squadron.|$|E

5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information <b>requests,</b> <b>and</b> that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
5|$|In 1738, Zahir's forces {{captured}} the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule {{complained that he}} governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple <b>requests,</b> <b>and</b> that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' <b>requests</b> <b>and</b> from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

30|$|As in [1, 2], {{there is}} no {{bandwidth}} <b>request</b> <b>and</b> grant process at the downlink; bandwidth <b>request</b> <b>and</b> grant process only happens at uplink, before the uplink transmissions commence. This process involves BS and the SS that desire to perform uplink transmission. In bandwidth <b>request</b> <b>and</b> grant process, the SS initializes the process by building the bandwidth request message. The bandwidth request message is composed by counting {{the size of the}} queue or by predicting the new packet arrival [8]. The bandwidth request message that contains the information of bandwidth needed for next cycle and the corresponding CID are shown in Figure  1. CID is an essential component in IEEE 802.16 as it is used to identify a connection and transmission between BS and SS. In bandwidth <b>request</b> <b>and</b> grant, it is used to identify which SS is requesting bandwidth.|$|R
