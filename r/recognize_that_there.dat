25|$|The Church does <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are rare}} {{occasions}} when it is better that couples do separate, {{but there is no}} official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.|$|E

25|$|Among Galen's major {{contributions}} to medicine was {{his work on}} the circulatory system. He was the first to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are distinct differences between venous (dark) and arterial (bright) blood. Although his anatomical experiments on animal models led him to a more complete understanding of the circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, and other structures, his work contained scientific errors. Galen believed the circulatory system to consist of two separate one-way systems of distribution, rather than a single unified system of circulation. He believed venous blood to be generated in the liver, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. He posited that arterial blood originated in the heart, from where it was distributed and consumed by all organs of the body. The blood was then regenerated in either the liver or the heart, completing the cycle. Galen also believed in the existence of a group of blood vessels he called the rete mirabile in the carotid sinus. Both of these theories of the circulation of blood were later shown to be incorrect by Ibn al-Nafis.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

"Only {{two days}} prior to March 6, American {{capitalism}} refused to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is unemployment in the United States; but {{the determination of the}} masses to struggle under the political leadership of the Communist Party and the revolutionary trade unions force the Hoover administration and Secretary of Labor Davis to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are at least three million unemployed workers in the United States.... While the unemployed workers were mobilized on economic demands to fight for work or wages, yet the Communist Party and the revolutionary trade unions did not fail to point out that unemployment cannot be abolished under capitalism and only the destruction of capitalist state and the abolition of capitalism can solve the unemployment problem. It is precisely this political turn of the unemployment movement that American capitalism fears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Health {{advocacy}} {{also has}} 20th century roots in community organizing around health hazards {{in the environment}} and in the workplace. [...] The Love Canal Homeowners Association, for example, was founded in 1978 by Lois Gibbs and others concerned about {{the high rate of}} cancer and birth defects in the community. [...] These grass roots advocates often begin with a concern about perceived [...] "clusters" [...] of disease. [...] The Newtown Florist Club {{on the south side of}} Gainesville, Georgia was founded by women who pooled their money to buy wreaths for funerals in their community; in the 1980s they began to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were [...] "far too many deaths due to cancer and lupus in the neighborhood. [...] 'That put us on a wonder,'" [...] said one resident, and now their advocacy includes toxic tours of the community. [...] Health disparities and issues of environmental justice are often the focus of advocacy for low income and minority urban residents, and like West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT), their advocacy for environmental justice encompasses health concerns.|$|E
2500|$|In simply {{narrative}} terms, Roquentin's nausea {{arises from}} his near-complete detachment from other people, his not needing much interaction {{with them for}} daily necessities: [...] "the fact of his alienation from others is important; as his own work ceases to entertain and to occupy him, Roquentin has nothing that could distract him from the business of existing in its simplest forms." [...] As a practical matter, he could solve his problem by getting a job; but, as a device for developing the novel's theme, his aloneness {{is a way of}} making him (and the reader) <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is nothing inherent in the objective nature of the world that would give any necessary meaning to whatever actions he chose, and therefore nothing to restrict his freedom. [...] "is perception of the world around him becomes unstable as objects are disengaged from their usual frames of reference," [...] and he is forced to recognize that freedom is inescapable and that therefore creating a meaning for his life is his own responsibility. [...] "Nothing makes us act the way we do, except our own personal choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{passing of}} 1975 without {{incident}} left the Watch Tower Society {{open to new}} claims of prophetic failure. Instead of maintaining the prophetic significance of that year, however, the group's leaders embarked on a lengthy period of denial and purge, blaming rank and file membership for misreading the organization's interpretations. The Watchtower initially explained {{that the reason for}} the failure of Armageddon's arrival was due to the time lapse between the creation of Adam and Eve. Although the Society had earlier argued that the gap was [...] "weeks or months, not years", it now decided the time lapse could, after all, be years. The following year the magazine repeated its explanation, but declared the Witnesses themselves were to blame for their eager expectations about 1975 because they had misread the Bible. [...] "It was not the word of God that failed or deceived [...] and brought disappointment, but ... his own understanding was based on wrong premises." [...] In talks at conventions four years later, leading members of the Society finally acknowledged their error in the initial formulation of the prophecy, and in the March 15, 1980 Watchtower the Society said its claims about 1975 were regretted. It assigned no different interpretation to the date and demanded that its members <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> never was an explicit prophecy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{book review}} by Maximiliano Korstanje, an economist from Argentina, posits {{a more radical}} criticism on Why Nations Fail. Far from being objective, he claims, the argument of this book is based on Ethnocentrism, or Anglocentrism—that other non-Western civilizations will converge to the universal Western ideal of development, democracy and human rights. Acemoglu and Robinson, he argues, fail to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are many other nations that are free to choose to live in another way; there is no imperative stating that all nations should be democratic to enjoy the “benefits” of modern life and a capitalist economy. Indeed, paradoxically, envisaging democracy as a [...] "universal value" [...] is a betrayal to the self-determination of others, which Korstanje sees as the very cornerstone of democratic ideology. In his view, defining a nation's success {{as a function of}} its degree of wealth or per capita income corresponds directly to an [...] "ethnocentric" [...] mechanism within the discipline, aimed at creating a need in non-western societies, namely, the [...] "need" [...] to be [...] "economically developed," [...] "modern" [...] and [...] "democratic." [...] There is no genuine attempt for a critical discussion of the role of international financial corporations like the World Bank in issuing an unlimited number of loans to the world. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson are not treating the problem of inequality with accuracy and detail. The Gini coefficient list shows how some Latin American countries such as Uruguay are more egalitarian than the United States. Moreover, inside the United States, despite the high level of economic development and the democratic system, black people are often excluded from such benefits, reaffirming the ethnocentric nature of democracy and development.|$|E
