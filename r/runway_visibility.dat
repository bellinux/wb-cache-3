40|$|Adequately {{presenting}} {{all necessary}} information on an approach chart represents {{a challenge for}} cartographers. Since many tasks associated with using approach charts are cognitive (e. g., planning the approach and monitoring its progress), and since the characteristic of a successful interface is one that conforms to the users' mental models, understanding pilots' underlying models of approach chart information would greatly assist cartographers. To provide such information, a new methodology was developed for this study that enhances traditional information requirements analyses by combining psychometric scaling techniques with a simulation task to provide quantifiable links between pilots' cognitive representations of approach information and their use of approach information. Results of this study should augment previous information requirements analyses by identifying what information is acquired, when it is acquired, and what presentation concepts might facilitate its efficient use by better matching the pilots' cognitive model of the information. The primary finding in this study indicated that pilots mentally organize approach chart information into ten primary categories: communications, geography, validation, obstructions, navigation, missed approach, final items, other <b>runways,</b> <b>visibility</b> requirement, and navigation aids. These similarity categories were found to underlie the pilots' information acquisitions, other mental models, and higher level cognitive processes {{that are used to}} accomplish their approach and landing tasks...|$|R

50|$|The {{weather in}} Fredericton was difficult—reported weather gave 100 ft of {{vertical}} visibility and 1/8 {{of a mile}} in horizontal visibility. With the runway lights, the <b>runway</b> <b>visibility</b> was 1200 ft for landing on runway 15. At 200 ft above ground level the captain approved the landing and the first officer, who was the pilot flying, responded that he would land the plane. Once the first officer disengaged the autopilot the aircraft drifted off the centre line of the runway and as the plane approached 80 ft above ground level the first officer reduced the engine thrust to idle speed. The captain, knowing the plane was off centre and unsure how much runway was left, ordered a go-around.|$|E

Furthermore, the air crew did not turn on the Instrument Landing System on the aircraft due to increased workload which was exacerbated further due to the different cockpit switch configuration between the A300 owned by Malaysia Airlines & that of the crashed aircraft, which was leased from Scandinavian Airlines System.|$|E
40|$|Flight {{simulators}} {{capable of}} displaying infrared (IR) and millimeter wave radar (MMWR) images {{will be required}} for training flight crews {{in the use of}} enhanced vision system (EVS) before operational EVS find their way into cockpits. Such flight simulators require IR and MMWR sensor models to simulate the images of the scene seen by them. This report presents the physics based IR and MMWR sensor models to simulate the images. These models generates images by computing the energy levels detected by the sensors (in case of IR) and the power returned by the objects (in case of MMWR) based on various environmental factors like position of sun, ambient temperature, latitude, time of the day, weather conditions, objects material properties etc. Commercially available software package MODTRAN- 5 has been used to compute atmospheric attenuation affecting IR sensor image for different weather condition like fog and rain. Using these concepts IR and MMWR image simulator have been developed in VC++ and interfaced with desktop Flightgear using UDP network protocol to generate IR and MMWR sensor images in real time. IR/MMWR images were simulated under winter as well as summer seasons, fog and rain conditions. The results are presented for different time-of-day, different <b>runway</b> <b>visibility</b> conditions due to fog and rain rate using simulated data. Validation with real data of IR images is under progress...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision System (SVS/EFVS) {{technologies}} {{have the potential}} to provide additional margins of safety for aircrew performance and enable operational improvements for low visibility operations in the terminal area environment with equivalent efficiency as visual operations. To meet this potential, research is needed for effective technology development and implementation of regulatory and design guidance to support introduction and use of SVS/EFVS advanced cockpit vision technologies in Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. A fixed-base pilot-in-the-loop simulation test was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center that evaluated the use of SVS/EFVS in NextGen low visibility ground (taxi) operations and approach/landing operations. Twelve crews flew approach and landing operations in a simulated NextGen Chicago O Hare environment. Various scenarios tested the potential for EFVS for operations in visibility as low as 1000 ft <b>runway</b> <b>visibility</b> range (RVR) and SVS to enable lower decision heights (DH) than can currently be flown today. Expanding the EFVS visual segment from DH to the runway in visibilities as low as 1000 RVR appears to be viable as touchdown performance was excellent without any workload penalties noted for the EFVS concept tested. A lower DH to 150 ft and/or possibly reduced visibility minima by virtue of SVS equipage appears to be viable when implemented on a Head-Up Display, but the landing data suggests further study for head-down implementations...|$|E

2500|$|Plans for {{the airport}} were drawn up in 1953, work started in January 1954, and by mid-1957 it was found {{possible}} to bring the operational date forward to mid-March 1958. The task {{was by no means}} straightforward, and many problems —largely of a civil engineering nature—had to be overcome before the runway could be built. The site chosen, on a great lava plain, is a pilot's and a controller's dream: eleven miles from the centre of Nairobi (the city's two other airports, Eastleigh and Nairobi West, are closer), its approaches are free from any obstruction for at least 17 miles in any direction. The nearest mountain ("high ground" [...] would be a misnomer when Embakasi itself is 5,327ft AMSL) is 25 miles away, and 10 deg off the <b>runway</b> centre-line. <b>Visibility</b> rarely falls below this obstruction-distance in the clear air of the plains, and it may have been possible to see the summit of Mount Meru in Northern Tanganyika, about 140 miles away; both Kilimanjaro (115 n.m. away) and Mount Kenya could be clearly seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{autoland}} {{flows from the}} fact that an autopilot could be set up to track an artificial signal such as an Instrument Landing System (ILS) beam more accurately than a human pilot could - not least because of the inadequacies of the electro-mechanical flight instruments of the time. If the ILS beam could be tracked to a lower height then clearly the aircraft would be nearer to the runway when it reached the limit of ILS usability, and nearer to the <b>runway</b> less <b>visibility</b> would be required to see sufficient cues to confirm the aircraft position and trajectory. With an angular signal system such as ILS, as altitude decreases all tolerances must be decreased - in both the aircraft system and the input signal - to maintain the required degree of safety. This is because certain other factors - physical and physiological laws which govern for example the pilot's ability to make the aircraft respond - remain constant. For example, at 300 feet above the runway on a standard 3 degree approach the aircraft will be 6000 feet from the touchdown point, and at 100 feet it will be 2000 feet out. If a small course correction needs 10 seconds to be effected at 180kts it will take 3000 ft. It will be possible if initiated at 300 feet of height, but not at 100 feet. Consequently, only a smaller course correction can be tolerated at the lower height, and the system needs to be more accurate.|$|R

40|$|Earthquakes {{are one of}} nature’s most {{destructive}} forces. However, small earthquakes associated with volcanic eruptions can be very useful {{as a predictor of}} eruptive activity, and can warn scientists, emergency managers, and the public that a big eruption may be about to begin. For instance, the recent large eruption of Mount Etna, Italy’s highest and most vo-luminous volcano, was preceded by the largest swarm of earth-quakes seen at this volcano in the last 20 years. Increased earth-quake, or seismic, activity was observed on Mt. Etna starting on July 13, 2001. Over a two-day period, more than 2, 500 earth-quakes were recorded, many of which were felt in nearby towns. Warnings were issued. On July 17, a major flank eruption began, generating explosive activity and lava flows from five separate fis-sure vents on the volcano’s flank. The lava flows destroyed roads and structures, and ash from explosive activity fell in towns up to 25 kilometers away. A nearby international airport had to be closed because ash was covering <b>runways</b> and obscuring <b>visibility.</b> Ash is also dangerous to aircraft engines. Why are earthquakes associat-ed with volcanic activity? Magma movement within the upper 10 kilometers of the earth stresses the crust, generating movement that radiates elastic waves to the Camera recording volcanic eruptions on the outer rim of Mt. Erebus, Antarctica. Images of eruptions are used to help interpret seismic activity in the volcano...|$|R
5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident {{was a lack of}} proper crew coordination, including a virtual reversal of roles by the DC-9 pilots, which led to their failure to stop taxiing their airplane and alert the ground controller of their positional uncertainty in a timely manner before and after intruding onto the active runway.Contributing to the cause of the accident were (1) deficiencies in the air traffic control services provided by the Detroit tower, including failure of the ground controller to take timely action to alert the local controller to the possible <b>runway</b> incursion, inadequate <b>visibility</b> observations, failure to use progressive taxi instructions in low-visibility conditions, and issuance of inappropriate and confusing taxi instructions compounded by inadequate backup supervision for the level of experience of the staff on duty; (2) deficiencies in the surface markings, signage, and lighting at the airport and the failure of Federal Aviation Administration surveillance to detect or correct any of these deficiencies; and (3) failure of Northwest Airlines, Inc., to provide adequate cockpit resource management training to their line aircrews.Contributing to the fatalities in the accident was the inoperability of the DC-9 internal tail cone release mechanism. Contributing to the number and severity of injuries was the failure of the crew of the DC-9 to properly execute the passenger evacuation.|$|R
40|$|The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is an {{augmentation}} of the Global Positioning System (GPS) {{to allow}} for precision approach and landing at airports. Stanford University has, with support from U. S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), developed a real time prototype of the LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) known as the Integrity Monitor Testbed (IMT). It is used to evaluate whether the LGF can meet the integrity and continuity requirements that apply to aircraft Category I precision approach (i. e. close to the <b>runway,</b> but non-zero <b>visibility).</b> The first generation IMT system was designed in the mid- 1990 s. Since that date computational power and, to a somewhat lesser extent, receiver technology has evolved dramatically. The dated processing platform and Radio Frequency (RF) hardware limit further progress. Therefore, a transition to a new and improved system is needed to further continue development and testing for Category I precision approach and {{to use as a}} starting point for Category II/III LGF development. This thesis describes the design goals and motivation behind the second-generation IMT system, known as IMT 2. The hardware upgrade involves new L 1 /L 2 antennas, low-loss antenna cables, new L 1 and L 2 -upgradeable GPS receivers, and a new computer platform. Considerable effort was placed on the computer platform as this is the element that has experienced the most advanced since the first prototype. The computer platform was designed to provide additional flexibility, incorporated new GPS hardware, and enhance the development environment. One key element of the upgrade has been the addition of new software to communicate with the receivers. This function, known as Signal-in-Space Receive and Decode 2 (SISRAD 2), is now a modular means of integrating different receiver types, providing synchronization of receiver measurement packets, and fits the measurement packets into a single IMT 2 data format.
