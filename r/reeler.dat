5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the cortical plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in <b>reeler</b> mutant mice show that knocking out the <b>reeler</b> gene results in aberrant migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past the older ones. Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in cortical migration of the developing embryo.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{infrequent}} {{playing of}} women's Test cricket outside of Australia, England and New Zealand, cumulative records, {{such as the}} most runs during a career, are dominated by players from those three nations. England's Jan Brittin has scored the most runs during her career, totalling 1,935 during her 27 matches, and 18 of the top twenty players come from either Australia, England or New Zealand. The Australian batsman Denise Annetts, who is 15th on that list, has the highest batting average, 81.90, from her ten matches. Annetts was also involved in the largest partnership in women's Test cricket, sharing a stand of 309 runs with Lindsay <b>Reeler</b> in 1987.

2500|$|It {{was found}} {{later that the}} {{mutation}} causing these disorders was located in the RELN gene which codes for reelin, a glycoprotein secreted by Cajal–Retzius cells in the developing brain. This protein seems {{to act as a}} stop signal for migrating neurons, controlling the positioning and orientation of neurons in their layers, according to the inside-out pattern of development. When the mutation occurs, reelin expression is reduced and this signal isn’t as strong, therefore, migration of the first neurons in the brain is not done correctly.

2500|$|Lissencephaly {{results from}} {{defective}} neuronal migration {{between the first}} and second trimester of gestation which causes lack of gyral and sulcal development, as well as improper lamination, giving the brain a smooth appearance.

Apparently Cajal–Retzius cells are not affected in [...] mutations in the LIS1 gene, even though the product of this gene interferes with reelin interaction with their receptors. Mutations in the RELN gene appear in the autosomal form of lissencephaly with cerebral hypoplasia, where patients show developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia and seizures, symptoms which can be related to the <b>reeler</b> mutant.|$|E

In early cortical development in mice, mutations of Dab1, VLDLR, and ApoER2, generate similar abnormal phenotypes, called [...] reeler-like phenotype. It performs several abnormal processes in brain development, such as forming an outside to inside gradient, forming cells in an oblique orientation.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of cross-prefectural {{differences}} in financial integration on the regional spread of Japan’s Great Recession in the early 1990 s. In prefectures with many small manufacturing firms, post- 1990 growth was significantly lower if low levels of banking integration {{with the rest of the}} country before 1990 existed. The least financially integrated and most credit-dependent prefectures also saw the largest declines in lending by major banks operating nationwide. This suggests that financing frictions were more severe in less financially integrated regions. We then show that cross-prefectural differences in financial integration in the late 20 th century can be explained by regionally different pathways to financial development after Japan’s opening in the late 19 th century. Silk reeling emerged as Japan’s main export industry after 1868. The silk industry was heavily dependent on credit for working capital, but silk <b>reelers</b> in the mountainous regions of central Japan generally could not borrow from the large banks in Yokohama or the other major cities. Instead, they either formed local credit cooperatives or local banks were founded with the help of Yokohama silk merchants who then effectively provided the silk <b>reelers</b> with trade credit. The silk regions therefore embarked on a path to financial development in which banking remained centered on a largely mutual or cooperative model and in which banks borrow and lend mainly regionally. Thus, the banking system of the late 19 th-century silk-exporting regions was effectively less financially integrated wit...|$|R
