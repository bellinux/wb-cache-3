It is a non-profit and volunteer run initiative [...] and {{is set to}} coincide with a break in fixtures within the football calendar when the Premier League and Championship sides do not have games. This is so that international fixtures can be played and top level players will be on international duty. It has received widespread backing from the Premier League and from Football League clubs as well as MPs, media organisations, charities and from non-league clubs themselves. The Football Association also gives its backing to the campaign. Clubs often look to this day for a boost in attendance figures and offer <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> prices to fans of other clubs for games played on Non-League Day. Clubs can also offer incentives for fans to attend. In August 2014 Bungay Town handed-out mushrooms to supporters attending their match with Martham in the Anglian Combination League Division Two doubling their normal match-day attendance to 100.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel compact passive modeling technique for high-performance RF passive and interconnect circuits modeled as high-order resistor–inductor– capacitor–mutual inductance circuits. The new method {{is based on}} a recently proposed general s-domain hierarchical modeling and analysis method and vector potential equivalent circuit model for self and mutual inductances. Theoretically, this paper shows that s-domain hierarchical reduction is equivalent to implicit moment matching at around s = 0 and that the existing hierarchical reduction method by one-point expansion is numerically stable for general tree-structured circuits. It is also shown that hierarchical reduction preserves the reciprocity of passive circuit matrices. Practically, a hierarchical multipoint reduction scheme to obtain accurate-order <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrices of general passive circuits is proposed.

Therefore <b>reduced</b> <b>admittances</b> match the low-order terms in exact admittances. First-order realization of admittances is guaranteed, and higher-order realization is achieved by template optimization using Geometric Programming. The algorithm uniquely uses common-factor identification and cancelation operations to make Y- transformation numerically stable.

As the stapes is ankylosed in otosclerosis, the lateral end of the ossicular chain may still be quite mobile. Therefore, otosclerosis may only slightly <b>reduce</b> the <b>admittance,</b> resulting in either a shallow tympanogram (type AS), or a normal tympanogram (type A). Otosclerosis increases in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency tympanometry. Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as otosclerosis can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.|$|R

In this work, we first apply state-space based optimization technique to enforce passivity on the hierarchical model order <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix. To realize the passivity-enforced admittance, we propose a general multi-port network realization method based on relaxed one-port network synthesis technique based on Foster’s canonical form.

We derive sufficient conditions relating synchronization in a power network directly to the underlying network state, parameters, and topology. In particular, we provide a spectral condition based on the algebraic connectivity of the network and a second condition based on the effective resistance among generators. These conditions build upon the authors’ earlier results on synchronization in network-reduced power system models. Central to our analysis is the <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix of the network, which is obtained by a Schur complement of the network’s topological admittance matrix with respect to its bus nodes.

The <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix is obtained by a Schur complement of the topological network admittance matrix with respect to its bus nodes. We provide a detailed spectral, algebraic, and graph-theoretic analysis of this network reduction process, termed Kron reduction, with particular focus on the effective resistance.

If the mobility of the stapes is reduced due to otosclerosis, then stapedius muscle contraction does not significantly decrease the admittance. When acoustic reflex testing is conducted, the acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) cannot be determined when attempting to measure on the affected side. Also, a conductive pathology will attenuate the test stimuli, resulting in either elevated reflex thresholds or absent reflexes when the stimulus is presented in the affected ear and measured in the other ear.|$|R

40|$|In a large {{interconnected}} power system, disturbances {{initiated by}} a fault or other events cause acceleration in the generator rotors {{with respect to}} their synchronous reference frame. This acceleration of rotors can be described by two different dynamic phenomena, as shown in existing literature. One of the phenomena is simultaneous acceleration and the other is electromechanical wave propagation, which is characterized by travelling waves in terms of a wave equation. This paper demonstrates that depending on the structure of the system, the exhibited dynamic response will be dominated by one phenomenon or the other or a mixture of both. Two system structures of choice are examined, with each structure exemplifying each phenomenon present to different degrees in their dynamic responses. Prediction of dominance of either dynamic phenomenon in a particular system can be determined by taking into account the relative sizes of the values of its <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix...|$|E

These losses are properly and fairly shared between network buses for fair loss allocation {{in proportion to the}} percent of penetration the currents of each bus. Furthermore, using partial derivatives of the active power losses with respect to the bus currents’ coefficients, a sensitivity analysis has been done for proving the fairness of the proposed method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel compact modeling technique for linear(ized) active analog circuits. The new method {{is based on}} a recently proposed general s-domain hierarchical modeling and analysis method. In this work, based on the characteristics of analog circuits, we propose a constrained linear least square based method to optimize the order <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrices with respect to both magnitude and phase responses up to the given frequency range. Theoretically we show that the hierarchical reduction does not change the reciprocity property of the linear circuit. For analog active circuits, which typically are non-reciprocal, so do the orderreduced circuit admittance matrices after hierarchical reduction. We propose a novel general multi-port, non-reciprocal network realization method. The resulting modeling algorithm can take in the SPICE netlists of active circuits and generate high-fidelity compact macro models of the active circuits with easily controlled model accuracy and complexity.

Gaussian elemination is applied to <b>reduce</b> the bus <b>admittance</b> matrix of the network. The reduced network will contain only buses of primary interest - that is of the analysed contract.

40|$|To enable an {{efficient}} stochastic-based design optimization methodology for multi-scale structures of electrical devices and systems, we propose {{the infusion of}} stochastic modeling with the electromagnetic macro-model in the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. We provide a methodology for the efficient generation and utilization of the stochastic macro-model {{for the purpose of}} time-domain analysis in FDTD. The methodology quantifies the impact of uncertainty, manifested as random material and structural variations in the design and manufacturing process of the realized system, on the stochastic system's electromagnetic performance. In {{the current state of the}} art, and in absence of the stochastic macro-model, it is necessary to perform repeated discretization of the large deterministic domain for every random variation in the small fine-featured stochastic domain. The development of the stochastic macro-model eliminates the need for repeated discretization of the overall structure for every such random variation. Indeed, only a single FDTD grid needs to be developed for the deterministic portion of the overall structure irrespective of the realization generated by a specific choice of the random parameters in the domains exhibiting statistical variability; thus, the macro-model results in significant computational savings by eliminating operations pertaining to repeated discretization of the deterministic domain for each variation in the stochastic domain. In essence, the macro-model is a state-space representation of the discretized Maxwell's equations which encapsulates a certain fine-featured region of a multi-scale structure, in the FDTD grid. To enhance the computational efficiency of this state-space abstraction layer we apply a modified embodiment of the model order reduction (MOR) technique, known as enhanced nodal order reduction (ENOR), to minimize the internal degrees of freedom of the abstraction layer while maintaining sufficient engineering accuracy in the system response. ENOR provides a passive <b>reduced</b> order <b>admittance</b> boundary condition model which expedites the efficient computation of field quantities in the fine-featured regions. To enable cost-effective and high-accuracy FDTD simulations involving design and manufacturing variations of disparate spatial scales, the method of sub-gridding is utilized, with the stochastic macro-model implemented in the sub-gridded region. To enable the insertion of the high spatial-resolution stochastic macro-model inside the FDTD grid, a class of isotropic spatial filters is developed to suppress the spurious noise waves which are generated by the discrete wave-impedance mismatch at the boundary of the macro-model. To this end, we develop a class of spatial filter operators that: (a) are straightforward to design and implement within the existing Yee style FDTD explicit time-stepping scheme; (b) do not require complicated spatial/temporal interpolation in the field update equations; (c) are able to accommodate broadband electromagnetic sources; (d) exhibit spatial isotropy in their suppression of the spurious numerical reflections while preserving the pertinent portions of the signal's power spectral density...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} new hydrogen- and polarity-related {{effects in}} the photoluminescence of ZnO single crystal wafers {{and the relationship between}} surface electron accumulation and surface hydroxyl coverage on different ZnO surfaces. A comparative study of the low temperature photoluminescence of various types of hydrothermal and melt-grown ZnO wafers revealed several new hydrogen-related exciton recombination lines and a number of consistent polarity-related differences in the PL emission from different crystallographic surfaces. Temperature-dependent PL measurements were extensively used to distinguish the ground and excited state transitions involved in these effects. ZnO samples of different surface polarity were annealed in oxygen and nitrogen gases and in hydrogen-containing forming gas mixtures in an attempt to identify the origin of these new PL features. The well known aluminium-related I_₆ recombination line was resolved into two separate features in hydrothermal ZnO, and the new component I 6 -H (3. 36081 eV) was found to repeatedly quench and then re-emerge after annealing in oxygen and forming gas, respectively. A model involving an aluminium - lithium - hydrogen defect complex was proposed for I 6 -H and further tested via hydrogen and deuterium implantation experiments on hydrothermal ZnO wafers with different lithium concentrations. These experiments also provided evidence for the involvement of a different lithium-hydrogen defect complex in other hydrogen-related emission lines I₄b,c (3. 36219 eV and 3. 36237 eV) unique to hydrothermal ZnO. In addition, a broad Gaussian-shaped feature observed in the near-band-edge PL emission from the O-polar (000 ‾ 1), a-plane (11 ‾ 20) and r-plane (1 ‾ 102) faces of ZnO was shown to be surface sensitive and also related to hydrogen. The involvement of hydrogen in the chemical and electronic properties of different ZnO surfaces was also investigated. The thermal stability of the hydroxyl termination and the associated downward surface band bending on the polar and non-polar surfaces of ZnO was studied by synchrotron and real-time photoelectron spectroscopy, both during and after annealing and subsequent H₂O/H₂ dosing in ultra-high vacuum conditions. On the O-polar face, the band bending could be reversibly switched over a range of approximately 0. 8 eV by adjusting the surface H-coverage using simple UHV heat treatments and atmospheric exposure. A transition from electron accumulation to electron depletion on the O-polar face was observed at a H-coverage of approximately 0. 9 monolayers. In contrast, the downward band bending on the Zn-polar face was signiﬁcantly more resilient and electron-depleted surfaces could not be prepared by heat treatment alone. This was also the case for in situ cleaving in UHV conditions which failed to produce hydroxyl-free surfaces due to migration of hydrogen from the bulk to the cleaved surface. Interestingly, the thermal stability of the hydroxyl termination on the a-plane (11 ‾ 20) and m-plane (10 ‾ 10) surfaces was signiifcantly lower than on the polar faces due to the availability of a lower energy desorption pathway and the electrostatic stability of these non-polar surfaces in their clean, bulk terminated form. The surface band bending on the non-polar ZnO surfaces was also found to be directly related to their OH coverage with a transition from downward to upward band bending, similar to that observed on the O-polar face, as the OH coverage was <b>reduced.</b> Thermal <b>admittance</b> spectroscopy and deep level transient spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of lithium removal on the defect nature of hydrothermal ZnO. A number of new defects were introduced by the high temperature (1100 - 1400 °C) annealing/re-polishing process used to reduce the lithium concentration, particularly E₁₉₀ (also known as T 2) which is thought to be related to Zn vacancies. Significantly, both the E₅₀ defect level and the I 6 -H PL emission line were absent after lithium (and hydrogen) removal suggesting an association of both these features with the same aluminium - lithium - hydrogen defect complex...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} model order reduction (MOR) algorithm, called MTermMOR, for modeling interconnect circuits with {{large number of}} external ports. The proposed method overcomes the difficulty associated with Krylov subspace based projection MOR methods for reducing circuits with many ports. The novelty of the proposed method lies {{on the fact that}} we separately compute the poles and residues of each transfer function in the <b>reduced</b> <b>admittance</b> matrices. Specifically we apply traditional subspace projection method for computing poles and use hierarchical symbolic analysis for computing frequency responses of admittances to determine the residues of transfer functions. In this way, we only use necessary poles (smaller number of poles) to archive the same accuracy than subspace projection based methods. Finally convex programming based optimization is used to enforce the passivity of the reduced models. The new method can lead to much smaller reduced models for a given frequency range or much higher accuracy given the same model sizes than subspace projection based methods for multi-port interconnect circuits. Experimental results on several industry interconnect circuits demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over the subspace projection based methods...|$|E
