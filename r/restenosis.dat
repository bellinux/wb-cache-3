5|$|However, {{there is}} {{continued}} interest in vascular brachytherapy for persistent <b>restenosis</b> in failed stents and vein grafts.|$|E
5|$|In {{treating}} In-stent <b>restenosis</b> (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) {{have been}} found to be superior to Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT).|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of coronary in-stent <b>restenosis,</b> in which a catheter is placed inside blood vessels, through which sources are inserted and removed.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) such as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular brachytherapy) {{for the treatment of}} coronary in-stent <b>restenosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{further reduce}} the {{incidence}} of <b>restenosis,</b> drug-eluting stents (DES) were introduced which consisted of stents coated in anti proliferative agents. Animal studies and later clinical trials showed a reduction in <b>restenosis</b> to approximately 5%.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of a {{coronary}} stent is typically attributed to Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart when they implanted a stent into a patient in Toulouse, France in 1986. It {{was used as a}} scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid <b>restenosis</b> in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in Germany. The use of these bare-metal stents helped reduce the incidence of <b>restenosis</b> from 30–40% in coronary surgery to 20–30%.|$|E
25|$|CYR61 is overexpressed in {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} cells of atherosclerotic lesions {{and in the}} neointima of <b>restenosis</b> after balloon angioplasty, both in rodent models and in humans. Suppression of CYR61 expression results in reduced neointimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty, an effect that is reversed by delivery of CYR61 via gene transfer In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, expression of CYR61 in the vitreous humor produced significant beneficial effects in repairing damaged vasculature.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular <b>restenosis,</b> and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the high}} use of intracoronary stents during PCI procedures, {{the focus of}} {{treatment}} changed from procedural success to prevention of recurrence of disease in the treated area (in-stent <b>restenosis).</b> [...] By the late 1990s it was generally acknowledged among cardiologists {{that the incidence of}} in-stent <b>restenosis</b> was between 15 and 30%, and possibly higher in certain subgroups of individuals. [...] Stent manufacturers experimented with (and continue to experiment with) a number of chemical agents to prevent the neointimal hyperplasia that is the cause of in-stent <b>restenosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} the same time, Cordis (a division of Johnson & Johnson) was developing the Cypher stent, a stent that would release sirolimus (a chemotherapeutic agent) over time. [...] The first study of these individuals revealed an incredible lack of <b>restenosis</b> (zero percent <b>restenosis)</b> at six months. [...] This led to the approval for the stent {{to be used in}} Europe in April 2002. [...] Further trials with the Cypher stent revealed that <b>restenosis</b> did occur in some individuals with high risk features (such as long areas of stenosis or a history of diabetes mellitus), but that the <b>restenosis</b> rate was significantly lower than with bare metal stents (3.2 percent compared to 35.4 percent). [...] About a year after approval in Europe, the United States FDA approved the use of the Cypher stent as the first drug-eluting stent for use in the general population in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{immediate}} results of PBMV are often quite gratifying, the procedure {{does not provide}} permanent relief from mitral stenosis. Regular follow-up is mandatory, to detect <b>restenosis.</b> [...] Long-term follow-up data from patients undergoing PBMV indicates that up to 70-75% individuals can be free of <b>restenosis</b> 10 years following the procedure. The number falls to about 40% 15 years post-PBMV.|$|E
2500|$|The {{antiproliferative}} {{effect of}} sirolimus {{has also been}} {{used in conjunction with}} coronary stents to prevent <b>restenosis</b> in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty. [...] The sirolimus is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention. [...] Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower <b>restenosis</b> rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. A sirolimus-eluting coronary stent was marketed by Cordis, a division of Johnson & Johnson, under the tradename Cypher. [...] However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|Trials of heparin-coated stents {{could not}} match the {{significant}} decrease in <b>restenosis</b> rates seen with the Cypher and Taxus stents. [...] With the increased supply in the chemotherapeutic drug-eluting stents available, the use of heparin-coated stents waned.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{products}} of the new focus on preventing late events (such as in stent <b>restenosis</b> and late thrombosis) was the heparin-coated Palmaz-Schatz stent. [...] These coated stents {{were found to have}} a lower incidence of subacute thrombosis than bare metal stents.|$|E
2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{development}} of the Cypher stent, Boston Scientific started development of the Taxus stent. [...] The Taxus stent was the Express2 metal stent, which was in general use for a number of years, with a copolymer coating of paclitaxel that inhibited cell replication. [...] As with the Cypher stent before it, the first trials of the Taxus stent revealed no evidence of in-stent <b>restenosis</b> at six months after the procedure, while later studies showed some <b>restenosis,</b> at a rate much lower than the bare metal counterpart. [...] Based on these trials, the Taxus stent was approved for use in Europe in 2003. [...] With further study, the FDA approved the use of the Taxus stent in the United States in March 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{occurred}} less frequently than with balloon angioplasty or other techniques, stents nonetheless remained vulnerable to <b>restenosis,</b> caused almost exclusively by neointimal tissue growth. To address this issue, developers of drug-eluting stents used the devices {{themselves as a}} tool for delivering medication directly to the arterial wall. [...] While initial efforts were unsuccessful, the release (elution) of drugs with certain specific physicochemical properties from the stent was shown in 2001 to achieve high concentrations of the drug locally, directly at the target lesion, with minimal systemic side effects. [...] As currently used in clinical practice, [...] "drug-eluting" [...] stents refers to metal stents that elute a drug designed to limit the growth of neointimal scar tissue, thus reducing the likelihood of stent <b>restenosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{is mainly}} to inhibit neointimal growth (due to {{proliferation}} of smooth muscle cells) which would cause <b>restenosis.</b> [...] Much of the neointimal hyperplasia {{seems to be}} caused by inflammation. Hence, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative drugs are used. Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus were previously used for other medical applications and have been included in licensed DES.|$|E
2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} <b>restenosis</b> due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. [...] <b>Restenosis</b> is the body's response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. [...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, plain old balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the <b>restenosis</b> reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. [...] Abbott Laboratories has used a dissolvable material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drug-eluting}} stent (DES) is {{a peripheral}} or coronary stent (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases {{a drug to}} block cell proliferation. This prevents fibrosis that, together with clots (thrombi), could otherwise block the stented artery, a process called <b>restenosis.</b> [...] The stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an interventional cardiologist or interventional radiologist during an angioplasty procedure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of {{coronary}} angioplasty, {{there were a number of}} serious complications. [...] Abrupt vessel closure after balloon angioplasty occurred in approximately 1% of cases, often necessitating emergency bypass surgery. Vessel dissection was a frequent issue as a result of improper sizing of the balloon relative to the arterial diameter. [...] Late <b>restenosis</b> occurred in as many as 30% of individuals who underwent PTCA, often causing recurrence of symptoms necessitating repeat procedures.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was quickly}} {{realized}} that <b>restenosis</b> rates were significantly lower in individuals who received an intracoronary stent when {{compared to those who}} underwent just balloon angioplasty. [...] A damper on the immediate use of intracoronary stents was subacute thrombosis. [...] Subacute thrombosis rates with intracoronary stents proved to be about 3.7 percent, higher than the rates seen after balloon angioplasty. [...] Post-procedure bleeding was also an issue, due to the intense combination of anticoagulation and anti-platelet agents used to prevent stent thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-eluting stents [...] {{in current}} {{clinical}} use {{were approved by}} the FDA after clinical trials showed they were statistically superior to bare-metal stents [...] {{for the treatment of}} native coronary artery narrowings, having lower rates of major adverse cardiac events [...] (usually defined as a composite clinical endpoint of death + myocardial infarction + repeat intervention because of <b>restenosis).</b> The first drug-eluting stents to be approved in Europe and the U.S. were coated with paclitaxel or an mTOR inhibitor, such as sirolimus.|$|E
2500|$|Angioplasty and stenting {{have begun}} {{to be looked at}} as {{possible}} viable options in treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of <50%) ranged from 90-98%, and the rate of major peri-procedural complications ranged from 4-10%. [...] The rates of <b>restenosis</b> and stroke following the treatment were also favorable. This data suggests that a randomized controlled trial is needed to more completely evaluate the possible therapeutic advantage of this preventative measure.|$|E
2500|$|Paclitaxel {{is used as}} an {{antiproliferative}} {{agent for}} the prevention of <b>restenosis</b> (recurrent narrowing) of coronary and peripheral stents; locally delivered to the wall of the artery, a paclitaxel coating limits the growth of neointima (scar tissue) within stents. [...] Paclitaxel drug eluting coated stents for coronary artery placement are sold under the trade name Taxus by Boston Scientific in the United States. Paclitaxel drug eluting coated stents for femoropopliteal artery placement are sold under the trade name Zilver PTX by Cook Medical, Inc.|$|E
2500|$|A PCI {{involves}} {{performing a}} coronary angiogram {{to determine the}} location of the infarcting vessel, followed by balloon angioplasty (and frequently deployment of an intracoronary stent) of the stenosed arterial segment. [...] In some settings, an extraction catheter may be used to attempt to aspirate (remove) the thrombus prior to balloon angioplasty. [...] While the use of intracoronary stents do not improve the short term outcomes in primary PCI, the use of stents is widespread because of the decreased rates of procedures to treat <b>restenosis</b> compared to balloon angioplasty.|$|E
2500|$|Stent {{technology}} improved rapidly, and in 1989 the Palmaz-Schatz balloon-expandable intracoronary stent was developed. [...] Initial {{results with}} the Palmaz-Schatz stents were excellent {{when compared to}} balloon angioplasty, with a significantly lower incidence of abrupt closure and peri-procedure heart attack. [...] Late <b>restenosis</b> rates with Palmaz-Schatz stents were also significantly improved when compared with balloon angioplasty. [...] However, mortality rates were unchanged compared to balloon angioplasty. [...] While the rates of subacute thrombosis and bleeding complications associated with stent placement were high, by 1999 nearly 85% of all PCI procedures included intracoronary stenting.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{drug-eluting}} stents are {{at higher risk}} than bare-metal stents for late thrombosis is intensely debated. [...] In meta-analyses of the sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stent trials, a small but statistically higher risk of thrombosis was shown after the first year, compared to bare-metal stents. [...] Late stent thrombosis often causes myocardial infarction and sometimes death. [...] In other analyses, the late thrombosis risk is offset by {{drug-eluting stents}}' markedly reduced risk of <b>restenosis</b> and its complications including myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis concluded the mortality risk associated with drug-eluting and bare-metal stents is similar.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-eluting stents {{also have}} been shown to be {{superior}} to bare-metal stents in reducing short-term complications of stenting in saphenous vein grafts; however, use in these bypass grafts is an example of an [...] "off-label" [...] use of drug-eluting stents. [...] That is, this application has not been sufficiently examined by the Food and Drug Administration for that agency to recommend the use. [...] For [...] "on-label" [...] applications, the FDA [...] "believes that coronary drug-eluting stents remain safe and effective when used for the FDA-approved indications. These devices have significantly reduced the need for a second surgery to treat <b>restenosis</b> for thousands of patients each year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coronary {{catheterization}} {{is one of}} {{the several}} cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures. Specifically, coronary catheterization is a visually interpreted test performed to recognize occlusion, stenosis, <b>restenosis,</b> thrombosis or aneurysmal enlargement of the coronary artery lumens; heart chamber size; heart muscle contraction performance; and some aspects of heart valve function. Important internal heart and lung blood pressures, not measurable from outside the body, can be accurately measured during the test. The relevant problems that the test deals with most commonly occur as a result of advanced atherosclerosis – [...] atheroma activity within the wall of the coronary arteries. Less frequently, valvular, heart muscle, or arrhythmia issues are the primary focus of the test.|$|E
2500|$|Dotter and Melvin Judkins had {{suggested}} using prosthetic devices inside arteries (in the leg) to maintain blood flow after dilation {{as early as}} 1964. [...] In 1986, Puel and Sigwart implanted the first coronary stent in a human patient. Several trials in the 1990s showed the superiority of stent placement over balloon angioplasty. [...] <b>Restenosis</b> was reduced because the stent acted as a scaffold to hold open the dilated segment of artery; acute closure of the coronary artery (and the requirement for emergency CABG) was reduced, because the stent repaired dissections of the arterial wall. [...] By 1999, stents were used in 84% of percutaneous coronary interventions (i.e., those done via a catheter, and not by open-chest surgery).|$|E
2500|$|With the {{significantly}} lower <b>restenosis</b> rates of drug eluting stents compared to bare metal stents, the interventional cardiology community began using these stents {{as soon as}} they became available. [...] Cordis, the manufacturer of the Cypher drug eluting stent, was not able {{to keep up with the}} demand for these stents when they first entered the market. [...] This fueled a rationing of Cypher stents; they were used on difficult anatomy and high risk individuals. [...] At the time there was a fear by the general population that these drug eluting stents would not be used on individuals who could not afford them (as they cost significantly more than the bare metal stents of the era).|$|E
2500|$|When {{the results}} of the first trials of {{drug-eluting}} stents were published, there was a general feeling in the interventional cardiology community that these devices would be part of the perfect revascularization regimen for coronary artery disease. [...] With the very low <b>restenosis</b> rates of the RAVEL and SIRIUS trials, interventions were performed on more complex blockages in the coronary arteries, under the assumption that the results in real life would mimic the results in the trials. [...] The antiplatelet regimens that were advised for the drug eluting stents were based on the early trials of these stents. [...] Based on these trials, the antiplatelet regimen was a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 months when Cypher stents were used, and 9 months when Taxus stents were used, followed by aspirin indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{procedure}} to treat blocked coronary arteries was {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery (CABG), wherein a section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the body is used to bypass the diseased segment of coronary artery. In 1977, Andreas Grüntzig introduced percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), also called balloon angioplasty, in which a catheter was introduced through a peripheral artery and a balloon expanded to dilate the narrowed segment of artery. As equipment and techniques improved, the use of PTCA rapidly increased, and by the mid-1980s, PTCA and CABG were being performed at equivalent rates. Balloon angioplasty was generally effective and safe, but <b>restenosis</b> was frequent, occurring in [...] about 30–40% of cases, usually within the first year after dilation. [...] In about 3% of balloon angioplasty cases, failure of the dilation and acute or threatened closure of the coronary artery (often because of dissection) prompted emergency CABGs.|$|E
2500|$|Though less {{frequent}} with drug-eluting stents, neointimal proliferation can still occur in DES and cause <b>restenosis.</b> Stent occlusion because of thrombosis may occur during the procedure, {{in the following}} days, or later. [...] The presence of thrombi around the stent may, in turn, affect the drug-eluting performance of the stent. [...] Treatment with the antiplatelet drugs aspirin and clopidogrel {{appears to be the}} most important factor reducing this risk of thrombosis, and early cessation of one or both of these drugs after drug-eluting stenting markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. A recent histopathology study showed very late DES thrombosis is associated with histopathological signs of inflammation and intravascular ultrasound evidence of vessel remodeling. Compared with other causes of myocardial infarction, eosinophilic infiltrates are more common in thrombi harvested from very late DES thrombosis and correlate with the extent of stent malapposition.|$|E
2500|$|A stent is {{a foreign}} {{object in the}} body, and the body {{responds}} to the stent’s presence {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Macrophages accumulate around the stent, and nearby smooth muscle cells proliferate. [...] These physiological changes, which can cause <b>restenosis,</b> are limited by the drugs released by the stent, but these drugs also limit formation of a new endothelial layer over the new stent to inhibit clot formation. Endothelialization is a hallmark of vascular healing and is important for the prevention of thrombus formation. Lack of healing caused by antiproliferative drugs can make the stent an exposed surface on which a clot, sometimes life-threatening, can form. For drug-eluting stents (which, by design, delay formation of a new endothelium cover over the stent), the incidence of clot formation within the stent may persist {{for a longer period of}} time, perhaps as long as five years after treatment. Drug-eluting stents have been associated with delayed arterial healing and the prevalence of latent thrombus after five years, suggesting patients may continue to be at risk for stent thrombosis for an extended period of time.|$|E
50|$|When a stent is {{used and}} <b>restenosis</b> occurs, {{this is called}} in-stent <b>restenosis</b> or ISR. If it occurs {{following}} balloon angioplasty, this is called post-angioplasty <b>restenosis</b> or PARS. The diagnostic threshold for <b>restenosis</b> in both ISR or PARS is ≥50% stenosis.|$|E
