40|$|We reveal {{motivations of}} Chinese firms for issuing Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEO) by {{examining}} why firms change {{the use of}} SEO proceeds and how they use unspecified SEO proceeds. Using 533 SEOs issued by Chinese firms during 1999 - 2006, we find that firms do not use unspecified SEO proceeds on capital investment regardless {{of the nature of}} controlling shareholders. We find that if the controlling shareholder is the state, then the firm uses unspecified proceeds to stockpile cash; if the controlling shareholder is a parent state-owned enterprise, then the firm uses unspecified proceeds on <b>retiring</b> <b>debt</b> and on related party transactions...|$|R
40|$|How do firms finance large {{cash flow}} requirements? We examine {{this in the}} context of firms that are subject to {{substantial}} cash flow requirements. We find that trade credit, inventory and cash stock reductions are all important in the short term for mild requirements. Larger and longer cash flow shortages give rise to more equity than debt finance. After the shocks, firms gradually adjust their leverage back to pre-shock levels by <b>retiring</b> <b>debt</b> and issuing equity. Financing patterns during a shock are consistent with a pecking-order theory of finance, whereas the adjustment afterwards is consistent with a trade-off theory. Cash flow shocks, equity issues, trade-off theory, pecking-order theory. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{find that}} equity mispricing impacts {{the speed at}} which firms adjust to their target {{leverage}} (TL) and does so in predictable ways depending on whether the firm is over- or underlevered. For example, firms that are above their TL and should therefore issue equity (or <b>retire</b> <b>debt)</b> adjust more rapidly toward their target when their equity is overvalued. However, when a firm is undervalued but needs to reduce leverage, the speed of adjustment is much slower. Our findings support the role of equity mispricing as an important factor that alters the cost of making capital structure adjustments. © Copyright 2012 Michael G.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} firms' debt and equity market timing decisions in response to equity misvaluation, {{as well as how}} these timing decisions vary across firms with different external funding needs. We use price pressure resulting from mutual fund flow-induced trading to identify equity misvaluation. We find that when equity is overvalued, the least financially constrained firms issue equity and use the proceeds to <b>retire</b> <b>debt,</b> acting as pure arbitrageurs. In contrast, firms that are most financially constrained issue both overpriced equity and debt to increase investment. Our finding that equity market timing does not vary significantly with external funding needs, while debt market timing does, implies that the financing channel of equity mispricing impacting firm investment works primarily through debt issues...|$|R
