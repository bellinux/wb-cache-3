50|$|Rosin {{consists}} of a complex mixture of different substances including organic acids named the resin acids. These {{are closely related to}} the terpenes, and derive from them through partial oxidation. Resin acids can be dissolved in alkalis to form <b>resin</b> <b>soaps,</b> from which the purified resin acids are regenerated by treatment with acids. Examples of resin acids are abietic acid (sylvic acid), C20H30O2, plicatic acid contained in cedar, and pimaric acid, C20H30O2, a constituent of galipot resin. Abietic acid can also be extracted from rosin by means of hot alcohol; it crystallizes in leaflets, and on oxidation yields trimellitic acid, isophthalic acid and terebic acid. Pimaric acid closely resembles abietic acid into which it passes when distilled in a vacuum; it has been supposed to consist of three isomers.|$|R
40|$|Cleaning {{is one of}} {{the first}} and most {{important}} steps in conservative restora- tion intervention, as it removes the unwanted layers of dirt and deposit from the surface of an artefact. It must be done selectively, however, by adapting the cleaning operation to the different zones and removing successive layers of deposit without acting directly on the original materials of the surface. Generally, cleaning protocols are based on chemical or physical procedures with potential negative effects for restorers’ health and/or for the materials constituting the artworks. As an alternative, solvent gels, rigid gels and <b>resin</b> <b>soaps</b> can be used for selective cleaning. In recent decades, biological clean- ing has greatly improved as a result of research into biotechnologies and today plays an important role in the preservation and restoration of cultural assets. Nowadays, biocleaning by viable bacterial cells or hydrolytic enzymes represents a resource with great potential in the restoration of cultural heri- tage, minimising risks for artworks and for human health. New methodologies based on sulphate-reducing bacteria or bioactive molecules with hydrolytic activity have been applied as selective and safer cleaning methods in the removal of black crusts from stone surfaces or organic materials such as glue and/or adhesives, from paintings and other substrates...|$|R

50|$|The {{commercial}} {{manufacture of}} wood pulp grade chemical cellulose using the kraft chemical pulping processes releases resin acids. The Kraft process is conducted under strongly basic conditions of sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfide and sodium hydrosulfide, which neutralizes these resin acids, converting {{them to their}} respective sodium salts, sodium abietate, ((CH3)4C15H17COONa) sodium pimarate ((CH3)3(CH2)C15H23COONa) and so on. In this form, the sodium salts are insoluble and, being of lower density than the spent pulping process liquor, float {{to the surface of}} storage vessels during the process of concentration, as a somewhat gelatinous pasty fluid called kraft soap, or <b>resin</b> <b>soap.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{proximate}} analysis of Cyperus rotundus tubers were evaluated and the composition {{was found to}} be: 9. 00. 80, 1. 750. 55, 9. 500. 86, 7. 870. 92, 17. 481. 04 and 63. 601. 52 % for moisture, crude protein, oil, ash, crude fibre and carbohydrate respectively. The quality of the oil extracted by Soxhlet was assessed in terms of acid value, free fatty acid content, iodine value, saponification value and specific gravity. Results showed that the oil has a low iodine number thus placing it as a non-drying oil, stable and reduced degree of unsaturation. The saponification value and the heat of combustion, implicated the oil as non-edible but {{can be used for}} making alkyd <b>resin,</b> shampoo and <b>soaps.</b> The phytochemical constituents; terpenoids, tannins and flavonoids are also implicated in the allelopathic properties of the tubers...|$|R
40|$|Extraction of Oils from Vitex doniana (Water melon) and Citrullus vulgaris (Black plum) {{was done}} by soxhlet using {{petroleum}} ether (60 - 80 oC). The percentage oil contents from the dried powdered seeds of Vitex doniana and Citrullus vulgaris were 27 ± 1. 2 and 20 ± 1. 2 respectively. Results from the physiochemical analysis of Citrullus vulgaris and Vitex doniana seed oils showed that both oils are semi drying with iodine values of 150 ± 3. 0 and 112 ± 1. 3 respectively and {{could be used in}} production of Skin cream. The Saponification value of 200 ± 1. 2 for Citrullus vulgaris seed oil was relatively high, thus could be used in Alkyd <b>resin</b> and liquid <b>soap</b> making while the Vitex doniana seed oil with low Saponification value of 16. 5 ± 0. 2 could be for solid soap making. The percentage oil content for Citrullus vulgaris and Vitex doniana were 28. 2 ± 1. 0 and 27. 5 ± 1. 2 respectively showed that both seeds had appreciable oil content and could be commercialized.

40|$|From a {{study of}} strongyloides infections in man and animals in this region, it has been determined, in {{confirmation}} of the view of Grassi, Calmette, and others, {{that they are not}} causative factors in the production of diarrhea. The mother worm, however, burrows into the mucosa and deposits her ova there. Certain tissue reactions take place and are evidenced by the cellular proliferation in those portions of the intestines occupied by the nematodes. In animals, there is an associated anemia, not positively attributable to the strongyloides, but, on the other hand, not attributable to any other cause. It is possible that S. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man. The amount is indeterminable in this region among hospital cases on account of the associated hookworm disease or malaria. Portals of entry for various microörganisms are made by the female mother worm and her larvæ in the small intestine, and, while no case of general bacterial infection has been proved to have arisen in this way, its occurrence is possible and highly probable. In the cultures of strongyloides of man, there is among natives, who presumably are infected with purely tropical strains, a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiated mode, in some cases, an absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larvæ being obtained. There are, however, natives, cultures from whose stools contain from a single filariform larva of the direct phase up to a very definite predominance of this mode. Cultures from natives of the temperate zones contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larvæ. The presence of the filariform (direct mode), larva is perhaps best accounted for by its being an attempt at more perfect parasitism (Stiles). From a correlation of culture study with the results of a histological examination of the invaded mucosa, this explanation of the derivation of the two phases is suggested. The mother worm in the intestinal tract has two kinds of progeny: (a) those expelled into the crypts or lumen, and (b) those imbedded in the intestinal wall. One lot becomes larvæ of either the direct or indirect phase; the other lot of the opposite phase. It appears to me that the intraepithelial cell-developed larvæ furnish the direct phase, while the embryos expelled directly from the mother become the indirect phase larvæ. This will require for its confirmation {{a study of}} cultures in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall. Cold merely inhibits the development of the larvγaelig; into either the filariform (direct) or into the sexually differentiated adults, and does not alter the anlage. The resistant as well as the infecting form is the filariform larva, and all chemical larvicides must be directed against this form. Thymol and an alkaline cresol <b>resin</b> <b>soap</b> were found to be effective larvicides for the filariform larvæ. Two new strongyloides of the monkey and ant bear are described. Cultures of these nematodes show a predominance of the indirect mode of development...|$|E
