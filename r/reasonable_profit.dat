Highland cattle can produce beef at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>profit</b> from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E

These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a <b>reasonable</b> <b>profit</b> to the investors. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011, production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets.

500|$|The other line {{eventually}} {{acquired by}} the CL was the Middletown and Cincinnati Railway (M, {{not to be confused}} with the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad discussed earlier). Paul J. Sorg, owner of a tobacco plant east of Middletown, was unhappy with the service provided by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (then independent) and Cincinnati and Springfield Railway (Big Four system), both of which bypassed the center of town. Sorg and associates incorporated the M in early 1890, and surveyed a [...] line from Middletown, which lay in the Great Miami River valley, southeast to a point that would be known as Middletown Junction on the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania system). Construction on the majority of the route, which crossed the CL at Hageman, was complete by September 1891, and a [...] truss bridge over the Little Miami River opened in early 1892, linking the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into central Middletown was delayed until December, when it was finally able to cross the CH to its depot. As opposed to the CL and DL, the M was straight and flat, giving a smooth ride, and turned a <b>reasonable</b> <b>profit.</b> The revenue was not enough, however, to pay off the bonds, and the M entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property bought the line at foreclosure in October for $335,000, incorporated the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad in December, and elected Sorg president.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the principles of a conceptual model to help developers and housing users achieve their expectations regarding quality, affordability and <b>reasonable</b> <b>profits.</b> Based on the identification of housing user’s preferences extracted from the survey, data are incorporated into model simulations considering budget restrictions for developers as well as for housing users. Design/methodology/approach The models’ development was based on fieldwork in Guayaquil, Ecuador, using a method that includes housing users’ preferences. Developed through a “methodological pluralism”, this study identifies people-oriented variables and assumptions. Thus, a more integrated approach is proposed, crossing and covering the fields of different disciplines. Findings The study concludes with findings regarding the identification of the most preferred attributes of housing users and the proposal of an alternative method to incorporate quality into model simulations for estimating housing market prices. Through optimizations, it is found that the optimal number of housing units per housing types in urban projects, which translates into more <b>reasonable</b> <b>profits</b> for the developers and the provision of better and more affordable houses for the users. Research limitations/implications A more complete assessment of the principles described in this paper will require a larger timeframe and location of application. Practical implications The identification of the most preferred attributes of housing users and the inclusion in a conceptual simulation model would help private and public developers to provide better and more affordable houses for users as well as to attain <b>reasonable</b> <b>profits.</b> Further, housing national policy could also be influenced by model’s results. Social implications The consideration of housing user’s preferences will entail an improvement of quality of life for social housing projects. Originality/value The study’s main original and novel contribution is the development of an approach for the inclusion of housing preferences into model simulations by using quality points and housing demand curves. status: publishe...|$|R

The stormy confusions of his youth were now subsiding; after all his aberrations, repulses, and perplexed wanderings, he was at length about to reach his true destination, and times of more serenity began to open for him. Two such tragedies as he had lately offered to the world {{made it easier for}} his friend Dalberg to second his pretensions. Schiller was at last gratified by the fulfilment of his favourite scheme; in September 1783, he went to Mannheim, as poet to the theatre, a post of respectability and <b>reasonable</b> <b>profit,</b> to the duties of which he forthwith addressed himself with all his heart. He was not long afterwards elected a member of the German Society established for literary objects in Mannheim; and he valued the honour, not only as a testimony of respect from a highly estimable quarter, but also as a means of uniting him more closely with men of kindred pursuits and tempers: and what was more than all, of quieting forever his apprehensions from the government at Stuttgard. Since his arrival at Mannheim, one or two suspicious incidents had again alarmed him on this head; but being now acknowledged as a subject of the Elector Palatine, naturalised by law in his new country, he had nothing more to fear from the Duke of Würtemberg.|$|E

It is common, indeed, for the tradesman to say, 'I cannot abate anything,' when yet they do and can afford it; but the tradesman should indeed not be understood strictly and literally to his words, but as he means it, namely, that he cannot reasonably abate, and that he cannot afford to abate: and there he may be in earnest, namely, that he cannot make a <b>reasonable</b> <b>profit</b> of his goods, if he is obliged to abate, and so the meaning is honest, that he cannot abate; and yet rather than not take your money, he may at last resolve to do it, in hopes of getting a better price for the remainder, or being willing to abate his ordinary gain, rather than disoblige the customer; or being perhaps afraid he should not sell off the quantity; and many such reasons may be given why he submits to sell {{at a lower price}} than he really intended, or can afford to do; and yet he cannot be said to be dishonest, or to lie, in saying at first he cannot, or could not, abate.|$|E

Another plan, which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives, is that councils should be formed, which in England have been called local boards of trade, in France “conseils de prud’hommes,” and other names; consisting of delegates from the work-people and from the employers, who, meeting in conference, should agree upon a rate of wages, and promulgate it from authority, to be binding generally on employers and workmen; the ground of decision being, not the state of the labor market, but natural equity; to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages, and the capitalist <b>reasonable</b> <b>profits.</b>|$|R
