The altitude loss of 3, 000 to 9, 000 feet before climbout could be effected was a function of launch altitude and recovery angle of attack. The average time for the X- 15 to separate 10 feet from the B- 52 carrier airplane was about 0. 8 second.

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for transport capacity led to new hull designs with a large bow flare {{that are able to}} carry more containers. These new hull shapes influence the ship stability and may lead to large roll angle amplitudes, which lead to high accelerations and thereby to a high safety risk for human life, ship and cargo. To be able to predict or prevent large roll angles and roll acceleration, {{it is important to understand}} the physical principals of roll motion and especially <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> The assessment of dynamic stability of ships in the early design phase is needed. In today’s naval engineering practice, the roll motion of a ship is computed with computational methods based on the potential theory. These methods are sufficiently fast for ship design purposes. However, they lack the ability to predict viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping,</b> which has to be determined with other means such as model tests, viscous field methods or empirical prediction methods. Model tests, in turn, are costly, time consuming and suffer from scale effects on the <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Empirical methods such as the Ikeda method are also restricted in their use, as their development was based on a restricted number of hull shapes (e. g. slender bodies) and may not be valied for modern ship designs. The demand for a <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> prediction method and the described deficit in the current <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> assessment methods led to the two main objectives of this thesis: An in-depth analysis of the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> mechanisms and identification of the influencing factors of the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients of modern hull shapes. Secondly, the development of a mathematical model for the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> prediction of modern ship hulls. For this purpose, numerical <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> simulation were conducted for a systematic variation of hull shapes. The resulting time series data was then used in a nonlinear regression analysis to derive the mathematical <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> prediction model. In order to apply a consistent methodology for this pro- cess, a computational framework was implemented, that incorporates all the numerical tools, that were used. The result from this development is a database with the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients for a series of hull shape variations, a systematically evaluated <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> model and a prediction method for the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> behavior of new hull designs...|$|R

Flight tests were also made at angles of attack near maximum lift (alpha = 40 deg) with a radio-controlled model dropped from a helicopter. Static and dynamic force tests were made over an angle-of-attack range from 0 to 90 deg. The longitudinal stability and control characteristics were considered satisfactory when the model had positive static longitudinal stability. It was possible to fly the model {{with a small amount of}} static instability, but the longitudinal characteristics were considered unsatisfactory in this condition. At angles of attack above the stall the model developed a large, constant-amplitude pitching oscillation. The lateral stability characteristics were considered to be only fair at angles of attack from about 20 to 35 deg because of a lightly damped Dutch roll oscillation. At higher angles of attack the oscillation was well damped and the lateral stability was generally satisfactory. The Dutch roll damping at the lower angles of attack was increased to satisfactory values by means of a simple rate-type <b>roll</b> <b>damper.</b> The lateral control characteristics were generally satisfactory throughout the angle- of-attack range, but there was some deterioration in aileron effectiveness in the high angle-of-attack range due mainly to a large increase in damping in roll...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDamping plays a {{significant}} role on the maximum amplitude of a vessel's roll motion, in particular near the resonant frequency. It is a common practice to predict <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> using a linear radiation–diffraction code and add that to a linearized viscous damping component, which can be obtained through empirical, semi-empirical equations or free decay tests in calm water. However, it is evident that the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> is nonlinear with roll velocity and amplitude.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of {{surfaced}} submarines. Modern diesel-electric submarines {{can spend a}} significant time sailing in surfaced condition. When sailing in this condition, the submarine will roll due to the excitation by waves. The (very) large rolling angles that occur are bothersome to the crew and possibly dangerous to the submarine and its systems. The large angles occur, because the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of a submarine is low when compared to ordinary surface ships. The rudders contribute the most to the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of a submarine. Hardly any research into the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of submarines {{is found in the}} open literature. For these reasons, the following research question is formulated: Which rudder configuration provides the most <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> for a surfaced submarine at speed? Six different rudder configurations are compared over a range of roll amplitudes, roll frequencies and forward speeds. The comparison is made using a newly developed mathematical model. The mathematical model calculates the lift and drag forces generated by the rudders using thin airfoil theory, whilst taking the effects of very high angles of attack and the vicinity of the free surface into account. The model is validated against an extensive series of experiments on a model submarine. The model submarine had a scale of 1 : 24. Forced oscillation tests were performed at the towing tank of Delft University of Technology. Forces normal to the rudders and the torque acting on the hull were measured. The results of the experiments showed that the mathematical model could be used to predict the qualitative trends in the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of surfaced submarines. For every combination of roll amplitude, roll frequency and forward speed that was studied, the trend was similar: the large X-rudders with bowplanes generate the most <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Adding bowplanes to a given aft rudder configuration always increases the <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringMarine and Transport Technolog...|$|R

40|$|To {{guaranty}} {{safety of}} the vessel, operation and especially the people during offshore activities, a motion analysis is executed. The motion analysis determines the motions over the entire frequency spectrum. Motions are amplified when incoming wave frequencies come to {{the vicinity of the}} natural frequency of the vessel, hence a very interesting region concerning the {{safety of the}} operation. In the vicinity of the natural frequency the motions are highly dependent on the present damping, therefore an accurate prediction of the damping is desired. This thesis study aims to improve the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> operation of sheerlegs (barge-type vessels) Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 during a lifting opertation. This is achieved by implementing the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> component and investigating the effect of a vertical center of gravity well above the waterline. A high VCG results in a coupled motion between roll and sway. The effect of a high vertical center of gravity on the potential and viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> is studied. Furtermore, the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> is determined applying three different techniques. Finally all models are validated with data from pre-executed experiments. Theory developed by Ikeda, Tanaka and Himeno (IHT) is implemented to compute the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> for ship shaped hulls and barge-type hulls. IHT theory is the ITTC recommended procedure for practical assesment of viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> in absence of experiments, as long as the hull dimensions and motion conditions are within the set limitations. Two numerical models are developed according to IHT theory, the IHT - Ship model and IHT - Barge model. The IHT - Ship model is verified and showed no discrepancies with the verifying document. However, the calculated viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> for the Taklift 4 is surprisingly small when compared to the potential <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> The estimation of the bilge radius and the lewis transformation to determine the velocity increment appeared to be the least accurate parameters causing an inaccurate viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> estimation. After the IHT - Barge model is developed, it is directly validated together with the ‘κ-formula’-model against the decay test data. Journee designed the κ-formula’-model, which contains the potential <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> ratio and a viscous contribution multiplied with the square-root of the roll angle. The validation shows that the ‘κ-formula’-model consistently estimates the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> in a more accurate manner for barges where 5 ≤B/T≤ 7. 5. Unfortunately, the decay tests were limited with an initial roll angles up to five or six degrees. It is rather challenging to define a limitation concerning a roll angle for this approach. Therefore, the ‘κ-formula’-model can safely be used, but for large roll angles it is advised to maintain a conservative user approach. For barges where B/T= 10, the IHT – Barge model is not appropriate and also the ‘κ-formula’-model is accurate for roll angles smaller than 2. 5 degrees. It is suggested the free surface effects ‘hide’ the dependence of the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> and the <b>roll</b> angle. The third technique to determine the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping,</b> is the so-called Magnuson approach. Magnuson applied an equivalent linearization procedure on the experimental data of the Noble Denton JIP to determine the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> To develop the Magnuson approach, experimental data providing motion response and environmental conditions is required. Such data is not available for the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7, hence results from pre-executed experiments are used, which among other things contains free decay test results and behavior in regular beam waves for rectangular scale models with similar dimensions as the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. The main difference between the vessels studied in this thesis scope and pre-executed experiments, is the height the vertical center of gravity (VCG). A VCG above the waterline causes the response motion to change from 'pure' roll to a coupled roll-sway motion. Due to a phase difference between the coupled terms and b 44 and b 22 term, the B 44 p is decreasing for increasing VCG. The B 44 p coefficient becomes zero for a certain location of the VCG, which could not be explained physically in this thesis. The effect of the VCG on the b 44 v is positive. It is suggested the coupled roll-sway motion and secondary separation can account for this. An attempt is made to determine viscous effects of b 24, b 42 and b 22. Very limited studies are executed on this topic, hence {{it is very difficult to}} determine the correctness of the computations. After all developed models were compared with each other, the Magnuson approach showed most promise. Therefore this approach is used to determine the viscous <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. Viscous damping ratios of 0. 041 and 0. 034 respectively, were computed for the most similar scale models, hence a viscous damping ratio of 0. 0375 for both Taklift vessels is determined. It is left for future work to determine how the workability of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 is increased by the more accurate <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> prediction.

Steady roll technique was used for these measurements in the NAL 1. 2 m wind tunnel. The earlier control system was configured on two separate computers, viz. one for speed control and the other for data acquisition and processing of the rolling moment data. The system required certain important parameter entries to be duplicated exactly in both the computers for synchronization of speed and acquisition of the rolling moment data. Certain other data related to the speed information were needed to be transferred from one PC to the other after the blowdown for data processing. In the new approach some modifications were made to the existing control, data acquisition and processing programs to run simultaneously in one PC. Additional features were incorporated for better performance and easy handling of the programs, and the necessary data for processing is internally transferred from one program to the other.

The simulation model is based on the MSS Toolbox, with additional modifications added to represent roll motions more realistically, i. e. 4 -quadrant open water results and non-linear sway and <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> The numerical simulations and experimental trials, presented in the thesis, are compared with ship operations that require low roll motions, and shows promising results with significant roll reduction. Seakeeping trials related to roll motions are carried out to quantify the damping contribution. Decay tests showed average damping ratio 250 % higher using the proposed anti-roll system compared to the undamped case. Furthermore, regular waves showed 40 % damping in the area around resonance. Additionally, statistical values from irregular wave trials showed damping in the regime 30 - 64 %. Lastly, operability diagrams were created using numerical simulations and was compared with helicopter landing criteria. It was shown that helicopter landings could take place 34 % more often using the active <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> system for oblique waves and 20 % more often for beam waves. Based on the results, it is concluded that the system works very well for moderate sea states, and that the damping contributions, that is to say in moderate sea state conditions, is comparable to that of currently available anti-roll system...|$|R

From the new approximations, the dutch roll frequency {{is shown to}} be a function of the stability axis yaw stability and the dutch <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> is mainly effected by the <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> ratio. In additional, an important parameter called roll-to-yaw ratio is obtained to describe the dutch roll mode. Solution shows that large-roll-to-yaw ratio is the generate character of hypersonic vehicle, which results the large error for the practical approximation. Predictions from the literal approximations derived in this paper are compared with actual numerical values for s example hypersonic vehicle, results show the approximations work well and the error is below 10 %.

40|$|An {{optimization}} algorithm {{has been developed}} to study the effectiveness of substituting time tested ODEs with FDEs as applied to ship motions, specifically {{with an eye toward}} modeling different forms of <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Relations between the order of differentiation a and damping coefficient b in the FDEs have been drawn for changing damping, added moment of inertia, and initial roll angle. A pitch model has also been studied and compared to the roll model. The error at each of these a and b pairs has also been calculated using an L 2 -norm. An initial effort was made to correlate the FDE coefficients to differing mechanisms of <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> as characterized by Himeno...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{traineeship}} is {{to design}} an L 1 adaptive controller for a ship autopilot in combination with rudder <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Rudder <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> means that the rudder of the ship is used to reduce wave induced roll motions of the ship. L 1 adaptive control theory is a new adaptive control architecture which decouples estimation (adaptation) from control (robustness), and with that allows for arbitrary fast adaptation. L 1 adaptive control is first used to control the heading of a ship. A simple one degree of freedom model is used with a non-linear steering characteristic. The adaptive controller is used to estimate this nonlinearity. The designed adaptive autopilot is then used on a more complex four degree of freedom model. This used benchmark ship model is a 360 ton naval vessel. The L 1 adaptive control theory {{is also used to}} design a controller which uses the rudder to dampout roll motion of the ship. A model which only contains the equations of motion in roll was used for this. Finally the autopilot is combined with <b>roll</b> <b>damping</b> to get a controller which combines rollreduction with low heading interference...|$|R
40|$|Wing rock is {{one type}} of lateral-directional instabilities at high angles of attack. To predict wing rock {{characteristics}} and to design airplanes to avoid wing rock, parameters affecting wing rock characteristics must be known. A new nonlinear aerodynamic model is developed to investigate the main aerodynamic nonlinearities causing wing rock. In the present theory, the Beecham-Titchener asymptotic method is used to derive expressions for the limit-cycle amplitude and frequency of wing rock from nonlinear flight dynamics equations. The resulting expressions are capable of explaining the existence of wing rock {{for all types of}} aircraft. Wing rock is developed by negative or weakly positive <b>roll</b> <b>damping,</b> and sustained by nonlinear aerodynamic <b>roll</b> <b>damping.</b> Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results is obtained...|$|R
