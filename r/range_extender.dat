5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept shares {{the same basic}} plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> instead of General Motorsâ€™ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 15,045 all-electric cars and vans were {{registered}} in 2014, of which, pure electric passenger cars totaled 10,560 units. This figure rises to 10,968 units if the BMW i3 with <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> is accounted for. All-electric utility vans totaled 4,485 units registered in 2014. All-electric cars captured a 0.59% {{market share of}} new car registered in France in 2014. Plug-in hybrid car registrations totaled 1,519 units in 2014, almost doubling registrations from a year earlier. Plug-in hybrid sales were driven by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, with 820 units registered in 2014.

25|$|In 2010 Audi {{unveiled}} a prototype series-hybrid electric car, the A1 e-tron, that incorporated a small 250cc Wankel engine, running at 5,000rpm, which recharged the car's batteries as needed, and provided electricity {{directly to the}} electric driving motor. In 2010, FEV Inc said that in their prototype electric version of the Fiat 500, a Wankel engine would {{be used as a}} <b>range</b> <b>extender.</b> In 2013, Valmet Automotive of Finland revealed a prototype car named the EVA, incorporating a Wankel powered series-hybrid powertrain car, utilizing an engine manufactured by the German company Wankel SuperTec.

25|$|In June 2016, Nissan {{announced}} it will introduce a compact <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> car in Japan before March 2017. The series plug-in hybrid will use a new hybrid system, dubbed e-Power, which debuted with the Nissan Gripz concept crossover showcased at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction. Unlike a conventional engine, which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions, the <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> can be operated under optimum conditions at all times. High-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for PEV use. These include advanced close-cycle steam engines, stirling engines, Wankel engines, and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small size.|$|E
25|$|The i3 {{performance}} in range-extending mode {{may be more}} limited than when it is running on battery power, as BMW clarified the <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> is designed not for long-distance travel but purely as an emergency backup to keep the electric system going until the next recharging location. According to BMW, {{at the beginning of}} the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.|$|E

25|$|While the {{previous}} system, Copenhagen City Bikes, was {{considered one of}} the first examples of modern bike share systems, it was also of little or no use to commuters, and was mainly seen as serving tourists and casual users since it was primarily designed to prevent bike theft. This was set to change with the city's new bike share system opening in 2013, which should be designed specifically for commuters, in order to function as a <b>range</b> <b>extender</b> for the public transit system. With that in mind, the cities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg have appointed the operator of the S-train system, DSB to both tender and subsequently run the system. In 2013, a new system, Bycyklen, provided by Gobike has been put into function, once fully installed it will provide 1,260 modern bikes with aluminium frame, adjustable seat-height and GPS-guidance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{strategies that}} operators can employ to profitably provide acceptable and affordable telecommunication services to {{customers in the}} rural areas. The strategies discussed {{include the use of}} low power / low cost infrastructure designed and based on the specifications of the rural areas and the shared access concept using the Global System for Mobile (GSM) phone booth. These strategies are based on infrastructure that is modular, scalable, solar powered, and customizable to the operatorâ€™s specifications. The low cost infrastructure is designed to extend telecommunication services to rural areas enabling users in those areas to link up with the operatorâ€™s network in the urban areas using their personal phones. These devices (repeaters) can be designed to allow the userâ€™s phones to transmit at minimum power thus giving them longer talk time. With the GSM phone booth, the users donâ€™t need to have personal phones.

Apart from <b>range</b> <b>extenders,</b> flow batteries (redox batteries as one variant) which might be refilled with electrolyte similar to conventional vehicles and technological improvements, the exchange of batteries is a method allowing BEV's similar ranges and similar usability like vehicles with internal combustion engines as they are currently used. The suggested way for the investigation into the success of the concept holds a two fold approach: Mapping the innovation: Enumerating the influencing factors Assessing: In-depth research of acceptance In step one influence analysis (causal loop) is applied to determine the most active factors and the system dynamics. In step two a multi criteria decision analysis is employed in order to quantify the potential impact of the factors/characteristics on the probability {{of the success of the}} concepts. The two step methodology is presented for the battery exchange system (swappable battery), because for this system it is easiest to determine the technological aspects being purely mechanical and also the market impact based on the pre-existing knowledge of the facts.
