40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the vertebrate inner ear is a complex process that has been investigated in several model organisms. In this work, we examined genetic interactions regulating early {{development of}} otic structures in medaka. We demonstrate that misexpression of Fgf 8, Dlx 3 b and Foxi 1 during early gastrulation is sufficient to produce ectopic otic vesicles. Combined misexpression strongly increases the appearance of this phenotype. By using a heat-inducible promoter we were furthermore able to separate the regulatory interactions among Fgf 8, Foxi 1, Dlx 3 b, Pax 8 and Pax 2 genes, which are active during different stages of early otic development. In the preplacodal stage we suggest a central position of Foxi 1 within a regulatory network of early patterning genes including Dlx 3 b and Pax 8. Different pathways are active after the placodal stage with Dlx 3 b playing a central role. There Dlx 3 b <b>regulates</b> <b>members</b> of the Pax–Six–Eya–Dach network and also strongly affects the early dorsoventral marker genes Otx 1 and Gbx 2...|$|R
40|$|Hox gene {{clusters}} encode {{a family}} of transcription factors that govern anterior posterior axis patterning during embryogenesis in all bilaterian animals. The time and place ofHox gene expression are largely determined by the relative position of each gene within its cluster. Furthermore, Hox genes were shown to have their expression fine-tuned by regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated regulation of these transcription factors during fish early development remain largely unknown. Here we have profiled three highly expressed miR- 10 family members of Nile tilapia at early embryonic development, determined their genomic organization as well as performed functional experiments for validation of target genes. Quantitative analysis during developmental stages showed miR- 10 family expression negatively correlates with the expression of HoxA 3 a, HoxB 3 a and HoxD 10 a genes, as expected for bona fide miRNA–mRNA interactions. Moreover, luciferase assays demonstrated that HoxB 3 a and HoxD 10 a are targeted by miR- 10 b- 5 p. Overall, our data indicate that the miR- 10 family directly <b>regulates</b> <b>members</b> of the Hox gene family during Nile tilapia embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} {{homologous}} factors (FHFs) are not growth factors, but instead bind to voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV) and regulate their function. Mutations in FGF 14, an FHF {{that is the}} locus for spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA 27), {{are believed to be}} pathogenic because of a dominant-negative reduction of NaV currents in cerebellar granule cells. Here, we demonstrate that FGF 14 also <b>regulates</b> <b>members</b> of the presynaptic CaV 2 Ca 2 + channel family. Knockdown of FGF 14 in granule cells reduced Ca 2 + currents and diminished vesicular recycling, a marker for presynaptic Ca 2 + influx. As a consequence, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse were markedly diminished. Expression of the SCA 27 -causing FGF 14 mutant in granule cells exerted a dominant-negative reduction in Ca 2 + currents, vesicular recycling, and the resultant EPSCs in Purkinje cells. Thus, FHFs are multimodal, regulating several discrete neuronal signaling events. SCA 27 most likely results at least in part from dysregulation of Ca 2 + channel function...|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} {{growth factor}} ligands, including {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) and the neuregulins (NRGs), <b>regulate</b> <b>members</b> of the erbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases. These growth factors induce erbB receptor oligomerization, and their biological specificity {{is thought to be}} defined by the combination of homo- and hetero-oligomers that they stabilize upon binding. One model proposed for ligand-induced erbB receptor hetero-oligomerization involves simple heterodimerization; another suggests that higher order hetero-oligomers are ‘nucleated’ by ligand-induced homodimers. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the abilities of EGF and NRG 1 -β 1 to induce homo- and hetero-oligomerization of purified erbB receptor extracellular domains. EGF and NRG 1 -β 1 induced efficient homo-oligomerization of the erbB 1 and erbB 4 extracellular domains, respectively. In contrast, ligand-induced erbB receptor extracellular domain hetero-oligomers did not form (except for s-erbB 2 –s-erbB 4 hetero-oligomers). Our findings argue that erbB receptor extracellular domains do not recapitulate most heteromeric interactions of the erbB receptors, yet reproduce their ligand-induced homo-oligomerization properties very well. This suggests that mechanisms for homo- and hetero-oligomerization of erbB receptors are different, and contradicts the simple heterodimerization hypothesis prevailing in the literature...|$|R

In this work we compared cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and RNA expression patterns induced in Caco- 2 cells exposed to AuNP (5 and 30 nm). Cellular internalization was dose and time-dependent for both AuNPs. The toxicity was observed by colony forming efficiency (CFE) and not by Trypan blue assay, and exclusively for 5 nm AuNPs, starting at the concentration of 200 μM (24 and 72 h of exposure). The most pronounced changes in gene expression (Agilent microarrays) were detected at 72 h (300 μM) of exposure to AuNPs (5 nm). The biological processes affected by smaller AuNPs were: RNA/zinc ion/transition metal ion binding (decreased), cadmium/copper ion binding and glutathione metabolism (increased). Some Nrf 2 responsive genes (several metallothioneins, HMOX, G 6 PD, OSGIN 1 and GPX 2) were highly up <b>regulated.</b> <b>Members</b> of the selenoproteins were also differentially expressed.
