5|$|In the Fourth Circuit case of Saunders v Wilkins (1945), Saunders {{claimed that}} Virginia should have its Congressional {{representation}} reduced {{because of its}} use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued {{for the right to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a political question.|$|E
5|$|Moran was {{the mayor}} of Alexandria, Virginia from 1985 to 1990, when he {{resigned}} to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> He defeated Republican incumbent Stanford Parris {{in the general election}} on November 6, 1990, and was sworn in the following January. He is of Irish descent, and is the son of professional football player James Moran Sr. and the brother of former Democratic Party of Virginia Chairman Brian Moran.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo gained a considerable level of support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{election}} following the {{ratification of the}} Kentucky Constitution of 1850, Burnett was elected clerk of the circuit court of Trigg County, Kentucky, defeating James E. Thompson. He resigned in 1853 to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> Later that year, he was elected as a Democrat to the 34th Congress, succeeding Speaker of the House Linn Boyd. He was re-elected to the three succeeding Congresses; during the 35th Congress, he chaired the Committee of Enquiry regarding the sale of Fort Snelling and served on the Committee on the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from {{flying over the}} Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> He did hint to state party leaders {{that he would}} be interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|When Minton {{returned}} home he reopened his law practice {{and decided to}} enter politics. He ran for office in Indiana's 3rd congressional district, but lost the Democratic primary, despite significant campaigning and his war record. He lost to John Ewing, 6,502 votes to 3,170, second place {{in a field of}} five candidates. After the loss, he briefly joined the Indiana law firm of Stonsenburg and Weathers, two politically active lawyers, before moving to Miami, Florida, where he joined another firm, Shutts & Bowen. In January 1928, he left the Miami practice and returned to Stonsenburg and Weathers. He attempted to secure the Democratic nomination to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1930, but was again defeated, this time by the former state party chairman Eugene B. Crowe.|$|E
5|$|With his {{increasing}} reputation, local Republicans urged Harrison to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> He initially confined {{his political}} activities to speaking {{on behalf of}} other Republican candidates, a task for which he received high praises from his colleagues. In 1872, Harrison campaigned for the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana. Former governor Oliver Morton favored his opponent, Thomas M. Browne, and Harrison lost his bid for statewide office. He returned to his law practice and, despite the Panic of 1873, he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in Indianapolis in 1874. He continued to make speeches on behalf of Republican candidates and policies.|$|E

5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning.

5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered a <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> as a Democrat, but was advised {{that the district}} was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
