5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> Chesapeake came from her {{contingent}} of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a project}} planned by the Government of Tamil Nadu to lay stones along the shores {{to protect the}} fort and the Masilamaninathar Temple in Tharangambadi from erosion. While the project was planned much before the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2005, it was {{implemented}} only in 2007. Before the tsunami, there was stiff <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> the local villages citing impact to fishery in the region. Post tsunami, the <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> the locals receded and the project was extended to accommodate additional areas of the shore.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|A site within Muckaty {{was being}} {{considered}} for Australia's low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste storage and disposal facility.

50|$|Standard {{heat pipes}} are {{constant}} conductance devices, where the heat pipe operating temperature is {{set by the}} source and sink temperatures, the thermal <b>resistances</b> <b>from</b> the source to the heat pipe, and the thermal <b>resistances</b> <b>from</b> the heat pipe to the sink. In these heat pipes, the temperature drops linearly as the power or condenser temperature is reduced. For some applications, such as satellite or research balloon thermal control, the electronics will be overcooled at low powers, or at the low sink temperatures. Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) are used to passively maintain {{the temperature of the}} electronics being cooled as power and sink conditions change.|$|R

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for his casting. In the years leading up the production of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and wanted him to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of Ivan IV and in 1598 of his son Feodor, the last tsars of the Rurik Dynasty, Russia entered a period of severe dynastic, {{economic}} and social crisis and instability. As Boris Godunov encountered <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> both the peasant masses and the boyar opposition, in the Commonwealth the ideas of turning Russia into a subordinated ally, either through a union, or an imposition of a ruler dependent on the Polish–Lithuanian establishment, were rapidly coming into play.|$|E
5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, which was already serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> Iraqi forces {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E

40|$|Plasmid-borne copper <b>resistance</b> genes <b>from</b> copper-resistant {{strains of}} Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria from California, Florida, and Oklahoma shared {{structural}} similarities.

Even though the regiment advanced, it failed to achieve its objective for the day. On the regiment's right flank, the HV 128th Brigade advanced together with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Home Guard Regiment and cut through the VrhovineKorenica road.
