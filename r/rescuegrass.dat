40|$|The {{long-term}} hydrologic {{response of}} a small (7. 8 ha) zero-order Southern Piedmont watershed were analyzed from 1940 - 1984. Four land use phases occurred during this period: row cropping (5 -yr), kudzu (5 -yr), grazed kudzu mixed with <b>rescuegrass</b> (7 -yr), and grazed coastal bermudagrass (28 -yr). Land use and rainfall variability influenced runoff characteristics. Row cropping produced the greatest runoff, percentage runoff, and peak flows. Kudzu reduced spring runoff and almost eliminated summer runoff, as did a mixture of kudzu and rescuegrass; however, rainfall was reduced during these two phases. Peak flows were also reduced during these two phases. Bermudagrass reduced runoff more than row cropping {{but not as much}} as kudzu or kudzu mixed with <b>rescuegrass.</b> Peak flows increased during grazing of bermudagrass but stayed below those during the cropping phase. Monthly rainfall-runoff regression relationships were developed and R 2 greater than 0. 60 were found for: cropping phase- summer, spring and winter; kudzu phase-spring and winter; kudzu-rescuegrass phase- summer, spring, winter; and bermudagrass phase- summer and spring. Long-term information such as this is needed for various environmental and management decisions faced by land managers today...|$|E
40|$|Canola {{is a low}} {{erucic acid}} oilseed crop {{developed}} from oilseed rape, mainly used for edible oil and meal for feed • The United States imports the equivalent of 2 million acres of production each year • 1 million acres are planted to Canola in the United States with 90 % of the acreage being in the Dakotas and Minnesota. • With improvements to winter canola varieties 60, 000 acres were planted in 2006 in the southern Great Plains with the majority being centered in Oklahoma and Kansas. • Canola can potentially improve yield and quality of Oklahoma winter wheat planted after a canola rotation; limited research has shown a 15 % increase in winter wheat yields following canola. • Canola makes a good crop to rotate to to control troublesome weeds in wheat such as feral rye, jointed goatgrass, and <b>rescuegrass.</b> • Approximately 125 growers of canola in Oklahoma with about 80 - 160 acres each, totaling 16 - 17 thousand acres of canola...|$|E
40|$|Biological invasions by alien (c. f. non-native, non-indigenous, foreign, exotic) {{species are}} {{recognised}} {{as a significant}} component of global environmental change, often resulting in a significant loss in the economic value, biological diversity and function of invaded ecosystems (Wittenberg and Cock 2001). Numerous alien species, many introduced {{only in the last}} 200 years ago, have become successfully established over large areas of Europe (Hulme 2007). Future global biodiversity scenarios highlight potentially dramatic increases in biological invasions in European ecosystems (Sala et al. 2000). Interacting effects through rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, warmer temperatures, greater nitrogen deposition, altered disturbance regimes and increased habitat fragmentation may facilitate further invasions (Vilà et al. 2006). Early warning and prevention of the harmful impact of alien species on ecosystems is a fundamental requirement of the European Biodiversity Strategy and the EU Action Plan to 2010 and Beyond (European Commission 2006) yet, in the absence of reliable regional analyses, the European states have been unable to tackle this issue strategically (Miller et al. 2006; Hulme et al. 2007). In the United States, the cost of biological invasions has been estimated to total 97 billion hitherto for 79 major bioinvasions (Pimentel et al. 2001). Although only limited monetary data are available at present for Europe, there is a similar indication that biological invasions have imposed losses on the economy. The strongest evidence is for alien pest and weeds that impact upon the agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and other sectors (Williamson 2002). Examples of direct economic impacts include the damage caused by Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica to flood defences and the impact of bark stripping by grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis on forestry production. The western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera was accidentally introduced in the 1990 s into Serbia and is an important pest of maize and leads to yield losses. Preliminary studies on the potential of establishment of the western corn rootworm show that this pest is likely to survive and develop wherever maize is grown in Europe. Leaving aside introduced pests and diseases affecting agriculture, alien parasites such as Gyrodactylus salaris (an ectoparasite of Atlantic salmon) and Anguillicola crassus (swimbladder nematode of eels) have led to dramatic decreases in fisheries sector incomes in several Nordic countries. The American oyster drill Urosalpinx cinerea is an important gastropod pest of the cultured oyster industry as it feeds preferably on oyster spat and is recorded as consuming more than half the oyster spat in certain European estuaries (Cole 1942). The muskrat Ondatra zibethicus and coypu Myocastor coypus, both introduced by the European fur industry, damage river banks through digging and have increased the risk and severity of floods in many central and southern European countries. Notorious invasive alien weeds are of major economic significance, e. g., Mexican tea Chenopodium ambrosioides, knotgrass Paspalum paspaloides, Canadian horsew-eed Conyza canadensis, Bermuda buttercup Oxalis pes-caprae. While other alien plants act as hosts of plant pathogens e. g., <b>rescuegrass</b> Bromus catharticus as host for barley yellow dwarf virus and wheat stem rust. Invasive alien species can also affect human health e. g., phytophotodermatitis through contact with giant hog-weed Heracleum mantegazzianum, asthma and hay-fever arising from the pollen of annual ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia, poisoning of humans through consumption of toxic fruit e. g., American pokeweed Phytolacca americana, silverleaf nightshade Solanum elaeagnifolium, or leptospirosis spread by the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. ...|$|E
