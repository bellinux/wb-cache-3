40|$|AbstractBackgroundBodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> (weight, height, BMI, {{abdominal}} circumference) {{are extremely}} important for clinical care, research and quality improvement. These and other vitals signs data are frequently missing from structured tables of electronic health records. However {{they are often}} recorded as text within clinical notes. In this project we sought to develop and validate a learning algorithm that would extract bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> from clinical notes in the Veterans Administration (VA) Electronic Health Record to complement the structured data used in clinical research. MethodsWe developed the Regular Expression Discovery Extractor (REDEx), a supervised learning algorithm that generates regular expressions from a training set. The regular expressions generated by REDEx were then used to extract the numerical values of interest. To train the algorithm we created a corpus of 268 outpatient primary care notes that were annotated by two annotators. This annotation served to develop the annotation process and identify terms associated with bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> for training the supervised learning algorithm. Snippets from an additional 300 outpatient primary care notes were subsequently annotated independently by two reviewers to complete the training set. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated. REDEx was applied to a separate test set of 3561 notes to generate a dataset of weights extracted from text. We estimated the number of unique individuals who would otherwise not have bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> recorded in the CDW {{and the number of}} additional bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> that would be additionally captured. ResultsREDEx’s performance was: accuracy= 98. 3 %, precision= 98. 8 %, recall= 98. 3 %, F= 98. 5 %. In the dataset of weights from 3561 notes, 7. 7 % of notes contained bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> that were not available as structured data. In addition 2 additional bodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> were identified per individual per year. ConclusionBodyweight <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> are frequently stored as text in clinical notes. A supervised learning algorithm can be used to extract this data. Implications for clinical care, epidemiology, and quality improvement efforts are discussed...|$|R

An initial list of supply chain performance measures was compiled and then modified by six experts in order to extract the appropriate lean supply chain performance measures. Following this, a questionnaire was designed and sent to 580 supply chain practitioners working at small and medium enterprises in Iran's automotive industry in order to score the measures. Principal component analysis was applied to identify and group the lean supply chain performance components and <b>related</b> <b>measures.</b> From the initial list, a total of 28 performance measures were chosen by the experts and considered essential to monitor the leanness of a supply chain. Four underlying components were identified (quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery and reliability) and the 28 <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> were subsequently grouped under these performance components. By identifying and validating a multidimensional list of lean supply chain performance components and <b>related</b> <b>measures</b> for small and medium enterprises, the research can be useful for practitioners or academics that are going to evaluate the leanness of a supply chain...|$|R
