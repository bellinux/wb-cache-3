5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple of}} units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the issue.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E

5|$|On June 8, 1993, Garza {{was arrested}} at the Cameron County office in Harlingen having {{surrendered}} after an arrest warrant was issued. He was charged with capital murder and held at a county prison with a US$500,000 bond. Garza <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the arrest, and officers stated {{that they could not}} release details of his involvement other than that they had evidence he was involved in Fischer's murder. Arrest warrants were issued for Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña the day before. They were believed to be in Mexico, and police said they were working with Mexican officials to arrest the two men. On July 21, 1993, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez, and his brother Alonso Bazaldúa Cepeda, in Matamoros on a December 1992 murder charge, and for the unauthorized use of a vehicle. However, both men were released at around 3:00a.m. the next day after Olivarez showed the police a writ of amparo (similar to a writ of habeas corpus), which protected his constitutional civil rights. Following their release, the Brownsville police said there were reports that the two suspects were seen in Matamoros, and in Monterrey, Nuevo León, and that next time they tried to cross the international bridge, U.S. border agents would arrest them. Police records show that Olivarez was once arrested in Brownsville on September 12, 1992, for possession of a criminal instrument, but was released on bond the following day. He wrote on his bond application that he lived in Brownsville, though this information was false.|$|E

50|$|The climactic air {{battle of}} 15 September 1940 arrives, with Winston Churchill in {{attendance}} at 11 Group's operations room.

25|$|In 2008, {{a former}} FBI agent {{asserted}} that {{some members of}} the Hells Angels had conspired to murder Mick Jagger in retribution for the Rolling Stones' lack of support following the concert, and for the negative portrayal of the Angels in the Gimme Shelter film.

Before the operation, Pilar reads Robert Jordan's palm, and after seeing it, <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> what she saw, foreshadowing his untimely demise.|$|R

50|$|Rumours that Heywood {{might have}} been {{employed}} as an agent by British intelligence have been denied by Foreign Secretary William Hague, an unusual move, as the British government typically <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the identity of its agents.

25|$|In July, 2011, GoDaddy {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} blocking DNS queries from some outside DNS servers, {{in order to prevent}} other DNS queries from being too slow.

This policy affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. GoDaddy has <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or they are giving preference to their platinum level customers.
