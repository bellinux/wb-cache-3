40|$|The Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT) welcomes {{plans to}} extend the pilot Community <b>Return</b> <b>Programme</b> {{as one of a}} number of {{measures}} proposed in the Irish Prison Service Strategic Pan 2012 - 2014 to address the chronic overcrowding in Irish prisons. Current levels of overcrowding seriously undermine the Irish prison system’s ability to meet its core goal of rehabilitation and reducing reoffending. IPRT therefore welcomes plans to reduce the prison population to 2007 levels, and thus bring the prison population back to within the operational capacity of Irish prisons. The Community <b>Return</b> <b>Programme</b> is an incentivised scheme under which offenders, who are assessed as posing no threat to the community, are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service. The Irish Prison Service, working in conjunction with the Probation Service, plans to release 400 prisoners per year for the next three years under this supervised scheme. IPRT sees this measure as one part of a wider programme of shifting the balance in the criminal justice system from expensive and ineffective incarceration towards crime prevention and community payback. Speaking today, IPRT Executive Director Liam Herrick said: “International evidence demonstrates that effective and adequately resourced community payback schemes lead to lower reoffending rates, which should be the core goal of any penal system. For every prisoner who is supported in desisting from offending behaviour following their release, there is one less victim. Moreover, communities also benefit directly from the work carried out by offenders. It is in everybody’s interest that this scheme works. ” “IPRT believes this Community <b>Return</b> <b>Programme</b> has the potential for a more structured and transparent system of early release than the system of ad hoc temporary release as it currently operates, which is unsatisfactory for both prisoners and the community alike. However, any early release programme must operate as a transparent process based on clear criteria, open to appeal and to scrutiny. It must also be supported by adequate resourcing of probation and community services, along with increased provision of regimes and education within the prisons. ” “In fact, what is being proposed here is not a great leap from the system that is currently in operation. While prisoners in Ireland have an automatic entitlement to remission of 25...|$|E

40|$|The power-sharing {{agreement}} in Zimbabwe has {{ushered in a}} period of engagement between the diaspora and homeland government, marking a distinct change from the hostility that characterised relations over previous years. This article discusses the politics of this repositioning and the character of the new diasporic organisations formed {{in the wake of the}} Global Political Agreement to take forward agendas of development and reconstruction at home. It argues that these new diasporic organisations have tried to create non-partisan platforms for engagement, have an elite social base, and connect responsibilities for development at home with the desire for formal political rights. Despite an apparent convergence of interest around development and reconstruction on the part of an array of diaspora groups, as well as the Zimbabwean and British governments, there are, nonetheless, tensions among these actors that this article seeks to reveal. It argues that a key issue shaping conversations over engagement is the divergence of interest within the diaspora between those with and without security in their states of residence. This divide is likely to become more salient in the context of a large-scale <b>return</b> <b>programme,</b> especially if there is ongoing uncertainty in Zimbabwe and if repatriation is conceived as a final one-way movement rather than as part of an ongoing circulation in which people may choose to maintain transnational lives. This discussion of the Zimbabwean case thus contributes to broader debates over the tensions that characterise policies of ‘diaspora engagement’...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{recycling}} obsolete mobile phones has significantly increased with their rapidly growing worldwide production and distribution. Return and recycling rates are quite low; {{people tend to}} keep old, unused phones at home instead of returning them for recycling or further use {{because of a lack}} of knowledge and acceptance of <b>return</b> <b>programmes.</b> Thus far, individual use and recycling behavior has not shown any trend towards more sustainable patterns. Consequently, an increased awareness is needed for the high environmental and social impact throughout the whole value chain of a mobile phone - there is simply a lack of information and knowledge regarding sustainability issues around the mobile phone. A teaching material was therefore developed in a German research project, based on the concept of the ecological rucksack, presenting comprehensive information about the value chain of a mobile phone. Its application in different schools led to an increased awareness and interest among pupils for the connection between sustainability, resources and mobile phones.

40|$|The Sub-Committee on Penal Reform was {{established}} specifically to examine ‘back-door strategies which involve {{some form of}} early release‘. Executive summary - recommendations 1. Reduce prison numbers. The Sub-Committee {{is concerned about the}} significant increase over recent years in the numbers of prisoners in Ireland. It strongly recommends the adoption of a ‘decarceration strategy‘; a declared intention by the Government to reduce the prison population by one-third over a ten-year period. 2. Commute prison sentences of less than six months. The Sub-Committee recommends that all sentences for under 6 months imprisonment imposed in respect of non-violent offences should be commuted and replaced with community service orders. 3. Increase standard remission from one-quarter to one-third and introduce an incentivised remission scheme of up to one half. The Sub-Committee recommends that standard remission should be increased from one-quarter to one-third of all sentences over one month in length. An enhanced remission scheme of up to one-half should be made available on an incentivised basis for certain categories of prisoner, particularly those serving a prison sentence for the first time. 4. Introduce legislation providing for structured release, temporary release, parole and community return. The Sub-Committee endorses the Irish Penal Reform Trust recommendation for a single piece of legislation which would set out the basis for a structured release system; to include proposed changes to remission set out above, and to temporary release and parole. The Sub-Committee recommends that this legislation could also provide a statutory framework for an expanded community <b>return</b> <b>programme.</b> Legislation could also underpin the strategies currently used by groups working with offenders post-release, and with potential offenders. 5. Address prison conditions and overcrowding; and increase the use of open prisons. The Sub-Committee was informed that structured release and incentivised remission programmes could not operate effectively within prisons unless prison conditions are improved and overcrowding tackled. The recommendations listed above would help to alleviate the overcrowding problem. In addition, actions should be taken to improve conditions within prisons generally. The proportion of open prisons should also be increased...|$|E

See also Kiander and Virén (2001) and Rodgers (2007) for {{different}} measures of flexibility, and the OECD report (2010 b) for an overall index on the strictness of employment protection legislation. 13 In Ireland, the variable takes the value 1 in the period 1996 - 2008, representing the extraordinary reversal of the migratory flows {{in this country in}} the last years. The marked inflows began in the mid- 1990 s and accelerated in 2004 with the enlargement of the EU; however, in 2009 the net migratory flows became negative (see, for example, Barrett 2009; Barrett and Kelly 2012, and OECD 2006). In the case of Spain the variable takes the value 1 in the period 2000 - 2008, when this economy experienced an immigration boom that lasted until 2008. In 2009, Spain has seen a large decrease of net migration. Since the end of 2008, the Spanish government has implemented a series of measures to revert the migratory inflows (e.g. in September 2008 it introduced a voluntary <b>return</b> <b>programme</b> for non-EU migrants, the Royal Decree 4 / 2008 of 19 September). Although there is not yet a clear evidence of the impact of these measures, there is some support that immigrants are leaving Spain (see, for example, Leschke and Watt 2010 and OECD 2009 a). 14 The Spanish labour force series comes from the OECD Economic Outlook 87, but only for years 1977 - 2009. To stretch the series back to 1967 we rely on the AMECO (2010) database of the European Commission; we use the growth rate of the AMECO series into the original OECD series for 1967 - 1976.15 The sample, too, is somewhat larger in this case, and covers some of the years under Franco’s dictatorship. That explains the unusually and deceptive low unemployment rates experienced up until Franco’s death (1975), as seen in most of the centrally-planned economies of the world –both right and left. Despite this issue, our counterfactual experiments below are robust to the re-estimation of the model using a restricted sample for the democracy period (1976 - 2009 instead of 1967 - 2009). 16 At this stage we only consider the I(1) variables in our models: n [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-return}} of rejected international protection applicants does not enjoy a high political profile on its own, {{but has been}} discussed {{as part of a}} global debate on asylum. Significant efforts are required when considering the wide spectrum of possible reasons of non-return, some reasons depending on the countries of destination, others on the returnee himself/herself. In this respect, reasons of non return range from the non-respect of deadlines, the issuance of travel documents, postponement of removal for external reasons to the returnee, for medical reasons, the resistance of the third-country national and the lack of diplomatic representation of Luxembourg, to name but a few. In regards to the procedure, in Luxembourg the rejection of the international protection application includes the return decision. The Minister in charge of Immigration, through the Directorate of Immigration, issues this decision. The return decision only becomes enforceable when all appeals are exhausted and the final negative decision of rejection of the competent judicial authority enters into force, as appeals have suspensive effects. This decision also sets out the timeframe during which the rejected international protection applicant has to leave the country. In case the applicant does not opt for a voluntary return, the decision will also include the country to which s/he will be sent. In general, the decision provides for a period of 30 days during which the applicant has the option to leave voluntarily and to benefit from financial support in case of assisted voluntary return through the International Organization for Migration (IOM). There are two exceptions to this rule: the applicant who is considered a threat to national security, public safety or homeland security and the applicant who has already been issued a return decision before. The declaration and documentation provided during the procedure of international protection can be used to facilitate return. Subsequent applications are possible, in particular if new evidence of facts appears resulting in an increased likelihood of the applicant to qualify for international protection. For rejected international protection applicants who did not opt for voluntary return and did not receive any postponement of removals, a certain (limited) support is available while waiting for the execution of the enforceable return decision. As such, they continue to stay in reception facilities and to receive certain social benefits unless they transgress any internal rules. If an urgent need exists, rejected applicants may be granted a humanitarian social aid. However, they are not entitled to access the labour market or to receive ‘pocket money’ or the free use of transport facilities. They benefit from an access to education and training, however this access cannot constitute a possible reason for non-return. These benefits are available to rejected applicants until the moment of their removal. In order to enforce the return decision and prevent absconding, the Minister may place the rejected international applicant in the detention centre, especially if s/he is deemed to be obstructing their own return. Other possible measures include house arrest, regular reporting surrendering her/his passport or depositing a financial guarantee of 5000 €. Most of these alternatives to detention were introduced with the Law of 18 December 2015 which entered into force on 1 st January 2016. As a consequence, detention remains the main measure used to enforce return decisions. A number of challenges to return and measures to curb them are detailed in this study. A part of these measures have been set up to minimize the resistance to return from the returnee. First and foremost is the advocacy of the AVRR programme and the dissemination of information relating to this programme but also the establishment of a specific <b>return</b> <b>programme</b> to West Balkan countries not subject to visa requirements. Other measures aim at facilitating the execution of forced returns, such as police escorts or the placement in the detention centre. Finally, significant efforts are directed towards increasing bilateral cooperation and a constant commitment to the conclusion of readmission agreements. No special measures were introduced after 2014 in response to the exceptional flows of international protection applicants arriving in the EU. While the Return service within the Directorate of Immigration has continued to expand its participation to European Networks and in various transnational projects in matters of return, this participation was already set into motion prior to the exceptional flows of 2014. As for effective measures curbing challenges to return, this study brings to light the AVRR programme but especially the separate <b>return</b> <b>programme</b> for returnees from West Balkan countries exempt of visa requirements. The dissemination of information on voluntary return is also considered an effective policy measure, the information being made available from the very start of the international protection application. Among the cases where return is not immediately possible, a considerable distinction has to be made in regards to the reasons for the non-return. Indeed, in cases where the delay is due to the medical condition of the returnee or to material and technical reasons that are external to the returnee, a postponement of removal will be granted. This postponement allows for the rejected applicant to remain on the territory on a temporary basis, without being authorized to reside and may be accompanied by a measure of house arrest or other. In cases of postponement for medical reasons and of subsequent renewals bringing the total length of postponement over two years, the rejected applicant may apply for a residence permit for private reasons based on humanitarian grounds of exceptional seriousness. Nevertheless, apart from this exception, no official status is granted to individuals who cannot immediately be returned. Several measures of support are available to beneficiaries of postponement to removal: they have access to accommodation in the reception centres they were housed in during their procedure, they may be attributed humanitarian aid, they continue to be affiliated at the National Health Fund, they continue to have access to education and professional training and they are allowed to work through a temporary work authorization. The temporary work authorization is only valid for a single profession and a single employer {{for the duration of the}} postponement to removal, although this is an extremely rare occurrence in practice. OLAI may allocate a humanitarian aid might be allocated if the individual was already assisted by OLAI during the procedure of her/his international protection application. All of these measures apply until the moment of return. The study also puts forth a number of best practices such as the Croix-Rouge’s involvement in police trainings, their offer of punctual support to vulnerable people through international networking or the socio-psychological support given to vulnerable people placed in the detention centre among others. A special regard has to be given to AVRR programmes and their pre-departure information and counselling, the dissemination of information and the post-arrival support and reintegration assistance. Indeed, stakeholders singled the AVRR programme out as a best practice and the Luxembourgish government has made voluntary return a policy priority for a long time. However, this increased interest in voluntary returns has to be put into perspective as research shows that sustainable success of voluntary return and reintegration measures is only achieved for a very restricted number of beneficiaries (namely for young, autonomous and dynamic returnees with sizeable social networks and who were granted substantial social capital upon return). Hence, returning women remains a sensitive issue, especially if they were fleeing abusive relationships. Another factor contributing to hardship set forth by research is the difficult reintegration of returnees that have lived outside of their country of return for a prolonged period of time and are therefore unable to rely on social networks for support or for a sense of belonging. Based on these considerations, NGOs and academia cast doubts on the ‘voluntary’ nature of these return programmes, their criticism targeting the misleading labelling of these policy measures...|$|E

30|$|Nevertheless, Afghans did {{return from}} Europe after 2002, under various conditions. First, the greater ability {{to travel to}} Afghanistan led to {{a growing number of}} Afghans with {{permanent}} residence status who were willing to return to invest in and contribute to the reconstruction of the country (Jazayery, 2002). While most of them returned temporarily to work in the reconstruction, interpreting and consultancy sectors and to sell or rent family properties, a small proportion of these returnees stayed in Afghanistan for a longer term (Blitz et al., 2005; Oeppen, 2009). Second, after the events of 11 September 2001, a general rise in xenophobia led to stricter migration policies (Hyndman, 2012; Koser & Black, 1999).
