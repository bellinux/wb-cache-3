5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a <b>readout</b> in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
25|$|The {{accuracy}} of an analog computer {{is limited by}} its computing elements as well as quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer <b>readout</b> was limited chiefly by the precision of the <b>readout</b> equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. The precision of a digital computer {{is limited by the}} word size; arbitrary-precision arithmetic, while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that might be needed.|$|E

40|$|Event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs) {{were recorded}} from the scalp of subjects as they monitored changing digital <b>readouts</b> for values that went 'out-of-bounds'. Workload was manipulated by varying {{the number of}} <b>readouts</b> that were monitored concurrently. The ERPs elicited by changes in the <b>readouts</b> showed long latency positivities that increased in amplitude, {{not only with the}} number of <b>readouts</b> monitored, but also with the number of monitored <b>readouts</b> that were 'in danger' of going out-of-bounds. No effects were found due to the number of nonmonitored <b>readouts</b> 'in danger'. This evidence indicates that subjects (1) selectively attended to the monitored <b>readouts</b> and (2) processed the monitored <b>readouts</b> differently as the <b>readouts</b> approached the out-of-bounds levels to which an overt response was required...|$|R

25|$|He was a {{research}} associate at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the bubble chamber experimental research group from 1978–1982. There he was responsible for the hybrid bubble chamber facility's lead glass detector, in collaboration with colleagues from Duke University, Florida State University and the University of Tennessee. On the physics faculty at the University of Tennessee from 1982–1988, he continued investigations of photoproduction of charmed particles and vector mesons at SLAC. He joined the SLD Collaboration, beginning preparations for an experiment at the SLAC Linear Collider. He studied the design of a uranium calorimeter for SLD and in 1985 published an analysis in collaboration with Tony A. Gabriel — the first to show that despite earlier experimental work, compensation cannot be achieved with liquid argon <b>readout.</b> Using Monte Carlo calculations, Brau and Gabriel showed the importance of low energy neutron interactions with the <b>readout</b> medium hydrogen to achieve compensation.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, the wide fan-shaped signal presented serious problems when more than one aircraft entered the beam. In this case, the bearing <b>readout</b> would always say it was mis-aligned, and {{it was impossible for}} the range readers to know which aircraft they were measuring. Even the most experienced crews were unable to satisfactorily track a target in these conditions.|$|E
25|$|BiFC enables direct {{visualisation}} {{of protein}} interactions in living cells with limited cell perturbation, {{rather than relying}} on secondary effects or staining by exogenous molecules that can fail to distribute evenly. This, and the ability to observe the living cells for long periods of time, is made possible by the strong intrinsic fluorescence of the reconstituted reporter protein reduces the chances of an incorrect <b>readout</b> associated with the protein isolation process.|$|E
25|$|Short-term {{facilitation}} {{has been}} demonstrated to serve as both working memory and mapping input for <b>readout,</b> short-term depression for removing auto-correlation. Long-term potentiation is used for spatial memory storage while long-term depression for both encoding space features, selective weakening of synapses and clearing old memory traces respectively. Forward spike-timing-dependent plasticity is used for long range temporal correlation, temporal coding and spatiotemporal coding. The reversed spike-timing-dependent plasticity acts as sensory filtering.|$|E

25|$|The suit's {{integral}} facemask {{has its own}} HUD, displaying typical data {{including a}} tactical map, health, current energy levels, and weapons information. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a booting <b>readout</b> and visual distortion during abnormal operation. A particularly useful utility is the binocular function, which allows the player to zoom in and electronically tag enemies and vehicles from afar, thereby tracking their movement on the tactical display.|$|E
25|$|Analog meters {{are also}} useful where {{the trend of}} a {{measurement}} {{is more important than}} an exact value obtained at a particular moment. A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a digital <b>readout.</b> For this reason, digital multimeters often approximate this with a bargraph (typically with a more rapid reading response than the primary readout); the most effective of these are arranged in an arc, to simulate the pointer of an analog meter.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Clark and Ann Lyons {{from the}} Cincinnati Children’s Hospital {{developed}} the first glucose enzyme electrode. This biosensor {{was based on}} a thin layer of glucose oxidase (GOx) on an oxygen electrode. Thus, the <b>readout</b> was the amount of oxygen consumed by GOx during the enzymatic reaction with the substrate glucose. This publication {{became one of the most}} often cited papers in life sciences. Due to this work he is considered the “father of biosensors,” especially with respect to the glucose sensing for diabetes patients.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} there are {{described}} methods {{of two and}} three voltmeter <b>readouts</b> for insulation resistance periodic measurement in live DC and AC/DC IT networks. A new measuring method for AC/DC networks is proposed. Application of a novel algorithm for shortening of measurement cycle is explained. Methodology. All methods of two and three voltmeter <b>readouts</b> consist in connection of a resistor and measurement of mean value of network’s fixed point-to-ground voltages. Results. A new algorithm implemented in KDZ- 3 device enables determination of steady-state voltage of a DC network’s pole much faster than in other exploited systems. Originality. In author’s modification of two voltmeter <b>readouts</b> method, line-to-ground voltage mean value is measured at AC side of AC/DC network. This innovation has not been applied for implementation of periodic insulation monitoring in AC/DC IT networks yet. Practical value. The use of author’s innovation will allow to execute measurements at AC side of AC/DC IT networks which might be necessary if rectifier’s output circuits are unavailable. Shortening of measurement cycle duration {{of two or three}} voltmeter <b>readouts</b> method’s is of great importance in networks with high capacitance...|$|R

25|$|The optical microscope, {{designed}} by the University of Arizona, is capable of making images of the Martian regolith with a resolution of 256 pixels/mm or 16 micrometers/pixel. The field {{of view of the}} microscope is a 2x2 mm sample holder to which the robotic arm delivers the sample. The sample is illuminated either by 9 red, green and blue LEDs or by 3 LEDs emitting ultraviolet light. The electronics for the <b>readout</b> of the CCD chip are shared with the robotic arm camera which has an identical CCD chip.|$|E
25|$|Automation is an {{important}} element in HTS's usefulness. Typically, an integrated robot system consisting of one or more robots transports assay-microplates from station to station for sample and reagent addition, mixing, incubation, and finally <b>readout</b> or detection. An HTS system can usually prepare, incubate, and analyze many plates simultaneously, further speeding the data-collection process. HTS robots that can test up to 100,000 compounds per day currently exist. Automatic colony pickers pick thousands of microbial colonies for high throughput genetic screening. The term uHTS or ultra-high-throughput screening refers (circa 2008) to screening in excess of 100,000 compounds per day.|$|E

The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers 1 week after the accident; they were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for <b>readout.</b> The victims' remains were transported to the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office in Hauppauge, New York.|$|E

40|$|Computational {{models of}} {{enhancer}} function generally assume that transcription factors (TFs) exert their regulatory effects independently, modeling an enhancer as a “bag of sites. ” These models fail on endogenous loci that harbor multiple enhancers, and a “two-tier” model appears better suited: in each enhancer TFs work independently, {{and the total}} expression is a weighted sum of their expression <b>readouts.</b> Here, we test these two opposing views on how cis-regulatory information is integrated. We fused two Drosophila blastoderm enhancers, measured their <b>readouts,</b> and applied the above two models to these data. The two-tier mechanism better fits these <b>readouts,</b> suggesting that these fused enhancers comprise multiple independent modules, despite having sequence characteristics typical of single enhancers. We show that short-range TF-TF interactions are not sufficient to designate such modules, suggesting unknown underlying mechanisms. Our results underscore that mechanisms of how modules are defined and how their outputs are combined remain to be elucidated...|$|R
