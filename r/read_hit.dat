Due to their proprietary nature, software licenses typically prevent the disclosure of performance information. This has resulted in limited research being carried out in analyzing their performance. Improvements in technology have resulted in increases in processor speed and decreases in cost of main memory and I/O latency. This has resulted in more powerful desktops systems being available at lower prices. In the near future, it is likely that desktop environments may be the choice for small to medium sized database applications. We analyze the performance of Decision Support Systems for the desktop environment. We implement the TPC-H DSS benchmark using the SHORE storage manager on the Windows 2000 platform for this purpose. We find that there is a high amount of sequentiality in the accesses to the database. The file cache performance is very good with copy <b>read</b> <b>hit</b> rates of more than 95 percent. We also find that the performance and scalability of the database depends {{on the nature of the}} queries as well as the size and content of the database. Based on our observations, we believe that the desktop environment can support small to medium scale database applications. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel cache {{management}} mechanism termed the Content-Based Buffer Cache. The Content-Based Buffer Cache (CBBC) attempts to maintain a single copy of any block in memory according to its contents. In the presence of repeated content, this mechanism increases the effective size of the buffer cache. Overheads for maintaining this extra state information are small and bounded, providing an overall system performance improvement. Additionally, we eliminate writes to blocks where the new and old content are the same, reducing pressure on the I/O subsystems in the presence of these “Silent Writes”. We have logged traces of block-level disk access for a group of workstations over a several month period using a modified Linux kernel designed to boot off of an iSCSI target. We have analyzed single client access, as well as multiple client access to distinct logical disks using a unified block cache. There is significant replication of content and significant numbers of “Silent Writes ” within a single workstation trace, improving the Content-Based Buffer Cache <b>read</b> <b>hit</b> rate as much as 80 % over the traditional buffer cache design. We have also found that there is significant sharing of content between disks, which benefits content-based caching performance {{in the presence of a}} unified cache. For our workloads, these results indicate that content-based buffer caches dramatically improve I/O performance when used to manage a cluster of similar storage. ...|$|E

40|$|How {{can it be}} that meaning {{arises in}} the absence of overt {{linguistic}} structure? This is the puzzle of ellipsis – a puzzle that has been a major preoccupation in theoretical linguistics for several decades. One intruiging aspect of the puzzle concerns the phenomenon of sloppy identity, illustrated with VP ellipsis (VPE) in (1) : (1) John said Mary hit him. Bill did too. (said Mary hit John/Bill) Here, the antecedent VP is said Mary hit him, with him referring to John. The elided VP is ambiguous between a strict reading, Bill said Mary hit John and a sloppy reading, Bill said Mary hit Bill. Surprisingly, this ambiguity seems to disappear in the following variant of (1) : (2) John said Mary hit him. Bill said she did too. (hit John/*Bill) Here, there emerges a clear preference for the strict <b>reading</b> <b>hit</b> John. What might account for this remarkable fact? In this paper, I will suggest that this rebinding puzzle reflects a fundamental fact about the computational system which links syntactic structure with meaning. I will propose that this system operates in a monotonic fashion: that is, meaning representations are constructed as early as possible during a bottom-up derivation, and the resulting meaning representations cannot be revised later. In what follows, I begin with the original account of the re-binding puzzle, due to Sag (1976), who first observed the phenomenon. I argue that Sag’s account i...|$|R
5000|$|The agrarian {{argument}} developed particularly through Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation (1944), Maurice Dobb's Studies in the Development of Capitalism (1946), and Robert Brenner's [...] "Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe" [...] (1976). In {{the wake}} of the Norman Conquest, the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but tenants (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible {{to be able to}} win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the enclosures. In this <b>reading,</b> <b>'it</b> was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism.

Instead of assigning reads one by one to the taxonomy tree as many existing methods do, we propose a statistical framework to model the identified candidate genomes to which sequence <b>reads</b> have <b>hits.</b> After obtaining the estimated proportion of reads generated by each genome, sequence reads are assigned to the candidate genomes and the taxonomy tree based on the estimated probability by taking into account both sequence alignment scores and estimated genome abundance.

40|$|Despite a low {{occurrence}} rate, silent {{data corruption}} represents {{a growing concern}} for storage systems designers. Throughout the storage hierarchy, from the file system down to the disk drives, various solutions exist to avoid, detect, and correct silent data corruption. Undetected errors during the completion of WRITEs may cause silent data corruption. A portion of the WRITE errors may be detected and corrected successfully by verifying the data written on the disk with the data in the disk cache. Write verification traditionally is scheduled immediately after a WRITE completion (Read After Write- RAW) which is unattractive, because it degrades user performance. To reduce the performance penalty associated with RAW, we propose to retain the written content in the disk cache and verify it once the disk drive becomes idle. Although attractive, this approach (called IRAW-Idle Read After Write) contends for resources, i. e., cache and idle time, with user traffic and other background activities. In this paper, we present a trace-driven evaluation of IRAW and show its feasibility. Our analysis indicates that idleness is present in disk drives and can be utilized for WRITE verification with minimal effect on user performance. IRAW benefits significantly if some amount of cache, i. e., 1 or 2 MB, is dedicated to retain the unverified WRITEs. If the cache is shared with the user requests then a cache retention policy that places both READs and WRITEs upon completion at the most recently used cache segment, yields best IRAW performance without effecting user <b>READs</b> cache <b>hit</b> ratio and overall user performance. ...|$|R
