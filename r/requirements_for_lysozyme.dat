40|$|The {{requirement}} of ultrahigh temperature (UHT) -treated Clostridium perfringens spores <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> and {{the sensitivity of}} heated and unheated spores to lysozyme were studied. The UHT-treated spores requiring <b>lysozyme</b> <b>for</b> germination and colony formation originated from {{only a small portion}} of the non-UHT-treated spore population. This raised a question of whether the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> was natural to the spores or was induced by the UHT treatments. However, these spores did not require <b>lysozyme</b> <b>for</b> germination before UHT treatment, which confirmed that the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> had been induced by the UHT treatment. Only 1 to 2 % of the spores were naturally sensitive to lysozyme; therefore, the mere addition of lysozyme to the plating medium did not permit the enumeration of all survivors. Treatment of UHT-treated spores with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) sensitized the spores to lysozyme and increased by 10 - to 100 -fold the number of survivors that were detected on a medium containing lysozyme. Under the heating conditions used, spores that were naturally sensitive to lysozyme and spores that required EDTA treatment were equally heat resistant...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a simple and sensitive analytical method <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> using Plasmon Resonance Light-Scattering (PRLS) technique with Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the probe. Nanomolar level of lysozyme induced AuNPs aggregation with enhanced PRLS. For 1. 4 nM citrate-capped AuNPs (13 nm in diameter), the linear range of the calibration curve was 15 - 50 nM with a detection limit of 13. 1 nM <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme.</b> Six nanomolar lysozyme can produce an observable PRLS enhancement. Most potential interfering substances present in urine had a negligible effect on the determination.

The 90. 1 - 118. 2 % recovery was achieved for 8 individual lysozyme-spiked urinary samples.

40|$|The {{influence}} of succinylation on lysozyme is studied using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The spectroscopic data reveal that {{at room temperature}} the structures of succinylated lysozyme and native lysozyme are similar. However, the calorimetric {{results show that the}} thermal stability of succinylated lysozyme is lower than that of native <b>lysozyme.</b> <b>For</b> succinylated <b>lysozyme,</b> the denaturation temperature (T-d) varies in the range of 325 - 333 K (52 - 60 degrees C) and the associated denaturation enthalpy (Delta(den) H) varies between 225 and 410 kJ/mol. <b>For</b> <b>lysozyme,</b> T-d is 342 - 349 K (69 - 76 degrees C) and Delta(den) H is 440 - 500 kJ/mol, From these data, the change in the heat capacity (Delta(den) C(p)) upon thermal denaturation is derived, <b>For</b> <b>lysozyme,</b> Delta(den) C(p) is 7. 5 kJ/mol/K, and <b>for</b> succinylated <b>lysozyme,</b> it is 16. 7 kJ/mol/K.

The high value of Delta(den) C(p) <b>for</b> succinylated <b>lysozyme</b> is explained in terms of an extended degree of unfolding of the secondary structure and exposure of the apolar parts of the succinyl groups, Furthermore, the Gibbs energy of denaturation, as a function of temperature, derived from the thermodynamic analysis of the calorimetric data, indicates a cold-denaturated state of succinylated lysozyme below 20 degrees C. However, because a denatured state at low temperatures could not be detected by CD or fluorescence measurements, the native state may be considered to be metastable at those conditions...|$|R

Polymer grafting provided a three-dimensional regular arrangement of the ligand and increased ionic capacity of the poly(SPM) -grafted cation-exchangers. The result showed that adsorption capacity <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> enhanced greatly in poly(SPM) -grafted cation-exchangers whereas adsorption capacity for gamma-globulin decreased dramatically.

By constrast, the repulsive excluded volume interaction between grafted polymer and protein was remarkable in adsorption of gamma-globulin on poly(SPM) -grafted cation exchangers. Moreover, the poly(SPM) -grafted cation exchangers exhibited great salt tolerance in protein adsorption and distinct intraparticle mass transfer properties.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we have {{reported}} a novel electrochemical aptamer–antibody based sandwich biosensor {{for the detection}} of lysozyme.

After incubating with a target protein (lysozyme), a biotinylated antibody was used to complete the sandwich format. The subsequent additions of avidin-alkaline phosphatase as an enzyme label, and a 1 -naphthyl phosphate substrate (1 -NPP) allowed us to determine the concentration of lysozyme (Lys) via Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) of the generated enzyme reaction product, 1 -naphthol.

In addition, the results obtained by this method were compared with the results obtained by the Zirmil-beating cell disruption method and the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. The OD 260 /OD 280 ratio and concentration of the DNA extracted using the CLU method were 2.02 and 282.8  µg/µL, respectively; when the incubation temperatures <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> and RNase were adjusted to 37  °C, those values were 2.08 and 309.8  µg/µL, respectively.

The lysozyme assay was able to detect more of the individuals with TB (sensitivity, 100 % for 19 patients) or leprosy (sensitivity, 86 % for 36 patients) than either antibody assay. In particular, lysozyme levels were raised in a higher proportion of the paucibacillary leprosy patients (83 % of 17), for whom the antibody assays were less sensitive; the LAM IgG and the phenolic glycolipid- 1 IgM levels were raised in only 62 and 44 % of 16 patients, respectively. The data suggest that lysozyme measurements may be useful in the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections and other chronic infectious granulomatoses...|$|R
40|$|Glycerol {{has been}} shown to lower the heat {{denaturation}} temperature (T(m)) of dehydrated lysozyme while elevating the T(m) of hydrated lysozyme (. J. Pharm. Sci. 84 : 707 - 712). Here, we report an in situ elastic neutron scattering study of the effect of glycerol and hydration on the internal dynamics of lysozyme powder. Anharmonic motions associated with structural relaxation processes were not detected <b>for</b> dehydrated <b>lysozyme</b> in the temperature range of 40 to 450 K. Dehydrated lysozyme was found to have the highest T(m) by. Upon the addition of glycerol or water, anharmonicity was recovered above a dynamic transition temperature (T(d)), which may contribute to the reduction of T(m) values <b>for</b> dehydrated <b>lysozyme</b> in the presence of glycerol. The greatest degree of anharmonicity, as well as the lowest T(d), was observed <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> solvated with water. Hydrated lysozyme was also found to have the lowest T(m) by. In the regime above T(d), larger amounts of glycerol lead to a higher rate of change in anharmonic motions as a function of temperature, rendering the material more heat labile. Below T(d), where harmonic motions dominate, the addition of glycerol resulted in a lower amplitude of motions, correlating with a stabilizing effect of glycerol on the protein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{phase diagram}} <b>for</b> <b>lysozyme</b> is {{calculated}} <b>for</b> the precipitant salt NaCl using a potential of mean force {{that takes into}} account contributions from ion-dispersion forces (J. Phys. Chem. B 110 24757). In contrast to the perturbation theory calculation, we find that the lysozyme phase diagram with NaCl has a metastable fluid-fluid coexistence curve. We also compare our predicted phase diagram with experimental results in the case of NaCl. Our results suggest that a refined version of the current model is necessary to account quantitatively for the experimental phase diagram of lysozyme...|$|R
