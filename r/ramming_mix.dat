40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{modelling}} of a specific <b>ramming</b> <b>mix</b> mainly used in the high-temperature industry due to its high-compacting behaviour. This material has the ability to absorb the deformation of parts submitted to high thermal loads. Triaxial and instrumented die compaction tests were carried out in order to identify the shear and hardening behaviours, respectively. Tests on the <b>ramming</b> <b>mix</b> were led for a temperature range between 20 C and 80 C. The temperature effect is particularly observed on the material response when it is compacted. The main features of the behaviour of the <b>ramming</b> <b>mix</b> can be represented by the theoretical framework of the Modified Cam-Clay model. A single variable allows to accurately reproduce the hardening behaviour depending on the temperature. Moreover, an extension of the model for the hardening behaviour at high pressures is proposed. A good agreement between the experimental data and numerical tests is reached with this model...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} thermo-mechanical model of a blast furnace hearth able to {{estimate}} the stress state in service. To identify the behaviour of bricks, mortars and <b>ramming</b> <b>mix,</b> characterization tests have been developed for temperatures up to 1500 °C. A modified Cam-clay model is identified for the <b>ramming</b> <b>mix.</b> The masonry modelling is based on a macroscopic approach where bricks and mortars are replaced by a set of equivalent homogeneous materials accounting for the different joint states (open or closed). The non linearity of the behaviour is reproduced thanks to a stress criterion, allowing the transition from one state to another. The final modelling of a hearth is compared with in-situ instrumentation results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSaint-Gobain {{has a long}} {{experience}} {{in the design and}} supply of blast furnace hearth linings. The Blast Furnace Hearth is arguably the most critical part within the whole integrated steel plant when considering overall potential profit/loss. Typical wear lines found in the BF hearth match closely with the areas subject to highest Thermo-Mechanical stresses. There is clear interest in being able to estimate the thermo-mechanical stresses experienced between different designs. Thanks to FEM tools, SG has a means of evaluating these stresses in the hearth and in order to complete their expertise, they have launched an ambitious program of material modelling and characterization aimed at designing a model as close to reality as possible. The last developments include: - The identification of the mortar joint behaviour as a function of temperature. For that purpose, new compressive tests at high temperature have been developed; - A modelling method with Equivalent Homogeneous Materials for pad as well as walls has been used. This calculation method makes it possible {{to take into account the}} behaviour of the very soft and numerous joints. As a consequence, the hearth stiffness is globally reduced; - A precise and appropriate identification of the <b>ramming</b> <b>mix</b> behaviour through a Cap model, defining hardening behaviour in compression. Accounting for this specific behaviour is a key point considering its strain absorbing role due to lining expansion. At the same time efforts are being made to register actual stresses found in the BF hearth. With the results from the improved model calculation and better knowledge of the actual stresses which are experienced, we will be better placed to make advances in the correct direction regarding design considerations...|$|E

In some tests, the cold faces were water cooled. With water cooling, the silicon carbides showed virtually no attack after 500 h. In the absence of water cooling, the chrome-alumina-magnesia spinels were the most resistant to slag attack but were subject to thermal-shock cracking.

Empirical correlations were validated for kLa as a function of shaking frequency and superficial area/filling volume ratio and rendered adequate values for the adjusted R 2 with an accuracy of ± 30 %. Further, we compared the Escherichia coli kinetics of growth, glucose uptake, dissolved oxygen tension (DOT), and organic acids production in RAM and OM at two equivalent initial kLa. Similar E. coli kinetics were observed at an initial kLa of 46 h− 1, but not at 92 h− 1 where differences in DOT and culture parameters were found, mainly in growth rate and biomass yield on glucose, which is the result of different oxygen transfer rates due to the increased gas pressures in RAM...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{impressive}} developments observed in the last 20 years, {{the improvement of the}} installation methods of monolithic refractories is certainly to be taken into account. However, this evolution, from vibratable castables to shotcrete and drycrete was not applied to materials based on magnesia, which are still mostly commercialized as <b>ramming</b> <b>mixes,</b> or as pouring castables with poor properties due to excessive water use. The major issues associated to this lack of technology is the scarcity of submicrometric powders compatible to magnesian systems, and the expansion followed by hydration of the magnesia, which is a disruptive reaction. By a thorough research on the literature, some potential additives were identified to be tested as anti-hydration additives. Hydration tests of powders in autoclave, complemented by pH and rheological measurements on magnesia pastes have identified five possible additives which can be used to inhibit the hydration: tartaric acid, citric acid, boric acid, magnesium fluoride and microsilica. Salts from the organic acids can also be successfully used. Of these, microsilica also presented the advantage of providing the submicrometric particles necessary to improve the flow of the castable, and to improve the bond of the castable. The three acids are very effective in inhibiting the formation of magnesium hydroxide, but affect negatively flow properties and mechanical resistance after cure. Microsilica prevented hydration cracks due to the reaction between the silicic acid generated under basic environment with the newly formed brucite, leading to the precipitation of a magnesium-silica-hydrated phase of poor crystallinity between the magnesia grains. This phase does not promote volumetric change, and also enable water release at a wider temperature range. Due to its nature close to serpentine minerals, it forms forsterite and enstatite at low temperatures, thus generating suitable strength between room temperature and at least 1400 °C. Magnesium fluoride changed the nature of this magnesium-silica-hydrated phase, by being incorporated to it and forming a phase more similar to the humite minerals. These minerals present higher MgO:SiO 2 molar ratio than serpentine, and their formation requires a lower content of microsilica for a same effect against hydration, which is beneficial for the overall properties of the castable. The properties of the castable, as well as the influence of a number of other variables (for instance, refractoriness under load, creep, cold crushing strength, cold modulus of rupture, bulk density and apparent porosity) were also studied and hereby reported. It is believed that this technology can be further developed for industrial use, provided that some issues regarding the properties at high temperatures are solved. Not only had the study and comprehension {{of the nature of the}} bond between microsilica and magnesia, and the role of magnesium fluoride been pioneered by this work, but also the methodology used to evaluate the hydration after the drying process of castings, which was close to real refractory components...|$|R
50|$|The UltraSound cards gained great {{popularity}} in the PC tracker music community. The tracker format was originally developed on the Commodore Amiga personal computer in 1987, but due to the PC becoming more capable of producing high-quality graphics and sound, the demo scene spilled out onto the platform in droves and took the tracker format with it. Typical tracker formats of the era included MOD, S3M and, later, XM. The format stores the notes and the instruments digitally in the file instead of relying on a sound card to reproduce the instruments. A tracker module, when saved to disk, typically incorporates all the sequencing data plus samples, and typically the composer would incorporate his or her assumed name into the list of samples. This primitive precursor to the modern sampler {{opened the way for}} Gravis to enter the market, because the requirements matched the capabilities of the GF1 chip ideally. The problem with the other sound cards playing this format was that they had to downmix voices into one or both of its output channels in software, further deteriorating the quality of 8-bit samples in process. An UltraSound card was able to download the samples to its <b>RAM</b> and <b>mix</b> them using fast and high-quality hardware implementation, offloading the CPU from the task. Gravis realized early on that the demo scene support could be a sales booster, and they gave away 6000 cards for free to the most famous scene groups and people in the scene.|$|R
40|$|From the archetypical {{example of}} Taylor-Aris {{dispersion}} to chaotic advection in duct flows, transverse mixing is wellknown to suppress both longitudinal dispersion and residence time distribution (RTD) variance in mean translational flows. In this paper {{we consider the}} connection between these transport modes which are quantified in terms of fundamental solutions of the advection-diffusion operator, and demonstrate how asymptotic and pre-asymptotic RTD evolution is governed by the transverse mixing eigenmodes in both axially-constant and axially-periodic duct flows. This formalism is validated via application to a axially-periodic chaotic mixing flow, the Rotated Arc <b>Mixing</b> (<b>RAM)</b> flow, and predictions of RTD evolution based on the transverse mixing eigenmodes agree very well with experimental observations.

The absence of internal obstructions benefits the performance of the RAM in several ways. The geometry is amenable to in-depth analysis and is easier to scale up and optimize for specific applications. The absence of internals also has the benefit of making the RAM less susceptible to clogging and fouling, which can reduce downtime and maintenance cost. The RAM exploits chaotic advection to mix and transport heat in viscously dominated (low Reynolds number) flows. Among other things the RAM can effect good in-line mixing of viscous materials with a pressure drop that is {{the same as that of}} an open pipe; moreover, the RAM has several control parameters to tune the chaotic advection, making it flexible for applications.

The wall temperature profile evolution and resultant steady state gradients were very similar regardless of mix type indicating {{that the majority of the}} wall remained relatively dry. Unless liquid water is present, the thermal resistance and heat capacity of these materials does not change sufficiently to make significant differences to temperature profile evolution regardless of soil mix type. Little scope exists to intelligently modify the ability of SRE walls to absorb and store heat energy simply by manipulation of particle size distribution (PSD) and the resultant bulk density/void ratio relationships, under these conditions.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{and recognition of}} sustainability is growing within the construction industry. Traditional rammed earth has many benefits in terms of sustainability. For this reason, this ancient building method is regaining popularity. Also, the conservation of natural resources {{as well as the}} reduction of waste generation is an important aspect of sustainability. Thus, incorporating recycled aggregates (RA) into rammed earth would greatly contribute sustainable practices in the construction industry and promote the wider use of this building technology. The overall target {{of this study is to}} improve the knowledge of rammed earth structures that incorporate RA and to further the development of future sustainable construction. For this purpose, we used artificial soil with different Recycled Aggregates replacement percentages endeavors, to examine the effect of varying different size of RA particles on the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of rammed earth and also compare the linear shrinkage between the mixes with natural aggregates (NA) and with RA. The use of appropriate soil is the key to the success of rammed earth. Therefore the characteristics of the soil are considered important. In the state of the art, we focus on the test methods and explain typical physical properties of rammed earth, production process, compaction of the rammed earth and methods used for construction. Initially the grading and the particles fractions for our artificial soil from natural aggregate was chosen and then after finding the optimum moisture content for rammed earth with natural aggregate we start replacing RA in different percentage instead of bigger particles (gravel and sand) in our samples. Some samples were tested for unconfined compressive strength after 7 days and the other after 28 days. The results of unconfined compressive tests in this experiment indicate that <b>rammed</b> earth <b>mixes</b> with RA have acceptable strength and their compressive strength were fairly lower than natural aggregates. All batches have strengths exceeding 2 MPa and thus can be used in rammed earth construction. The addition of RA in this study does not lead into a decrease in characteristic UCS, and in general, especially when the coarser natural aggregate (gravel) replaced by coarse recycled aggregates. Finally in this study, the results of linear shrinkage test were approving the recommendations and were acceptable. In regards to rammed earth incorporating RA, this study focused in most part on the effect that RA has on the compressive strength and shrinkage of rammed earth. The effect of RA on other properties of rammed earth should also be examined. Other properties such as durability, erosion resistance and thermal conductivity may be affected by the addition of RA and should be study in future...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) We {{present a}} {{parameter}} study of offset mergers between clusters of galaxies. Using the Eulerian hydrodynamics/N-body code COSMOS, we simulate mergers between nonisothermal, hydrostatic clusters with a steep central dark matter density profile and a beta-model gas profile. We constrain global {{properties of the}} model clusters using observed cluster statistical relationships. We consider impact parameters between zero and five times the scale radius and mass ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 3. The morphological changes, relative velocities, and temperature jumps we observe agree with previous studies using the King profile for the dark matter. We observe a larger jump in X-ray luminosity (~ 4 - 10 x) than in previous work, and we argue that this increase is most likely a lower limit due to our spatial resolution. We emphasize that luminosity and temperature jumps due to mergers may have an important bearing on constraints on Omega derived from the observation of hot clusters at high redshift. Shocks are relatively weak in the cluster cores; hence they do not significantly increase the entropy there. Instead, shocks create entropy in the outer regions, and this high-entropy gas is mixed with the core gas during later stages of the merger. <b>Ram</b> pressure initiates <b>mixing</b> by displacing the core gas from its potential center, causing it to become convectively unstable. The resulting convective plumes produce large-scale turbulent motions with eddy sizes up to several 100 kpc. This turbulence is pumped by dark matter-driven oscillations in the gravitational potential. Even after nearly a Hubble time these motions persist as subsonic turbulence in the cluster cores, providing 5 - 10 % of the support against gravity.

One {{of the ways to}} increase the bearing capacity of {{piled foundations}} is the necessity to take into account resistance of foundation bed soil located under raft bottom.
