40|$|Middleware is a {{layer of}} the {{software}} that connects and manages application components running on distributed hosts. Several types of middleware are reflective middleware, eventbased middleware, object-oriented middleware, and message-oriented middleware. Adaptive middleware is part of reflective middleware, that allows the system’s behavior to be altered at run time to better match the system’s current operating environment (e. g. whether the system is being debugged or operating in a real-time environment or in a secure environment). Many vendors develop the middleware as distributed software. Sun, IBM, CORBA, Microsoft and Sybase provide its own architecture in many purposes such as in communication, manufactory, medical, and financial application. IBM offered the RFID infrastructure which had adaptive characteristics. It supported multiple RFID reader devices and minimized network overload. In Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID)</b> <b>application</b> in particular, middleware is implemented for increasing the system performance in network communication, coordination, reliability, scalability, and heterogeneity. <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> is used to process data sent to and received from radio frequency identification (RFID) devices such as RFID readers, writers, and printers.

This research investigated the application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology on construction projects’ supply chain and determined that RFID technology can improve the performance of construction projects. The focus of this research is on the performance impact of RFID on the project schedule through the integration of this technology into the project supply chain. RFID technology is widely used in many industry sectors and it has become the subject of research studies on the construction industry too. However, the majority of these studies investigated the technical feasibility of <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> and simply extended the technical feasibility into potential cost savings. This research instead brings <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> into the context of a construction project’s supply chain. The construction supply chain suffers from uncertainties that shows up as material unavailable cases such as delayed materials, missing and defective materials. This research proposes that these uncertainties can be mitigated by applying RFID technology to the construction supply chain and the project performance can be improved. Industry practices were surveyed to establish a typical industrial construction supply chain model. Simulations of the typical model were conducted to demonstrate the effect on project performance by applying RFID technology. A real world construction project was also studied and actual effect of <b>RFID</b> <b>application</b> and the construction supply chain were examined accordingly. The findings concluded that RFID technology provided timely material availability information and improved the supply chain on-time performance and had the potential to improve the construction project schedule performance. ...|$|E

To secure <b>RFID</b> <b>applications</b> that confine tagged objects in the same RFID system, this paper studies the cloned-tag identification problem.

The execution time of our protocol is only 1. 4 times the value of the time lower bound, being over 91 % less than that of the existing protocol.
