40|$|<b>Rhizosecretion</b> is an {{attractive}} technology {{for the production of}} recombinant proteins from transgenic plants. However, to date, yields of plant-derived recombinant pharmaceuticals by this method have been too low for commercial viability. Studies conducted focused on three transgenic plant lines grown in hydroponic culture medium, two expressing monoclonal antibodies Guy's 13 and 4 E 10 and one expressing a small microbicide polypeptide cyanovirin-N. <b>Rhizosecretion</b> rates increased significantly by the addition of the plant growth regulator alpha-naphthalene acetic acid. The maximum <b>rhizosecretion</b> rates achieved were 58 microg/g root dry weight/ 24 h for Guy's 13, 10. 43 microg/g root dry weight/ 24 h for 4 E 10, and 766 microg/g root dry weight/ 24 h for cyanovirin-N, the highest figures so far reported for a full-length antibody and a recombinant protein, respectively. The plant growth regulators indole-butyric acid, 6 -benzylaminopurine, and kinetin were also demonstrated to increase <b>rhizosecretion</b> of Guy's 13. The effect of the growth regulators differed, as alpha-naphthalene acetic acid and indole-butyric acid increased the root dry weight of hydroponic plants, whereas the cytokinins benzylaminopurine and kinetin increased <b>rhizosecretion</b> without affecting root mass. A comparative glycosylation analysis between MAb Guy's 13 purified from either hydroponic culture medium or from leaf extracts demonstrated a similar pattern of glycosylation comprising high mannose to complex glycoforms. Analysis of the hydroponic culture medium at harvest revealed significantly lower and less complex levels of proteolytic enzymes, in comparison with leaf extracts, which translated to a higher proportion of intact Guy's 13 IgG in relation to other IgG products. Hydroponic medium could be added directly to a chromatography column for affinity purification, allowing simple and rapid production of high purity Guy's 13 antibody. In addition to the attractiveness of controlled cultivation within a contained environment for pharmaceutical-producing plants, this study demonstrates advantages with respect to the quality and downstream purification of recombinant proteins. -Drake, P.

40|$|<b>Rhizosecretion</b> of {{recombinant}} pharmaceuticals from {{in vitro}} hydroponic transgenic plant cultures is a simple, low cost, reproducible and controllable production method. Here, we demonstrate the application and adaptation of this manufacturing platform {{to a human}} antivitronectin IgG 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) called M 12. The rationale for specific growth medium additives was established by phenotypic analysis of root structure and by LC-ESI-MS/MS profiling of the total protein content profile of the hydroponic medium. Through a combination of optimization approaches, mAb yields in hydroponic medium reached 46 μg/mL in 1 week, the highest figure reported for a recombinant mAb in a plant secretion-based system to date. The rhizosecretome was determined to contain 104 proteins, with the mAb heavy and light chains the most abundant. This enabled evaluation of a simple, scalable extraction and purification protocol and demonstration that only minimal processing was necessary prior to protein A affinity chromatography. MALDI-TOF MS revealed that purified mAb contained predominantly complex-type plant N-glycans, in three major glycoforms. The binding of M 12 purified from hydroponic medium to vitronectin was comparable to its Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) -derived counterpart. This study demonstrates that in vitro hydroponic cultivation coupled with recombinant protein <b>rhizosecretion</b> can be a practical, low-cost production platform for monoclonal antibodies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Alternative agriculture, which {{expands the}} uses of plants well beyond food and fiber, is {{beginning}} to change plant biology. Two plant-based biotechnologies were recently developed that {{take advantage of the}} ability of plant roots to absorb or secrete various substances. They are (i) phytoextraction, the use of plants to remove pollutants from the environment and (ii) <b>rhizosecretion,</b> a subset of molecular farming, designed to produce and secrete valuable natural products and recombinant proteins from roots. Here we discuss recent advances in these technologies and assess their potential in soil remediation, drug discovery, and molecular farming...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{promising}} tools to produce complex recombinant proteins like antibodies. When host plants are grown on hydroponics, {{the production of}} recombinant proteins that are secreted by the roots ('rhizosecretion') greatly simplifies harvest and purification of the product, during whole plant life. However, proteases represent up to 10 % of the naturally secreted proteins and are known to significantly decrease the yield of production by <b>rhizosecretion.</b> In this study, we analyzed the rhizosecreted proteases of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. Total rhizosecreted proteins were recovered by salt extraction and the protease activity was assayed in vitro or by zymography. The relative contribution of major protease families to total activity was evaluated with specific inhibitors and revealed {{significant differences between the}} two species. The degradation capacity of the root-secreted proteases was further characterized against selected target proteins: BSA and human IgGs...|$|E
40|$|A plant-based {{system for}} {{continuous}} production of monoclonal antibodies {{based on the}} secretion of immunoglobulin complexes from plant roots into a hydroponic medium (<b>rhizosecretion)</b> was engineered to produce high levels of single-chain and full-size immunoglobulins. Replacing the original signal peptides of monoclonal antibodies with a plant-derived calreticulin signal increased the levels of antibody yield 2 -fold. Cosecretion of Bowman-Birk Ser protease inhibitor reduced degradation of the immunoglobulin complexes in the default secretion pathway and further increased antibody production to 36. 4 μg/g root dry weight per day for single-chain IgG 1 and 21. 8 μg/g root dry weight per day for full-size IgG 4 antibodies. These results suggest that constitutive cosecretion of a protease inhibitor combined {{with the use of}} the plant signal peptide and the antibiotic marker-free transformation system offers a novel strategy to achieve high yields of complex therapeutic proteins secreted from plant roots...|$|E
40|$|Plant-based {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{have gained}} {{a lot of}} interest in the past decade due to their reduced cost and relative safety compared to mammalian cell cultures. While the first plant-made recombinant proteins are now reaching the market, the production systems still need improvements to maximize their competitiveness, proteolysis being one of the main factors limiting the yields. Identifying and inhibiting in vivo endogenous proteases involved in the degradation of recombinant proteins could then lead to a significant increase in production yields. In this study, we focused on two different production systems in Arabidopsis thaliana: <b>rhizosecretion</b> and cell suspensions. Extracellular proteases of both systems were used in vitro to study the conditions of target protein degradation (Bovine Serum Albumine, BSA). First, proteases from both systems degrade BSA at both acidic and neutral-to-basic pH conditions. Then, serine and metallopeptidases were shown to be the main protease classes responsible for BSA degradation by rhizosecreted proteomes or extracellular cell culture media, respectively. Finally, the biochemical tests were coupled to a bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, in order to reduce the number of the proteases most likely involved in BSA degradation. Using this method, only five serine proteases and two metallopeptidases remain candidates for an amiRNA-mediated in vivo inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a {{microbicide}} {{candidate that}} inactivates {{a wide range}} of HIV strains by binding to gp 120. Production of CV-N, or any protein microbicide, needs to be at extremely high levels and low cost {{to have an impact on}} global health. Thus, it is unlikely that fermentor-based systems will be suitable, including recombinant E. coli, where CV-N aggregates and dimers have consistently been found. Transgenic plants may provide a suitable expression system for protein microbicides, as production can be easily and economically scaled up. Here, Nicotiana tabacum was transformed with a gene encoding CV-N to explore proof of concept for the production of CV-N in transgenic plants. Plant-derived rCV-N was recoverable at levels of 130 ng/mg of fresh leaf tissue, or at least 0. 85 % of total soluble plant protein. Western blot analysis demonstrated that virtually all of the rCV-N was expressed in the desired monomeric form. Functionality was demonstrated by specific binding to gp 120 and protection of T-cells from in vitro HIV infection. Hydroponic culturing of transgenic plants demonstrated CV-N <b>rhizosecretion</b> at levels of 0. 64 μg/ml hydroponic media after 24 days. Therefore, we suggest that transgenic plants have the potential to provide strategies for large-scale protein microbicide production...|$|E
40|$|Plant-based {{recombinant}} protein production systems have gained an extensive interest {{over the past}} few years, because of their reduced cost and relative safety. Although the first products are now reaching the market, progress are still needed to improve plant hosts and strategies for biopharming. Targeting {{recombinant protein}}s toward the extracellular space offers several advantages in terms of protein folding and purification, but degradation events are observed, due to endogenous peptidases. This paper focuses on the analysis of extracellular proteolytic activities in two production systems: cell cultures and root-secretion (<b>rhizosecretion),</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. Proteolytic activities of extracellular proteomes (secretomes) were evaluated in vitro against two substrate proteins: bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum immunoglobulins G (hIgGs). Both targets were found to be degraded by the secretomes, BSA being more prone to proteolysis than hIgGs. The analysis of the proteolysis pH-dependence showed that target degradation was mainly dependent upon the production system: rhizosecretomes contained more peptidase activity than extracellular medium of cell suspensions, whereas variations due to plant species were smaller. Using class-specific peptidase inhibitors, serine and metallopeptidases were found to be responsible for degradation of both substrates. An in-depth in silico analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data from Arabidopsis was then performed and led to the identification of a limited number of serine and metallo-peptidases that are consistently expressed in both production systems. These peptidases should be prime candidates for further improvement of plant hosts by targeted silencing...|$|E
40|$|The {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) {{reduction}} pathway from a soil bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri, was engineered in plants to reduce N 2 O emissions. As a proof of principle, transgenic plants expressing nitrous oxide reductase (N 2 OR) from P. stutzeri, encoded by the nosZ gene, and other transgenic plants expressing N 2 OR {{along with the}} more complete operon from P. stutzeri, encoded by nosFLZDY, were generated. Gene constructs were engineered {{under the control of}} a root-specific promoter and with a secretion signal peptide. Expression and <b>rhizosecretion</b> of the transgene protein were achieved, and N 2 OR from transgenic Nicotiana tabacum proved functional using the methyl viologen assay. Transgenic plant line 1. 10 showed the highest specific activity of 16. 7 µmol N 2 O reduced min− 1 g− 1 root protein. Another event, plant line 1. 9, also demonstrated high specific activity of N 2 OR, 13. 2 µmol N 2 O reduced min− 1 g− 1 root protein. The availability now of these transgenic seed stocks may enable canopy studies in field test plots to monitor whole rhizosphere N flux. By incorporating one bacterial gene into genetically modified organism (GMO) crops (e. g., cotton, corn, and soybean) in this way, {{it may be possible to}} reduce the atmospheric concentration of N 2 O that has continued to increase linearly (about 0. 26 % year− 1) over the past half-century...|$|E
40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} (HSPs) are evolutionary highly conserved {{proteins that}} {{are present in}} all living organisms. They were discovered in 1962 by Ferruccio Ritossa during an heat shock experiment on fruits flies, but their identification and the term “heat shock proteins” have been coined in the 1974 (Ritossa, 1962; Tissieres et al., 1974). HSPs are classified into several families according their molecular size: HSP 100, HSP 90, HSP 70, HSP 60 and the small HSP (15 to 30 kDa) and they are located in all cellular and subcellular compartments (nucleus, membrane, cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosome). They are expressed constitutively (cognate proteins or HSC) in all cells but their expression increases (inducible forms or HSP) after several stressful conditions, such as environmental (high temperature, oxidative stress, ultraviolet irradiation, heavy metals), pathological (viral or bacterial infections, inflammatory and malignancies) or physiological stimuli (cellular differentiation, hormones and growth factories (Ellen et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004). Their overexpression is essential for survival of cells and their protective role {{has been shown in}} vitro and in vivo. The principal function of these class of proteins is operate as molecular chaperones contributing to cellular homeostasis. As molecular chaperones HSPs promote the correct folding of nascent proteins and misfolded proteins, prevent the protein aggregation and assist protein transport across membrane (Gehrmann et al., 2008). Recently an additional roles have been associated to HSPs as danger signals and as potent activators of immune system. It has been shown that these molecules are 6 capable of inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by the monocyte-macrophage system and the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells. In particular, mammalian cytosolic HSP 70 and HSP 90 bind antigenic peptides generated in cells and these complexes (HSP-PC) are taken up by antigen presentation cells via α 2 -macroglobulin receptor (CD 91) -mediated endocytosis, resulting in representation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Srivastava, 2002). The capability of HSPs, particularly HSP 70 and HSP 90, to operate as molecular carrier for antigenic determinants suggests the possible application of these molecules for production of conjugated vaccines (Robert, 2003). Lately, Kumaraguru et al. demonstrated that plant HSP 70 mediated activation of mammalian immune system (Kumaraguru et al., 2003). Therefore it‟s feasible to consider the use of plant HSP 70 as adjuvant molecules for vaccines production or for other pharmaceutical applications. Plants represent a renewable source and a safe system for production of molecules {{that can be used for}} human or animal vaccines. Although plants could provide several pharmaceutical molecules the limitation for their massive use is mainly due to the very low content of active molecules in plant bio-mass and to difficult and expensive purification processes. Recombinant DNA technologies permit to overcome these limits. Many works reported the use of plant systems for the expression of therapeutic molecules, such as antibodies, hormones, growth factor, blood components, human and animal vaccines (Ma et al., 2006). Recombinant proteins can be produced in several plant tissues or can be targeted to subcellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), chloroplast and mitochondria, where proteins are more stable, or intercellular space (apoplast). Latest 7 approach can be utilized to facilitate the recovery of recombinant proteins from roots exudates into hydroponic medium. This system, named <b>rhizosecretion,</b> has been used firstly by Borjsiuk and collaborators in 1999 to produce three different recombinant proteins in plant root exudates (Borjsiuk et al., 1999). In our work we used Nicotiana tabacum to induce constitutive expression of Arabidopsis HSP 70. In particular we have genetically engineer tobacco to direct the recombinant HSP 70 in the secretory pathway providing the HSP 70 gene with a ER signal peptide from the abundant ER protein calreticulin of N. plumbaginifolia (Cal-HSP 70). The presence of this signal peptide in the N terminal site of HSP 70 should direct the recombinant protein to apoplasts and subsequently to the <b>rhizosecretion</b> pathway and consequently secrete the protein in the sterile hydroponic medium. Moreover, HSP 70 targeted with the calreticulin signal peptide has been labelled with six histidine residues (His-tag) at its C terminus (Cal-HSP 70 -His). The His-tag signal will allow the rapid detection of His-tag HSP 70 in transgenic tobacco by immunolocalization analysis with anti-His specific antibody. The recombinant genes (Cal-HSP 70 and Cal-HSP 70 -His), were inserted into binary plant expression vector “pJazz”, under transcriptional control of CaMV 35 S constitutive promoter. The expression of HSP 70 in transgenic tobacco was evaluated by Quantitative Real Time PCR analysis. The results showed that HSP 70 gene is correctly transcribed both in leaves and in roots of transgenic plants, although at different levels. A further goal of our work was to purify the recombinant HSP 70 from genetically engineered a strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this case a specific recognition sequence for enterokinase cleavage was added in 5 ‟of the start codon 8 (first ATG) to allow the excision of extra sequences after purification of HSP 70 protein from yeast cells. S. cerevisiae combines the advantages of unicellular organism, such as ease of genetic manipulation and growth, with the capability of proteins processing that are typical for eukaryotic organism (protein folding, assembly and posttranslational modifications). As plants, yeast represent a safe system for the production of recombinant proteins, since there are no health risks arising from the presence of toxins or potential human pathogens. In fact this organism is recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration as an organism generally regarded as safe (Porro et al., 2005). Since 1995 there are many examples of recombinant proteins that were expressed in yeast, spanning from pharmaceutical products (insulin, interferon, erythropoietin, vaccines against hepatitis B) to industrial enzymes (used for treatments of food, feed, detergents and health care) (Porro et al., 2005). To obtain the expression of recombinant His-tag HSP 70 in S. cerevisiae the protein coding gene was cloned under control of yeast inducible promoter GAL 10 in the commercial vector named pESC-Trp (Stratagene). The production of His-tagged HSP 70 was achieved using a 3 liters fermentator and yeast cells were disrupted by using the French Press. Proteins extracted from yeast cells were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The purification level of His-tagged HSP 70 by IMAC was assessed by SDS-olyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western Blot analyses.
