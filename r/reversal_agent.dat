40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} self-associating foldamers have been {{designed}} as heparin <b>reversal</b> <b>agents,</b> as antidotes to prevent bleeding due to this potent antithrombotic agent. The foldamers have a repeating sequence of Lys-Sal, in which Sal is 5 -amino- 2 -methoxy-benzoic acid. These foldamers are designed to self-associate along one face of an extended chain in a β-sheet-like interaction. The methoxy groups were included to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds that preclude the formation of very large amyloid-like aggregates, while the positively charged Lys side chains were introduced to interact electrostatically with the highly anionic heparin polymer. The prototype compound (Lys-Sal) 4 carboxamide weakly associates in aqueous solution at physiological salt concentration in a monomer-dimer-hexamer equilibrium. The association is greatly enhanced at either high ionic strength or {{in the presence of}} a heparin derivative, which is bound tightly. Variants of this foldamer are active in an antithrombin III−factor Xa assay, showing their potential as heparin <b>reversal</b> <b>agents.</b> Foldamers are nonbiological sequence-specific polymers ofdefined-length oligomers that adopt well-defined secon-dary and tertiary structures. 1 − 4 Not only are they used to tes...|$|R

5000|$|In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) [...] transparencies, {{the film}} is first {{processed}} in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding [...] "push" [...] processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical <b>reversal</b> <b>agent</b> is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.|$|E
5000|$|Next, {{the film}} is {{developed}} to completion in the colour developer bath, which contains CD-3 as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the <b>reversal</b> <b>agent</b> absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or [...] "exposes") the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is {{not a part of}} the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the [...] "leftover" [...] of the negative image, that is, a positive image. As the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes in situ. Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to [...] "kick off" [...] the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is changed to iron (II) EDTA ({Fe+++ EDTA} + {Ag^\circ} + Br^- -> {Fe++ EDTA} + AgBr) before fixing, and final wash. The most common processing chemistry for such films is E6, derived from a long line of developers produced for the Ektachrome range of films.|$|E

Study Design: This retrospective cohort study evaluated 1433 abortion procedures performed on women who received intravenous conscious sedation between April 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006. Women were allowed oral intake before the procedure. De-identified data were abstracted from charts using a standardized extraction form. Primary outcomes evaluated were need for <b>reversal</b> <b>agents,</b> need to obtain emergency intravenous access, pulmonary aspiration, need for oxygen supplementation and hospitalization for any reason. Results: Of the 1433 procedures, 410 women received sedation with continuous intravenous access, and 1023 women received sedation by direct venous injection. More than 95 % of women received fentanyl 100 mcg combined with 1 - 2 mg of midazolam. We identified four (0. 3 %) instances of adverse events, none of which occurred as a result of oversedation. No women experienced oral content aspiration. Conclusions: Intravenous conscious sedation with fentanyl and midazolam is safe for outpatient surgical abortion in women without cardiovascular compromise up to 18 weeks of gestation.

Between anticoagulant users and non-users, of whom 70 % underwent early endoscopy, no endoscopy-related adverse events or {{significant differences were found}} in the rate of endoscopic therapy need, transfusion need, rebleeding, or thromboembolism. Rebleeding was associated with shock, comorbidities, low platelet count and albumin level, and low-dose aspirin use but not HAS-BLED score, any endoscopic results, heparin bridge, or international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 2. 5.

40|$|AbstractAs {{expected}} {{with all}} antithrombotic agents, {{there is a}} risk of bleeding complications in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because of the DOAC itself, acute trauma, invasive procedures, or underlying comorbidities. For many bleeding events, a prudent course of action will be to withdraw the DOAC, then “wait and support” the patient, with the expectation that the bleeding event should resolve with time. Likewise, DOAC therapy may be interrupted ahead of a planned procedure, the stopping time being dependent on the agent involved and the patient’s renal function. However, urgent reversal of anticoagulation is required in patients with serious or life-threatening bleeding or in those requiring urgent surgery or procedures. Novel specific <b>reversal</b> <b>agents,</b> either under development or recently approved, will need to be incorporated into local anticoagulation reversal protocols. For dabigatran-treated patients, idarucizumab recently has been approved for clinical use in cases of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding or when patients require emergency surgery or urgent procedures, both associated with a high risk of bleeding. As clinical experience with individual specific <b>reversal</b> <b>agents</b> grows, their roles in managing major bleeding events in DOAC—treated patients will become better defined. Future research, as well as ongoing use of idarucizumab, should help establish when it is appropriate to re-dose with idarucizumab, coadminister with prothrombin complex concentrates, or re-initiate DOAC after idarucizumab use.

Here, we report an increased directional transport of several MDR 1 P-glycoprotein substrates, such as digoxin, paclitaxel, and vinblastine, through polarized monolayers of MDR 3 -transfected cells. Transport of other good MDR 1 P-glycoprotein substrates, including cyclosporin A and dexamethasone, was not detectably increased, MDR 3 P-glycoprotein-dependent transport of a short-chain phosphatidylcholine analog and drugs was inhibited by several MDR <b>reversal</b> <b>agents</b> and other drugs, indicating an interaction between these compounds and MDR 3 P-gp.
