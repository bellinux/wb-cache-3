5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later the <b>rebellion</b> of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is presumed that Earl Harald {{played a part in}} this. The <b>rebellion</b> was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the <b>rebellion</b> in Burgos {{scheduled}} for January 23 {{was a failure}} due to poor coordination with the besieging army; it started two days early and was easily crushed.

5|$|The Monmouth <b>Rebellion</b> and {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth <b>Rebellion.</b> The Monmouth <b>Rebellion</b> {{plays a key role in}} Peter S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly Quicksilver and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth <b>Rebellion</b> and its aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The Partisan Prohibitions were {{repealed}} {{during the}} Yellow Turban <b>Rebellion</b> and Five Pecks of Rice <b>Rebellion</b> in 184 AD, {{largely because the}} court did not want to continue to alienate {{a significant portion of the}} gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's <b>rebellion,</b> in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive <b>rebellion</b> across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.|$|E

25|$|According to Adalberto Aguirre, {{there were}} 1,161 slaves {{executed}} in the U.S. between the 1790s and 1850s.

50|$|In fall 616, while Emperor Yang was {{inquiring about}} the status of agrarian <b>rebellions</b> (by this point, most of Sui {{territory}} was in fact engulfed in agrarian <b>rebellions),</b> Yuwen, in order to placate him, informed him that the <b>rebellions</b> had largely been suppressed. Su, however, truthfully informed Emperor Yang that the <b>rebellions</b> were causing major problems for Sui rule. Emperor Yang, not happy about the news, soon considered putting Su to death, but eventually only reduced Su to commoner rank.|$|R

5|$|After King William I's death Thomas {{served his}} successor, WilliamII, {{and helped to}} put down a <b>rebellion</b> led by Thomas' old mentor Odo of Bayeux. Thomas also {{attended}} the trial for <b>rebellion</b> of the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, Thomas' sole suffragan, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more {{became involved in the}} dispute with Canterbury over the primacy when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King HenryI, and died soon after the coronation.|$|E
5|$|After serving {{for several}} years as the Master of the Ordnance, he was asked by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger to serve as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland {{as well as its}} Commander-in-Chief after the Irish <b>Rebellion</b> of 1798 broke out. While the <b>rebellion</b> was mostly put down before his arrival, he oversaw the mopping up of the {{remaining}} pockets of <b>rebellion</b> and successfully defeated a French invasion intended to foment further rebellious activity. He then worked to secure the passage by the Irish Parliament of the 1800 Act of Union, which joined the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He resigned his posts when the king refused to support Catholic emancipation, which he viewed as a key element for securing an enduring peace in Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inherently}} conservative {{nature of}} all three <b>rebellions,</b> but particularly those of 1549, is emphasised, as is their protagonists focus on local issues and avowed subservience to Edward VI (cries of [...] "God Save the King" [...] were heard among the Kett rebels in August 1549). The class antagonisms underlying the <b>rebellions</b> {{are considered to be}} exaggerated, and, in any case, what antagonisms existed merely weakened the <b>rebellions.</b> On a practical level, the <b>rebellions</b> were marred by chaos and blunder. They never, then, in any way directly challenged the state.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Rebellions</b> of 1837-1838 (Les <b>rébellions</b> de 1837) {{were two}} armed uprisings {{that took place}} in Lower and Upper Canada in 1837 and 1838. Both <b>rebellions</b> were {{motivated}} by frustrations with political reform. A key shared goal was responsible government, which was eventually achieved in the incidents' aftermath. The <b>rebellions</b> led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to The British North America Act, 1840 which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system and eventually led to the British North America Act, 1867 which created Canada and its government.|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had {{inherited}} England instead of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose. Thomas supported Rufus despite a <b>rebellion</b> led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to put down the revolt. Thomas attended the subsequent trial for <b>rebellion</b> in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the <b>rebellion,</b> most of the {{remaining}} insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands, towards Portuguese East Africa, from where they hoped to head north to German territory. Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje. Many other rebels were captured; 300 were imprisoned following the <b>rebellion</b> and 40 were executed. Around 30 rebels evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border.|$|E
5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as the Boxer <b>Rebellion</b> in China and the Sokehs <b>Rebellion</b> in the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke was involved in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
50|$|M3A3s {{were used}} by British forces in Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution, where they {{suffered}} heavy losses due to the Stuart's thin armour plating. They were used until 1946, when the British left. The M3A3s were then {{passed on to the}} KNIL, which used them {{until the end of the}} fighting before passing on the tanks to the Indonesian National Army. The tank saw action during the DI/TII <b>rebellions</b> in Aceh and Java, RMS <b>rebellions</b> in South Maluku, PRRI <b>rebellions</b> in Sumatra, Permesta <b>rebellions</b> in Northern Sulawesi and the fighting against the 30 September movement.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, {{because of}} this {{possible}} Kurdish threat {{as well as the}} alliance's dealings with Russia, Ottoman troops moved against this alliance. Two brief and minor <b>rebellions,</b> the <b>rebellions</b> of Barzan and Bitlis, were quickly suppressed.|$|R
5|$|Further <b>rebellions</b> {{occurred}} in 1287–88 and, more seriously, in 1294, {{under the leadership}} of Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. This last conflict demanded the King's own attention, but in both cases the <b>rebellions</b> were put down.|$|R
5|$|Although the <b>rebellion</b> did {{not itself}} achieve lasting success, it is {{commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The <b>rebellion</b> had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer <b>Rebellion</b> menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the <b>rebellion</b> ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi <b>Rebellion,</b> devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The <b>rebellion</b> diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
