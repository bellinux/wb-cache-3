40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} degree of matching for poor-performing fraud firms varies depending {{on the strength of}} the causal relation between expenses <b>and</b> <b>revenues.</b> A stronger causal relation exists between <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> operating expenses than between <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> total expenses that include non-operating expenses as well as operating expenses. Fraud firms have stronger incentives for managing earnings. Given that managing earnings is easier when using non-operating items than when using operating items, {{the degree of}} matching is (not) lower for fraud firms than for non-fraud firms at the strong (weak) level of the causal relation between <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> expenses. Empirical results suggest that the degrees of matching are different between fraud and non-fraud firms only at the strong level of the causal relation between <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> expenses. This result implies that the investigation of the matching model at a strong level of the causal relation between <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> expenses is more effective than that at a weak level of the causal relation, with regard to examining the degree of matching for fraud firms. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the importance of the level of the causal relation when examining the degree of matching...|$|R
