40|$|Improved {{method of}} winding carbon {{filaments}} for carbon/carbon composite structures less costly and labor-intensive, also produces more consistent results. Involves use of <b>roller</b> <b>squeegee</b> to ensure filaments continuously wet with resin during winding. Also involves control of spacing and resin contents of plies to obtain strong bonds between carbon filaments and carbon matrices. Lends itself to full automation and involves use of filaments and matrix-precursor resins in their simplest forms, thereby reducing costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the method}} of vector analysis, the {{mathematical}} model of <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> for twist drill groove was setup. At the same time, the parameter design and simulation software for the profile curve of drill groove <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was developed with Visual C++ Language. The simulation {{results showed that the}} mathematical model of <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was right, and the design accuracy and efficiency of the twist drill <b>squeegee</b> <b>roller</b> was improved greatly...|$|R

50|$|Silver stain is {{a common}} problem in roller {{transporter}} processors, since the material (usually paper) is pinched between <b>squeegee</b> <b>rollers</b> to remove excess developer and brought into the fixing bath without intermediate rinse or stop. Developers for such applications usually contain an antistaining agent, usually soluble organic thiols that form soluble but non-reactive silver compounds with free silver ions.|$|R
