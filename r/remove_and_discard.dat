50|$|In {{much of the}} {{temperate}} climate zone, most detached housing has had central heating installed since before the Second World War. Where coal was readily available (i.e. the Anthracite coal region in northeast Pennsylvania) coal-fired steam or hot water systems were common. In more recent times, these have been updated to use fuel oil or gas {{as the source of}} combustion, eliminating the need for a large coal storage bin near the boiler and the need to <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> ashes after the coal is burned. Coal-fired systems are now mostly reserved for larger buildings.|$|E
50|$|Honey is {{the complex}} {{substance}} made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees which are gathered, modified {{and stored in}} the comb by honey bees. Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose. It has antibacterial and anti fungal properties. Honey from the Western honey bee, along with the bee Tetragonisca angustula, has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, however it will crystallize over time. Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> crystallized honey from the hive.|$|E

50|$|Damping off can be {{prevented}} or controlled in several different ways. Sowing seeds in a sterilized growing medium can be effective, although fungal spores may still be introduced to the medium, either on the seeds themselves or after sowing (in water or on the wind). To reduce survival of the pathogens, <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> diseased plants, and sterilize containers to remove dust, planting medium, and soil particles in which spores can survive. Maintaining drier conditions with better air circulation helps {{prevent the spread of}} the disease, although it can also prevent or slow down germination. Spraying or drenching the soil with a recommended anti-fungal treatment (such as copper oxychloride) also helps suppress the disease. Homemade solutions (including ones made from chamomile tea or garlic) are used by some gardeners for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Modifications to the Sherman {{included}} the sealing {{of the lower}} hull, {{the addition of the}} propeller drive and the addition of Straussler's flotation screen around the hull, together with its inflation system. The base of the canvas flotation screen was attached to a horizontal mild steel boat-shaped platform welded to the tank's hull. The screen was supported by horizontal metal hoops and by 36 vertical rubber tubes. A system of compressed air bottles and pipes inflated the rubber tubes to give the curtain rigidity. The screen could be erected in 15 minutes and quickly collapsed once the tank reached the shore. In practice there was about 3 ft of freeboard. In combat, the flotation system was considered expendable and it was assumed the tank crew would <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> it as soon as conditions allowed. In practice, some units kept the flotation equipment and their tanks were used in several amphibious operations.|$|E
5000|$|A penalty {{paid for}} the {{efficiency}} of suspension preheaters is their tendency to block up. Salts, such as the sulfate and chloride of sodium and potassium, tend to evaporate in the burning zone of the kiln. They are carried back in vapor form, and re-condense when a sufficiently low temperature is encountered. Because these salts re-circulate back into the rawmix and re-enter the burning zone, a recirculation cycle establishes itself. A kiln with 0.1% chloride in the rawmix and clinker may have 5% chloride in the mid-kiln material. Condensation usually occurs in the preheater, and a sticky deposit of liquid salts glues dusty rawmix into a hard deposit, typically on surfaces against which the gas-flow is impacting. This can choke the preheater {{to the point that}} air-flow can no longer be maintained in the kiln. It then becomes necessary to manually break the build-up away. Modern installations often have automatic devices installed at vulnerable points to knock out build-up regularly. An alternative approach is to [...] "bleed off" [...] some of the kiln exhaust at the kiln inlet where the salts are still in the vapor phase, and <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> the solids in this. This is usually termed an [...] "alkali bleed" [...] and it breaks the recirculation cycle. It can also be of advantage for cement quality reasons, since it reduces the alkali content of the clinker. However, hot gas is run to waste so the process is inefficient and increases kiln fuel consumption.|$|E

40|$|Typically, {{an equal}} volume of TE-saturated phenol {{is added to}} an aqueous DNA sample in a {{microcentrifuge}} tube. The mixture is vigorously vortexed, and then centrifuged to enact phase separation. The upper, aqueous layer carefully is removed to a new tube, avoiding the phenol interface and then is subjected to two ether extractions to remove residual phenol. An equal volume of water-saturated ether {{is added to the}} tube, the mixture is vortexed, and the tube is centrifuged to allow phase separation. The upper, ether layer is removed and discarded, including phenol droplets at the interface. After this extraction is repeated, the DNA is concentrated by ethanol precipitation. ### Protocol 1. Add an equal volume of TE-saturated phenol to the DNA sample contained in a 1. 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and vortex for 15 - 30 seconds. - Centrifuge the sample for 5 minutes at room temperature to separate the phases. - Remove about 90 % of the upper, aqueous layer to a clean tube, carefully avoiding proteins at the aqueous:phenol interface. At this stage the aqueous phase can be extracted a second time with an equal volume of 1 : 1 TE-saturated phenol:chloroform, centrifuged and removed to a clean tube as above but this additional extraction usually is not necessary if care is taken during the first phenol extraction. - Add an equal volume of water-saturated ether, vortex briefly, and centrifuge for 3 minutes at room temperature. <b>Remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> the upper, ether layer, taking care to remove phenol droplets at the ether:aqueous interface. Repeat the ether extraction. - Ethanol precipitate the DNA by adding 2. 5 - 3 volumes of ethanol-acetate, as discussed below...|$|E

Pig's or sheep's stomach is sometimes used for nyanya, a dish similar to haggis. Head and collagen-rich extremities are used to make kholodets—a version of aspic, whereby these body parts are slowly boiled for several hours with meat <b>and</b> spices, <b>removed</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded,</b> <b>and</b> the remaining broth is cooled until it congeals.|$|R
40|$|Fermented or brined products, such as dill cucumbers, {{cure for}} several weeks. Curing changes the color, flavor, {{and texture of}} the product. Lactic acid {{produced}} during fermentation helps preserve the product. Satisfactory products can be obtained only when quality ingredients are used and proper procedures followed. Correct proportions of vegetables, salt, vinegar, and spices are essential. Ingredients Cucumbers—Select fresh, firm unwaxed cucumbers about 4 inches long. Cucumbers deteriorate rapidly, especially at room temperature. For best results, use varieties developed for pickling. Be sure to <b>remove</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard</b> a 1 / 16 inch slice from the blossom end of fresh cucumbers. Blossoms may contain an enzyme that causes excessive softening of pickles. Salt—Use non-iodized canning or pickling salt; iodine can prevent the bacterial fermentation and may darken pickles. Other salts contain anti-caking materials that can make the brine cloudy. Canning or pickling salt {{can be purchased at}} most supermarkets. Changing salt proportions or using a reduced-sodium salt substitute in fermented products is not recommended because the product will not ferment correctly. Spices—Use fresh, whole spices for best flavor in pickles. Firming Agents—According to the National Center for Food Preservation, “Alum may be safely used to firm fermented pickles. However, it is unnecessary and is not included in the recipes in this publication. Alum does not improve the firmness of quick-process pickles. The calcium in lime definitely improves pickle firmness. Food-grade lime may be used as a limewater solution for soaking fresh cucumbers 12 to 24 hours before pickling them. Excess lime absorbed by the cucumbers must be removed to make safe pickles. To remove excess lime, drain the lime-water solution, rinse, and then resoak the cucumbers in fresh water for 1 hour. Repeat the rinsing and soaking steps two more times. To further improve pickle firmness, you may process cucumber pickles for 30 minutes in water at 180 °F. This process also prevents spoilage, but the water temperature should not fall below 180 °F. Use a candy or jelly thermometer to check the water temperature. ” Equipment The fermentation equipment must be washed in hot soapy water and rinsed well with very hot water before use...|$|E
