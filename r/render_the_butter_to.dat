50|$|The {{process through}} which the artists work varies {{according}} to the sculptor, but often follows the same general steps. Most start with choosing {{one of the six}} dairy cattle breeds (Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, and Milking Shorthorn) to recreate. Usually, they produce drawings of the cattle or take several photographs from which to work. As the sculpting actually begins, it is important for <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> be of <b>the</b> right consistency, which has been described as feeling like cold cream. In total, about 500-600 pounds of butter is used. Over the years, sculptors moved from working in chilled rooms to large refrigerated display cases with temperatures between 35 and 40oF. <b>The</b> <b>butter</b> is placed on a wooden-and-wire armature, at first in large amounts to achieve the general shape of the cow, and later in smaller quantities to fine-tune <b>the</b> form. <b>The</b> <b>butter</b> is added layer upon layer until the cow is in its finished form, taking between two days and a week, depending on the artist. Though the sculptors claim it was never a secret that the Buttercow is built on a wooden armature, many people assumed the sculpture was solid, and made entirely from <b>butter,</b> despite <b>the</b> logistical impossibilities.|$|R

Results of the score were summarized and on the base of the total assessment were determinated quality of the product. The carried out researches of samples of melted <b>butter</b> have shown <b>the</b> full conformance with requirements of GOST R 52971 on physicochemical parameters: the weight fraction of fat – 99 %, the weight fraction of moisture – 1 %. It was established that in the samples without food additive maximum values of acid number were received in a month of storage; and in the samples with additive - in 3 months of storage. It was determinated that in samples of butter rented without salting peroxide number increases more intensively than in other test samples. It has been determined increased storage stability of melted butter with salt and food additive...|$|R

50|$|Forms {{of peanut}} butter were already popular before Rosefield's innovation. The {{problem was that the}} oil {{separated}} from the peanut grit and did not keep.

This also made it possible <b>to</b> churn <b>the</b> peanut <b>butter</b> <b>to</b> a creamy consistency. His company promised a one-year shelf life for the product and claimed that it tasted better and was less sticky than previous formulas.|$|R

60|$|<b>Butter,</b> <b>to</b> preserve.--Boil it {{in a large}} vessel {{till the}} scum rises. Skim this off {{as fast as it}} appears on the surface, until <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> remains quite clear, like oil.

Butter is churned, in many countries, by twirling a forked stick, held between the two hands, in a vessel full of cream; or even by shaking the cream in a bottle. It is said that the temperature of the milk, while it is being churned, should be between 50 degrees and 60 degrees Fahr., and that this is all-important to success.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of diacetyl {{from the standpoint}} of the desirable aroma of butter has been shown by various investigators. van Niel, Kluyver and Derx (6) found from 0. 0002 to 0. 0004 percent diacetyl in fine butter, and when these concentrations of diacetyl were added <b>to</b> <b>butter</b> neutral in odor an unmistakable aroma appeared. The important conclusion of these investigators was that diacetyl is either responsible for <b>the</b> aroma of <b>butter</b> or is <b>the</b> principal component of the aroma material. Schmalfuss and Barthmeyer (4) found diacetyl to be an aroma constituent of various materials, including <b>butter.</b> <b>The</b> diacetyl was considered to come from acetylmethylcarbinol. Margarine to which diacetyl had been added took on <b>the</b> aroma of <b>butter.</b> Four samples of butter, representing different conditions of feeding the producing animals, yielded from 0. 0001 to 0. 0006 grams of nickel salt (equivalent to diacetyl) per kilogram, and the quantity of diacetyl in <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> appeared <b>to</b> be correlated with the intensity of the aroma...|$|R

5000|$|Humorous {{observations}} {{have been}} made about buttered toast. It has been noted that buttered toast has a perceived tendency, when dropped, <b>to</b> land with <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> side <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor, the least desirable outcome. Although the concept of [...] "dropped buttered toast" [...] was originally a pessimistic joke, a 2001 study of <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> toast phenomenon found that when dropped from a table, a buttered slice of toast landed butter-side down at least 62% of the time. The phenomenon is widely believed to be attributable to {{the combination of the}} size of the toast and the height of the typical dining table, which means that the toast will not rotate far enough to right itself before encountering the floor. A joke that plays on this tendency is <b>the</b> <b>buttered</b> cat paradox; if cats always land on their feet and buttered toast always lands buttered side down, it questions what happens when buttered toast is attached to a cat's back.|$|R
