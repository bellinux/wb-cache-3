50|$|In a <b>residential</b> <b>lease</b> for consideration, {{a tenant}} {{may not be}} removed except for cause, {{even in the absence}} of a written lease. If a {{landlord}} can terminate the tenancy at will, a tenant by operation of law is also granted a reciprocal right to terminate at will. However, a lease that expressly continues at the will of the tenant ("for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") does not automatically provide the landlord with a reciprocal right to terminate, even for cause. Rather, such language may be construed to convey to the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to commercial real estate, <b>residential</b> <b>lease</b> contracts are highly codified by the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (abbr. BGB, [...] "German civil code"). One {{of the central}} ideas there regarding real estate, is the Ortsübliche Vergleichsmiete (local customary comparable rent). New leases must not be more than 20 percent (not exactly stated by BGB, depending on the jurisdiction) higher than the local customary comparable rent, or the rental contracts may be nullified. Within existing lease contracts, rent increases (i) must not exceed the local customary comparable rent, (ii) are only allowed for if the rent has not increased for the past 15 months, and (iii) must not exceed a total increase of 20 percent within three years. To conclude, {{the determination of the}} sustainable rent for residential assets should be made on conservative premises and in close correlation with the current rents. Experience shows that foreign investors have in the past tended to underestimate the effects of such legislation.|$|E

50|$|The {{comparative}} {{rarity of}} long <b>residential</b> <b>leases</b> in Scotland was made rarer by the Long Leases (Scotland) Act 1954.

As the notice had to be served within five years of the Act of 1954coming into force (i.e. before 1 September 1959) this provision is now spent.

40|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>lease</b> The thesis {{examines}} <b>residential</b> <b>lease.</b> For {{the reason}} of limited length the paper does {{not deal with}} the topic in general but focuses primarily on the aspects of <b>residential</b> <b>lease</b> termination. This particular topic was chosen {{because of the fact}} that it is one of the significant legal relations occurring among the subjects of law, many people fulfil their accommodation requirements through it and almost everyone gets in touch with it in his/her life, in a way. Taking into consideration the social implications of rental housing the topic goes beyond the legal area. It is politically sensitive and it involves frequent disputes between the parties that are on the opposite sides of the political spectrum, mainly because of the different levels of regulation. The goal of the thesis is to explore and evaluate the effective legal regulation in the light of practice of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic. Moreover, the thesis tries to be proactive and predict possible questionable aspects and it aims to provide the readers with practical advice and recommendations at the same time. From the structural point of view the thesis is divided into chapters, each of them dealing with different features. Firstly, chapter one briefly describes what the <b>residential</b> <b>lease</b> is, furthermore, it explains its [...] ...|$|E

To understand the origin of present legal regulation of tenement relations, it is important to analyze it in a historical context. First part of the thesis therefore concentrates on the evolution of civil lease regulation, beginning from Roman law, which has put the basis of modern continental civil law, to our history shortly after the revolutionary year 1989.

40|$|LEGAL CAUSES OF USE OF A FLAT - summary The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse legal causes {{of use of}} a flat. My aim is to form summary of legal causes of use of a flat thereby accent their multiplicity. Because this theme is very extensive, I {{attended}} mainly to origin of particular causes. For coherence of my thesis I also describe rights and duties, which result from particular legal relationships and manners of their dissolution. The thesis is composed of 10 chapters (of course except Chapter One - introduction), each of them attends to one of legal cause of use of a flat. Chapter Two gives us a definition of a flat. This term is not explained in our Civil Code, {{so we have to}} search for this definition in established practice of courts. Chapter Three describes one of the main cause of use of a flat - lease. There are many ways, how that legal relationship could grow up. The best known is contract of lease. Then we can enter into an agreement with lessor and current lessee, get a lease because of passage of the lease of flat in consequence of death of lessee or his permanent desertion from household. In this chapter I describe common <b>residential</b> <b>lease,</b> common <b>residential</b> <b>lease</b> of spouses, rights and duties resulting from a lease and its dissolution.

Methods of research/ Approach: The case study is “Residencial Porto”, built by <b>Residential</b> <b>Leasing</b> Program in 2004, which has blocks built in the limit of the plot creating potential insecurity situations for 12 flats on the ground floor. Through the fieldwork, where methods and techniques of Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) were applied, it is analysed data regarding residents´ perceptions of safety and solutions to increase safety.
