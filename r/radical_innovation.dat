The Codex Gregorianus includes rescripts up to 292, which the Codex Hermogenianus updated with a comprehensive collection of rescripts issued by Diocletian in 293 and 294. Although {{the very act of}} codification was a <b>radical</b> <b>innovation,</b> given the precedent-based design of the Roman legal system, the jurists were generally conservative, and constantly looked to past Roman practice and theory for guidance. They were probably given more free rein over their codes than the later compilers of the Codex Theodosianus (438) and Codex Justinianus (529) would have. Gregorius and Hermogenianus' codices lack the rigid structuring of later codes, and were not published {{in the name of the}} emperor, but in the names of their compilers. Their official character, however, was clear in that both collections were subsequently acknowledged by courts as authoritative records of imperial legislation up to the date of their publication and regularly updated.|$|E

Although both academics and market research practitioners would generally accept this statement, alignment {{with the needs of}} the customer often results in conservative innovation strategies. Due to their focus on what is currently on offer in the marketplace, customers primarily demand so-called incremental innovations. Companies however, want to develop entry points for <b>radical</b> <b>innovations.</b> The identification of <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> is a difficult task whose implementation is often associated with significant risk. It is questionable if market research can alone allow innovation management to develop attractive search fields for <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> and if it can also contribute to the reduction of the risk that such innovations inherently possess. Closer observation shows that the market research methods used today for the discovery of <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> in the form of new market/technology combinations possess only limited suitability. Empirical tests verify that success-fully innovative companies often don't use such methods, rather they involve specifically qualified, innovative knowledge carriers early-on in the process such as Lead Users or external experts with relevant knowledge from analogous markets in the search for innovations. When searching for applications for <b>radical</b> <b>innovations,</b> market researchers should initially concentrate on the question of who they address as the information source. How successful the process of involving experts is and how well supported through the methodology it is, depends heavily on the specific factors and conditions related to the pro-ject planning.

We find that <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> are the only significant contributors to TFP growth so that innovation height matters. We also find evidence that TFP growth is better represented by an upward shift of the production function than by a continuous innovation measure.

From the existing literature, we build a model {{in order to examine}} empirically <b>radical</b> <b>innovations.</b> This will be by measuring the dependent variable “radicalness ” through an index based on four dimensions which capture different levels of risk encountered by firms while developing new products or manufacturing processes. The determinants of <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> are identified using recent data collected on 639 manufacturing firms of diverse industries in three regions in the North of Montréal. Multivariate regression is used to model both the decision to innovate or not, and the decision regarding the degree of radicalness of the innovation to undertake. Determinants of these two decisions were mainly derived from the literature on learning. Control variables such as age of firms, size and sectors were also included in the regression models. The results indicate that various types of learning matters regarding both the decision of whether to innovate or not, and the decision about the degree of radicalness of the innovation to undertake. Overall, the results show that variables related to learning by doing, learning by training and learning by interacting have the highest impact on <b>radical</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R

[...] The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text.

Despite his youth at the time, the charismatic Hays was a rallying figure to his men and is often considered responsible for giving cohesion, discipline and a group mentality to the Rangers. Flacco, a chief of the allied Indian tribe of the Lipan, used to call Hays Bravo too much.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{provides}} empirical {{evidence for the}} relationship between the market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and collaboration of external actors in the processes of incremental and <b>radical</b> <b>innovations</b> in rural enterprises. The research tested two sets of assumptions: first, the relation between contributions of strategic orientation and innovation processes; and second, collaborations of external stakeholders in the implementation of innovation processes. Data were collected from 208 rural enterprises and analyzed with the use of techniques of partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results showed that the market orientation contributes to the development of incremental innovation, and that the entrepreneurial orientation contributes to the implementation of the incremental and <b>radical</b> <b>innovations.</b> Specific agents (buyers, suppliers of goods and services, consultants, and others producers), collaborate positively in implementing incremental innovation; however, generic agents do not.
