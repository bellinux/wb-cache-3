40|$|There is {{consensus}} among researchers regarding how managing and designing in complexity multidimensionality represents {{some of the}} mains challenges and constants of contemporaries’ processes of innovation (Manzini, Baule, Bertola, 2004). This systemic distinguishing peculiarity makes impossible to standardize the design innovation processes because every problem needs to be solved by adopting different strategies (Celaschi, Deserti, 2007). Nevertheless, those innovative processes can be developed and managed by referring us to tools and practices of design into the paradigms of multidisciplinary and multidimensional. However, what happens when professors have to transmit those concepts to young students of design faculties? We have to consider that normally those students are coming from second-degree schools, which programs usually still insist on content rigidly divided in disciplines and don´t consider how the contemporary relation between space and time has overturned for them (Morin, 2001). Young students generally disclaim their past in the meaning of heritage, values and techniques knowledge; {{they live in the}} present, a time that does not exist; a time that today results enormously expanded by globalization processes. They are still living in a reality of which territorial capital subsystems are characterized by an entropic strong dichotomy of entities in opposition but, on the other hand, in balance within themselves, as for example topics as material/immaterial, collective/identity, culture/industry, etc. So, which are the design didactic challenges to provide horizontal skills for allowing young students to understand complexity and manage knowledge of the reality? This article will discuss the case study of the perception among design of a newly generation admitted at the Innovation and Design Engineering Degree of the Universidad Panamericana – Guadalajara Campus. As expected, in this new generation we can especially observe a resistance to consider the sociocultural, business, technological and territorial dimensions as systems that strategically characterized and affected plural aspects of the design innovation processes. The contribute then proceed in analyzing case studies of didactic activities for creating skills and sensibility able to develop this capability to observe, select and manage the intangible in order to optimize the design of the tangible in the young generations. The investigation, through the experimentation and comparison of informal didactic model, bring to the identification and promotion of special extra-ordinary didactics experiences oriented to the complex project and able to <b>resalt</b> the designer mediation role among the innate and dualistic tension between polarities able to <b>resalt</b> the intangible aspects which characterized contemporary design processes...|$|R

The fandamental concept of the MEI embraces tandard thermodynamic theory, that of matter (natrients) trans-ported by energy within an open system. Fish yield is a biotic oatpat of the system. Constraints {{on the level of}} fish yield are determined by lake-basin morphometry and natrient and energy availability. Of the three morphometric factors considered, mean depth, volame, and area, mean depth appears to be the variable most closely linked with prodaction processes. The major direct effect on production by area is that expressed by the elementary mathematics of both size and of scale, particularly perimeter-to-area nd area-to-volume ratios which change mark-edly in lakes of different total surface areas. Volumetric effects contain elements similar to those of both area and mean depth. A rational approach to fish-yield estimation may be made at three hierarchic levels: (1) a global evel at which area and temperature assume major importance; (2) a regional level at which nutrients and mean depth become the critical variables as area and temperature are held constant; (3) an infra-regional level at which either a nutrient or a depth variable alone may be used for fish-yield estimates while the remaining variable is constant.

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to define the}} incidence of enlarged bronchial arteries after early surgical repair of transposition of the great arteries by the arterial switch operation, and to report the results of catheter-directed therapy in five patients. Background. Pathologic and angiographic studies have demonstrated enlarged bronchial arteries in patients with transposition of the great arteries. Methods. A subjective 4 -point scale was used to grade postoperative angiograms performed in 119 patients at our institution between January 1983 and December 1991. Grades 0 and 1 were designated {{if there was no}} opacification of the pulmonary arteries or veins, whereas grades 2 and 3 were assigned if there was such opacification. The median age at repair was 8 days (range 1 day to 13 months) and the median age at catheterizatian was 11. 2 months (range 3. 6 to 58. 5). An intact vernicular septum was present in 84 (71 %) of 119 patients. <b>Resalts.</b> Significantly increased broachial flow (grade 2 or 3) was present in 55 (46 %) of 119 patients. Age at repair, age at catheterization and interval between repair and catheterization were not associated with significantly increased bronchial flow; however, an intact ventricular septum was weakly associated with increased flow (p = 0. 04). Coil emholization was performed in live patients with complete occlusion of the vessels and no significant complications. Conclusions. Abnormally enlarged bronchial arteries are frequently identified at postoperative catheterization despite early repair and may explain continuous murmurs or persistent cardiomegaly in patients with otherwise normal noninvasive findings. When clinically indicated, catheter-directed therapy can be performed with good results...|$|R

The amount of the nitrogenous compounds dissolved out into the lime-water from the shark-skin in the liming, increased in parallel with the time of liming, with no relation with the volume of lime-water. The amount of ammonia-N and amide-N dissolved out from the shark-skin was about two {{times as much as}} that from the cattle hide. The contents of amide-N and diamino-N in the limed shark-skin were less than those of raw skin, while the contents of mono amino-Nshowed increasing tendency. ""The detection of almost every kind of amino acid was possible in the lime-water used for liming. In general, the amino acids in the shark-skin dissolved out faster than those in the cattle-hide. Glycine, aspartic acid and alanine were apt to become free from the skin. The release existence of proline and hydroxyproline suggesting the decomposition of collagen was obserbed revealed in case of the shark-skin on the 7 th and 10 th day in the liming, while in case of the cattle-hide it was marked on the 17 th day weakly. The contents of hydroxyproline and arginine in the shark-skin decreased and those in the lime-water increased gradually, after the 7 th day. Accordingly, it was clarified that the liming of shark-skin should be kept in the peried from 7 to 10 days at about 23 °C. Before the occurrence of rapid decrease in the contents of hydroxyproline in the limed skin collagen, no change the hydrothermal shrinking temperature (Ts) could be observed. Ts. of limed skin and that of delimed skin were observed to be not so high as that of raw skin, but Ts. of leather was always considerably higher than that of raw skin. From the above mentioned <b>resalts</b> it was presumed that the liming process should haveconsiderable effects on the skin, namely, the removal of unavilable protein; the swell and exposure of collagen; the increase of reactivity of skin to tan agent and the elevation of Ts. of leather.

As a <b>resalt,</b> the cyanuric chloride derivatives was {{proved to be a}} polymeric surfactant. First, this study was investigated with respect to the selectivity of cyanuric chloride with Jeffamine® M- 2070. By varying the molar ratios of M- 2070 and temperature, the suitable reaction conditions of the three avtive sites in cyanuric chloride was found (0 oC、 25 oC、 130 oC). The structures were determined by GPC. Furthermore, a family of block copolymers with different molecular weights and stuctures were prepared by using the selective reactions of cyanuric chloride and polyetheramines. Their fundamental surfactancy has been discussed. These polymeric surfactants lowered the surface tension of water and interfacial tension of water/toluene (or water/n-hexane) to 29 ~ 35 dyne/cm and 2. 1 dyne/cm, respectively. Some adducts exhibited cloud points similar to the nonionic surfactants. The higher cloud point temperatures were observed for the higher HLB values. 摘 要 聚醚胺(polyoxyalkyleneamine) 和氯化三聚氰酸(cyanuric chloride) 進行親核取代反應，利用cyanuric chloride (cc) 三取代基之反應選擇特性，以控制溫度方式合成一系列之cc衍生物，並鑑定其結構及分析產物的基本性質。此類型之結構中藉著分子中聚乙醚鏈段(polyoxyethylene segment) 與水形成氫鍵及聚丙醚鏈段(polyoxypropylene segment) 之親油性質，使其具有界面活性，成為高分子量的界面活性劑。 本論文先以聚醚胺M- 2070 (monoamine) 及cc進行一連串之反應選擇性探討。藉由不同之M- 2070 之莫爾數及反應溫度，以GPC觀察生成物之分子量變化，找出cc所具有三個反應位置之適當反應條件。結果分別為 0 ℃、 25 ℃、 130 ℃。 在以此條件為基礎下，分別合成了一系列具有聚醚基(polyoxyalkylene) ，而不同分子量分佈之高分子。其中包含以cc/D- 2000 及cc/ED- 2001 之共聚高分子。此分子中仍留有一級胺官能基可再與cc第三個反應基成為一反應型高分子。除此之外，亦合成一系列具有聚醚鏈段不同結構之高分子，具有明顯之界面性質，表面之性質，最低可將水的表面張力降低至 29 dyne/cm；另外，在 10 ppm濃度下，可導致水與甲苯界面張力最低降至 2. 1 dyne/cm (其原始界面張力為 32 dyne/cm) 。而且此型化合物具非離子型界面劑的特點，當親油基與親水基在不同比例時會有不同之濁點溫度(cloud point) ，其溫度與產物之HLB值有正比之趨勢。主 文 目 錄 一、前 言…………………………………………………… [...] ……… [...] … 1 1 - 1. 界面活性劑(surfactant) ………………………… [...] ………… [...] … 1 1 - 2. 微胞……………………………… [...] ……………. ……………. … 7 1 - 3. 表面張力……………. ………………………………. …… [...] …… 9 二、文獻回顧…………………………………………………………… 10 2 - 1. 聚醚胺之相關應用與文獻報導……………………………… 10 2 - 2. 氯化三聚氰酸(cyanuric chloride) 之相關文獻報導……. ……. 12 三、研究目的…………………………………………………………… 15 四、實驗方法…………………………………………………………… 16 4 - 1. 實驗材料與藥品……………………………………………… [...] 16 4 - 1 -(1). 聚醚胺類……………………………………………… [...] … 16 4 - 1 -(2). 氯化三聚氰酸(cyanuric chloride) ……………………… [...] . 18 4 - 1 -(3). 其他藥品…………………………………………… [...] …… 18 4 - 2. 實驗設備與儀器………………………………………… [...] …… 20 4 - 3. 實驗步驟…………………………………………………. ……. 22 4 - 3 -(1). cyanuric chloride與聚醚胺M- 2070 之親核取代反應… 22 4 - 3 -(2). cyanuric chloride與聚醚胺D- 2000 之縮合聚合反應…. 23 4 - 3 -(3). cyanuric chloride與聚醚胺ED- 2001 之縮合聚合反應… 23 4 - 3 -(4). 高分子型界面活性劑之合成…………………………… 23 A.

40|$|What {{the present}} paper deals with, of chiefly the researching-results {{concerning}} the properties of shark-skin put under the tanning process. I. Effect of liming on the fish-skin. The amount of the nitrogenous compounds dissolved out into the lime-water from the shark-skin in the liming, increased in parallel with the time of liming, with no relation with the volume of lime-water. The amount of ammonia-N and amide-N dissolved out from the shark-skin was about two {{times as much as}} that from the cattle hide. The contents of amide-N and diamino-N in the limed shark-skin were less than those of raw skin, while the contents of mono amino-N showed increasing tendency. The detection of almost every kind of amino acid was possible in the lime-water used for liming. In general, the amino acids in the shark-skin dissolved out faster than those in the cattle-hide. Glycine, aspartic acid and alanine were apt to become free from the skin. The release existence of proline and hydroxyproline suggesting the decomposition of collagen was obserbed revealed in case of the shark-skin on the 7 th and 10 th day in the liming, while in case of the cattle-hide it was marked on the 17 th day weakly. The contents of hydroxyproline and arginine in the shark-skin decreased and those in the lime-water increased gradually, after the 7 th day. Accordingly, it was clarified that the liming of shark-skin should be kept in the peried from 7 to 10 days at about 23 °C. Before the occurrence of rapid decrease in the contents of hydroxyproline in the limed skin collagen, no change the hydrothermal shrinking temperature (Ts) could be observed. Ts. of limed skin and that of delimed skin were observed to be not so high as that of raw skin, but Ts. of leather was always considerably higher than that of raw skin. From the above mentioned <b>resalts</b> it was presumed that the liming process should haveconsiderable effects on the skin, namely, the removal of unavilable protein; the swell and exposure of collagen; the increase of reactivity of skin to tan agent and the elevation of Ts. of leather. In addition, it was confirmed that the day sneeded for the liming of shark-skin were far shorter than those for cattle hide. II. Changes of lipid in fish-skin. The changes in the contents of lipid in the skin under the tanning process, especially the pickling process, were studied, mainly, with blue-fin-tuna-skin having much lipid. Lipid contents in the skin under the liming process decreased in parallel with the time of liming. Only about 15 % of lipid in tuna-skin was removed by liming, though, about another 40 % of lipid was exuded by beaming, additionally. Moreover, a part of residual lipid was to be eliminated by the dehydro-shrinking in the pickling process. The contents of the phospholipid in the skin decreased during the pickling. Clear Schiff's reaction was seen in the waste-liquor of pickling. The more decreased were the lipid contents in the pickled skin, the higher the contents of volatile compounds in the skin. The acidic tanning effect of pickling may be attributed to the tanning activity of these carbonyl-compounds, Chrome tanning, accompanied by pickling, was assumed to be an excllent method for the tanning of fish-skin containing much lipid. III. Condition of chrome tanning. It was ascertained that the skin was almost nearly stable in the process of deliming and peckling. The pH value and the percentage of sodium-thiosulfate to chrome-alum in the best chrome-tanning-liquor were about 3. 0 and 60 % respectively. There was no proportional relationship between the amount of chrome combined with the leather and Ts. of the leather. The combined chrome and Ts. of the leather prepared by the double tanning with K-alum, was (found to be) far more increased than of the leather prepard through the sulfuric acid pickling, though inferior physical properties were ascertained in such leather. The amount of chrome combined with the skin was in proportion to the concentration of chrome liquor, and that in diluted chrome-liquor was larger than in case of the undiluted one. When the combined chrome was over 2 % per the leather weight, the tention of the leather decreased gradually. IV. Reactivity of skin-protein to chrome ion in chrome tanning. In order to make clear the relation of carboxyl group of skin-protein and its reactivity fowards chrome ion, the influence of esterification of limed skin upon the amount of the combined chrome, sulfuric acid and Ts. of the leather was investigated. Every value of the leather subjected to esterification was considerably lower than that of the one subjected to no esterification, the value being almost constant from the first, having no relation with the liming period. The reactivity of carboxyl group of skin-protein towards chrome ion was clearly ascertained by these results. Furthermore, it was concluded that the liming treatment played a important role for the binding of skin with chrome...|$|R
