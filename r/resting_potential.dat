25|$|Julius Bernstein {{was also}} the first to {{introduce}} the Nernst equation for <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> across the membrane; this was generalized by David E. Goldman to the eponymous Goldman equation in 1943. The sodium–potassium pump was identified in 1957 and its properties gradually elucidated, culminating in the determination of its atomic-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved, giving a broader view of how these molecular machines work.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{intravenous}} dose is 10–20 mEq {{per hour and}} it is given slowly since it takes time for the electrolyte to equilibrate into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle. Elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia, causes the resting electrical potential of the heart muscle cells to be lower than normal (less negative). Without this negative <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> cardiac cells cannot repolarize (prepare for their next contraction).|$|E
40|$|The photon rupture method, {{by which}} oxide film and metal are removed by focused pulsed Nd–YAG laser beam irradiation, {{was applied to}} form {{artificial}} micro-pits in Zn– 5 mass% Al alloy-coated steel. The zinc alloy-coated layer was removed by pulsed laser irradiation treatment for about one second in a neutral buffer solution with NaCl. The <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> transient with the laser treatment was measured. In the early stage of the laser treatment the <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> of zinc alloy-coated steel changed to the negative direction immediately after every irradiation of a laser pulse {{and then returned to}} the previous value. However, after the steel substrate was exposed to the solution, the <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> moved to the positive direction immediately after every irradiation of a laser pulse and then returned to the previous value. The amplitude and duration of the potential change after the laser irradiation increased with repetition of laser irradiation, related to the pit depth and the exposed area ratio of coated layer/steel substrate. The <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> fluctuation difference can be explained by galvanic reaction change in the artificial pit formed by laser irradiation on the Zn alloy-coated steel...|$|R

25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, {{which in turn}} increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
25|$|Before {{an action}} {{potential}} occurs, the axonal membrane {{is at its}} normal <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> and Na+ channels are in their deactivated state, blocked on the extracellular side by their activation gates. In response to an electric current (in this case, an action potential), the activation gates open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the neuron through the channels, and causing the voltage across the neuronal membrane to increase. Because the voltage across the membrane is initially negative, as its voltage increases to and past zero, {{it is said to}} depolarize. This increase in voltage constitutes the rising phase of an action potential.|$|E
25|$|The strength-duration time {{constant}} of both cutaneous and motor afferents decreases with age, and this corresponds {{to an increase}} in rheobase. Two possible reasons for this age-related decrease in the strength-duration {{time constant}} have been proposed. First, nerve geometry might change with age because of axonal loss and neural fibrosis. Secondly, the persistent Na+ conductance might decrease maturation. Significant decreases in threshold for sensory and motor fibers have been observed during ischemia. These decreases in threshold were furthermore associated with significant increases in the strength-duration time constant, appreciably indicating a significant decrease in rheobase current. These changes are thought {{to be the result of}} non-inactivating, voltage-dependent Na+ channels, which are active at <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|E

In the absence of anodic polarization, a <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> of 870 _ 10 mv is obtained which is a mixed potential, nd this system is referred to as a Pd/PdO electrode. After anodic polarization but in the absence of peroxide, a rest po-tential of 1470 _+ 10 mv is obtained which is an equil ibrium metal-metal oxide potential, and this system is referred to as a Pd/PdO 2 electrode. With time, a Pd/PdO 2 electrode is transformed to a Pd/PdO electrode because PdO 2 is unstable in acid solutions. In a certain potential region, Pd dissolves in acid solutions to form Pd + + ions which greatly influence the <b>rest</b> <b>potential.</b> Evi-dence is presented which indicates that, of all the noble metals, possibly Pd is the only one for which the evolution of oxygen under anodic polarization proceeds through an oxide mechanism.

25|$|The {{course of}} the action {{potential}} {{can be divided into}} five parts: the rising phase, the peak phase, the falling phase, the undershoot phase, and the refractory period. During the rising phase the membrane potential depolarizes (becomes more positive). The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase. At this stage, the membrane potential reaches a maximum. Subsequent to this, there is a falling phase. During this stage the membrane potential becomes more negative, returning towards <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b> The undershoot, or afterhyperpolarization, phase is the period during which the membrane potential temporarily becomes more negatively charged than when at rest (hyperpolarized). Finally, the time during which a subsequent action potential is impossible or difficult to fire is called the refractory period, which may overlap with the other phases.|$|E
25|$|As the {{membrane}} potential is increased, sodium ion channels open, allowing {{the entry of}} sodium ions into the cell. This {{is followed by the}} opening of potassium ion channels that permit the exit of potassium ions from the cell. The inward flow of sodium ions increases the concentration of positively charged cations in the cell and causes depolarization, where the potential of the cell is higher than the cell's <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b> The sodium channels close {{at the peak of the}} action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell. The efflux of potassium ions decreases {{the membrane}} potential or hyperpolarizes the cell. For small voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70mV. However, if the voltage increases past a critical threshold, typically 15mV higher than the resting value, the sodium current dominates. This results in a runaway condition whereby the positive feedback from the sodium current activates even more sodium channels. Thus, the cell fires, producing an action potential. The frequency at which cellular action potentials are produced is known as its firing rate.|$|E
25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial demyelination (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of conduction velocity and amplitudes of compound motor (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength duration time constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the recovery cycle after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E

40|$|These {{experimental}} {{results are not}} consistent with the mechanism advanced by Bockris and Oldfield (6) to account for the pH dependence of the <b>rest</b> <b>potential.</b> These authors suggested that the <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> is de-termined by the activity of adsorbed OH radicals and that at even small H 202 concentrations, the surface is saturated with OH radicals. This mechanism implies a zero order of reaction with respect to H 202 which is contrary to observation. Bianchi and collaborators (7) proposed that per-oxide decomposes by a chemical, rather than electro-chemical, process. According to these authors, per-oxide decomposition takes place on cathodic polariza-tion by reaction with atomic hydrogen adsorbed on the electrode surface, i. e. ...|$|R
500|$|GABA {{controls}} the excitability of neurons by binding to the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor is a protein complex {{located in the}} synapses of neurons. All GABAA receptors contain an ion channel that conducts chloride ions across neuronal cell membranes and two binding sites for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABAA receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA. Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding, benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor. [...] This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.|$|E
2500|$|High {{frequency}} stimulation {{leads to}} an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium and calcium ions due to the repeated opening of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels in the axon and terminal. [...] As the frequency of stimuli increases, there is less time between each stimulus for the cell to repolarize and return to normal <b>resting</b> <b>potential.</b> [...] Therefore, the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> becomes more depolarized, meaning a smaller depolarizing current is needed to fire an action potential.|$|E
2500|$|However, this {{modulation}} {{is usually}} very short lived. [...] If the stimulation ceases, the neuron will revert {{to its original}} <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> as the ion channels and pumps have ample time {{to recover from the}} last stimulus.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{develops}} {{a model for}} a single cell electroporated by an external electric field and uses it to investigate the effects of shock strength and <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> on the transmembrane potential Vm and pore density N around the cell. As compared to the induced potential predicted by resistive-capacitive theory, the model of electroporation predicts a smaller magnitude of Vm throughout the cell. Both Vm and N are symmetric about the equator with the same value at both poles of the cell. Larger shocks do not increase the maximum magnitude of Vm because more pores form to shunt the excess stimulus current across the membrane. In addition, the value of the <b>rest</b> <b>potential</b> does not affect Vm around the cell because the electroporation current is several orders of magnitude larger than the ionic current that supports the <b>rest</b> <b>potential.</b> Once the field is removed, the shock-induced Vm discharges within 2 μs, but the pores persist in the membrane for several seconds. Complete resealing to preshock conditions requires approximately 20 s.

2500|$|Each excitable {{patch of}} {{membrane}} has two important levels of membrane potential: [...] the <b>resting</b> <b>potential,</b> {{which is the}} value the membrane potential maintains as long as nothing perturbs the cell, and a higher value called the threshold potential. [...] At the axon hillock of a typical neuron, the <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> is around –70 millivolts (mV) and the threshold potential is around –55 mV. [...] Synaptic inputs to a neuron cause the membrane to depolarize or hyperpolarize; that is, they cause the membrane potential to rise or fall. [...] Action potentials are triggered when enough depolarization accumulates to bring the membrane potential up to threshold. [...] When an action potential is triggered, the membrane potential abruptly shoots upward and then equally abruptly shoots back downward, often ending below the resting level, where it remains for some period of time. [...] The shape of the action potential is stereotyped; that is, {{the rise and fall}} usually have approximately the same amplitude and time course for all action potentials in a given cell. [...] (Exceptions are discussed later in the article). [...] In most neurons, the entire process takes place in about a thousandth of a second. [...] Many types of neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of up to 10–100 per second; some types, however, are much quieter, and may go for minutes or longer without emitting any action potentials.|$|E

The depolarization opens both the sodium and potassium channels in the membrane, allowing the ions to flow {{into and out of the}} axon, respectively. [...] If the depolarization is small (say, increasing Vm from −70mV to −60mV), the outward potassium current overwhelms the inward sodium current and the membrane repolarizes back to its normal <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> around −70mV.However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current increases more than the outward potassium current and a runaway condition (positive feedback) results: the more inward current there is, the more Vm increases, which in turn further increases the inward current. A sufficiently strong depolarization (increase in Vm) causes the voltage-sensitive sodium channels to open; the increasing permeability to sodium drives Vm closer to the sodium equilibrium voltage ENa≈ +55mV. [...] The increasing voltage in turn causes even more sodium channels to open, which pushes Vm still further towards ENa. [...] This positive feedback continues until the [...] sodium channels are fully open and Vm is close to ENa. The sharp rise in Vm and sodium permeability correspond to the rising phase of the action potential.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the peak}} of the action {{potential}}, when enough Na+ has entered the neuron and the membrane's potential has become high enough, the Na+ channels inactivate themselves by closing their inactivation gates. The inactivation gate {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "plug" [...] tethered to domains III and IV of the channel's intracellular alpha subunit. Closure of the inactivation gate causes Na+ flow through the channel to stop, which in turn causes the membrane potential to stop rising. With its inactivation gate closed, the channel is said to be inactivated. With the Na+ channel no longer contributing to the membrane potential, the potential decreases back to its <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> as the neuron repolarizes and subsequently hyperpolarizes itself. This decrease in voltage constitutes the falling phase of the action potential.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{potential}} {{in a normal}} skeletal muscle cell {{is similar to the}} {{action potential}} in neurons. [...] Action potentials result from the depolarization of the cell membrane (the sarcolemma), which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; these become inactivated and the membrane is repolarized through the outward current of potassium ions. [...] The <b>resting</b> <b>potential</b> prior to the action potential is typically −90mV, somewhat more negative than typical neurons. The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2–4ms, the absolute refractory period is roughly 1–3ms, and the conduction velocity along the muscle is roughly 5m/s. [...] The action potential releases calcium ions that free up the tropomyosin and allow the muscle to contract.
