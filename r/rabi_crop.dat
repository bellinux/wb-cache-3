50|$|Accordingly, Punjabi farmers {{traditionally}} {{start to}} harvest the kharif (monsoon) rice crops after Dussehra and sow the wheat (<b>rabi</b> <b>crop)</b> after Diwali. Therefore, Dussehra doubles up as a thanksgiving festival and Diwali is also {{considered to be}} a harvest festival.|$|E

50|$|The major {{economic}} {{activity of the}} village is agriculture, mainly subsistence based, and carpet weaving. The landless people weave the famous bhadohi woolen carpets but not the people from higher caste of Brahmins. Many people have migrated to Kolkata and Mumbai and post order money is a very prominent source of income. There is one <b>rabi</b> <b>crop</b> of wheat and another kharif crop of rice mainly with help of irrigation by ground water pumped through a government-installed bore well {{and a couple of}} private ones. There is hardly any commercial cropping. Much of land is alkaline, posing a great difficulty to agricultural activity.|$|E

40|$|Rainfall data {{recorded}} at IPSA/BSMRAU Meteorological Station, Salna, Gazipur, Bangladesh, for 13 years from 1988 to 2000 was evaluated. The stable but decreasing tendency of annual rainfall was indicated. The decreasing tendency was most conspicuous for October and February. This is alarming {{from the viewpoint}} of crop production. Decrease in October rainfall makes <b>rabi</b> <b>cropping</b> difficult in the rainfed condition, because rainfed cultivation of unplaned <b>rabi</b> <b>crops</b> is performed by utilizing soil water stored in the monsoon season. December and January are already in small rainfall, and decrease in February rainfall brings about condition of essentially no rainfall in consecutive 3 months. It may make cropping more risky in the rabi season. Re-examination of the present results is desired by using rainfall data {{recorded at}} other meteorological stations...|$|R
50|$|A. Kanhar: This type of soil {{is black}} {{in color and}} oilish. The {{capacity}} of water absorption in this soil is greater {{and this is very}} useful in growth of Kharif and <b>Rabi</b> <b>crops</b> in the region. This type of soil is found in the plane of Kotri and Mahanadi regions.|$|R
50|$|Karva {{is another}} word for 'pot' (a small earthen pot of water) and chauth means 'fourth' in Hindi (a {{reference}} {{to the fact that}} the festival falls on the fourth day of the dark-fortnight, or krishna paksh, of the month of Kartik). The festival originated and came to be celebrated only in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. One hypothesis is that military campaigns were often conducted by men in far off places whereby men would often leave their wives and children to go off to war. Their wives would often pray for their safe return. The festival also coincides with the wheat-sowing time (i.e., the beginning of the <b>Rabi</b> <b>crop</b> cycle). Big earthen pots in which wheat is stored are sometimes called Karvas, so the fast may have begun as a prayer for a good harvest in this predominantly wheat-eating region.|$|E

50|$|The pre-monsoon showers are meager {{and this}} along with low {{humidity}} accentuates the impact ofloo which at times changes into heat waves with exceptionally high temperature. The rainy season commences {{in the latter}} half of the June at different dates which are too difficult to be predicted. It brings relief to the people by lowering the temperatures up to 300c. The rainfall decreases southward and westward in the region. There is a dominance of Bay of Bengal currents. This season comes to an end by October with a sudden fall in temperature and amount of rainfall. Soon after the winter conditions settle in at times cold waves and westerly disturb the general monotony of the winters. The showers due to western depressions are very useful for the <b>rabi</b> <b>crop</b> in the region. The average rainfall in the study area varies between 105 cm to 150 cm.|$|E

A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (til) and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud, gur). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals. For most parts of India, this period {{is a part of}} early stages of the <b>Rabi</b> <b>crop</b> and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires.|$|E

Also, there was an induced low pressure, which pulled moisture both from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

50|$|Most fertile {{part of the}} village, use {{to produce}} all the most {{valuable}} rabi and bhadoi crops. In the low-lying areas, the main crop grown is winter rice, though in some parts good rabi crops are also raised on the lands. Rabi and Bhadoi crops were grown from 1800 till recently (1980). Villages like Umaidpur were chiefly dependent on the Aghani (or winter) rabi and bhadoi harvests. The village land falls into two classes: Bhith (uplands) and Dhanhar (low lands where water logging occurred during rainy season). Bhith was further classified as saliferous land or usher (soils in which salinity is mainly due to accumulation of alkali salts are called alkali soils) was found in patches in the outer area between good land and low-lying land. Nunia caste from the neighbouring village, Nauachak, used to extract saltpetere in the summer after <b>rabi</b> <b>crop</b> from these lands for their living. In these lands small farmers grew mainly 'Marua, also called mandua, nachini or Ragi' or Finger Millets (Eleusine coracana), Kauni (foxtail milet) and Sama (kutaki or little milet). In Bhith land, wheat, maize, and miscellaneous food-grains which consisted chiefly of khesari, rahari, masuri, urd, mung, janera, and oats. Miscel laneous food-crops growns also included potatoes, and suthni (Dioscorea fasciculate). The chief non-food crops are oilseeds. Tobacco and Chilies are cultivated as commercial crops.
