5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones, and the song thrush will also <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 off-season, Zach Parise {{signed a}} 13-year, $98million {{contract}} with the Minnesota Wild, leaving the Devils after one season as team captain. The Devils entered the lockout-shortened season with Bryce Salvador as their new captain. However, the Devils failed to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> performance of the prior year, finishing 19–19–10 in 48 games and missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In its lead-in to an {{upcoming}} <b>repeat,</b> <b>The</b> Wheel in Space episode 6 contains a short three-frame clip from The Evil of the Daleks episode 1, alongside a reprise {{from the existing}} episode 2 of that serial.|$|E

5|$|P. H. Vanderweyde {{noted that}} Crookes {{was already a}} believer in psychic powers before he {{obtained}} {{the results of the}} experiments. Vanderweyde stated the spring balance used in Crookes' experiment was unreliable as it was easy to manipulate by deception and suggested he should <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to blandly <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E
5|$|The Nebraska Cornhuskers {{began the}} 1996 season having won the {{national}} championship in both 1994 and 1995. Though Nebraska was {{now a member of}} a new conference—the former Big Eight Conference had been merged with four Texas schools to become the Big 12—it was widely expected that Nebraska would <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> performance for a third time in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The village by {{the ocean}} is {{probably}} the motif which has been <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> most in Faroese art. In Countless paintings Amariel Norðoy has <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> motif and shown it contains unlimited possibilities.|$|R

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 1996 season having ended 1995 {{with a victory}} over No. 9 Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl (December), {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} game in Virginia Tech history to that point. Following the victory, hopes were high that the Hokies would <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> performance in the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|The second CD, , was {{released}} on February 25, 2004 by Lantis. The second CD contains 16 tracks, several of which <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> names from the first disc, but are not repeat tracks. The disc also continues the story from the first disc. The second CD contains the voice actors from the original and includes Kadowaki as a main cast member.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} {{discusses}} disorder within nature, which is opposite {{to the discussion}} of order within nature found in the second section of Burnt Norton. Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate for explaining reality. Those who pursue only reason and science are ignorant. Even our progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> same errors as the past.|$|E
50|$|Vanbrugh <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> {{motif of}} three long round-headed windows at Castle Howard, {{and on the}} corner pavilions at Blenheim Palace. He <b>repeated</b> <b>the</b> rusticated central block with plainer {{projecting}} wings at Seaton Delaval Hall.|$|R

5|$|Therefore I shall again <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, as it is positively affirmed in Scripture: that God is there expressed in three different names, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghost: {{that each of these}} is God, and that there is but one God. But this union and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology {{tests are}} used to examine {{finished}} products such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} large {{attack on}} the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 3 April, the VPAF first {{appeared}} with two flights of four MiG-17s launched from Noi Bai airbase and shot down an F-8 Crusader for the cost of one of their own aircraft written off when it landed on a river bed after running short of fuel. A <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E

5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|English {{television}} cook Delia Smith and {{her husband}} Michael Wynn-Jones took over the majority of Norwich City's shares from Watling in 1996, and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success achieved during his first spell and was sacked two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in the First Division. His successor Bruce Rioch lasted two seasons and departed {{in the summer of}} 2000, with promotion yet to be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Gary Megson was {{appointed}} Norwich manager {{on a temporary}} basis {{for the second time}} in eight months: he had also briefly filled this role after Deehan's departure. Megson remained in charge until the end of the 1995–96 season before leaving the club. Mike Walker, who had struggled at Everton, was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> success achieved during his first spell and was sacked in the 1997–98 season with Norwich mid-table in the First Division.|$|E

50|$|The first {{movement}} typically {{takes about}} five minutes to nine minutes to perform. The length of the movement depends largely on whether both <b>repeats</b> (<b>the</b> <b>repeat</b> of <b>the</b> exposition and <b>the</b> <b>repeat</b> of <b>the</b> development and recapitulation) are observed. The movement shows two clear major themes, which have been decorated {{by the use of}} ornamentation, as was typical of the time.|$|R

5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide <b>repeat</b> (<b>the</b> mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine Exploration Fund survey team, {{reported}} uncovering an Arabic inscription {{buried in}} {{the wall of the}} village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have to <b>repeat</b> <b>the</b> payment.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} aspect {{is that the}} benchmark user {{may be interested in}} <b>repeating</b> <b>the</b> robustness tests. Although <b>repeating</b> <b>the</b> robustness tests using the same workload typically leads to the same results, performing additional tests with a different workload may be a simple way of disclosing more robustness issues.|$|R
