5000|$|The {{simplest}} valve gears give {{events of}} fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate {{in only one}} direction. Most however have a <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually [...] "shortening the cutoff" [...] or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as {{one and the same}} valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression ("kick back").|$|E
5000|$|Most Laserdisc {{players were}} {{required}} {{the user to}} manually turn the disc over to play the other side. A number of players (all diode laser based) were made that were capable of playing {{both sides of the}} disc automatically; {{at the end of the}} first side, or at the viewer's command, the machine would reverse the direction of the disc's rotation, simultaneously moving the laser pickup head to the other side of the disc, and then initiate playback. Since LD's are made up of two single sided discs glued together, the auto-reverse player would center each disc side individually. Laserdisc players used either a simple U-shaped <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> known as [...] "Epsilon Turn", or technique known as [...] "Gamma Turn", where the player physically rotated the laser reading head ° as it moved from one side of the disc to the other, ensuring that the laser retained the same playback orientation on both sides of the disc.

50|$|With larger engines, the {{linkages}} involved in controlling cutoff and direction grew progressively heavier {{and there was}} a need for power assistance in adjusting them. Steam (or later, compressed air) powered reversing gear was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Typically, the operator worked a valve that admitted steam to {{one side or the other}} of a cylinder connected to the <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> until the indicator showed the intended position. A second mechanism, usually a piston in an oil-filled cylinder held in position by closing a control cock, was required to keep {{the linkages}} in place. The first locomotive engineer to fit such a device was James Stirling of the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1873. Several engineers then tried them, including William Dean of the GWR and Vincent Raven of the North Eastern Railway, but they found them little to their liking, mainly because of maintenance difficulties: any oil leakage from the locking cylinder, either through the piston gland or the cock, allowed the mechanism to creep, or worse “nose-dive”, into full forward gear while running. Stirling moved to the South Eastern Railway and Harry Smith Wainwright, his successor with that company, incorporated them into most of his designs, which were in production about thirty years after Stirling’s innovation. Later still the forward-looking Southern Railway engineer Oliver Bulleid fitted them to his famous Merchant Navy Class of locomotives, but they were mostly removed at rebuild.|$|E
5000|$|The SR1 steam roller was Mamod's first mobile steam toy. It was {{introduced}} in January 1961, designed by Eric Malins. The first rollers were unidirectional and only travelled in a 'forward' direction (at an un-steam roller like speed). The engines featured a modified MM2 steam unit complete with characteristic rolls made of aluminium alloy. Like the early TE1s of 1963 and the stationary range, the early SR1 rollers were of screw construction and also featured a brass vaporising lamp rivetted to the scuttle. They had no tow hook. From 1963, a revised burner was used (as {{was introduced}} with the TE1 steam tractor), the handle of which formed a tow hook; although it would be 1969 before it had anything for it to tow, {{with the introduction of}} the OW1 Open Wagon and LB1 Lumber Wagon. From 1965 the roller was put together using pop rivets (like all the Mamod range of steam toys) - as a result it is easy to distinguish early 1960s rollers from later ones. In 1967 the SR1 became the SR1a with the introduction of a simple <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the engine unit. The mechanism was similar to the 1965 MEC1 Meccano engine. In the same way, the TE1 became a TE1a. In 1968 the aluminium rollers and wheels were replaced by Mazak items; the same material is used to this day. The roller has remained in the Mamod range for 50 years now and has undergone small incremental changes over this time, with modifications to the burner (moving to solid fuel circa 1976) and sight glass boilers replacing the over flow plug type (circa 1978). The only other changes have been largely cosmetic: paint, whistles, smoke box detailing. Early boxed SR1 engines now command strong prices and are sometimes referred to as [...] "nut and bolt" [...] SRs by collectors. Lately other variations of roller have included limited editions in different colours as well as longer boiler versions and also a kit version. Mamod's first mobile steam toy continues to sell well in the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Disk plows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (reversible) disk plows can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” disk plow was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> stabilization mechanism of the plow, a disk angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the disk plow.

The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries.

40|$|A symmetrically opening slit mechanism, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} infra-red spectrometers, is described. I t employs parallel spring movements, operates for widths from 1 to 2 OOO p and {{is suitable for}} use with curved jaws. Its operating torque is about 50 g cm which, with its rapid response and freedom from backlash, makes it suitable for automatic control. The jaws remain parallel to within about 3 sec, and the mid-line of the slit does not drift more than about 2 p. Hysteresis between the driving micrometer drum and the measured slit width amounts to 0. 2 - 0. 3 p, and {{may be due to}} an oil film. The slit jaws can be set so close together as to polarize the transmitted light completely. The slit mechanism, with a suitable rotational movement, has been applied to a twin-beam infra-red spectrometer; it has been demonstrated that entrance and exit slits must be alined to within a few seconds if satisfactory balance of the twin beams is to be achieved.

40|$|Analysis, design, fabrication, and {{experimental}} {{assessment of a}} symmetric three-phase free-piston Stirling engine system is discussed in this paper. The system is designed to operate with moderate-temperature heat input {{that is consistent with}} solar-thermal collectors. Diaphragm pistons and nylon flexures are considered for this prototype to eliminate surface friction and to provide appropriate seals. In addition, low loss diaphragm pistons, etched and woven-wire screen heat exchangers, and plastic flexures, as the main components of the system, are outlined. The experimental results are presented and compared with design analysis. Experiments successfully confirm the design models for heat exchanger flow friction losses and gas spring hysteresis dissipation. Furthermore, it is revealed that gas spring hysteresis loss is an important dissipation phenomenon for low-power Stirling engines and should be carefully addressed in design. Analysis shows that the gas hysteresis dissipation is reduced drastically by increasing the number of phases in a multiphase Stirling engine system. It is further shown that for an even number of phases, half of the engine chambers could be eliminated by utilizing a <b>reversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> within the multiphase system. The mathematical formulation and modal analysis of multiphase Stirling engine system are then extended to a system that incorporates a reverser. By introducing a reverser to the fabricated prototype, the system successfully operates in engine mode. The system proves its self-starting capability and validates the computed start-up temperature. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3097274 �...|$|E
