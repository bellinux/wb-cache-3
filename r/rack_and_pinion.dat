5|$|BMW {{began to}} use precise <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> {{steering}} systems in the 1930s, and many other European manufacturers soon adopted the technology. American automakers adopted <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering beginning with the 1974 Ford Pinto.|$|E

5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> system.|$|E
25|$|It is vitally {{important}} that all braking is done in a controlled manner, as any sudden shocks impose very high loads on the <b>rack</b> rail <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> wheels, <b>and</b> can cause damage.|$|R
40|$|The lateral Casimir {{force is}} {{employed}} {{to propose a}} nanoscale mechanical device composed of one <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> N <b>pinions.</b> A coupling between the pinions via torsional springs is shown to coordinate their motion through a synchronization transition. The system can work against loads that are greater than the lateral Casimir force for each device. The existence of a stable synchronized state ensures that the system could operate in full coordination without the need of delicate fine tuning of all the characteristics such as the spring constants, the corrugation amplitudes, and the distances between the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> the <b>pinions.</b> © 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
25|$|Most {{practical}} mechanical analog computers of {{any significant}} complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys {{were used in}} a Fourier synthesizer, a tide-predicting machine, which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinions.</b> The <b>racks</b> were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.|$|R
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> steering had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
40|$|This thesis shows {{a concept}} of a {{coupling}} point for gripper fingers. These gripping fingers {{are part of a}} three-finger-gripper for a new research robot at the DLR (German Areospace Center). Changing the gripper fingers gives high flexibility with regard to the feasible gripping tasks and a simple structure of the three-finger-gripper with only four degrees of freedom. The concept includes a PCB with spring loaded contacts for electical connection and a conical dovetail joint for mechnical connection. The mounting direction of the coupling point is in the acutation direction of the linear drive for the gripper finger. The transmission of the mechanical degree of freedom is achieved with two <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinions</b> <b>and</b> the overload release is bases on the friction effect. The realisation of the concept is critical due to the geometrical boundaries which leads to gripping forces below the requirements. Some possible solutions are contemplated and unconsidered areas for alternative solutions are shown...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of iron-clad ships the magnetic deviation observed in compasses became more severe. Methods of compensation by arranging iron or magnetic objects near the binnacle were developed. In 1854, {{a new type of}} binnacle was patented by John Gray of Liverpool which directly incorporated adjustable correcting magnets on screws or <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinions.</b> This was improved again when Lord Kelvin patented in the 1880s another system of compass and which incorporated two compensating magnets. These are colloquially known as [...] "Kelvin's balls" [...] in the UK, and [...] "navigator's balls" [...] in the United States. Unlike most display binnacles today, which have the balls painted red and green to represent port and starboard side of the vessel, the balls shall be painted black or have another uniform color. The Royal Maritime museum at Greenwich, London, has an extensive collection of binnacles in correct colours.|$|R

40|$|The {{coupling}} between corrugated surfaces due to {{the lateral}} Casimir force is employed to propose a nanoscale mechanical device composed of two <b>racks</b> <b>and</b> a <b>pinion.</b> The noncontact nature of the interaction allows for the system to be made frustrated by choosing the two racks {{to move in the}} same direction <b>and</b> forcing the <b>pinion</b> to choose between two opposite directions. This leads to a rich and sensitive phase behavior, which makes the device potentially useful as a mechanical sensor or amplifier. The device could also be used to make a mechanical clock signal of tunable frequency. Comment: 3 pages, to appear in Applied Physics Letter...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{prototype}} of the new camera, named the Rolleiflex, was finally completed in 1927; it was built for absolute reliability and featured a rigid, injection-moulded housing made of aluminium. Heidecke wanted to avoid conventional leather bellows for focusing the lens because of an earlier, bad experience: around 1916, he conducted an experiment with a Kodak camera; he left it in a cellar, and when he later retrieved it, he found that rats had eaten the bellows. This convinced him that a camera designed for photojournalism and operation in the tropics had to work perfectly, which excluded components that might rot. He ruled out a cloth shutter curtain for the same reason, choosing instead a Compur mechanical shutter.Focusing in the [...] "Rolleiflex" [...] was achieved by moving the carriage that held both the viewfinder and the imaging lens, i.e. the camera had so-called [...] "metallic bellows"; that is, the plate enclosed {{the sides of the}} case. It was crucial that the plate remained parallel as it moved during focusing; to achieve this, Heidecke developed an ingenious design which proved to be highly successful. Behind the imaging lens and surrounding the opening for the optical path was a large cogwheel which drove four smaller cogs located top left and right, and bottom left and right. Each of the four small cogs drove <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinions</b> (toothed rails) attached to the lens assembly. This system functioned perfectly, and, thanks to high-quality components, also for many years of service. Only the viewfinder and back of the camera, both made of aluminium, had to be handled with care, which remained the case until the camera went into production.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated, wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated, wheel coated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> uncoated as well as wheel uncoated <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (wheel <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> coated) <b>and</b> uncoated/coated pair (uncoated wheel <b>and</b> coated <b>pinion)</b> a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated wheel <b>and</b> uncoated <b>pinion)</b> – even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R
25|$|For simplicity, {{this section}} {{describes}} a basic type of lock, {{with a pair of}} gates {{at each end of the}} chamber and simple <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> paddles raised manually by means of a detachable windlass operated by lock-keepers or the boat's shore crew.
