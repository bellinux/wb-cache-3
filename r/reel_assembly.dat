25|$|Montgomery {{held the}} first patent on a rotary blade mower. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, mowers were {{equipped}} with a rotating <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> that was either pushed by hand or was propelled by a small gasoline engine. This kind of mower worked well in short grass, but it clogged up in tall grass. Montgomery did not invent this mower, but he obtained the patent from a frustrated inventor in Chicago, Illinois. The first commercially produced rotary mower, the Yazoo Master Mower, was then produced by a small manufacturing plant in Jackson, Mississippi. Montgomery was the Louisiana distributor of Yazoo until 1981, when he closed his lawnmower business in Ruston.|$|E

40|$|Several {{features}} of solar energy space power stations are discussed. An end-to-end {{analysis of a}} system using silicon solar cells is reviewed, and the merits of construction in low earth orbit and in geosynchronous orbit are compared. A suggested space construction procedure, described in detail, would use a 'beam builder', an automated machine, to fabricate the first sublevel truss structural members from strip stock material that is stored on <b>reels.</b> An <b>assembly</b> jig would then be used to position a number of beam builders in the proper location and to support the beams as they are produced to facilitate joining them to form the final space power station structure. Space projects for evaluating the construction concept are proposed, and a possible space construction sequence is considered. Space transportation {{that would be required}} in conjunction with the space power station is described...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} an induced gravity {{environment}} in-transit to Mars is assessed based on current knowledge. Two possible alternatives to constant in-transit spinning, periodic spinning and Mars surface reconditioning are discussed and compared. Four propulsion options: cryogenic/aerobraking, solid core nuclear thermal, solar electric and nuclear electric are evaluated for concept adaptability to induced gravity, and salient differences from their microgravity counterparts are assessed. Configurations to the systems level are presented and accompanied by mass estimates. Hardware subsystems required for induced gravity vehicles, such as tether crawlers, tether <b>reels,</b> high-power roll-ring <b>assemblies,</b> etc., have been defined to a sufficient level of detail to confidently determine mass penalties. Results of this study show the mass penalties and complexity involved in producing an induced gravity environment...|$|R
50|$|The TUS <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> (TUS-RA) is {{basically}} a large spool much like a garden hose reel that pays out cable when the MT moves away and rolls it back up as the MT returns {{to the center of}} the truss. This is the same TUS-RA retrieved during STS-121. It was replaced and this failed unit was returned to earth and refurbished to later fly on ELC-2.|$|E

50|$|The E-6 {{aircraft}} {{is based}} on the Boeing 707. The wings were redesigned to meet new wing loading characteristics, the tail was redesigned after a catastrophic failure of the vertical stabilizer during flight tests. The cockpit was copied from the Boeing 737NG commercial airliner, and the landing gear was modified to handle the added weight. Larger fuel tanks were installed and the fuselage was extensively modified to accommodate the 31 antennas, including the trailing wire antenna and <b>reel</b> <b>assembly.</b> After the upgrade to the E-6B, the TACAMO aircraft - with the addition of an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) - took over the EC-135 Looking Glass mission formerly conducted by the USAF 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.|$|E
50|$|Detachable reel {{magazines}} can {{be fitted}} (e.g. {{to enable the}} projection of nitrate film in accordance with safety regulations), or removed (e.g. to enable projection using an external film transport device such as a platter or tower, or to fit an external audio reader) as needed. Special fire trap rollers for nitrate were also available, to comply with fire regulations in some jurisdictions. Separate magnetic and analog optical audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components. The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad roller <b>assemblies,</b> <b>reel</b> spindles and the lens, {{and in some cases}} making minor adjustments to the lamphouse. This procedure can be completed by a competent projectionist in 5-10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model and the}} corresponding methods of designing the temperature fields formed in the strip at rolling in the mill with electrocontact technological heating have been developed. The principal parameters of the equipment of the electrocontact heating mill used for hot rolling tool steel strips have been determined. New structures of a current-leading stand, a working stand, a <b>reel</b> and other <b>assemblies</b> and units incorporated in the mill equipment have been devised, which permitted to implement the process of hot rolling thin strips from hardly-deformed steels and alloys. The experimental studies of the process have been carried out; they proved a high efficiency of producing thin strips from hardly-deformed steels and alloys on the electrocontact technological heating mill. Based {{on the results of}} the studies, a new mill 200 EKN with electrocontact technological heating of the strip has been designed, manufactured and installed at the Izhstal plant. The introduction of the mill 200 EKN into practice has made it possible to essentially reduce the working hours of the production of thin strips in coils from hardly-deformed steel and alloy gradesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

40|$|A tractor mounted three-point hitch {{implement}} {{was developed}} to extract and collect subsurface trickle irrigation laterals from the soil. Power to the implement was supplied by the tractor hydraulic system to the three-point hitch and two remote hydraulic circuits. In operation, the implement loosened the soil around the lateral, extracted the tubing from the soil, wound it on a <b>reel</b> <b>assembly,</b> and then dropped the roll of tubing {{at the end of}} the row. Draft power requirements averaged 14. 5 kW (19. 4 hp) and hydraulic power averaged 0. 56 kW (. 75 hp) when the one row implement was operated at 7. 2 km/h (4. 5 mph). Field capacity of the one row implement averaged 0. 19 ha/hr (. 47 ac/hr) when operated in 100 m (328 ft) long rows...|$|E
40|$|Describes the {{radiation}} testing and calibration of the AZ- 101 tank suspended solids profiler unit mounted on 6 tank riser 24 A. The Mt. Fury Suspended Solids Profiler (SSP) is a microprocessor-controlled instrument that measures the turbidity of solid-liquid suspensions and sludges. The profiler is used commercially for the {{monitoring and control}} of clarifiers and thickeners in waste treatment, mining, pulp and paper, and other industrial processing facilities. The instrument includes a three inch diameter probe, a Kynar coated coaxial cable, a <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> with a clutch and drive shaft, a stepper motor, and electronics. The instrument measures insoluble or suspended solids content in liquids by transmitting infrared energy at a wavelength of 935 nm and measuring the extent of backscatter. This frequency is not affected by solution color. There are two detectors that allow the instrument to operate over {{a broad range of}} concentrations, from clear liquids to light sludges...|$|E
40|$|The development, performance, {{and test}} {{results for the}} {{spaceborne}} magnetic tape transport are discussed. An analytical model of the tape transport was used to optimize its conceptual design. Each of the subsystems was subjected to reliability analyses which included structural integrity, maintenance of system performance within acceptable bounds, and avoidance of fatigue failure. These subsystems were also compared {{with each other in}} order to evaluate reliability characteristics. The transport uses no mechanical couplings. Four drive motors, one for each reel and one for each of two capstans, are used in a differential mode. There are two hybrid, spherical, cone tapered-crown rollers for tape guidance. Storage of the magnetic tape is provided by a <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> which includes the reel, a reel support structure and bearings, dust seals, and a dc drive motor. A summary of transport test results on tape guidance, flutter, and skew is provided...|$|E
40|$|A cable <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{described}} which is particularly adapted for, {{but not limited}} to, a system for providing electrical connection of power and data signals between an orbiter vehicle, such as a space shuttle, and a recovered satellite. The assembly is comprised of two mutually opposing ring type structures having 180 deg relative rotation {{with one of the}} structures being held in fixed position while the other structure is rotatable. Motor controlled berthing latches and umbilical cable connectors for the satellite are located {{on the rim of the}} rotatable ring structure. The electrical cable assembly is fed in two sections from the orbiter vehicle into the outer rim portion of the fixed ring structure where they are directed inwardly and attached to two concentrically coiled metal bands whose respective ends are secured to inner and outer post members of circular sets of guide pins located on opposing circular plate members, one rotatable and one fixed. The cable sections are fed out as three output cable sections through openings in the central portion of the circular plate of the rotatable ring structure where they are directed to the latches and connectors located on its rim...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} of a reliable dry land production system for common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) based on low-cost direct seeding and direct harvest methods was initiated at the Crop Development Centre at the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1980 s. The target production area is a dry land spring wheat farming region in which lentil and pea production is well established. Effort is focussed on production of the pinto class. Three major potential improvements to the production system were identified: harvest equipment modification to improve direct harvest capability, development of early maturing germplasm with reliable expression of a crop canopy suitable for direct harvesting systems, and appropriate agronomy to improve the reliability of production. The research effort in harvest equipment modifications resulted in commercialization of a new design of lifter and <b>reel</b> <b>assembly</b> for combines equipped with floating cutter bar headers. Field scale evaluations showed that a 50 % reduction in cutter bar loss is possible with cultivars with Type III growth habit. Agronomy research for new production systems has been limited to development of improved rhizobial strains, but new areas of research will be explored as appropriate cultivars become available. Research {{in the area of}} germplasm development is specifically focussed on gains in early maturity and improvements in canopy structure, particularly for the pinto class. The ideal canopy structure for the production system is one in which all pods are situated above the combine cutter bar at the time of harvest. Specific improvements to the canopy structure include development of early maturing genotypes with elongated Type I growth habit, Type II growth habit or Type III growth habit without basal clustering of pods. In addition, an effort is underway to develop genotypes with shorter pods to maximize cutter bar clearance are under development and with pods with reduced lignin to minimize shattering and maximize cutter bar clearance. Reduction of lignin in pods may help reduce shattering at the time of harvest due to reduced dehiscence. Pods with reduced lignin tend to curve upward at the time of maturity, allowing better clearance of the cutter bar. Agronomic comparisons of F 2 -derived F 4 and F 5 lines showed that in some populations cutter bar losses can be reduced by up to 50 %...|$|E
