40|$|Forty {{safflower}} genotypes {{were grown}} under normal irrigation and drought stress. In the first experiment, the allelopathic potential of shoot residues was evaluated using the sandwich method. Each genotype residue (0. 4 g) {{was placed in}} a sterile Petri dish and two layers of agar were poured on that. Radish seeds were placed on agar medium. The radish seeds were cultivated without safflower residues as the controls. The length of the radicle, hypocotyl, and fresh biomass weight and seed germination percentages were measured. A pot experiment was also done on two genotypes with the highest and two with the lowest allelopathic activity selected after screening genotypes in the first experiment. Before entering the reproductive phase, irrigation treatments (normal irrigation and drought stress) were applied. Shoots were harvested, dried, milled and mixed with the topsoil of new pots and then radish seeds were sown. The pots with safflower genotypes were used to evaluate the effect of <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> allelopathy. The shoot length, fresh biomass weight, and germination percentage were measured. Different safflower genotypes showed varied allelopathic potential. The results of the first experiment showed that Egypt and Iran-Khorasan genotypes caused maximum inhibitory responses and Australia and Iran-Kerman genotypes resulted in minimum inhibitory responses on radish seedling growth. Fresh biomass weight had the most sensitivity to safflower residues. The results of the pot experiment were consistent with the results of in vitro experiments. Residues produced under drought stress had more inhibitory effects on the measured traits.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{direct contact with}} the soil, roots are exposed to colonizing {{micro-organisms}} that persist after the plant has died. These micro-organisms may affect intrinsic root-chemical quality and the kinetics of <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> decomposition in soil, or interact with soil micro-organisms during the decomposition process. The aims in this work were i) to determine the interactions between the presence of root-colonizing micro-organisms and root-chemical quality and ii) to quantify the effect of these micro-organisms on root decomposition. Roots were selected from six maize genotypes cultivated in the field and harvested at physiological maturity. The roots of two genotypes (F 2 and F 2 bm 1) had a higher N content, lower neutral sugars content and higher Klason lignin content than the other genotypes (F 292, F 292 bm 3, Mexxal, Colombus). Location of the <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> micro-organisms by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots were more colonized than roots of the other genotypes. Electron Dispersive X-Ray microanalyses of in situ N confirmed a higher N content in the colonizing micro-organisms than in the root cell walls. Residues of F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots decomposed more slowly {{and to a lesser extent}} than those of the other genotypes during incubation in a silty loam soil under controlled conditions (15 °C, - 80 kPa). After 49 days, 40. 6 % of the total C from F 292 was mineralized but only 20. 7 % of from F 2 bm 1. These results suggest that residue-colonizing micro-organisms decompose the cell-wall sugars to varying extents before soil decomposition thereby modifying the chemical quality of the residues and their mineralization pattern in soil. Due to their high N content, colonizing micro-organisms also impact on the total N content of root residues, reducing their C to N ratio. Gamma sterilized root residues were incubated under the same conditions as non-sterilized residues to see if micro-organisms colonizing root residues could modify the action of soil micro-organisms during decomposition. Similar C mineralization rates were observed for both non-sterilized and sterilized residues, indicating that the residue micro-organisms did not quantitatively affect the activity of soil micro-organisms...|$|E

However, measuring such effects can contribute {{to a better understanding}} of crop rotation. In two experiments, we evaluated the content of legume-N in crop tissue and the fertilizer value of the roots and shoots of two legume species. Roots, shoots, or whole plants of the legumes sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea) and jack beans (Canavalia ensiformis) were cropped as green manure to supply nitrogen to cabbage crops (Brassica oleracea var. capitata). The principle of the A-value technique was applied to estimate the fertilizer value of each plant part. In a pot experiment, both the content of legume-N in cabbage and the fertilizer value of the whole plant was higher than the shoots, which was in turn higher than that of the roots. In field condition, roots had a decreasing effect on the N content of cabbage plants. Growing cabbage on legume <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> resulted in an increased absorption of 15 N-urea, resulting in negative values ​​for legume-N content: - 13. 59 g kg- 1 and - 3. 51 g kg- 1 for sunhemp and jack beans, respectively.

In the present work, the residue of Jatropha roots were extracted with methanol and resulting residues, were investigated regarding their content of total phenolic compounds by folin-Cioalteau assay. Further, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were characterized by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical method and proved remarkable results. Oxidation stability of Jatropha oil, used fried oil and olive oil and their corresponding biodiesel obtained by conventional transesterification were tested using thermal oxidation. Natural antioxidants such as (α-trocopherol), synthetic antioxidants as butylated hydroxytoluene and natural Jatropha root extract were {{used in the present study}} in comparison to investigate their addition effect on the oxidative stability of oils and their corresponding biodiesel. In the rapied thermal treatment test, results showed that addition of butylated hydroxytoluene 0. 25 % was able to stabilize Jatropha oil 6 h, but poorly stabiliz biodiesel. Addition of 0. 25 % α-trocopherol to Jatropha oil showed less oxidation stability after 2 h thermal treatment. Crude root extract addition at 0. 25 % to Jatropha oil showed good stability up to 4 h thermal treatment while addition of root extract at 0. 25 % to biodiesel showed better stability up to 6 h thermal treatment.

In a field experiment, the influence of two preceding cover crops, stooling rye and annual ryegrass, on the growth of maize and the weed Cyperus esculentus were compared with herbicides and weed control by hoeing. Maize emergence and early growth were delayed in the presence of physical residues of both cover crop species, especially in annual ryegrass residues. Growth of C. esculentus was significantly inhibited in the inter-row maize planting lines by the cover crops for the first 16 days after maize emergence, but this effect had diminished by day 28. In a pot experiment, the influence of the same two cover crops on maize and C. esculentus growth was evaluated together with oats and two additional annual ryegrass cultivars.

The experimental design was split plot in which three levels of nitrogen (0, 40, and 80 kg N ha - 1) were main factors and additive organic matters including liquorice <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> at 15 and 30 Mg ha - 1, municipal waste compost at 10 and 20 Mg ha - 1, and wheat residues at 750 and 1500 kg ha - 1 (all rates equivalent to 50 and 100 %) were sub factors. A check treatment (no additive materials) was {{also included in the}} experiment. Results indicated that with increasing nitrogen level from zero to 40 and 40 to 80 kg ha- 1, wheat yield increased significantly. Among yield components, number of seeds per spike increased significantly with zero to 40 and 40 to 80 kg nitrogen ha- 1, but number of spikes m- 2 increased significantly only when nitrogen level was increased from zero to 80 kg ha- 1. Compared to check (no additive materials), maximum wheat grain yield (32 %) was obtained from 100 % compost application. Results of nitrogen and organic matters interaction effects indicated that 100 % compost application and increasing nitrogen level from 40 to 80 kg ha - 1 had no significant effect on dryland wheat yield. This showed the positive impact of compost application on the reduction of nitrogen fertilizer. Thus, it appears that 50 % of the required nitrogen fertilizer could be replaced by compost.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{decomposition}} rates of shoot and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of perennial grasses. This knowledge is important to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of the grasses. An incubation experiment was carried out in a sandy clay loam with shoot and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of three native perennial grasses (Wallaby grass, Stipa sp. and Kangaroo grass) and the annual grass barley either separately or in mixtures of two residues. Respiration rate was measured over 18 days, and microbial C and available N were measured on days 0 and 18. Decomposition was lower for roots than for shoots and lower for residues of perennial grasses than for barley. Cumulative respiration was positively correlated with water-soluble C in the residues but not with residue C/N. In the mixtures, the measured cumulative respiration was higher than the expected value in five of the nine mixes usually where the differences in cumulative respiration between the individual residues were relatively small. Lower than expected cumulative respiration were found in two of the mixtures in which barley shoots (high cumulative respiration) were mixed with residues with low cumulative respiration. There was a negative correlation between the change in microbial biomass C concentration from day 0 to day 18 and cumulative respiration on day 18. In the amended soils, the available N concentration decreased from day 0 to day 18. It is concluded that the low decomposition rate of perennial grasses residues should favour C sequestration, but that mixing residues of similar decomposition rate may accelerate their decomposition.

Maize emergence and growth were delayed {{in the presence of}} residues of both cover crop species, especially in annual ryegrass residues. C. esculentus growth was significantly inhibited in the area between the maize planting rows by the cover crops for the first 14 days after maize emergence, but this growth suppressing effect diminished after 28 days. In a controlled environment study, the influence of the same cover crops, together with Avena sativa (oats) and three cultivars of annual ryegrass were evaluated.

Litterbags containing vetch or rye <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> {{were buried in}} soil at {{the same day as}} either vetch or rye winter catch crops were incorporated into the field soil from which the materials were gathered. The litterbags were sampled after 6 weeks in the field. In vetch, bacterial and fungal biomasses were similar whereas fungi dominated microbial biomass in rye. The biomass of the bacterial consuming fauna dominated by nematodes and microarthropods was similar to the biomass of bacteria in vetch as opposed to in rye where bacterivore biomass was lower than bacterial biomass. This suggests a much higher bacterial production in vetch compared to rye. Furthermore, in vetch dauer larvae of bacteria feeding nematodes prevailed, which is also a sign of high bacterial production followed by food shortage for the bacterivores. Bacterivorous and predatory nematodes with capability of consuming protozoa showed an inverse relationship to flagellated protozoa. This suggests that these nematodes controlled the protozoan biomass constituting a lower fraction of the bacterivore biomass in vetch compared to in rye. Such intraguild predator–prey relationship is therefore indicated for microbivorous organisms among bacterivorous and predatory nematodes (the intraguild predator) protozoa (the intraguild prey) and bacteria (the common prey). The much higher fungal biomass in rye than in vetch litterbags was not reflected in the biomass of the fungal feeders.

In the present experiment, the structure of the archaeal community was determined during the decomposition of rice <b>root</b> and straw <b>residues</b> in anoxic rice field soil incubated at three temperatures (15 °C, 30 °C, and 45 °C). More CH 4 was produced in the straw treatment than root treatment. Increasing the temperature from 15 °C to 45 °C enhanced CH 4 production. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses in combination with cloning and sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed that Methanosarcinaceae developed early in the incubations, whereas Methanosaetaceae became more abundant in the later stages.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate soil biological and chemical factors that give rise to cereal yield enhancing effects of legume rotations on sandy, nutrient poor West African soils. The aim was not only to gain more information on the role of legume residues and microorganisms in the soil nutrient cycle. But the study aimed at evaluating if differences in substrate qualities (e. g. <b>root</b> <b>residues)</b> cause changes in the microbial community structure due to specific and highly complex microbe-root-soil interactions. Site and system specific reactions of microorganisms towards rewetting, simulating the onset of rainy season, were observed. Higher respiration rates, higher amounts of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) as well as higher ergosterol, muramic acid, glucosamine and adenylate concentrations were measured in CL soils of Koukombo and in both soils from Fada. The immediate increase in ATP concentrations after rewetting was likely caused by rehydration of microbial cells where N was not immobilized and, thus, available for plants facilitating their rapid development. Legume <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> led only to slightly better plant performances compared to the control, while the application of cereal roots reduced seedling growth. In contrast to sorghum seedlings, the microbial community did not react to the mineral treatment. Thus the energy supply in form of organic amendments increased microbial indices compared to mineral P application and the control. The results of basal respiration rates, Cmic and Corg levels indicate that the microbial community in the soil from Koukombo is less efficient in substrate use compared to microorganisms in the soil from Fada. However, the continuous carbon input by legume <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> might have contributed to these differences in soil fertility. With the 33 P isotopic exchange method a low buffering capacity was detected in both soils irrespective of treatments. Calculated E values (E 1 min to E 1 min- 1 d and E 1 d- 3 m) indicated a slowly release of P due to root turnover while applied mineral P is taken up by plants or fixed to the soil. Due to the fact that sorghum growth reacted mainly to the application of mineral P and the microorganisms solely to the organic inputs, the combination of both amendments seems to be the best approach to a sustainable increase of crop production on many nutrient-poor, sandy West African soils. In a pot experiment, were CC and CL soils from Fada and Koukombo were adjusted to the same level of P and N concentrations, crop growth was significantly higher on CL soils, compared to the respective treatments on CC soils. Mycorrhizal infection of roots was increased and the number of nematodes, predominantly free living nematodes, was almost halfed on rotation soils. In conclusion, increased nutrient availability (especially P and N) through the introduction of legumes is not the only reason for the observed yield increasing effects. Soil biological factors seem to also play an important role. In a root chamber experiment the pH gradient along the root-soil-interface was measured at three times using an antimony microelectrode. For Fada soils, pH values were higher on CL than CC soils while the opposite was true for the Koukombo soils. Site-specific differences between Fada and Koukombo soils in N content and microbial community structures might have created varying crop performances leading to the contrasting pH findings. However, the mechanisms involved in this highly complex microbe-root-soil interaction remain unclear. This study was financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG, BU 1308 / 4 - 1...|$|R
30|$|The soil {{property}} that increases PR dissolution and its availability to plants is soil organic matter.

At the point when arable crops are harvested, an expansive extent of the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> and at times some portion of the over the ground parcels are abandoned in soil. The deterioration of plant buildups in soil brings about the creation of various natural acids, for example, oxalic, citrus, and tartaric acids.

Cotton lint yield and quality were not affected by cover crop treatments and tillage systems. Also, tillage by cover crop interactions was non-significant for cotton lint yield and quality. During the observations at 50 % boll opening period of cotton, it was monitored that leaf senescence decreased under no-tillage cotton production system in both years...|$|R

A randomized blocks design, in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, was used. Three cover crops (palisade grass, millet and common bean) provided straw and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> {{to the following}} crops of corn and soybean. The common bean-soybean sequence provided little soil covering and higher metabolic quotient and soil basal respiration and total enzymatic activity, {{as well as a}} general increase of soilborne fungi. The principal component analysis revealed that 76. 61 % of the variance {{can be explained by the}} three first components, with cover crops, soil basal respiration and metabolic quotient regarded as the main qualitative and quantitative sources of variance in the first component. Carbon from the microbial biomass was the soil quality indicator best correlated to crop yield and negatively correlated to Fusarium solani density. The Rhizoctonia solani population was correlated with higher metabolic quotient and soil total enzymatic activity and basal respiration. The palisade grass crop favored soil fungistasis and enhancement of antagonist Trichoderma spp. populations. The multivariate approach demonstrated the association of soil fungi with soil quality indicators, as well as a higher influence of cover crops on the variance observed, in comparison to cash crops...|$|R
30|$|The {{aggregate}} {{development and}} stability of soils is influenced by root systems, fungal filaments and soil fauna excrement (Daynes et al. 2013; Oades 1993; Ritz and Young 2004; Tisdall and Oades 1982). According to the soil thin sections, the percentage of organic components (<b>root</b> <b>residues</b> and hyphae) and excrement pedofeatures was higher in UFs than in CFs (Table  7). Thus, we propose that {{the formation of the}} well-developed granular microstructure of surface soil and spongy microstructure of subsoil was affected by plant roots, soil fauna and soil microorganisms, particularly fungal hyphae. We also detected differences between the upper and lower layers of UFs with respect to the structures observed. A granular structure is common in surface horizons with a very fine silt to clayey texture (such as in vertisols) (Fitzpatrick 1984; Kovda and Mermut 2010) or in mollic subsurface horizons with many grass roots (Gerasimova and Lebedeva-Verba 2010; Oades 1993). Shrink–swell processes in clay with a dry–wet cycle and the presence of root systems lead to the development of granular aggregates in these soils (Oades 1993). In the present study, the granular microstructures of the A 1 and A 2 horizons of E-UF and the A 1 horizon of N-UF contained many <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> and tissues (Table  7), and thus, the development of the granular microstructure was affected by root systems. In general, volcanic ash soils have a small granular microstructure (Sedov et al. 2010). In both Eniwa farms, the buried horizons were dominated by spongy microstructures composed of moderately or strongly developed granules, suggesting that this structure was influenced by volcanic ash. However, on the Narita farms, the spongy structure was found only in the A 1 horizon of N-UF and not that of N-CF. The aggregate hierarchy concept, different binding agents act at different hierarchical stages in soil aggregates (Tisdall and Oades 1982). Macro-aggregates (0.25 – 5  mm in diameter) comprise many micro-aggregates (2 – 250  µm), which are bound together mainly by a sticky network formed from fungal hyphae and fine roots. The micro-aggregates comprise mainly fine sand grains and small clumps of silt grains, clay and organic debris, which are bound together by root hairs, fungal hyphae and microbial gums (Brady and Weil 2008; Six et al. 2004; Tisdall and Oades 1982). In the soil thin sections, the granules in the A 1 horizon of N-UF measured 0.3 – 5.0  mm in diameter, whereas the small granules in the crumbs in the A 2 horizon of N-UF measured approximately 100 – 300  µm in diameter. These results show that the granular structure was dominated by macro-aggregates, whereas the spongy structure was dominated by micro-aggregates. The difference of aggregate size between the granular and spongy structures suggested that different organic matter act as binding agents with the granular structure affected by comparatively large roots and hyphae and the spongy structure affected by root hairs, fine fungal hyphae and microbial debris.|$|R
40|$|Overwintering legume-based {{catch crops}} (LBCCs) may play an {{important}} role in ecological intensification of agricultural production, especially in low-input systems like organic farming. The emerging concept of ecological intensification (or sustainable intensification) calls for new approaches to produce sufficient food with little environmental impact. Aimed at environment-friendly food production, organic farming may be a good candidate approach to meet the challenges of ecological intensification. Nitrogen (N) is a major constraint of crop yield in organic cropping systems due to restrictions of inorganic fertiliser input. LBCCs are capable to take up N from both the soil and the atmosphere (i. e., via biological N fixation (BNF)), and thus may act as an important source of N in crop rotations, enhancing crop yields but maybe also emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O, a potent greenhouse gas), in particular after soil incorporation of residues, which needs further evaluation. The main focus of this thesis was to investigate the effects of contrasting catch crops (i. e., legume-based vs. non-legume-based) on N 2 O emissions and N availability to succeeding organic spring barley. Therefore, a one-year field plot study was performed to monitor the N 2 O fluxes and to investigate the N supply as influenced by three LBCCs compared with two non-LBCCs and a bare fallow control on a loamy sand soil in Denmark. Catch crops may be harvested before winter for other purposes, e. g., used as winter fodder or in anaerobic digestion, which may emphasise the importance of <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> in N supply. Hence, the consequences on N supply and N 2 O emissions of autumn harvest of catch crops were also compared with incorporation of whole-plants by spring tillage in this study. Along with the field study, an in-situ 15 N labelling experiment in microplots was conducted to quantify the biological N fixation (BNF) in LBCCs and the recovery of the labelled residue N in spring barley with separate manipulation of top and <b>root</b> <b>residues.</b> Moreover, the period after residue incorporation is a “hot moment” for N 2 O emissions from the soil. In a laboratory incubation study, N 2 O evolution from simulated incorporation of catch crop residues was studied under controlled environment with addition of 15 N-enriched nitrate. By this way, the contributions of denitrification and nitrification to N 2 O fluxes were estimated, which is necessary to better understand the underlying processes of N 2 O emission and to develop specific mitigation strategies. Compared to non-LBCCs, LBCCs accumulated significantly more N, of which more than half was derived from BNF as shown by 15 N dilution. The higher amounts of N accumulation in LBCCs increased the yield of the following spring barley markedly, which was negatively affected by autumn harvest of catch crops. The macro-roots at 0 – 18 cm of the five catch crops tested accounted for 31 – 50...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of removing gutta-percha-based root fillings with ProTaper retreatment files (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) followed by F 1 and F 2 ProTaper instruments and to compare these results with those obtained with a # 25. 06 ProFile instrument (Dentsply Maillefer) followed by the Self- Adjusting File (SAF; ReDent, Ra'anana, Israel) using high resolution micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning. METHODS: Twenty-eight mandibular molar teeth with oval distal root canals were divided into 2 equal groups of 14 teeth each. The distal root canals were instrumented with ProTaper files up to an F 2 instrument, the roots were subsequently filled, and the root filling was allowed to set fully. Removal of the root canal filling was performed with D 1 -D 3 ProTaper retreatment files followed by F 1 and F 2 ProTaper instruments or with a # 25. 06 ProFile followed by SAFs. Chloroform was used in both groups to assist in the removal of the root filling material. High-resolution micro-CT scans were used to measure the residual quantities of the root filling material after completion of the procedures. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test and the Student t test. RESULTS: The median <b>root</b> filling <b>residue</b> in the ProTaper group was 5. 39...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{understanding}} of the relationship between carbon (C) chemistry and microbial community structure during decomposition of shoot and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> and how plant age affects this. In this study, residues of young wheat shoots and roots, mature wheat shoots and roots or a 1 : 1 mix of mature shoot + root (MSR) were added to sand inoculated with a diverse microbial community. Respiration was measured over 60 days. On days 0, 15, 30 and 60, total C and nitrogen were measured, residue C chemistry was determined by 13 C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and microbial community structure was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Cumulative respiration was least in young roots and did not differ among the other residue types. In MSR, decomposition was similar to that of shoots and roots alone; shoot material appeared to be preferentially decomposed. The decomposition rate of all residues combined was not related to C chemistry. However, mineralized C (Cmin) was negatively correlated with the percentage of (aryl + O-aryl) -C in mature but not in young residues. Mineralized C of roots was positively correlated with the percentage of (di-O-alkyl + O-alkyl) -C, whereas {{this was not the case}} for shoots. Microbial community structure was influenced by time, plant organ and plant age. There was no general relationship between microbial community structure and C chemistry of the residues. K.

40|$|Partitioning the root-derived CO 2 efflux {{from the}} soil into actual root {{respiration}} (RR) and microbial respiration of exudates and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> {{is very important for}} determining the carbon (C) and energy balance of soils. Studies based on artificial root environments like hydroponics or sterile soils give unrealistic figures for C partitioning and are unsuitable for predicting C flows under natural conditions. To date, only four methods have been suggested to separate RR and rhizomicrobial respiration in non-sterile soils: (1) the isotope dilution method, (2) the model rhizodeposition technique, (3) modeling of 14 CO 2 efflux dynamics, and (4) the exudate elution procedure. All four methods are based on the pulse labeling of shoots in a 14 CO 2 atmosphere and subsequent monitoring of 14 CO 2 efflux {{from the soil}}. However, the basic assumptions and principles of these methods, as well as the results observed in the original papers, all differ from one another. This study describes the separation of RR of Lolium perenne grown on a loamy Haplic Luvisol from microbial respiration of rhizodeposits by means of all four methods under the same experimental conditions. In spite of alternative principles, the isotope dilution and the 14 CO 2 dynamics methods show a similar level of RR: accordingly, 39 and 45 % of total root-derived CO 2 efflux were accounted for by RR. The remainder is rhizomicrobial respiration. The exudate elution method, which underestimates the total rhizodeposition, shows that at least 19 % of root-derived CO 2 is produced by exudate decomposition. The microbial respiration of rhizodeposits calculated using the model rhizodeposition technique is also underestimated. The exudate elutio...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{food web}} {{structure}} and function is primarily determined by the major basal resources, which are living plant tissue, root exudates and dead organic matter. A field experiment was performed to disentangle the interlinkage of the root-and detritus-based soil food chains. An arable site was cropped either with maize, amended with maize shoot litter or remained bare soil, representing food webs depending on roots, aboveground litter and soil organic matter as predominant resource, respectively. The soil micro-food web, i. e. microorganisms and nematodes, was investigated in two successive years along a depth transect. The community composition of nematodes was used as model to determine {{the changes in the}} rhizosphere, detritusphere and bulk soil food web. In the first growing season the impact of treatments on the soil micro-food web was minor. In the second year plant-feeding nematodes increased under maize, whereas after harvest the Channel Index assigned promotion of the detritivore food chain, reflecting decomposition of <b>root</b> <b>residues.</b> The amendment with litter did not foster microorganisms, instead biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria {{as well as that of}} fungi declined in the rooted zone. Likely higher grazing pressure by nematodes reduced microbial standing crop as bacterial and fungal feeders increased. However, populations at higher trophic levels were not promoted, indicating limited flux of litter resources along the food chain. After two years of bare soil microbial biomass and nematode density remained stable, pointing to soil organic matter-based resources that allow bridging periods with deprivation. Nematode communities were dominated by opportunistic taxa that are competitive at moderate resource supply. In sum, removal of plants from the system had less severe effects than expected, suggesting considerable food web resilience to the disruption of both the root and detrital carbon channel, pointing to a legacy of organic matter resources in arable soils...|$|R
