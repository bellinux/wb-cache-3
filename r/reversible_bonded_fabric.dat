To optimize the tensile strength the <b>reversible</b> <b>bonding</b> energy, or the polymer length must be increased to increase the degree of covalent or mechanical interlocking respectively. However, increase polymer length inhibits mobility and thereby impairs the ability for polymers to re-reversibly bond.

40|$|The {{response}} of associating polymers with oscillatory shear is studied through large-scale simulations. A hybrid molecular dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is employed. Polymer chains are modeled as a coarse-grained bead-spring system. Functionalized end groups, {{at both ends}} of the polymer chains, can form <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> according to MC rules. Stress-strain curves show nonlinearities indicated by a non-ellipsoidal shape. We consider two types of nonlinearities. Type I occurs at a strain amplitude much larger than one, type II at a frequency at which the elastic storage modulus dominates the viscous loss modulus. In this last case, the network topology resembles that of the system at rest. The <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> are broken and chains stretch when the system moves away from the zero-strain position. For type I, the chains relax and the number of <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> peaks when the system is near an extreme of the motion. During the movement to the other extreme of the cycle, first a stress overshoot occurs, then a yield accompanied by shear-banding. Finally, the network restructures. Interestingly, the system periodically restores bonds between the same associating groups. Even though major restructuring occurs, the system remembers previous network topologies...|$|R

40|$|Self-healing {{polymers}} crosslinked by solely <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> are intrinsically {{weaker than}} common covalently crosslinked networks. Introducing covalent crosslinks into a reversible network would improve mechanical strength. It is challenging, however, to apply this design concept to dry elastomers, largely because reversible crosslinks such as hydrogen bonds are often polar motifs, whereas covalent crosslinks are non-polar motifs, {{and these two}} types of bonds are intrinsically immiscible without co-solvents. Here we design and fabricate a hybrid polymer network by crosslinking randomly branched polymers carrying motifs that can form both <b>reversible</b> hydrogen <b>bonds</b> and permanent covalent crosslinks. The randomly branched polymer links such two types of bonds and forces them to mix on the molecular level without co-solvents. This allows us to create a hybrid dry elastomer that is very tough with a fracture energy $ 13, 500 J/m^ 2 $ comparable to that of natural rubber; moreover, the elastomer can self-heal at room temperature with a recovered tensile strength 4 MPa similar to that of existing self-healing elastomers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{process of}} making and {{breaking}} <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> between associating groups (stickers) controls the dynamics of associating polymers. We develop a theory of “sticky reptation ” to model the dynamics of entangled solutions of associating polymers with many stickers per chain. At {{a high degree of}} association, there are very few unassociated stickers. It is therefore very difficult for a sticker to find a new partner to associate with after breaking the bond with an old one. Typically a sticker returns to its old partner following an unsuccessful search for a new one, prolonging the effective lifetime of <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds.</b> In the sticky reptation model, the search for a new partner is restricted to a part of the tube confining the entangled chain. Another important effect is the increase of the fraction of the interchain associations {{at the expense of the}} intrachain ones with increasing polymer concentration. The sticky reptation model predicts a very strong concentration dependence of viscosity in good agreement with experiments. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{we study}} {{the association of}} flexible oligomers terminated by a donor and an acceptor group capable of orientationally specific <b>reversible</b> <b>bonding.</b> On the basis of simulation results, we have obtained equilibrium constants for chain growth and ring closure. These constants were employed in an analytical model, which reproduces the large-scale simulation results very well. We also propose an analytical approach {{which can be used}} to analyze experimental data or make predictions of molecular weight, chain/ring distributions, etc., which are hard to obtain experimentally. Our simulation and analytical results show that an increase of orientational specificity of <b>reversible</b> <b>bonding</b> decreases the degree of association and molecular weight and leads to the suppression of small rings. As a result the ring-chain crossover concentration (i. e., the concentration at which the number of <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> in chains and rings coincide) decreases and exhibits a maximum as a function of oligomer length N. With a decrease in the energy of reversible association or increase in temperature the ring-chain crossover shifts to lower concentrations and molecular weight either systematically decreases if the system is in the chain-dominated regime (high concentrations) or increases and exhibit a maximum if the system is in ring-dominated regime (low concentrations). Higher orientational specificity of association in combination with a short spacer length ensures a larger value of the molecular weight at its maximum which is reached at lower temperatures and higher oligomer concentrations. These results are supported by recent experimental observations and can be explained based on the oligomer redistribution between chains and rings near the ring-chain crossover. 1...|$|R

40|$|The only defined {{physiological}} role {{of boron}} in plants is as a cross-linking molecule involving <b>reversible</b> covalent <b>bonds</b> with cis-diols {{on either side}} of borate. Boronic acids, which form the same <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds</b> with cis-diols but cannot cross-link two molecules, were used to selectively disrupt boron function in plants. In cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv BY- 2) cells, addition of boronic acids caused the disruption of cytoplasmic strands and cell-to-cell wall detachment. The effect of the boronic acids could be relieved by the addition of boron-complexing sugars and was proportional to the boronic acid-binding strength of the sugar. Experiments with germinating petunia (Petunia hybrida) pollen and boronate-affinity chromatography showed that boronic acids and boron compete for the same binding sites. The boronic acids appear to specifically disrupt or prevent borate-dependent cross-links important for the structural integrity of the cell, including the organization of transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands. Boron likely plays a structural role in the plant cytoskeleton.

40|$|We present hybrid {{molecular}} dynamics/Monte Carlo {{simulations of}} supramolecular networks formed by unentangled telechelic chains with sticky end monomers (or stickers) of finite functionality. The <b>reversible</b> <b>bonding</b> between sticky monomers {{leads to the}} formation of sticker clusters with well-defined size distribution, which in turn work as cross-links for transient polymer networks. We study the kinetics of sticky monomer association, the topological structure and the resulting dynamic and rheological behavior of the supramolecular systems {{as a function of the}} sticker bonding energy ε and the parent polymer chain length. Percolated transient networks are formed above a threshold bonding energy around 4. 3 k_B T. At high bonding energies ε≥ 10 k_B T, the majority of the stickers are fully reacted and the fraction of open stickers is less than 1 %. The conventional picture of a single sticker hopping from one cluster to another is energetically unfavorable. We find the dynamic and rheological behavior of such strongly associated supramolecular networks are dominated by a partner exchange mechanism in which the stickers exchange their associated partners, and so release the imposed topological constraints, through the association and disassociation of sticker clusters. The characteristic time of the partner exchange events grows exponentially with the bonding energy and is up to 2 orders of magnitude longer than the average lifetime of the <b>reversible</b> <b>bonds.</b> As a result, three relaxation regimes can be clearly identified in the stress and chain end-to-end vector relaxation functions as well as the mean-squared displacements of the stickers, which are the initial Rouse regime, the intermediate rubbery regime and the terminal relaxation regime.
