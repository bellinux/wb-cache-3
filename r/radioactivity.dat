5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of <b>radioactivity</b> in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of <b>radioactivity.</b> The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of <b>radioactivity</b> excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's <b>radioactivity</b> was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of <b>radioactivity.</b> Public interest in <b>radioactivity</b> had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E

The characteristics of possible disturbances in dense molecular clouds which can initiate the formation of cloud cores is discussed, with emphasis on these disturbances able to generate fresh <b>radioactivities.</b> A one-solar mass red giant star on the asymptotic giant branch appears to have been the best candidate to account for the short-lived extinct <b>radioactivities</b> in the early solar system...|$|R
40|$|Meteorite {{studies have}} {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} short-lived <b>radioactivities</b> in the early solar system. The current data suggests that the origin of {{at least some of}} the <b>radioactivities</b> requires contribution from recent nucleosynthesis at a stellar site. This sets a strict time limit on the time available for the formation of the solar system and argues for the theory of the triggered origin of the solar system. According to this scenario, the formation of our planetary system was initiated by the impact of an interstellar shock wave on a molecular cloud core. The shock wave originated from a nearby explosive stellar event and carried with it <b>radioactivities</b> produced in the stellar source. In addition to triggering the collapse of the molecular cloud core, the shock wave also deposited some of the freshly synthesized <b>radioactivities</b> into the collapsing system. The <b>radioactivities</b> were then incorporated into the first solar system solids, in this manner leaving a record of the event in the meteoritic material. The viability of the scenario can be investigated through numerical simulations studying the processes involved in mixing shock wave material into the collapsing system. The high-resolution calculation...|$|R
5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's <b>radioactivity</b> was widely acknowledged during {{the first decades of}} the 20th century. In the second half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns over its <b>radioactivity.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} details two {{experiments that}} together establish {{the legitimacy of}} a compartmental model which describes the cerebral uptake and metabolism of radiolabelled L-dopa in vivo. First, tissue <b>radioactivities</b> calculated with the model were compared with corresponding <b>radioactivities</b> measured previously by chromatographic fractionation of 18 F-labelled metabolites in striatal tissue extracts from rats given intravenous injections of L- 6 -[18 F]fluorodopa. Second, kinetic constants estimated by model fitting to measured <b>radioactivities</b> from combined metabolite pools in a time-series of static autoradiograms from right cerebral hemispheres of rats administered [3 H]dopa, were compared to corresponding previously published estimates based on analyses of measured <b>radioactivities</b> from individual metabolite pools separated by chromatographic fractionation of 3 H-labelled metabolites in the left cerebral hemispheres of the same rats. These comparisons confirmed quantitatively the biological accuracy of the model, thus validating the compartmental modelling of autoradiographic data for investigations of the kinetic behaviour of radiolabelled L-dopa in living brain...|$|R
40|$|We {{discovered}} that the abundances of now extinct <b>radioactivities</b> (relative to stable reference isotopes) in meteorites vary {{as a function of}} their mean lifetimes squared. This relationship applies to chondrites, achondrites, and irons but to calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs). Certain meteorites contain excesses in isotopic abundances from the decay of radioactive isotopes with half-lives much less than the age of the solar system. These short-lived <b>radioactivities</b> are now extinct, but they were alive when meteorites assembled in the early solar system. The origin of these <b>radioactivities</b> and the processes which control their abundances in the solar nebula are still not well understood. Some clues may come from our finding that the meteoritic abundances of now extinct <b>radioactivities</b> (relative to stable reference isotopes) vary as a function of their mean lifetimes squared. This relationship applies to chondrites, achondrites, and irons, but not to CAIs. This points to at least two different processes establishing the abundances of short-lived isotopes found in the meteoritic record...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's <b>radioactivity</b> declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its <b>radioactivity,</b> the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, {{but this was not}} the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their <b>radioactivity,</b> with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E
