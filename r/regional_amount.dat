40|$|Natural {{archives}} of oxygen isotopes in precipitation {{may be used}} to study changes in the hydrological cycle in the tropics, but their interpretation is not straightforward. We studied to which degree tree rings of Mimosa acantholoba from southern Mexico record variation in isotopic composition of precipitation and which climatic processes influence oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ 18 Otr). Interannual variation in δ 18 Otr was highly synchronized between trees and closely related to isotopic composition of rain measured at San Salvador, 710 km to the southwest. Correlations with δ 13 C, growth, or local climate variables (temperature, cloud cover, vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) were relatively low, indicating weak plant physiological influences. Interannual variation in δ 18 Otr correlated negatively with local rainfall amount and intensity. Correlations with the amount of precipitation extended along a 1000 km long stretch of the Pacific Central American coast, probably as a result of organized storm systems uniformly affecting rainfall in the region and its isotope signal; episodic heavy precipitation events, of which some are related to cyclones, deposit strongly 18 O-depleted rain in the region and seem to have affected the δ 18 Otr signal. Large-scale controls on the isotope signature include variation in sea surface temperatures of tropical north Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. In conclusion, we show that δ 18 Otr of M. acantholoba {{can be used as a}} proxy for source water δ 18 O and that interannual variation in δ 18 Oprec is caused by a <b>regional</b> <b>amount</b> effect. This contrasts with δ 18 O signatures at continental sites where cumulative rainout processes dominate and thus provide a proxy for precipitation integrated over a much larger scale. Our results confirm that processes influencing climate-isotope relations differ between sites located, e. g., in the western Amazon versus coastal Mexico, and that tree ring isotope records can help in disentangling the processes influencing precipitation δ 18 O.

The obstruction of coronary arteries results in significant loss of myocardium, called acute myocardial infarction, {{and the number}} one cause of death globally. Hence, quantification of the <b>regional</b> <b>amount</b> of heart muscle subtended by obstructed coronary arteries is of critical value in clinical medicine. However, the conventional methods are inaccurate and frequently disagree with clinical practices. This study proposes a novel algorithm to segment regional myocardium-at-risk subtended by any potentially obstructed coronary artery. Assuming the geometric triangular mesh models of coronary artery and myocardium derived from an individual cardiac computed tomography image, the proposed algorithm performs (i) computation of the medial axis of the coronary artery and (ii) segmentation of the coronary artery and myocardium using the medial axis. The algorithm provides the fused segmentation of coronary artery and myocardium via the medial axis. The computed result provides a robust mathematical linkage between myocardium-at-risk and supplying coronary arteries so that ischemic myocardial regions can be accurately identified, and both the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia can be quantified effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, the correspondence between segmented coronary artery and myocardium can be more importantly used for building optimization models of cardiac systems for various applications. We believe that the proposed algorithm and implemented VoroHeart program, which is freely available at [URL] will be an invaluable tool for patient-specific risk predictions and the treatment of obstructed coronary artery disease in clinical medicine. The algorithmic accuracy and efficiency are theoretically asserted and experimentally verified. Comment: 36 pages, 18 figures, submitted to Journal of Information Fusio...|$|E

BACKGROUNDThe systolic myocardial velocity (Sm) and early diastolic myocardial velocity (Em) acquired by TD are promising new indexes of left ventricular function. However, their structural and functional correlates in humans are still unknown. METHODSTen patients with coronary artery disease underwent echocardiographic examination including TD imaging, along with transmural endomyocardial biopsy {{at the time of}} coronary bypass surgery (two biopsies per patient for a total of 20 specimens). The specimens were analyzed for percent interstitial fibrosis and beta-adrenergic receptor density. RESULTSNormal segments (n = 8) had a higher beta-adrenoceptor density (2, 280 ± 738 vs. 1, 373 ± 460, p = 0. 03) and a lower amount of interstitial fibrosis (13 ± 3. 3 % vs. 28 ± 11. 5 %, p = 0. 002) than dysfunctional segments (n = 12). Myocardial systolic velocity and Em were also significantly higher (9. 5 ± 2. 7 vs. 5. 9 ± 1. 8 cm/s, p = 0. 025 and 11. 3 ± 2. 8 vs. 6. 4 ± 2. 1 cm/s, p = 0. 002, respectively) in normal segments. A significant relationship was present between Em and the beta-adrenergic receptor density (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and percent interstitial fibrosis (r = − 0. 7, p = 0. 0026), which together accounted for 81 % of the variance observed in Em.

40|$|Background: The Tau PET ligand 18 F-AV 1451 {{has been}} shown to {{reliably}} detect paired helical filaments of tau in Alzheimer's disease, but it is not yet known whether it binds to the tau aggregates present in patients with mutations in the gene (MAPT) coding for the tau protein. Further, no study has yet compared the cerebral retention of 18 F -AV 1451 with the tau aggregates revealed using neuropathology. Methods: Three patients from a Swedish family carrying the R 406 W mutation of MAPT were assessed with cognitive tests and subjects underwent 18 F-AV 1451 and 18 F-Flutemetamol PET scans. Further one of younger subjects also underwent an 18 F-FDG PET scan. The oldest subject died two weeks after the scan and the brain was processed for neuropathology. Tau immunohistochemistry was performed on brain sections from affected and unaffected brain regions. Results: Two mutation carriers, aged 56 and 60 years, had disease durations of 5 - 10 years and still only exhibited mild-moderate episodic memory impairment and no clear behavioural deficits. The MRI revealed only slight cortical atrophy and 18 F-AV 1451 PET imaging showed uptake in the hippocampus and the temporal lobes, especially in the inferior and anterior parts (Fig 1 A, B). The uptake of 18 F - AV 1451 correlated well with hypometabolism revealed with FGD PET in one of the subjects. The third case, 76 years, had a disease duration of ≥ 20 years and exhibited clear cognitive impairment, behavioural disturbances, mutism and dysphagia. The CT scan showed generalised cortical atrophy with a pronounced temporal lobe atrophy and 18 F -AV 1451 PET imaging revealed uptake in the temporal and frontal lobes, {{as well as in the}} basal ganglia (Fig 1 C). The regional uptake of 18 F -AV 1451 correlated strongly with the tau aggregates revealed using immunohistochemistry (R 2 = 0. 80, P < 0. 01; Fig 2). All cases exhibited negative amyloid (18 F -flutemetamol) PET scans. Conclusions: The in vivo uptake of 18 F-AV 1451 reflects the <b>regional</b> <b>amount</b> of tau aggregates revealed by neuropathological examination.

40|$|In {{regional}} planning literature {{it is often}} argued that regional deconcentration process and urban sprawl tend {{to increase the amount}} and distance of commuting (Vandersmissen et al. 2003). Supported by improved traffic infrastructure and falling transport costs the spatial division of labour and housing location extends the travel-to-work areas and allows to compensate for locational disadvantages of local labour markets (Moss et al. 2004). On the other hand, the contrary hypothesis is postulated, too. Since both working and living places are deconcentrating shorter commuting distances may happen because centre-orientated connections are substituted by intra-peripheral commuting patterns (Gordon; Richardson 1991 : 419). The intention of the paper is to analyse the influence of spatial structure on commuting behaviour of employees: e. g. does commuting behaviour differ between type of regions and what are the reasons for these differences? There are several ways how the locational conditions of the living area may influence the commuting behaviour. Firstly, the more jobs are available, the less is c. p. the necessity for long-distance commuting. Thus, the lower the regional density of jobs the more frequent and longer commuting should be expected. In addition, the variety of local jobs should have an influence on the commuting behaviour. As in rural regions less varied jobs are available, there should be a pressure on the local residents to increase their job opportunities by extending their commuting distance. However, apart from regional influences, individual characteristics may effect commuting behaviour, too. For example, highly qualified employees are expected to commute to longer distances since they could be more interested in realizing their investment in human capital. Conversely, long-distance commuting should be c. p. less attractive for part-time employees because of the less favourable relation between work and commuting time. The empirical analysis consists of two parts: Firstly, regional differences in commuting behaviour are analyzed. The focus of investigation lies on regions and the relationship between the regional characteristics of living places and the <b>regional</b> <b>amount</b> of commuting. The second part includes individual influences. As they can only observed at the level of individuals, the focus of investigation changes from regions to individuals: In addition to regional effects the commuting behaviour of individuals is explained by individual characteristics such as education or occupation. The data base is given by the social security statistics. It covers all employees in the social security system and contains information about each individual. As data on both the living and the working places are available, the statistics allows a much greater regional differentiation than the frequently used surveys. The other information relate to some personal characteristics (like sex or education) {{as well as to the}} occupation such as full-/part-time or the sector of employment. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dead wood {{patterns}} and dynamics vary with biophysical factors, disturbance history, owner-ship, and management practices; {{the relative importance}} of these factors is poorly understood, especially at landscape to regional scales. This study examined current dead wood amounts in the Coastal Province of Oregon, USA, at multiple spatial scales. Objectives were to: (1) describe current <b>regional</b> <b>amounts</b> of several characteristics of dead wood; (2) compare dead wood amounts across ownerships; (3) determine the relative importance, according to spatial scale, of biophysical and ownership characteristics, to regional dead wood abundance. Dead wood plot data were evaluated with respect to explanatory variables at four spatial scales of resolution: plots, subwatersheds, watersheds and subbasins. The relationships of dead wood characteristics with biophysical attributes and ownership were diverse and scale-specific. Region-wide dead wood abundance and types varied among ownerships, with public lands typically having higher amounts of dead wood and more large dead wood than private lands. Regression analysis of total dead wood volume indicated that ownership was important at the subbasin scale. Growing season moisture stress was important at plot, subwatershed, and watershed scales. Topography was important at the two coarser scales. Multivariate analysis of dead wood gradients showed that ownership was important at all scales, topography at the subbasin scale, historical vegetation at watershed and subbasin scales, and current vegetation at plot and subwatershed scales. Management for dead wood and related biodiversity at watershed to landscape scales should consider the distinct dynamics of snags and logs, the importance of historical effects, and the relevance of ownership patterns...|$|R

Daily rainfall δ^(18) O values range from + 0. 7 ‰ to − 18. 5 ‰ and exhibit a weak but significant inverse relationship with daily local precipitation amount (R=− 0. 19, p< 0. 05), consistent with the tropical amount effect. Day-to-day δ^(18) O variability at Mulu is best correlated to <b>regional</b> precipitation <b>amount</b> averaged over the preceding week (R=− 0. 64, p< 0. 01). The inverse {{relationship between}} Mulu rainfall δ^(18) O and local (<b>regional)</b> precipitation <b>amount</b> increases with increased temporal averaging, reaching R=− 0. 56 (R=− 0. 72) on monthly timescales. Large, negative, multi-day rainfall δ^(18) O anomalies of up to 16 ‰ occur every 30 – 90 days and are closely associated with wet phases of the intraseasonal Madden–Julian Oscillation. A weak, semi-annual seasonal cycle in rainfall δ^(18) O of 2 – 3 ‰ bears little resemblance to seasonal precipitation variability, pointing to a complex sequence of moisture sources and/or trajectories over the course of the year. Interannual rainfall δ^(18) O variations of 6 – 8 ‰ are significantly correlated with indices of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, with increased rainfall δ^(18) O during relatively dry El Niño conditions, and vice versa during La Nina events. We find that Mulu rainfall δ^(18) O outperforms Mulu precipitation amount as a tracer of basin-scale climate variability, highlighting the time- and space-integrative nature of rainfall δ^(18) O. Taken together, our results suggest that rainfall δ^(18) O variability at Mulu is significantly influenced by the strength of regional convective activity. As such, our study provides further empirical support for the interpretation of δ^(18) O-based paleo-reconstructions from northern Borneo stalagmites as robust indicators of regional-scale hydroclimate variability, where higher δ^(18) O reflects regional drying...|$|R

Ro was also estimated by fitting time-activity curves (4 - 30 min) of plasma and whole liver to the nonlinear model using the nonlinear regression method. Ro obtained from the receptor image was compared with that from curve fitting in relation to the results of hepatic function tests (indocyanine green test, hepaplastin test, and branched-chain amino acids/tyrosine plasma concentration ratio) and Child's classification. Results: Ros from the 2 methods showed a significant linear correlation (r 2 = 0. 938; P < 0. 0001; slope = 0. 90; y-intercept = 1. 5).

The results show that blocking formations in the Atlantic region are sensitive to the phase of the NAO. Sixty-seven percent more winter blocking days are observed during the negative phase compared to the positive phase of the NAO. The average length of blocking during the negative phase is about 11 days, which is nearly twice as long as the 6 -day length observed during the positive phase of the NAO. The NAO-related differences in blocking frequency and persistence are associated with changes in the distribution of the surface air temperature anomaly, which, to a large extent, is determined by the phase of the NAO. The distribution of <b>regional</b> cloud <b>amount</b> is also sensitive to the phase of the NAO. For the negative phase, the cloud amounts are significant, positive anomalies in the convective zone in the Tropics and much less cloudiness in the mid latitudes. But for the positive phase of the NAO, the cloud amount is much higher in the mid-latitude storm track region. In the whole Atlantic region, the cloud amount shows a decrease with the increase of surface air temperature. These results suggest {{that there may be a}} negative feedback between the cloud amount and the surface air temperature in the Atlantic region.

40|$|Problem statement: Making {{iron ore}} {{is one of}} the largest mining {{projects}} in south east of china. Due to the development of mining activities in that site, it has become necessary to increase the depth of exploration. Increase the exploration depth makes the mining tunnels subjected to the karst water inrush. Approach: A hydrological and a hydrogeological model for the Makeng area have been developed, which yield information on relevant parameters such as groundwater recharge and margins lateral inflow, to estimate aquifer yield. USGS flow code, MODFLOW 2000, was used to produce the numerical model. Collected GIS based information was synthesized in a finite difference numerical model. The regional steady and transient-state flow was calibrated under pre-development conditions assuming an equivalent porous medium approach. Results: Water budget calculations show that the total groundwater flow in <b>regional</b> aquifers <b>amounts</b> to 2. 98 mm 3 year - 1. Infiltration from precipitation provides 61. 7 % of the groundwater supply, while 21 % comes from lateral inflow and the remaining 17. 3 % is induced recharge from surface waters. Discharge from regional aquifers occurs through springs outflow 88. 5 % and flow to streams 11. 5 %. Conclusion/Recommendations: Although the karstic nature of the limestone aquifer the equivalent porous-medium flow model is appropriate to represent hydraulic heads and recharge/discharge relationships on a regional scale. The results of this study can be used to predict the required amounts of pumping and the possible locations to dewater the groundwater around the mining tunnels...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the main meteorological drivers of rainfall isotopic variation in north Australia in order to improve the interpretation of isotopic proxy records in this region. An intense monitoring program was conducted during two monsoonal events that showed significant and systematic isotopic change over time. The results showed a close link between isotopic variation in precipitation and variability in monsoon conditions, associated with the presence of large convective envelopes propagating through the study site. The largest negative amplitudes in the isotopic signal were observed when eastward and westward moving precipitation systems within the convective envelope merged over the measurement site. This suggests that the amplitude of the isotopic signal is related to the size and activity of the convective envelope. The strong correlation between rainfall isotopic variation, regional outgoing longwave radiation and <b>regional</b> rainfall <b>amount</b> supports this conclusion. This is further strengthened by the strong relationship between isotopic variation and the integrated rainfall history of air masses prior to arriving at the measurement locations. A local amount effect was not significant and these findings support the interpretation of δ¹⁸O as proxy for regional climatic conditions rather than local rainfall amount. Meteorological parameters that characterize intra-seasonal variability of monsoon conditions were also found to be strongly linked to inter-seasonal variability of the monthly based δ¹⁸O values in the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) database. This leads to the conclusion that information about the Australian monsoon variability can likely be inferred from the isotopic proxy record in North Australia on short (intra seasonal) and long (inter seasonal or longer) timescales...|$|R
30|$|In {{the urban}} form, walking, cycling and public {{transport}} package, {{the costs are}} estimated to be 510 [*]M€ annually. This cost is in addition to the current infrastructure and public transport operation costs of the national and <b>regional</b> governments. The <b>amount</b> is about 50 % of the current annual public transport funding by the national and regional governments in Finland [14] and would allow increasing the service level of public transport, infrastructure projects and mobility management activities. This package induces also significant health benefits due to direct health benefits of increased walking and cycling, estimated at 0.27 €/pkm for walking and 0.11 €/pkm for cycling. These values are based on Litman [26] and give a rather moderate value of health benefits compared to some estimations using the Health Economic Assessment Tool, see, e.g. Fishman et al. [12]. Health benefits of reduced car transport are estimated at 0.002 €/pkm. The calculation is based on the emission costs of cars estimated by Gynther et al. [16] and passenger kilometres travelled by cars as reported by FTA [14].|$|R

Environmentally friendly lifestyle doesn’t mean that we are using only natural products, but attention is pointed to the manufacturing and production process also. The rapid development of recycled and biodegradable products causes expanding usage of hemp fibers both in household and technical textiles. The analysis of hemp cultivation and usage trends in the world and Europe shows that hemp cultivation and processing in Latvia has good perspectives. Product quality is influenced by raw materials. In this case it is hemp fiber descriptive characteristics. Hemp fibers are natural fibers and their properties varies according to plant growing <b>regional</b> climatic conditions, <b>amount</b> of manure, plant density, harvesting time and pre-treatment technological processes. There are studied the influence of above mentioned factors on chemical composition, geometrical and physical properties of the Latvian hemp fiber both local and foreign cultivars.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the age-related variations of brain perfusion through quantitative cerebral perfusion computed tomography (CT) results in children without brain abnormality. METHODS: Brain perfusion CT examinations were performed in 77 children, aged 7 days to 18 years. These patients were admitted at our institution for both noncontrast and contrast-enhanced cerebral CT. Only children whose conventional cerebral CT and clinical/radiologic follow-up, including additional investigations, were normal were taken into account for this study (53 of 77). RESULTS: The average <b>regional</b> rCBF <b>amounts</b> to 40 (mL/ 100 g per minute) for the first 6 months of life, peaks at approximately 130 (mL/ 100 g per minute) at approximately 2 to 4 years of age, and finally stabilizes at approximately 50 (mL/ 100 g per minute) at approximately 7 to 8 years of age, with a small increase of rCBF values at approximately 12 years of age. The rCBF in the gray matter averages 3 times that in the white matter, except for the first 6 months of life. The global CBF represents 10 % to 20 % of the global cardiac output for the first 6 months of life, peaks at approximately 55 % by 2 to 4 years of age, and finally stabilizes at approximately 15 % by 7 to 8 years of age. Specific age-related evolution patterns were identified in the different anatomic areas of the cerebral parenchyma, which could be related to the development of neuroanatomic structures and to the emergence of corresponding cognitive functions. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative perfusion CT characterization of brain perfusion shows specific age variations. Brain perfusion of each cortical area evolves according to a specific time course, in close correlation with the psychomotor development...|$|R

Objective: To present {{body fat}} {{patterning}} reference standards to identify {{children with a}} predominant distribution of body fat in the abdominal or truncal region of the body. Design: Cross-sectional study in {{a representative sample of}} Spanish adolescents aged 13 - 18 years. Subjects: A total of 2160 adolescents with a complete set of anthropometric measurements (1109 males and 1051 females). Measurements: Weight, height, body mass index, skinfold thickness (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh, calf) and waist and hip circumferences. Results: In the majority of the age groups, subscapular/triceps skinfolds ratio, trunk-to-total skinfolds percent (TTS%) and waist circumference values were significantly higher in males than in females; hip circumference was higher in females than in males, except at 15. 5 years. In males, age showed a significant effect for all the body fat distribution indices; however, in females, the effect was only significant for triceps skinfold, waist and hip circumferences and waist-to-hip ratio. Smoothed age- and sex-specific triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, subscapular/triceps skinfolds ratio, TTS%, waist circumference and hip circumference, waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratio percentile values for male and female adolescents have been established. Conclusion: These reference data for waist circumference and the other fat patterning indices, together with data from other countries, will help to establish international central obesity criteria for adolescents. The presented percentile values will give the possibility to estimate the proportion of adolescents with high or low <b>regional</b> adiposity <b>amounts.</b> © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.
