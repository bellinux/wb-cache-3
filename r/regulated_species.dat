40|$|The latest Green Paper on the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) {{identified}} {{the high level}} of discards in Europe as one of the structural weaknesses of the current CFP. The new CFP introduces a discard ban in European waters, with an obligation to land all <b>regulated</b> <b>species.</b> The fishing management system in the Mediterranean is based on effort control and technical measures, and this is raising some particular concerns about the effective implementation of the discard ban. With the exception of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, Scombridae), there are no quotas in the Mediterranean and this regulation affects all <b>regulated</b> <b>species</b> with the minimum landing size. Under these circumstances, the discard ban may lead to an increase in the amount of juvenile fish caught, because such catches are not counted against a given quota, {{as is the case in}} the Atlantic fisheries, and thus, there is no incentive to avoid catching them. On the contrary, the obligation to land the juveniles that are now discarded and their subsequent fishmeal processing might even become commercially interesting. One possible consequence of the new regulation may be an increase in the illegal marketing of fish below the minimum size. The landing, storage and transportation of juveniles will all be legal, and this may simplify their commercialization via the black market.

40|$|Discarding, or {{returning}} {{unwanted catch}} to the sea, {{is a common}} feature of European fisheries, and is widely acknowledged as morally wrong. It wastes food and economic resources, and has contributed to overfishing in EU stocks. However, under the current Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), catch that is below minimum landings sizes, exceeds quota, or does not match catch composition regulations must be discarded. The high profile of discarding {{in recent years has}} put pressure on the European Commission (EC) to reform the CFP. A key objective is to eliminate discards and reduce unwanted catches. A discard ban and catch quotas for <b>regulated</b> <b>species</b> will be implemented. The EC argues that this will create strong incentives for more selective fishing, but little supporting evidence from EC fisheries is available. This thesis aims to present such evidence. A desk based analysis of a number of global fisheries found that a discard ban in isolation created little or no incentive to avoid unwanted catches; supporting measures were required to encourage more selective fishing practices. Analysis of the potential impact of introducing a discard ban on English North Sea otter trawlers supported this finding. Models using economic, logbook and observer data showed that the cost of capturing unwanted catch is minimal unless a cap is placed on total catches. Catch quotas cap fishing mortality, creating a strong incentive to reduce catches of limiting species. This incentive is unequally distributed between and within fleets, and is strongest for the least selective vessels. If catch compositions are not adjusted to match available quota, substantial reductions in revenue could occur. So under the reformed CFP discards of <b>regulated</b> <b>species</b> could be eliminated, the cost of catching unwanted fish will be passed onto the fishers, and strong incentives for more selective fishing practices will be generated...|$|E
40|$|Large scale {{precipitation}} {{of calcium}} carbonate {{in the oceans}} by coccolithophorids is a phenomenon that {{plays an important role}} in atmospheric CO 2 trapping. However, recent experiments revealed that the associated fluxes may be slow down by an increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration. In this paper we design models to account for the decrease in calcification and photosynthesis rates observed after an increase of pCO 2 in Emiliania huxleyi chemostat cultures. Since the involved mechanisms are still not completely understood, we consider various models, each of them being based on a different hypothesis. These models are kept at a very general level, by maintaining the growth and calcification functions in a generic form, i. e. independent on the exact shape of these functions and on parameter values. The analysis is thus performed using these generic functions where the only hypothesis is an increase of these rates with respect to the <b>regulating</b> carbon <b>species.</b> As a result, each model responds differently to a pCO 2 elevation. Surprisingly, the only models whose behaviour is in agreement with the experimental results correspond to carbonate as the <b>regulating</b> <b>species</b> for photosynthesis.

40|$|The new Common Fisheries Policy aims {{to reduce}} the discard rate in Europe, and {{one way in which}} it seeks to achieve this goal is by making it {{compulsory}} to land all species subject to catch limits, and some of species managed by minimum catch size. The characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns over the viability, efficacy and consequences of these measures, and {{the purpose of this study}} is therefore to analyse these with a view to improving discard management in this region. The Port of Santa Pola was chosen as a reference fishing port in the Spanish Mediterranean for quantitative analysis, comparing all the species caught with those proposed by the CFP. Additionally, a qualitative SWOT analysis was performed, incorporating the views of fishermen, administrators, NGOs, scientists and entrepreneurs on the regulation. The daily discard rate during the period analysed was 11. 7 t (All Species) and 1. 8 t (<b>Regulated</b> <b>Species),</b> with annual discards totalling 2623 t (47. 3 %) (All Species) and 421 t (7. 6 %) (<b>Regulated</b> <b>Species).</b> The regulation was found to have more weaknesses and threats (72. 6 %) than strengths and opportunities (27. 4 %). The governing system should take into consideration the contextualisation of discard management according to the specific characteristics of each métier; coordination between stakeholders; and caution about the ecological cost of landing discards. The high logistical, surveillance, monitoring and ecological costs produce a negative outcome despite the objective pursued, the willingness of the fishing industry to reduce discards and the profitable use of the resource by its proposed end users. This may lead to the measure proving unviable in the Mediterranean Sea and its ensuing failure to reduce discards.

The amount of nitrous oxide formed depends primarily on the process temperature, the amount of chemical injected, the initial NOx level, and the carbon monoxide level in the gas stream.

40|$|Question: Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed that control the spatio-temporal pattern of species coexistence. Among others, the species pool hypothesis states that the large-scale species pool {{is an important factor}} in controlling small-scale species richness through filtering of species that can persist within a species assemblage on the basis of their tolerance of the abiotic environment. Because of the process of environmental filtering, co-occurring species that experience similar environmental conditions are likely to be more taxonomically similar than ecologically distant species. This is because, due to the conservatism of many species traits during evolutionary diversification, the ability of species to colonize the same ecological space is thought to depend at least partially on their taxonomic similarity. The question for this study is: Under the assumption of trait conservatism, does environmental filtering lead to nonrandom species assemblages with respect to their taxonomic structure? Methods: The significance of taxonomic filtering in <b>regulating</b> <b>species</b> coexistence is tested using data from 15 local species assemblages from the urban flora of Rome (Italy). To find out whether the taxonomic structure of the selected 'local' species assemblages was significantly different from random, we used a Monte Carlo simulation in which for each local species assemblage, the actual taxonomic diversity was compared to the taxonomic diversity of 1000 virtual species lists of the same size extracted at random from a larger 'regional' species pool. Results: We found that in most cases the local species assemblages have a higher degree of taxonomic similarity than would be expected by chance showing a phenomenon of 'species condensation' in a small number of higher-level taxa. Conclusions: Our observations support the species pool hypothesis and imply that environmental filtering is an important mechanism in shaping the taxonomic structure of species assemblages. Therefore, the incorporation of taxonomic diversity into landscape and community ecology may be beneficial for a better understanding of the processes that <b>regulate</b> <b>species</b> coexistence...|$|R
