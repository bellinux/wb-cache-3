30|$|A quality {{attribute}} {{is a key}} aspect (or property) {{of the system that}} is used by its stakeholders to judge its operation, rather than specific functional behaviors (Bass 2003). Quality attribute properties are typically quantified by quality metrics. Systems often fail to meet stakeholders needs regarding these attributes when they focus on some aspects without considering the impact on others. For instance, when system adaptation is required, selecting the configuration that minimizes the reconfiguration time might not be the best candidate regarding the overall quality of service (QoS). Furthermore, the overall QoS is defined based on a combination of conflicting runtime properties (e.g., response time, accuracy, availability, security). For example, replicating communication and computation to achieve availability, or including a shadow <b>removal</b> <b>component</b> to achieve high accuracy for event recognition, might conflict with performance requirements (e.g., low response time) or resource restrictions (e.g., maximum memory consumption). Stakeholders (i.e., users) generally find it difficult to quantify their preferences in such conflicting situations.|$|E

By using experience gained from designing and running a micro-sized aquaponics system in the Fall of 2012, a scale up was necessary to provide a platform for further experimentation. By using engineering principles such as head loss, pumping and structural analysis using finite element analysis, a larger system based off of the work completed by Dr. Rakocy at the University of the Virgin Islands was designed and constructed at the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies at California Polytechnic University of Pomona.

The goal of the Question Answering Track is to provide short, succinct answers to English sentences posed by users. In answering definition questions, we are asked to retrieve new and relevant information, {{in the form of}} short sentences or fragments from newswire text. Because many news articles overlap in content, we need to employ a duplicate removal method before presenting the results to the users. Here we present two different approaches to duplicate removal. Our first approach uses the BLEU score, a commonly used metric for machine translation evaluation, as the similarity metric between sentences. Our second approach takes a list of candidate answers, and clusters answers using word-level edit-distance as the similarity metric; the best answer from each cluster is chosen as the representative. In this paper we compare these two approaches and determine their relative performances in the duplicate detection task. 2.

40|$|The Integrated Film Activated Sludge Process (IFAS) was {{developed}} {{to reduce the cost}} of additional facilities required to complete year round nitrification in the design of new or retrofit wastewater treatment plants. The purpose of this project was to develop a computer-based mechanistic model, called IFAS, which {{can be used as a}} tool by scientists and engineers to optimize their designs and to troubleshoot a full-scale treatment plant. The program also can be employed to assist researchers conducting their studies of IFAS wastewater treatment processes. IFAS enables the steady-state simulation of nitrification-denitrification processes as well as carbonaceous removal in systems utilizing integrated media, but this current version supports only sponge type media. The IFAS program {{was developed}} by incorporating empirical equations for integrated biofilm carbonaceous uptake and nitrification developed by Sen and Randall (1995) into the general activated sludge model, developed by the International Association on Water Quality (IAWQ, previously known as IAWRC), plus the biological phosphorus removal model of Wentzel et al (1989). The calibration and evaluation of the IFAS model was performed using existing data from both an IFAS system and a conventional activated sludge bench-scale plant operated over a wide range of Aerobic Mean Cell Residence Times (Aerobic MCRT's). The model developed provides a good fit and a reasonable prediction of the experimental data for both the IFAS and the conventional pilot-scale systems.

In this frame the Integral Circulation Experiment (ICE) test section has been installed into the CIRCE pool facility, and suitable experiments have been carried out aiming to deeply investigate the pool thermal-hydraulic behavior of a HLM cooled pool reactor. In particular a fuel pin bundle simulator (FPS) has been installed in the CIRCE pool.

In this frame, the NACIE-UP loop has been designed to perform mixed convection experiment with LBE. A 19 -pin wire-spaced Fuel Pin bundle Simulator (FPS) is installed to measure clad temperature and heat transfer coefficients in different conditions in the different ranks of sub-channels of the MYRRHA bundle. NACIE-UP is a rectangular 2. 5 ″-pipe loop where a difference in height H~ 5 m exists between the heat source (FPS) and the heat sink (Heat Exchanger, HX). This difference in height provides the pressure head Dp~rgβDT×H for the natural circulation of the Heavy Liquid Metal in the loop. A gas-lift system provides a void fraction in the riser promoting an enhanced circulation in the loop. Most of the pressure losses are located in the FPS, and the maximum mass flow rate is around 2 kg/s in natural circulation and 7 kg/s in gas-enhanced circulation. A 7 tube/shell-and-tube Heat Exchanger couples the primary LBE loop with the secondary side with water in pressure at 16 bar. The tube-in-tube technology with LBE tube side, water shell side, steel powder in the gap, and two section for low and high power, is adopted for HX. In the primary side, two prototypical Induction Flow Meters (IFM) are installed, one in the natural circulation range and another one in the enhanced circulation range. Bubble tubes with flowing Ar are adopted to measure pressure losses in the different branches of the loop. Several thermocouples monitor the loop in different points. An ancillary gas system ensures the cover gas and provides flow rate for the gas-lift system.

In this frame the CIRCE pool facility has been refurbished to host a suitable test section able to thermal-hydraulically simulate the primary system of a HLM cooled pool reactor. In particular a fuel pin bundle simulator (FPS) has been installed in the CIRCE pool. It has been conceived with a thermal power of about 1 MW and a linear power up to 25 kW/m, relevant values for a LMFR. It consist of 37 fuel pins (electrically simulated) placed on a hexagonal lattice. The LBE, heated by the FPS, flows up through the riser, reaching the Heat Exchanger (HX) inlet though a gas separator placed in the tank upper zone. The primary fluid circulation occurs employing a gas lift system which injects Argon from a nozzle connected to the riser entrance, enhancing the LBE flow. The heat exchanger represents the heat sink of the system and it is designed to have a thermal duty of about 800 kW; it consists of 91 double-wall bayonet tubes (with helium gap) fed by low pressure boiling water. Finally the decay heat removal system (DHR), designed to remove 40 kW and uncoupled from the main flow path. It consists of a bayonet element in which the air is injected from the top, flows downward through the inner tube and then flows upward through the annular region, where heat is removed from primary LBE side. The bayonet element is placed into a suitable shell thermally insulated from the external pool. LBE enters into the shell from the top and flows downwards in a counter flow heat exchanger configuration. The experimental campaign was designed to study the PLOHS+LOF accident, with decay heat removed by the DHR-system. This paper reports the experimental data as well as a preliminary analysis and discussion of the results, focusing on the most relevant tests of the campaign, namely Test IV Temperatures along the three sections of the FPS were reported and the Nusselt number in the FPS sub-channels was investigated. Moreover, the void fraction in the riser was computed and the riser inlet and outlet average temperatures were discussed. Concerning the HX, temperature measurements in the sub-channels were presented, as well as temperatures at the inlet and outlet sections. For the DHR-system, temperatures at the entrance and exit section were analyzed both for the primary lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) circuit and for the secondary air side, estimating the thermal power removed by DHR under the formulated accidental scenario. Finally system codes thermal hydraulics analyses performed adopting the RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3 are presented. A comparison with the data obtained from preliminary experimental tests is presented...|$|E
