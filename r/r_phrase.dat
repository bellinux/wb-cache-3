40|$|On Company Time: American Modernism and the Big Magazines situates the {{evolution}} of American modernism within its capacious mass-market periodical context, {{and in doing so}} finds that hallmark modernist texts such as Willa Cather's The Professor's House and T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land participate in a more complex and far-reaching print ecology than is often understood. I contend that reading modernist formal experimentation within, rather than against, popular print culture raises a new set of questions about how reactions to "mass civilization," to use F. <b>R.</b> Leavis's <b>phrase,</b> feed back into the content of midcentury mass media. By excavating the deep institutional, economic, and aesthetic affiliations that bridge the golden days of modernism and American magazine culture, this study challenges the recent focus on little magazines and coterie circles in determining modernism's cultural circulation. Instead, through readings of Cather, Eliot, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jessie Fauset, James Agee, Kenneth Fearing, Ernest Hemingway, and others, I argue that the influence of little magazines on modernist production and circulation looks rather narrow when compared to well-funded and massively popular titles like McClure's, Time, Life, and Esquire. Rather than simply instantiate a bland mass culture against which modernism reacts, early twentieth-century magazines comprise a heterogeneous cluster of serial publications that differentiated themselves by form, genre, and readership. This double life of modernism and magazines is equally epistemological and formal, for the authors I discuss take their ambivalences about institutional affiliation as an occasion for material and aesthetic experimentation. By simultaneously analyzing literary history, media forms, and narrative structure, I contribute to an emerging body of scholarship at the intersection of media studies, book history, and literary criticism. This study expands the material and institutional history of print culture while attending to the ways authors, genres, and literary styles can move through a literary marketplace...|$|R

40|$|The Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) {{has come}} a long way in a {{relatively}} short space of time. From inauspicious beginnings, the principle was endorsed by the General Assembly in 2005 and unanimously reaffirmed by the Security Council in 2006 (Resolution 1674). However, the principle remains hotly contested primarily because of its association with humanitarian intervention and the pervasive belief that its principal aim is to create a pathway for the legitimization of unilateral military intervention. This article sets forth the argument that a deepening consensus on R 2 P is dependent on its dissociation from the politics of humanitarian intervention and suggests that one way of doing this is by abandoning the search for criteria for decision-making about the use of force, one of the centre pieces of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty 2001 report that coined the <b>phrase</b> <b>R</b> 2 P. Criteria were never likely to win international support, the article maintains, and were less likely to improve decision-making on how best to respond to major humanitarian crises. Nevertheless, R 2 P can make an important contribution to thinking about the problem of military intervention by mitigating potential 2 ̆ 7 moral hazards 2 ̆ 7, overcoming the tendency of international actors to focus exclusively on military methods and giving impetus to efforts to operationalize protection in the fiel...|$|R

40|$|Safety Data Sheet (hereinafter SDS) is a {{document}} that provides a mechanism for transfer of adequate safety information on hazardous substances and mixtures. SDS allows users to undertake the necessary measures to protect human health and safety {{in the workplace and}} environment. SDS is defined by the REACH Regulation (1907 / 2006 /EC), Annex II. By the implementation of REACH for substances and mixtures which are dangerous to {{human health and the environment}} the SDS has become an extended document that contains the Exposure scenario. It is necessary to prepare Exposure scenario for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of more than 10 t/y that have PBT and/or vPvB properties or are classified into some other class of hazard in accordance with Art. 14 of the REACH Regulation. Exposure scenario is part of the Chemical Safety Report, within the Chemical safety assessment as a part of registration dossier. Classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures is carried out in accordance with the CLP Regulation (1272 / 2008 /EC). CLP Regulation follows the criteria for classification of chemicals given by the UN, the so-called Global Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). Regulation brings new classification criteria, hazard symbols (pictograms) and warning labels and statements H and P by replacing <b>R</b> and S <b>phrases.</b> Both of regulations have a major impact on the content of SDS, which has become larger and more complex document for its creator (manufacturer) and the end user. We believe that the industry should take some steps to create a compendious version of SDS, which will have practical application in everyday life and will be convenient to the storekeeper, carriers, end users of dangerous chemicals, i. e. for people who are in a direct contact with dangerous chemicals in order to protect themselves timely and adequately from undesirable effects...|$|R
40|$|The ECVAM-funded skin {{irritation}} validation study (SIVS) was initiated in 2003 {{with the aim}} to evaluate whether the EpiDermTM, EPISKINTM and the SIFT alternative methods were able to reliably identify skin irritant and non-irritant chemicals and as such to replace the rabbit Draize test for {{skin irritation}}. The primary goal {{of the study was}} to evaluate the predictive capacity of the assays with regard to the EU classification system using the risk <b>phrase</b> <b>R</b> 38 for skin irritants and no classification for non irritants. A secondary objective was the retrospective analysis of the data to assess whether the in vitro tests would be able to discriminate between strong (category 2), mild (category 3) and non-irritants (no category), as defined by the OECD and United Nations proposal for a Globally Harmonised System (GHS) for classification and labelling of dermal irritancy. A Chemicals Selection Sub-Committee (CSSC) was appointed to identify test chemicals to be used in the SIVS having high quality existing in vivo data with which to correlate the in vitro measurements. Since chemicals from the European Centre for the Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) database of reference chemicals for skin irritation / skin corrosion had been extensively used in preceding studies, the CSSC made use of novel sources for potential test chemicals. The first source of chemicals screened was the New Chemicals Database (NCD) which is the central archive within the EU notification scheme for 'new' commercial chemicals. Data registered in NCD originate from standard assays, submitted in compliance with the legislation regulating marketing of industrial chemicals, and are subject to quality assurance by EU member state competent authorities. In addition, to obtain 'existing' chemicals readily available from major manufacturing and/or distribution sources, additional databases were surveyed such as the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) database maintained by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the ECETOC database with the exclusion of those chemicals used in the previous optimisation and prevalidation phases. A total of approximately 3500 chemicals from the NCD and 1600 from the additional databases were screened by the CSSC. Pre-determined selection criteria were applied to ensure primarily the quality of the in vivo data and the practicability of testing. Nevertheless, the number of chemicals fulfilling the CSSC selection criteria was found to be limited, particularly when identifying GHS category 2 chemicals. However, a total set of 60 chemicals were selected and proposed to be tested in the SIVS. The selected chemicals (1) represented statistically justified sample sizes for distinguishing R 38 from non classified chemicals, (2) provided a balanced representation of the three GHS categories to allow for post-hoc evaluation of the performance of the assays for that classification system, and (3) acknowledged to a certain degree the large prevalence known to exist for chemicals which have oedema and erythema scores of 0. These chemicals were independently coded and distributed to the participating laboratories. The selected chemicals presented a variety of molecular structures, functional chemical groups, effect and use categories, as well as a wide range of physical-chemical properties. They represented a challenging set of chemicals relevant to current industrial commerce for the alternative methods being validated. JRC. I. 2 -Validation of biomedical testing method...|$|R
