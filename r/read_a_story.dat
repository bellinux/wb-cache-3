5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and Live and Let Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That year he <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company De Beers. The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E
25|$|While {{working for}} the Nilsson Rafter-E-N Ranch, Bascom {{happened}} to <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in a western magazine about Native American Jim Thorpe. Thorpe had been working as a horse wrangler, but got fired. The camp cook gave him some advice - go to school. Thorpe took that advice, went to school, excelled in sports and became an Olympic champion.|$|E
25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E

500|$|The fifth track, [...] "Sweating Bullets", shows Mustaine's {{battle with}} his inner selves, which is {{presented}} throughout a conversational singing style. [...] "Sweating Bullets" [...] was written {{during the second}} recording session and was released as the album's third single. Its lyrical theme deals with paranoia. David Ellefson commented that the song's lyrics were [...] "psychotically perfect" [...] and sounded like [...] "the inside of a crazed lunatic's mind". The title track was inspired by environmental concerns {{about the future of}} the planet. The name was suggested by Nick Menza, who had <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in Time magazine entitled [...] "The Countdown to Extinction". [...] "High Speed Dirt" [...] focuses on skydiving. [...] "Captive Honour" [...] is a song about prison and the consequences of crime, while [...] "Psychotron" [...] was written about the Marvel Comics character Deathlok. The album's closing track, [...] "Ashes in Your Mouth", concentrates on the negative aftermaths of war. The longest tune on the record, it is performed at intense tempo and features shredding guitar leads.|$|E
500|$|Pete Michels, {{director}} of the episode, had <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in the newspaper about people with famous names. He {{came up with a}} way of how Homer's life could be affected if he saw someone on TV with his name. While creating the Homer Simpson television character, the production staff was deciding if the character should be [...] "cool" [...] throughout the episode, or if he should be an idiot from the beginning. The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program. The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen. [...] Ron Hauge, a The Simpsons show producer, suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name. His friend, however, did not take it. The episode would also inspire Tom Martin's cousin to name his son Max Power. One scene from the episode features Ned Flanders commenting that cartoons are easily able to change voice actors; to enhance the joke for his one line of dialogue, Flanders is voiced by recurring cast member Karl Wiedergott instead of his regular voice actor Harry Shearer.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|Academics were {{supplemented}} {{with a strong}} emphasis on the arts, as well as physical activity, including daily walks in the woods. The children learned two languages from {{the first day of school}} on, with emphasis on the spoken, rather than the written word. Learning was accomplished through living, whether from daily walks in the woods, from the tasks required of the children in and around the building, or at meal time, where there were [...] "English" [...] and [...] "French" [...] tables and those sitting at them would speak in those languages during the meal. The arts were also offered. In addition to painting, drawing, singing and drama, the children learned to play music. In the evening, [...] "Tante Anna" [...] <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> then gave each child a [...] "good night kiss" [...] and sent them off to bed.|$|E

6000|$|Now, a Christmas story {{should be}} one.

So far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you <b>read</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in a holiday magazine {{the only way you}} can tell it is a Christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads: ["The incidents in the above story happened on December 25th.--ED."] ...|$|E
