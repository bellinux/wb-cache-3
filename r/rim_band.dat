40|$|Flash {{butt welding}} {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state butt welding. It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash butt welding is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for <b>rim</b> and <b>band</b> manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the flash butt welding cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of flash butt welding cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the flash butt welding is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world. Certainly there might be a lot of researches carried out under this topic in the history,' but due to high competitiveness among the companies the research outcomes might be kept as company secrets. In this project, the analysis of flash butt welding cracks in wheel manufacturing will be discussed in detail. The second stage is process description.. and principles of flash butt welding. Third stage is problem identification and the fourth stage is methodology to solve the problem. In methodology it has stated that the identified process' variables that affect the welding quality and how further testing are carried out.

40|$|A {{simple and}} cost {{effective}} {{optical fiber sensor}} using side coupling of light into the core modes of plastic optical fiber (POF) coated with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods is reported here. Nanorods coating enhanced coupling inside the fiber by scattering light but were also capable of causing leakage. Structuring the growth to specific regions allowed scattering from different segments along the fiber {{to contribute to the}} total coupled power. A uniform, densed and highly aligned spiral patterned ZnO nanorods were grown on the POF using the hydrothermal method and its effect was investigated. ZnO nanorods growth time of 12 h and temperature of 90 °C provided the best coupling voltage. Side coupling was measured to be a factor of 2. 2 times better for spiral patterned coatings as opposed to unpatterned coatings. The formation of multiple segments was used for multiple-wavelength channels excitation where different bands were side coupled from different segments. It was found that visible white light source significantly coupled the light into the POF compared with infrared laser sources. A first order theoretical model was derived to simulate the impact of millimeter (mm) scale spiral patterns on coupling efficiency by varying the width and spacing of the coated and uncoated regions. The width of spiral patterned ZnO nanorod coatings on POF was optimized theoretically for light side coupling and was found to be 5 mm. An experimental validation was performed to complete the optimization and the experimental results showing a well correlation with simulation. Optimized width of spiral patterned ZnO nanorods grown on large core POFs was used for the purpose of temperature and multiple optical channel alcohol vapor sensing. Spiral patterned ZnO nanorods coating exhibited a significant response to temperature change from 20 ˚C to 100 ˚C based on extinction concept which is the attenuation of light by scattering and absorption as it traverses the ZnO nanorods. Sensitivity was measured to be a factor of 1. 3 times better for spiral patterned coatings as opposed to unpatterned coating. The multiple optical channel alcohol sensing mechanism utilized changes in the output signal due to adsorption of methanol, ethanol and isopropanol vapors. Three spectral bands consisting of red (620 - 750 nm), green (495 - 570 nm) and blue (450 - 495 nm) were applied in measurements. The range of relative intensity modulation (RIM) was determined to be between 25 to 300 ppm. Methanol presented the strongest response compared to ethanol and isopropanol in all three spectral channels. With regard to alcohol detection <b>RIM</b> by spectral <b>band,</b> the green channel demonstrated the highest RIM values followed by the blue and red channels respectively...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIAgua Rica is a {{world-class}} Cu (Mo–Au) deposit located in Catamarca, Argentina, {{in which the}} porphyry and high sulfidation epithermal stages are juxtaposed due to the telescoping of the mineralizing system. Pyrite is the most abundant sulfide in the analyzed section of the deposit and shows variations in textures and tracemetal content (determined by LA–ICPMS), between the porphyry and epithermal stages. Pyrite from the porphyry stage is fine grained and depleted in most trace elements analyzed, except for traces of Co (up to 276 ppm) and Ni (up to 131 ppm). Pyrite from the epithermal stage is texturally complex, compositionally heterogeneous, and the trace metal content varies with depth and within sub-stages of mineralization. At an intermediate depth (2625 m), epithermal pyrite from the cement of the jig-saw and clast-supported hydrothermal breccias are enriched in Cu (up to 2961 ppm) that correlates with the highest Cu grades in the section. This pyrite contains micro-inclusions of sulfosalt minerals as inferred by LA–ICPMS elemental mapping and individual spot ablation profiles. They are zoned and show a Co-rich core, an intermediate zone enriched inCu, and anouter rimrich inZn. At shallower levels (3000 m), epithermal pyrite cements in the heterolithic hydrothermal breccia are unusually rich in trace metals that correlate with the highest Pb, Zn, Au, and Ag grades. The ore-stage pyrite occurs as either successive colloform bands on earlier Co-bearing cores or as veinlets infill. The colloform pyrite bands and veinlets are As-poor (b 30 ppm) and enriched in Pb (up to 4528 ppm), Cu (up to 3900 ppm), Zn (up to 1078 ppm), Ag (up to 136 ppm), Au (up to 6. 7 ppm), Bi (up to 1077 ppm), and Te (up to 3. 1 ppm). In LA–ICPMS elemental maps, arsenic concentrates in a thin inner band within the thicker, trace element-rich <b>rims.</b> The colloform <b>banding</b> in pyrite is interpreted to reflect rapid crystallization during fluid boiling at a hydrothermal fluid–meteoric water interface, creating intense fluctuations in temperature and producing undercooling in the mixed fluid. This late and shallow fluid was depleted in As and Cu and also precipitated alunite, Fe-poor sphalerite, and marcasite enriched in trace metals. Maximum Au and Ag inputs into the system occurred {{towards the end of}} the epithermal cycle and are expressed by the Au–Ag-rich rims in hydrothermal pyrite. Based on Au–As data in pyrite, ore fluids forming early pyrite were undersaturated with respect to native Au (solid solution incorporation), while later fluids precipitating colloform pyritewere supersaturated with respect to native Au forming Au nanoparticles. This study provides evidence that pyrite records chemical changes at the porphyry to epithermal transition that can be used tomonitor hydrothermal fluid evolution, constrain different mineralization stages, and vector towards undiscovered ore zones.
