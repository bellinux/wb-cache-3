30|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>hull</b> is an {{agricultural}} by-product which is poorly utilized. More than 100 {{million tons of}} <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is generated annually in the world (Okafor and Okonkwo 2009). The collection and disposal of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is becoming more difficult and expensive and is, therefore, left unused as waste or simply burned in the fields, thereby creating significant environmental problems (Mansaray and Ghaly 1997). It has useful properties as a growing media such as low in weight, inert with respect to adsorption and desorption of nutrients and also has good drainage, aeration and low rate of decomposition (Saparamadu 2008). Ghehsareh (2013) reported some physicochemical properties of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> media such as porosity (73  %), water holding capacity (88  %), bulk density (0.09  g/cm 3), organic matter content (88.52  %), electrical conductivity (2.24  ds/m) and pH (6.2). The composition of N, P, and K in <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is 0.5, 0.08 and 0.4  %, respectively, and the C/N ratio of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> is 25 : 1 (Marulanda and Izquierdo 1993). According to Patel et al. (1987), the Si content in raw rice husk is 10.3 (wt%).

Ground fresh <b>rice</b> (Oryza sativa) <b>hull</b> {{materials were}} produced by grinding whole fresh <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> and passing the resulting product through a 1 -, 2 -, 4 - or 6 -mm- diameter screen {{to produce a}} total of four ground rice products (RH 1, RH 2, RH 4, and RH 6, respectively). The physical properties and water release characteristics of sphagnum peatmoss (peat) and the four ground <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products were evaluated. All of the ground <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products had a higher bulk density (Bd) than peat, and as the grind size of the <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> particle decreased, Bd increased. Peat had a higher total pore space (TPS) than all of the ground <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products except for RH 6. As grind size decreased, the TPS decreased. Peat had a lower air-filled pore space (AFP) than all of the ground <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products and as the grind size of the <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products decreased, AFP decreased. Peat had a higher water holding capacity (WHC) than all of the ground <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> products. Grind sizes RH 4 and RH 6 had similar WHC, whereas RH 1 and RH 2 had a higher WHC than RH 4 and RH 6. Peat, RH 4, and RH 6 had similar available water content (AVW), whereas RH 2 had higher AVW than these materials and RH 1 had the highest AVW.

A 2 x 4 factorial experiment in randomized complete block design with four levels of partial substitution and two <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> materials in three (3) replication was employed to assess the variation in seepage rate resulting from the partial substitution of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> materials for sand in concrete made into rectangular canal sections. The result showed that the average seepage rate of rectangular canal sections increases as the level of partial substitution increases. Furthermore, the results also confirmed the pre-experimental hypothesis of the researcher that the seepage rate through canal sections with partial substitution of rice will always be lower than the seepage rate through canal sections with partial substitution of whole <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> for sand. The analysis of variance revealed that the variation in the average seepage rates of different treatment combinations and the control treatment are significant.

30|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>hull</b> is a {{by-product}} of the rice polishing process and consists of 30 – 40 % carbon and 20 – 30 % silica (SiO 2). Annual global rice production is 620 million tons, of which 77 % is cultivated in Asia and 7.3 million tons are produced in Korea. It is generally recognized that the <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> comprises 16 – 18 % of the total rice weight.

30|$|Despite the {{problems}} with nutrient availability {{that may have been}} expected with the high pH of the guar and jantar blends, the tissue nutrient analysis of transplants grown in these blends showed increasing concentrations of all nutrients with increasing proportions in the compost. Concentrations of all measured nutrients, except P, of transplants grown in the wheat straw and <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> compost blends did, however, decrease with increasing compost proportions. Because tissue P concentration increased with increasing proportions of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> compost, it appears there is more plant available P in <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> compost than the 1 : 5 extract samples suggested. Nutrients in composts can display varying degrees of extractability when composts are used in potting mixes due to complex interactions between media components (Evans et al. 2011). Interactions between media components could explain some of the discrepancies between nutrients measured in media blends and tissue nutrient concentration. There appears to be no clear relationship between transplant tissue nutrient concentration and transplant growth or field performance. With this in mind, the good performance in <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> compost blends is likely due to the differences in the physical properties, pH, and EC of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> compost, from the other compost blends.

Scanning electron microscopic studies were conducted to evaluate the microstructure of this ash as well as diatomaceous earth and filter sand. The laboratory filtration experiments were conducted at slow to semi-rapid filtration rates in order to investigate the effectiveness of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash medium in removing turbidity, bacteria and colour from water, and to compare its performance with a conventional sand filter. Synthetic water was made by adding suitable amounts of kaolin clay, Escherichia coli suspension, coffee/leaf extract, to laboratory tap water. Filtrate quality and head loss were considered as the major parameters in assessing the performance of these filters. A number of thin layer filter experiments were conducted to obtain the variation of turbidity with depth in <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash filters, under selected operating conditions. Solubility studies of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash at various strengths of sodium hydroxide and for various steeping periods were made to evaluate the optimum conditions for silica solubilisation. A dilution procedure including partial neutralization and Subsequent aging prior to further dilution was adopted to convert alkali soluble <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash into activated silica. Coagulation of dilute clay suspensions (£ 40 m g / L), using alum, activated silica and selected polyelectrolytes were conducted {{with the aid of}} a jar test apparatus. The filtrate turbidity for approximately 750 mm depth of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash medium was equal to or less than that of a sand medium, at rates of filtration 0. 25 to 2. 0 m 3 / m 2 h and a turbidity range of 20 to 60 FTU. The rate of head loss in the sand medium was 1. 5 to 5 times more than in an ash filter. The optimum rate of filtration for the ash filter occurred at 1. 0 m 3 / m 2 h, with a rate of head loss of 52 mm/d. At filtration rates of 0. 5 and 1. 0 m 3 / m 2 h, for an influent Escherichia coli concentration of 100 - 2000 no/mL, approximately 70 % to 90 % reductions in bacterial numbers were achieved by 750 mm depths of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash media. Colour removal of at least 30 % was achieved by shallow depths (< 320 mm) of ash media, at slow rates of filtration (< 0. 25 m 3 / m 2 h). The results obtained from thin layer filtration experiments were analysed using a statistical filtration model known as the chi-square distribution analogy. This technique was successful in predicting the performance of <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash filters at specific operating conditions. The optimum removal of silica from <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash occurred when ash was steeped in 5 % NaOH solution for a period of 24 h. A procedure for the preparation of activated silica from <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash was developed. The addition of 5 mg/L of activated silica as a coagulant aid during the coagulation of turbid water (4 0 mg/L of kaolin clay) with 50 mg/L of alum at pH value of 6, was sufficient to achieve a residual turbidity of 1. 2 FTU. The coagulation of the same water with alum or alum-polyelectrolyte at similar conditions led to higher residual turbidity...|$|R
50|$|Refined salt for {{domestic}} use {{is made by}} evaporating salt water in large open vats using ovens with rice husks used as the fuel source. This method produces very clean, fine grained salt in which the impurities are removed during cooking. Traditionally, the stove used in salt making was wood-fueled. Wood became more expensive, prompting a shift to <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> stoves. The abundance of <b>rice</b> <b>hulls</b> has made it economically feasible to reprocess the salt and is a renewable source of fuel. The residue, <b>rice</b> <b>hull</b> ash, (RHA) is then sold back to farmers for use as fertilizer.|$|R
