40|$|Abstract: The <b>residual</b> <b>modulation</b> {{refers to}} the {{invariant}} level of modulation (modulation potential approximately 450 MV) observed at sunspot minimum since the commencement of the neutron monitor record in 1951. Satellite measurements of the heliomagnetic field show that it exhibited a similar invariance (~ 5. 2 nT) between the sunspot minima of 1965 and 1996. The cosmic ray record since 1428 shows that the <b>residual</b> <b>modulation</b> has increased steadily since the Spoerer solar minimum in the 15 th century. Three independent reconstructions of the heliomagnetic field (HMF) (two since the middle ages) show that it also exhibited step-like changes. The relative importance of diffusion-convection processes, and drift processes are discussed {{as a function of}} the strength of the HMF. It is proposed that the drift processes are more pronounced at times of low HMF strength, explaining the more pronounced 22 -year variation of the galactic cosmic radiation at earlier times, compared to during the neutron monitor epoch. The paper concludes with speculation that the solar magnetic fields exhibit an ~ 2300 year periodicity, and that solar activity modulates that field at the frequencies of 11, 22, ~ 80, ~ 230 years, leading to the intensity variations observed in the cosmogenic records...|$|E

METHODS: Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG) of 54 patients with refractory focal epilepsy were recorded pre- and post-resection at 2048 Hz. The ARRm was calculated in one-minute epochs in which high-frequency oscillations (HFOs; fast ripples, 250 - 500 Hz; ripples, 80 - 250 Hz) and spikes were marked. We investigated the pre-resection fraction of HFOs and spikes explained by the ARRm (h(2) -index). A general ARRm threshold was set and {{used to compare the}} ARRm to surgical outcome in post-resection ECoG (Pearson X(2)). RESULTS: ARRm was associated strongest with the number of fast ripples in pre-resection ECoG (h(2) = 0. 80, P 0. 47 were associated with poor outcome at channel and patient level (both P< 0. 01) in post-resection ECoG. CONCLUSIONS: The ARRm algorithm might enable intra-operative delineation of epileptogenic tissue.

40|$|The gas pixel {{detector}} (GPD) dedicated for photoelectric X-ray polarimetry {{is selected}} as the focal plane detector for the ESA medium-class mission concept X-ray Imaging and Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE). Here we show the design, assembly, and preliminary test results of a small GPD {{for the purpose of}} gas mixture optimization needed for the phase A study of XIPE. The detector is assembled in house at Tsinghua University following a design by the INFN-Pisa group. The improved detector design results in a good uniformity for the electric field. Filled with pure dimethyl ether (DME) at 0. 8 atm, the measured energy resolution is 18 % at 6 keV and inversely scales with the square root of the X-ray energy. The measured modulation factor is well consistent with that from simulation, up to ~ 0. 6 above 6 keV. The <b>residual</b> <b>modulation</b> is found to be 0. 30 % +/- 0. 15 % at 6 keV for the whole sensitive area, which can be translated into a systematic error of less than 1 % for polarization measurement at a confidence level of 99 %.

40|$|A {{coherent}} light beam {{is used to}} interrogate the focal region within a tissue-mimicking phantom insonified by an ultrasound transducer. The ultrasound-tagged photons exiting from the object carry with them information on local optical path length fluctuations caused by refractive index variations and medium vibration. Through estimation of the force distribution in the focal region of the ultrasound transducer, and solving the forward elastography problem for amplitude of vibration of tissue particles, we observe that the amplitude is directed along the axis of the transducer. It is shown that the focal region interrogated by photons launched along the transducer axis carries phase fluctuations owing to both refractive index variations and particle vibration, whereas the photons launched perpendicular to the transducer axis carry phase fluctuations arising mainly from the refractive index variations, with only smaller contribution from vibration of particles. Monte-Carlo simulations and experiments done on tissue-mimicking phantoms prove that as the storage modulus of the phantom is increased, the detected modulation depth in autocorrelation is reduced, significantly for axial photons and only marginally for the transverse-directed photons. It is observed that the depth of modulation is reduced to a significantly lower and constant value as the storage modulus of the medium is increased. This constant value {{is found to be}} the same for both axial and transverse optical interrogation. This proves that the <b>residual</b> <b>modulation</b> depth is owing to refractive index fluctuations alone, which can be subtracted from the overall measured modulation depth, paving the way for a possible quantitative reconstruction of storage modulus. Moreover, since the transverse-directed photons are not significantly affected by storage modulus variations, for a quantitatively accurate read-out of absorption coefficient variation, the interrogating light should be perpendicular to the focusing ultrasound transducer axi...|$|E

40|$|Our results {{demonstrate}} that photorefractive <b>residual</b> amplitude <b>modulation</b> (RAM) noise in electro-optic modulators (EOMs) {{can be reduced}} by modifying the incident beam intensity distribution.

RAM arises from the photorefractive amplified scatter noise off the defects and impurities within the crystal. A reduction in RAM is observed with increasing intensity uniformity (flatness), which is attributed to a reduction in space charge field on the beam axis. The level of RAM reduction that can be achieved is physically limited by clipping at EOM apertures, with the observed results agreeing well with a simple model. These results are particularly important in applications where the reduction of <b>residual</b> amplitude <b>modulation</b> to 10 ^- 6 is essential...|$|R

At the MQ Photonics Research Centre of Macquarie University the project "Unlocking the Ultraviolet" was launched {{to establish a}} new laser platform based on Ce:LiCAF for continuous wave (CW) and ultrafast pulsed operations in the ultraviolet spectral region. The work presented in this PhD thesis was part of this project, with the main aim to develop a deep understanding of the dynamics in Ce:LiCAF lasers that are pumped by a mode-locked source. As a result, a novel mode of operation for CW solid-state lasers was identified and implemented successfully. When setting up a mode-locked pumped laser system {{in a way that the}} normalized cavity length (that is the ratio between the length of the pump resonator and length of the laser cavity) is a rational number, ‘rational-harmonic mode-locking’ is obtained and short laser pulses are generated. In contrast, when the cavity length is detuned away from resonances, modulated continuous output is emitted. Such asynchronous pumping has never been substantially investigated before in solid-state lasers and led to the first ever CW Ce:LiCAF laser. The optimal normalized laser cavity length for asynchronously pumped CW Ce:LiCAF lasers was calculated to be 0. 3964, which in the present case is a distance of 120 mm detuned from the third harmonic of the 78. 75 MHz pump. The generated CW output featured a <b>residual</b> <b>modulation</b> of only 1 % for frequencies below 1 GHz and 4 % on faster time scales. The slope efficiency was 20 % and the laser threshold 1. 37 W. In the set-up used, the transition between CW behaviour and rational-harmonic mode-locking could be achieved easily by adjusting the length of the laser cavity, and thus in addition to the CW output, mode-locked output with pulse repetition rates up to 1. 1 GHz was achieved. Both mode-locked and CW laser output generation have been explored experimentally and theoretically by modelling the laser resonator based on the laser rate equations. Birefringent tuning of the CW Ce:LiCAF laser using single and multiple MgF 2 Brewster plates has also been investigated. Depending on the thickness of the MgF 2 plates used, continuous tuning over a range of up to 13 nm from 284. 5 nm to 297. 5 nm with a full width at half maximum linewidth of 50 GHz was achieved. By combining MgF 2 plates with etalons, the linewidthof the laser was narrowed down to 2. 7 GHz. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (viii, 207 pages) illustrations (some colour...|$|E
40|$|The {{hysteresis}} effect for small energies of {{galactic cosmic rays}} is due to two effects. The first {{is the same as}} for neutron monitor energies – the delay of the interplanetary processes responsible for cosmic ray modulation with respect to the initiating solar processes, according to the effective velocity of solar wind and shock waves propagation. Then, the observed cosmic ray intensity is connected to the solar activity variations during many months before the time of cosmic ray measurement. The second is caused by the time delay of small energy cosmic ray diffusion from the boundary of modulation region to the Earth's orbit. The model describing the connection between solar activity variation and cosmic ray convection–diffusion global modulation for neutron monitor energies is here developed by taking into account also the time-lag of the small energy particle diffusion in the Heliosphere. We use theoretical results on drifts and analytically approximate the dependences of drifts from tilt angle, and take into account the dependence from the sign of primary particles, and from the sign of polar magnetic field (A > 0 or A 1 MeV, > 2 MeV, > 5 MeV, > 10 MeV, > 30 MeV, > 50 MeV, > 60 MeV, > 100 MeV, and in intervals 10 – 30 MeV, 30 – 60 MeV, and 60 – 100 MeV during January 1986 –December 1999. We exclude periods with great cosmic ray increases caused by particle acceleration in solar flare events. Then, we determine monthly averaged fluxes, as well as 5 -month and 11 -month smoothed data. We analyze also satellite 5 -min data on alpha-particle fluxes in the energy intervals 60 - 160 MeV, 160 – 260 MeV and 330 – 500 MeV during January 1986 –May 2000. We correct observation data for drifts and then compare with what is expected according to the convection–diffusion mechanism. We assume different dimensions of the modulation region (by the time propagation X 0 of solar wind from the Sun to the boundary of modulation region), for X 0 values from 1 to 60 average months, by one-month steps. For each value of X 0 we determine the correlation coefficient between variations of expected and observed cosmic ray intensities (the estimation of cosmic ray intensities values is given in Section 3 by Eq. (9), and the determination of correlation and regression coefficients in Section 3 by Eq. (8)). The dimension of modulation region is determined by the value of X 0 max, for which the correlation coefficient reaches the maximum value.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the {{spatial and temporal}} allocation of attention as revealed by microsaccades. Observers viewed several concurrent “rapid serial visual presentation” (RSVP) streams in the periphery while maintaining fixation. They continually attended to, and discriminated targets in one particular, cued stream. Over and above this continuous allocation, spatial attention transients (“attention shifts”) were prompted by changes in the cued stream location and temporal attention transients (“attentional blinks”) by successful target discriminations. Note that the RSVP paradigm avoided the preparatory suppression of microsaccades in anticipation of stimulus or task events, which had been prominent in earlier studies. Both stream changes and target discriminations evoked <b>residual</b> <b>modulations</b> of microsaccade rate and direction, which {{were consistent with the}} presumed attentional dynamics in each case (i. e., attention shift and attentional blink, respectively). Interestingly, even microsaccades associated with neither stream change nor target discrimination reflected the continuous allocation of attention, inasmuch as their direction was aligned with the meridian of the target stream. We conclude that attentional allocation shapes microsaccadic activity continuously, not merely during dynamic episodes such as attentional shifts or blinks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSensitivity to {{mechanical}} vibrations of Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) is {{a well-known}} phenomenon. It is especially critical for FTS devoted to atmospheric studies (like the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard Mars Express 2003), as absorption bands for the gases of low concentration are comparable with the generated instrument spectral noise. The adopted techniques for the vibration sensitivity reduction suffer of limitations in practical implementation, leaving <b>residual</b> <b>modulations</b> of the interferogram and the so-called ghosts in the spectra. Moreover as it is often impossible to measure the vibrations during the FTS measurement, the position and magnitude of these ghosts cannot be evaluated. Up to now the adopted ghost reduction techniques are mostly based on the averaging of spectra, because the disturbance phase is randomly distributed. This paper presents an innovative data treatment technique which allows single spectrum correction from distortions of unknown nature. Such a technique would increase the spatial resolution of the mapping process and becomes crucial when the desired information is linked to a particular mapping area associated to an individual spectrum.
