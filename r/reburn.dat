40|$|AbstractReburning {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising and cost-effective NOx reduction strategies for combustion systems. In this study, NOx reduction in a CO boiler by reburning is investigated. This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the model for numerical investigation. It is found that NOx reduction occurs mainly behind the DeNOx section where recirculation is strong. Without <b>reburn</b> air, the size of <b>reburn</b> fuel hole does not significantly influence the NOx reduction, although a larger size is a little better. Without <b>reburn</b> air, a larger <b>reburn</b> fuel hole yields a higher temperature near the <b>reburn</b> fuel hole and leads to a better NO reduction. Injection of <b>reburn</b> fuel without <b>reburn</b> air results in higher CO emission. For a “richer” primary fuel without <b>reburn</b> air, <b>reburn</b> fuel fraction and injection location do not significantly influence the NOx reduction. The <b>reburn</b> air closer to the <b>reburn</b> fuel yields a lower NO emission. Temperature decreases first and arises then near the <b>reburn</b> air injection location. Combustion is more complete when the inlet air flow rate is increased. Increase of inlet air flow rate yields a higher NO emission and a lower CO emission.

30|$|One {{important}} {{outcome of}} wildfire is {{the production of}} charcoal. Charcoal is highly resistant to decomposition and its {{physical and chemical properties}} enhance soil fertility and influence nutrient cycling. We compared the amount of black C (the carbon fraction of charcoal) on coarse woody debris (CWD; ≥ 7.6 cm diameter) and total CWD biomass at sites burned once in a high-severity fire with sites that burned in an initial high-severity fire and then <b>reburned</b> eight to ten years later. Twice-burned sites contained an average of 655 kg ha− 1 of black C on CWD, significantly more (P = 0.004) than the 323 kg ha− 1 present in once-burned sites. Total average CWD biomass was significantly greater in once-burned sites compared to twice-burned sites (P < 0.001). Black C accounted for 0.7 % of CWD biomass in once-burned sites and 2.9 % of CWD biomass in twice-burned sites. Short-interval <b>reburns</b> of patches burned in an initial high-severity fire increased the amount of black C on CWD while simultaneously reducing total CWD biomass.|$|R
30|$|Relationships between recent fire history, CWD stocks, {{and black}} C {{formation}} on CWD remain poorly understood (DeLuca and Aplet 2008, Wiechmann et al. 2015).

Further, the NO{sub x} reduction is almost independent of stoichiometry from stoichiometric to upto 10 % deficient air in <b>reburn</b> zone. As a first step towards understanding the <b>reburn</b> process in a boiler burner, a simplified zero-dimensional model has been developed for estimating the NO{sub x} reduction in the <b>reburn</b> process using simulated animal waste based biomass volatiles. However the first model does not include the gradual heat up of <b>reburn</b> fuel particle, pyrolysis and char combustion. Hence {{there is a need for}} more rigorous treatment of the model with animal waste as <b>reburn</b> fuel. To address this issue, an improved zero-dimensional model is being developed which can handle any solid <b>reburn</b> fuel, along with more detailed heterogeneous char reactions and homogeneous global reactions. The model on ''NO{sub x} Reduction for <b>Reburn</b> Process using Feedlot Biomass,'' incorporates; (a) mixing between <b>reburn</b> fuel and main-burner gases, (b) gradual heat-up of <b>reburn</b> fuel accompanied by pyrolysis, oxidation of volatiles and char oxidation, (c) fuel-bound nitrogen (FBN) pyrolysis, and FBN including both forward and backward reactions, (d) prediction of NO{sub x} as a function of time in the <b>reburn</b> zone, and (e) gas phase and solid phase temperature as a function of time. The fuel bound nitrogen is assumed to be released to the gas phase by two processes, (a) FBN evolution to N{sub 2 }, HCN, and NH{sub 3 }, and (b) FBN oxidation to NO at the char surface. The formulation has been completed, code has been developed, and preliminary runs have been made to test the code. Note that, the current model does not incorporate the overfire air. The results of the simulation will be compared with the experimental results.

40|$|Cattle biomass (CB) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a renewable, supplementary fuel for co-firing and reburning. Reburning coal with CB {{has the potential to}} reduce NOx and Hg emissions from coal fired systems. The present research focuses on three areas of combustion: 1) Biomass reburning experiments are conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for the NOx reduction using blends of coal and CB as <b>reburn</b> fuels. 2) Since CB contains higher ash contents compared to coals, the fouling behavior is also investigated under the transient and short-time operation. 3) Finally CB contains higher Cl compared to coals, which oxidizes Hg to HgCl 2. To understand the Hg oxidation behavior, a fundamental study of Hg oxidation in coal combustion is conducted using a plug flow reactor (PFR). The main parameters investigated are types of the <b>reburn</b> fuel, <b>reburn</b> equivalence ratios (ERRBZ), O 2 concentrations in the <b>reburn</b> gas, injection angles of the <b>reburn</b> fuel, cross-sectional geometries of the <b>reburn</b> nozzles, symmetric and asymmetric <b>reburn</b> injections, <b>reburn</b> heat inputs, baseline NOx concentrations, and presence and absence of the heat exchangers (HEX). The results of reburning show that CB is a very effective fuel in NOx reduction, and the extent of NOx reduction is strongly dependent to the ERRBZ. The optimum conditions of the boiler operation for biomass reburning are as follows: ERRBZ = 1. 1, 45 ? upward circular <b>reburn</b> nozzles, 12. 5 % O 2 in the <b>reburn</b> gas, symmetric injection, and presence of HEXs. To make an effective <b>reburn</b> process, the baseline NOx concentrations must be higher than 230 g/GJ (0. 5 lb/mmBTU) and the <b>reburn</b> heat input higher than 20 %. The results of ash fouling show the presence of ash in the hotter region of the furnace seems to promote heat radiation thus augmenting the heat transfer to the HEX. The growth of the layer of ash depositions over longer periods typically lowers overall heat transfer coefficients. The addition of HCl to Hg containing gases in the PFR significantly increases Hg oxidations. The addition of NO inhibited the overall reaction and shifted the reaction temperature higher while the addition of O 2 promoted Hg oxidations and lowered the reaction temperature. For heterogeneous cases, the use of the VWT catalyst promotes the reduction of Hg 0 and shifted the reaction temperatures lower than those for homogeneous cases...|$|E

30|$|We {{suggest that}} pre-fire CWD load {{is the primary}} control of {{charcoal}} production in wildfires (including <b>reburns),</b> given sufficiently active fire behavior to initiate CWD combustion. After an initial high-severity fire (Donato et al. 2009), CWD biomass increases over time as fire-killed trees fall, creating a fuel bed susceptible to charring during a repeat burn. Other factors such as fuel moisture, fire behavior, and fire weather may influence charcoal production as well. But, the consistent increase of black C on CWD in compound disturbance sequences in which the initial disturbance increases CWD biomass (Table 1; Donato et al. 2009, Buma et al. 2014) suggests that pre-fire CWD biomass is the primary driver. This idea should be tested with experimental burns of sites with different CWD loads. Measurements of charred CWD fragmentation and mineralization rates are needed to determine and model fates of black C produced on CWD (Wiechmann et al. 2014).|$|R
