40|$|Seventy-five battery brooded (up to 3 weeks) {{broilers}} {{were transferred}} on conventional rice husk littered floor (CRLF) and were reared up to 49 days of age. On the other hand, seventy-five broiler chicks were reared on CRLF from day-old to 49 days of age served as control. The body {{weight of the}} battery brooded birds at 28 days of age was significantly (P< 0. 01) {{higher than that of}} floor reared birds. <b>Rearing</b> <b>battery</b> brooded broiler on CRLF following transfer depressed growth rate (at 35 days of age) in comparison with CRLF birds, {{but at the end of}} the experiment, there were no significant differences in body weight gain. Non-significant differences were also observed in case of feed intake, feed conversion efficiency and dressed yield between two management systems at the end of the experiment. There were no birds having breast blister irrespective of management system. Mortality percentage was higher in case of CRLF than that of battery brooded birds on CRLF. Battery brooding up to 3 weeks of age saved space. Males had higher body weight (P< 0. 05) and shank weight (P< 0. 01) than those of females. From the present study it is evident that battery brooder can serve as a positive brooder, because after transfer from battery brooder to CRLF there is no negative effect on overall performance...|$|E

50|$|By March 2007, {{the initial}} {{allocation}} of LS hybrids in the U.S. was nearly sold out, with 1,850 preorders placed months before debut. As of October 2007, Lexus sold 6,093 LS 600h's worldwide. When the LS hybrid originally {{went on sale}} in July 2007, Lexus initially targeted 7,000 total units worldwide for the first year, and 2,000 annually in other markets. Ward's Auto and other media outlets reported that the Lexus LS 600h first year's (2007) allocation was entirely sold out {{and that there was}} a one-year backorder as a result.

40|$|Abstract:- The aim of {{this study}} is to model the thermal {{behavior}} of NiMH batteries powering electric vehicles. Both the thermal and the hydrodynamic fields in the battery compartments are predicted using CFD simulations. The model developed switches between laminar free convection and turbulent mixed convection according to the fans state of operation. Simulations are carried out for the discharge phase of the battery (i. e. vehicle run phase) by setting the ambient temperature to 20 oC. The study put an emphasis on the validation of the model by comparing the numerical results to the experimental data collected during tests performed on an electric vehicle in an environmental chamber. Results reveal that evolutions of the predicted temperatures in both front and <b>rear</b> <b>battery</b> pack compartments are in accordance with the corresponding experimental data.

5000|$|A compact sedan may be {{a better}} choice than a subcompact owing to better load {{capacity}} and more room for battery placement. Some commercial EV Conversions use vehicles in this size range. One example is a 1992 Honda Civic. [...] In this conversion, the back seat was retained, and there is still enough room to sink nine flooded lead-acid batteries low in the trunk where the spare tire was located, as well as another nine batteries under the hood. Another example is a 1987 Mitsubishi Tredia where the <b>rear</b> <b>batteries</b> have been raised above the trunk floorspace, sealed, and externally vented. With suspension modifications, increasing shock length & spring rating, the car must still be below GVWR, even with the driver and passengers. Exceeding the total design weight of the vehicle would be illegal in some states, and might result in cancellation by an insurance company.|$|R

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 22, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, guarding the support artillery behind the 27th Infantry, came under attack by the KPA 1st Division troops that had passed around the forward positions. Freeman reported to Eighth Army at 16:40 that the North Koreans had shelled the <b>rear</b> <b>battery</b> of the 37th Field Artillery Battalion, that North Korean infantry were between the US 27th and US 23rd Regiments on the road, and that other North Korean groups had passed around {{the east side of}} his forward battalion. An intense artillery barrage began falling on the headquarters area of the 8th Field Artillery Battalion at 16:05, and 25 minutes later two direct hits destroyed the fire direction center, killing four officers and two non-commissioned officers. The individual batteries quickly took over control of the battalion fires and continued to support the infantry, while the battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company withdrew under fire.|$|R

50|$|The battery {{was built}} by Vincenzo Borg in February 1799, after a French force of around 30 ships was sighted close to the Maltese coast.

5000|$|U-210 {{undertook}} a single war patrol, departing Kiel on 18 July 1942 {{under the command}} of Rudolf Lemcke and heading for the north central Atlantic Ocean. The patrol was uneventful until 6 August 1942 when Convoy SC 94 was located. Despite heavy fog, U-210 was spotted on radar by the Canadian destroyer [...] The U-boat nearly escaped into the fog but the destroyer suddenly reappeared a mere 50 yd away as U-210 crossed its bow. Both ships opened fire; while the range was too close for the destroyer's main guns, machine gun fire shot up the bridge and conning tower, preventing use of the deck gun. As the destroyer passed astern, a shell from her <b>rear</b> <b>battery</b> hit the conning tower, killing the entire bridge crew; fifty caliber machine gun fire silenced the submarine's flak gun. The senior surviving officer of U-210 ordered her to dive, but forced a slow straight course which allowed Assiniboine to ram her just abaft the conning tower as she dove. This resulted in the submarine's electric motors failing and damage to the propellers. The ballast tanks were blown and the attacking destroyer rammed again as U-210 surfaced; a pattern of shallow-set depth charges were dropped at the same time. As the submarine sank, Assiniboine hit her with another 4.7 in shell. 37 survivors were pulled from the water and became prisoners of war. Six men of her crew died during this battle.|$|R
