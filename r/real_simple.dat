25|$|While citing poor {{advertising}} {{sales and}} a rough climate for selling magazine subscriptions, Time Inc. executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert {{resources to the}} company's other magazine launches that year, such as <b>Real</b> <b>Simple.</b> Later that year, its parent company, Time Warner, {{struck a deal with}} the Tribune Company for Times Mirror magazines, which included Golf, Ski, Skiing, Field & Stream, and Yachting. AOL and Time Warner announced a $184 billion merger, the largest corporate merger in history, which was finalized in January 2001.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer, Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: [...] "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it <b>real</b> <b>simple,</b> with just one pickup switch." [...] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a <b>real</b> <b>simple</b> video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something <b>real</b> <b>simple,</b> {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

As always {{and just as}} she did before with her last 3 independently—released projects, Mýa took full creative control of the album. Harrison lent {{a hand in the}} songwriting process; co-writing several of the album's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included Miami rapper Trina, international recording artist Iyaz, reggae star Sean Paul and ex Immature frontman Marques Houston. The album is a representation of Mýa's life today. [...] "It's about being cool and drama-free. And everything I do reflects that," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "The people that I associate with, the circle that I keep is <b>real</b> <b>simple</b> and sometimes we think or we're trained to believe that you always have to have more, more, more to make ourselves feel happy or beautiful, but it's the other way around for me. Simplicity is sexy." ...|$|E

[...] (Psa 32:5) Mark, nothing comes in betwixt confession and forgiveness of sin, nothing of works of righteousness, nothing of legal amendments, nothing but an outcry for mercy; and that act is so far off from lessening the offence, that it greatly heighteneth and aggravates it.
