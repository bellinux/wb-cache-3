40|$|There are now several tests {{available}} that can assess fetal status. A series of 164 cases of high risk pregnancies were studied {{in order to}} assess predictive value of a nonstress test. The majority (36 %) of patients complained about postdate pregnancy. A nonreactive test was identified in 24 of the patients (14. 6 %). Fetal distress, low Apgar score in 1 and 10 minutes after birth and mean of Apgar score in 5 minutes, cesarean section due to fetal distress, congenital anomalies, need of neonatal care, IUGR, abnormal presentation and perinatal death were much more common in the group of pregnancies with a nonreactive NST than in the group with <b>reactive</b> <b>test.</b> The difference was statistically significant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to present a new {{methodology}} for the measurement of agility for netball that is considered more ecologically valid than previous agility tests. Specifically, the agility performance of highly-skilled (n= 12), moderately-skilled (n= 12) and lesser-skilled players (n= 8) when responding to a life-size, interactive video display of a netball player initiating a pass was compared to a traditional, pre-planned agility movement where no external stimulus was present. The total movement times and decision times of the players were the primary dependent measures of interest. A second purpose of the research was to determine the test-retest reliability of the testing approach. Results revealed significant differences existed between the 2 test conditions demonstrating that they were measuring different types of agility. The highly-skilled group was significantly faster in both the reactive and planned test conditions relative to the lesser-skilled group, while the moderately-skilled group was significantly faster than the lesser-skilled group in the <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> condition. The decision time component within the <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> condition revealed that the highly-skilled players made significantly faster decisions than the lesser-skilled players.

40|$|BackgroundIn Ethiopia a tiebreaker {{algorithm}} using 3 rapid {{diagnostic tests}} (RDTs) in series {{is used to}} diagnose HIV. Discordant results between the first 2 RDTs are resolved by a third `tiebreaker¿ RDT. Médecins Sans Frontières uses an alternate serial algorithm of 2 RDTs followed by a confirmation test for all double positive RDT results. The primary objective was to compare {{the performance of the}} tiebreaker algorithm with a serial algorithm, and to evaluate the addition of a confirmation test to both algorithms. A secondary objective looked at the positive predictive value (PPV) of weakly <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> lines. MethodsThe study was conducted in two HIV testing sites in Ethiopia. Study participants were recruited sequentially until 200 positive samples were reached. Each sample was re-tested in the laboratory on the 3 RDTs and on a simple to use confirmation test, the Orgenics Immunocomb Combfirm® (OIC). The gold standard test was the Western Blot, with indeterminate results resolved by PCR testing. Results 2620 subjects were included with a HIV prevalence of 7. 7 %. Each of the 3 RDTs had an individual specificity of at least 99 %. The serial algorithm with 2 RDTs had a single false positive result (1 out of 204) to give a PPV of 99. 5 % (95 % CI 97. 3 %- 100 %). The tiebreaker algorithm resulted in 16 false positive results (PPV 92. 7 %, 95 % CI: 88. 4 %- 95. 8 %). Adding the OIC confirmation test to either algorithm eliminated the false positives. All the false positives had at least one weakly <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> line in the algorithm. The PPV of weakly reacting RDTs was significantly lower than those with strongly positive test lines. ConclusionThe risk of false positive HIV diagnosis in a tiebreaker algorithm is significant. We recommend abandoning the tie-breaker algorithm in favour of WHO recommended serial or parallel algorithms, interpreting weakly <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> lines as indeterminate results requiring further testing except in the setting of blood transfusion, and most importantly, adding a confirmation test to the RDT algorithm.

METHODS: Twelve semi-professional male basketball players (age: 25. 9 ± 6. 7 yr; stature: 188. 9 ± 7. 9 cm; body mass: 97. 4 ± 16. 1 kg; predicted maximal oxygen uptake: 49. 5 ± 5. 3 mL∙kg­ 1 ∙min­ 1) completed multiple trials of a Reactive Agility Test containing light­based (RAT­Light) and opponent­based stimuli (RAT-Opponent). Multiple outcome measures were collected during the RAT­Light (agility time and total time) and RAT-Opponent (decision time and total time). RESULTS: Mean performance times during the RAT­Light (2. 233 ± 0. 224 s) were significantly (P < 0. 001) slower than during the RAT-Opponent (1. 726 ± 0. 178 s). Further, a small relationship was observed between RAT­Light agility time and RAT-Opponent decision time (r 10 = 0. 20), while a trivial relationship was apparent between total performance times across tests (r 10 = 0. 02). Low commonality was observed between comparable measures across tests (R 2 = 0 -­ 4 %). CONCLUSION: <b>Reactive</b> agility <b>tests</b> containing light-based and live opponent stimuli appear to measure different qualities in court­based team sport athletes.

30|$|The {{reactive}} percolation {{tests in}} a fracture under THM conditions {{are aimed at}} improving our understanding of fluid/rock interactions and their influence on fracture flow. To achieve this objective, the developments described here were focused {{not only on the}} use of a specially designed experimental apparatus but also on an associated test methodology. The system makes it possible to carry out a reactive percolation test as such, as well as characterise the changes induced by the fluid/rock interactions. These changes are characterised both at the overall fracture scale, as regards its mechanical and hydraulic behaviour, and at microscopic scale through mapping the morphology and mineralogy of the fracture walls and also the voids. Combining all the data and characterisations obtained during the test enables one to draw up scenarios linking the nature of the fluid/rock interactions produced during the <b>reactive</b> <b>test,</b> their effect on the physical characterisation of the fracture (morphology, voids map, minerals) and the evolution of the resulting macroscopic behaviour (hydraulic and mechanical).|$|E

40|$|Background: The most {{frequently}} used test for evaluation of fetal health is the Non Stress Test (NST). Unfortunately it has {{a high incidence of}} false positive results. The combination of vibroacoustic stimulation with the NTS has been shown to reduce non reactive results. Methods: A tests assessment method was chosen with a simple randomized sampling. 40 pregnant women with non reactive NST in the first 20 minutes who received VAS in one of Tehran University's Hospitals were compared with BPP scores. A vibroacoustic stimulation was applied for a 3 seconds on the maternal abdomen and fallowed within 10 minutes. Data collection tools were NST, sonography instruments,NST result paper, tooth brusher, watch, demographic questioner and check list. Data analysis was made by descriptive static and by using the Fisher's Exact Test (with level of significant at p< 0 / 05). All statistical analysis were performed using an spss/win. Results: After VAS, 70 % of non reactive tracing became reactive. All cases with fetal reactivity response after a VAS had a subsequent BPP score of 8 (negative predictive value of 100 %). False positivity of VAS was lower than NST. Conclusion: VAS offers benefits, by decreasing the incidence of non <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> and reducing test time.

40|$|A conservative, upwind {{numerical}} {{method is}} formulated for {{the solution of}} a two-phase (reactive solid and inert gas) model of deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) in granular energetic solids. The model, which is representative of most two-phase DDT models, accounts for complete nonequilibrium between phases and constitutes a nonstrictly hyperbolic system of equations having parabolic degeneracies. The numerical method is based on Godunov’s methodology and utilizes a new approximate solution for the two-phase Riemann problem for arbitrary equations of state. The approximate solution {{is similar to the}} Roe-type Riemann solution for single-phase systems. The method is able to accurately capture strong shocks associated with each phase without excessive smearing or spurious oscillations and can accurately resolve fine-scale detonation structure resulting from interaction between phases. The utility of the method is demonstrated by comparing numerical predictions with known solutions for three test cases: (1) a two-phase shock tube problem; (2) the evolution of a steady compaction wave in a granular material resulting from weak piston impact (∼ 100 m/s); and (3) the evolution of a steady two-phase detonation wave in an energetic granular material resulting from weak piston impact. The nominally second-order accurate numerical method is shown to have global convergence rates of 1. 001 and 1. 670 for inert test cases with (case 1) and without (case 2) discontinuities, respectively. For the <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> case having a discontinuity (case 3), a convergence rate of 1. 834 was predicted for coarse grids that seemed to be approaching the expected value of unity with increasing resolution. c ○ 2000 Academic Press 1...|$|E

PROUD draws on community-based participatory research methods {{to better understand the}} HIV risk environment of people who use drugs in Ottawa. From March-October 2013, 593 people who reported injecting drugs or smoking crack cocaine were enrolled through street-based recruitment. Trained peer or medical student researchers administered a quantitative survey and offered an HIV POCT (bioLytical INSTI test) to participants who did not self-report as HIV positive. 550 (92. 7 %) of the 593 participants were offered a POCT, of which 458 (83. 3 %) consented to testing.

Treated as a transient phenomenon, the mixing and atomization processes that enhance or inhibit hypergolic ignition have been overlooked in an effort to enhance steady state performance. While the steady state mixing and atomization of propellants is crucial to the performance of rocket engines used for long duration firings, the transient hypergolic ignition event may be crucial for missions utilizing numerous short duration (tens of milliseconds) burn durations. Given the renewed interest in hypergolic propellants, and the missions being required of them, an examination into the injection properties that control hypergolic reaction is required. ^ Impinging and shear injectors were developed to examine the injection parameters that affect hypergolic reaction time.

In addition, a transition region from velocities until a blow-apart regime was reached.

Pulmonary {{hypertension}} impairs the {{mitral valve}} and {{often leads to}} more severe symptoms of heart failure, low exercise tolerance and thus higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of simultaneous radiofrequency ablation of ganglionated plexi of the pulmonary artery in patients with high pulmonary hypertension during mitral valve surgery. Methods. The inclusion criteria were based on patients’ echocardiography/right heart catheterization data. The main criteria were mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 40 mm Hg at rest and a positive <b>reactive</b> <b>test</b> with nitric oxide inhalation. From January 2014 to May 2015, 14 patients underwent radiofrequency denervation of the pulmonary artery in addition to planned mitral valve surgery. Mean patient age was 53. 4 ± 7. 8 years, with 57. 1 % of patients being females. Results. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 116 ± 12 minutes, mean cross-clamp time was 95 ± 13 minutes, and mean ablation time amounted to 9. 5 ± 3. 1 minutes. Pulmonary artery pressure decreased significantly from a mean of 56. 5 ± 9. 8 mmHg to 32. 0 ± 7. 3 mmHg immediately after the operation (p< 0. 001), and to 28. 4 ± 5. 2 mmHg and 29. 7 ± 4. 4 mmHg on the first and third days at ICU respectively. Mean ICU stay was 3. 1 ± 1. 2 days. There were neither early deaths nor specific complications. Conclusions. Simultaneous radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary artery ganglionated plexi when performing mitral valve surgery in patients with pulmonary hypertension is a safe and effective procedure. Further research and long-term follow-up would help to determine whether a decrease in the mean pressure of the pulmonary artery can be interpreted as a clinical advantage. </p...|$|E
40|$|The test of {{embedded}} systems is well-supported {{by a number}} of different test methods and tools if the system under test displays a discrete behavior. However, for systems with continuous behavior these approaches are not appropriate. Practical experiences with the test of {{embedded systems}} in the automotive industry have revealed that test-ing the continuous behavior is different from testing discrete systems. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for the specialities of continuous behavior testing and the conse-quences for practicing testers. In addition, we introduce a new test approach that en-ables the systematic definition of executable test cases for testing the continuous behavior of automotive embedded systems. This method is already in use in several production-vehicle development projects at DaimlerChrysler and is based on a graphi-cal notation for test cases which is easy to understand but also powerful enough to express complex, fully automated tests as well as <b>reactive</b> <b>tests</b> of continuous behavior...|$|R
2500|$|Except in neonates, a {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{should always be}} done before administering BCG. [...] A <b>reactive</b> tuberculin skin <b>test</b> is a contraindication to BCG. [...] Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, {{not because of the}} common misconception that tuberculin reactors [...] "are already immune" [...] and therefore do not need BCG. [...] People found to have <b>reactive</b> tuberculin skin <b>tests</b> should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people [...] who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{specificity}} of numerous extracts used for de· layed cutaneous hypersensitivity (OCH) testing of cancer patients was evaluated. Tests were performed with crude preparations (hypotonic membrane preparations and 3 ·M KCI extracts) and with Sephadex and gradient {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (PAGE) fractions prepared from tumors and from tissue culture (TC) cell lines derived from breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma. The reactivity and {{specificity of}} Individual extracts varied consid-erably. Some extracts were quite reactive and showed dlsease-related specificity; I. e., patients with tumors similar to the extract source were more <b>reactive</b> In OCH <b>testing</b> to some types of extracts than were patients with dissimilar tumors. Other extracts produced skin reactions In patients with various tumors or were poorly <b>reactive.</b> Comparative <b>testing</b> between KCI extracts of cells from the pleural effusion of a Ewing's sarcoma patient an...|$|R
