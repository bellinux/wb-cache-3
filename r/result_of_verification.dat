40|$|Language {{containment}} is {{a method}} for design verification that involves checking if {{the behavior of the}} system to be verified is a subset of the behavior of its specifications (properties or requirements). If this check fails, language containment returns a subset of `fair' states involved in behavior that the system exhibits but the specification does not. Current techniques for language containment do not take advantage {{of the fact that the}} process of design is incremental; namely that the designer repeatedly modifies and re-verifies his/her design.

40|$|We outline an intuitionistic view of {{knowledge}} which maintains the original Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov semantics for intuitionism and {{is consistent with}} the well-known approach that intuitionistic knowledge be regarded as the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification.</b> We argue that on this view co-reflection A →K A is valid and the factivity {{of knowledge}} holds in the form K A → A `known propositions cannot be false'. We show that the traditional form of factivity K A → A is a distinctly classical principle which, like tertium non datur A∨ A, does not hold intuitionistically, but, along with the whole of classical epistemic logic, is intuitionistically valid in its double negation form (K A→ A). Within the intuitionistic epistemic framework the knowability paradox is resolved in a constructive manner. We argue that this paradox is the result of an unwarranted classical reading of constructive principles and as such does not have the consequences for constructive foundations traditionally attributed it.

40|$|We outline an intuitionistic view of {{knowledge}} which maintains the original Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov semantics of intuitionism and {{is consistent with}} Williamson’s suggestion that intuitionistic knowledge {{be regarded as the}} <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification.</b> We argue that on this view co-reflection A → KA is valid and reflection KA → A is not; the latter is a distinctly classical principle, too strong as the intuitionistic truth condition for knowledge which can be more adequately expressed by other modal means, e. g. ¬A → ¬KA “false is not known. ” We introduce a system of intuitionistic epistemic logic, IEL, codifying this view {{of knowledge}}, and support it with an explanatory possible worlds semantics. From this it follows that previous outlines of intuitionistic knowledge are insufficiently intuitionistic: by endorsing KA → A they implicitly adopt a classical view of knowledge, by rejecting A → KA they reject the constructivity of truth. Within the framework of IEL, the knowability paradox is resolved in a constructive manner which, as we hope, reflects its intrinsic meaning. ...|$|E

Each kind of information was verified by using a different method. In Part I are presented the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> 7 questionnaire questions, among which 6 related to opinions. Information on the same topics obtained through in-depth interviews {{was used as a}} verification criterion. An in-depth interview was used along with an interview about an interview which constituted part of the method permitting to precisely characterize and evaluate the quality of the answers given by respondents. Part II presents the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> by means <b>of</b> the data contained in the files of work establishments and relating to 11 information items obtained in questionnaire interviews. The items concerned: the year and place of birth, educational level, number of completed training courses, the year in which the respondent started his work, level of wages in June, number of days of absence at work (warranted and unwarranted), number of late arrivals to work as well as of penalties and rewards recorded in the files. Discrepancies between interview answers and the files which appeared most frequently (30 % of respondents) related to the numbers of days of absence at work and the numbers of late arrivals to work. These discrepancies not always indicate a contradiction between the information obtained in interview and the reality as the file records cannot be treated as absolutely reliable. By comparing answers about wages with the corresponding data from the files it was ascertained that 57 % of respondents tended to overstate their wages by over 100 zlotys. This tendency is contrary to the findings presented by K. Lutyńska in the study contained in the present volume. It is recommended to apply simultaneously the less and more reliable methods <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> in order to evaluate the quality of the former methods as they can be used much more frequently than the latter...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe life of TE {{device is}} defined as the number of {{temperature}} cycles when its electrical resistance increases by a certain percent over the initial value. The cause which decides this life is the thermal stress that affects the joints between the substrates and the dice. Usually Ni barrier peels off most frequently from the surface of a corner die. It is obvious that the thermal stress is determined by temperature difference, coefficients of thermal expansion, die height, die cross section, substrate size and so on. However, there were not explicit relations among these parameters. Assuming that the clamping force is large enough to prevent the bending of TE device under test, and the rigidity of the substrate is much larger than that of dice, the thermal stress of the corner die where the stress is most severe is estimated approximately. Although the obtained relation is no more than the first order approximation, it seems it can be a guide for the reliability design judging from the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> tests...|$|E

As well main part of the production cost is related to choosing of the drilling method in each stope. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} generate a model for identification of the best drilling choice in each case. In order to developing a mathematical model, 150 stopes has been designed by hypothesized dimensions and drilling patterns. In each case production cost was calculated based on extracted ore unite. The out puts come from through calculation of the hypothesized designing on account of different thicknesses of the ore body and heights of the production blocks. A mathematical model has been developed through non-linear regression technique on the basis of the out puts. The generated model is able to define dissimilar production cost per extracted ore unit based on each production drilling method. Therefore the best choice is the drilling method which has the lowest rate of dissimilar production cost. Verification of the model has been carried out on some random data.
