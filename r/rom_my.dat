Hamas, the enemy they have been fighting, has been trained extensively by Iran and by Hezbollah, to fight among the people, to use the civilian population in Gaza as a human shield... Hamas factor in the uses of the population as a major part of their defensive plan. So even though as I say, Israel, the IDF, has taken enormous steps...to reduce civilian casualties, it is impossible, it is impossible to stop that happening when the enemy has been using civilians as human shields.|$|E
40|$|Most {{people today}} live a {{sedentary}} lifestyle, lack of movement {{results in the}} body becoming less equipped {{to take part in}} sporting activities. When the body is expected to perform, a weak musculoskeletal foundation can lead to postural deviations, muscular imbalances and unaligned joints. The risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) (7, 11, 17, 19, 20, 21, 27) increased which are presenting considerable challenges for personal trainers and sports coaches. One approach to counter ailments is the NASM Corrective Exercise Continuum (CEx) – that promotes the activation and deactivation of muscles, fascia and the nervous system(5). One common issue of the modern body is repetitive excessive knee valgus (knee collapse). Lack of control from the hips, particularly from the gluteus medius can result in excessive adduction and internal rotation of the femur (8, 23) which will affect joints above and below the knee (11, 30). Structures such as the Anterior Crucial Ligament (ACL), the patella (11, 16, 19, 20) and the Ilio-Tibial Band (ITB) (12) can become overstressed. The NASM screening process helps identify potential musculoskeletal problems by drawing attention to the signs of movement and range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> dysfunctions. <b>My</b> aim is to discuss how improved muscle strength and flexibility around the hips can help prevent or help improve musculoskeletal disorders linked to the knee. In line with the CEx system, I have suggested some easy to implement techniques and exercises...|$|R

That misunderstanding — {{though not the}} persecution — penetrates the SCA and influences both those {{who are trying to}} portray Gypsies and those who are audience to our portrayals. Over the last fifteen years the interest in Gypsies has grown in the SCA, particularly as a new and different persona to have. Due to both the relative lack of documentation about Roma and difficulty in obtaining much of that documentation, many of us who have portrayed Roma have done so enjoying the fact that few can knowledgeably argue our choice of names, clothing or history. This article stems from my research on the <b>Rom</b> (and <b>my</b> own persona) during the past decade. It begins with a brief introduction to the Roma before exploring their origins, motivations for traveling and the extent of their migrations. I hope this will help others researching the Rom as personas for themselves or just for interest's sake. Throughout this article I will be referencing the Rom by their modern name: Rom (singular), Roma (plural) and Romani (adjective), {{as well as by the}} term Gypsy. Gypsy is used as a connection mostly to the historical texts, acknowledging that most Roma prefer not to be referred to by that name. Who are the Rom? Over the last thousand years, Roma have been referred to by a seemingly endless variety of names, many of them occurring through error and prejudice. Wanderers, Vagrants, Bohemians, Travellers, Gypsies, Sinti, Zott, Luri, Nawar, Jats are only a sampling of these names. Many of these names are linguistically similar. For example, in the 11 th century the Gypsies were referred to in a Byzantine text,Life of St. George the Athonite 1. In this text the Gypsies are referred to as Adsincani, which is interpreted as a form of the Greek wor...|$|R

I am particular interested in the relationships between the artist, the audience the artwork and the engagement o f all of these with the space. I wished to see whether yijing theory and Chan philosophy might be provide a framework for the development and direction of my own installation practice and to discover whether my resulting artwork could in turn produce a direct interpretation of yijing and Chan. All of this research has been written up in Chapter 1 - 4 with an examination of essential background information on the aspects of Chinese art and aesthetic theory known as yi fing. Further such research was undertaken in the area of Chan Buddhism and its relationship to art and the artistic process. This was followed by an investigation of the characteristics of Chinese and Japanese garden design and how they can be seen to exemplify aspects of yijing and Chan. I then considered the history and development of East-West cultural interaction, aspects of environmental and installation practice and certain works by Turrell, Long and Teshigahara in order to provide an historical and theoretical context for my practical work. I Chapter 5 provides a detailed account of 10 practical projects, featuring the process of initiation, development, realisation, appraisal and documentation. Each project has been created and organised according to specific aims and objectives with appraisal and reflection of each project contributing to the particular focus of the practical work that followed. The conclusion of the thesis culminates in the final project, "Bright Moon Tender Wind', which sought to provide a conclusive statement in relation to the research themes. There is extensived ocumentation including images on a CD <b>ROM</b> for all <b>my</b> projects relating to the thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
