5|$|During 2006, Teaneck {{underwent}} a <b>revaluation</b> of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This <b>revaluation</b> adjusted property values to market prices, ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, {{an increase of}} 132.1% from the prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year. In {{the wake of the}} <b>revaluation</b> implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year. The township agreed to complete a <b>revaluation</b> by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine property values.|$|E

5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers that China only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a <b>revaluation.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the value relevance of recognised and disclosed <b>revaluations</b> {{of land and}} buildings for a large sample of Australian firms from 1993 through 1997. In contrast to prior research, we control for risk and cyclical effects and find no difference between recognised and disclosed <b>revaluations,</b> using yearly-cross-sectional and pooled regressions and using both market and non-market dependent variables. We also find only weak evidence that <b>revaluations</b> of recognised and disclosed land and buildings are value relevant...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{whether there are}} {{differences}} in the reliability of asset <b>revaluations</b> made by boards of directors versus independent (external) appraisers. We use a sample of recognized Australian asset <b>revaluations.</b> As a first step we examine the determinants of the choice between director-based <b>revaluations</b> and those undertaken by independent appraisers. We find that independent appraisers {{are more likely to be}} used for <b>revaluations</b> of land and buildings and directors are more likely for investments, plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles. We interpret this as evidence of firms harnessing directors’ knowledge of asset specificities. We also find that firms with less independent boards are more likely to use independent appraisers. We interpret this as evidence of substitutability between governance mechanisms. As for differences in reliability, we find that <b>revaluations</b> of plant and equipment that are made by independent appraisers are more reliable than those by directors. However, we are unable to detect a difference for other classes of non-current assets. We define reliability in terms of ex-post adjustments of recognized value increases. Reliability is determined by an examination of the extent to which upward <b>revaluations</b> are subsequently reversed. ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the long}} lapse {{of time between}} <b>revaluations</b> had {{resulted}} in large increases in rateable values. In November 1998, the Government announced that new valuation lists {{would be prepared to}} take effect from 1 April 1999 and <b>revaluations</b> would thereafter be conducted on an annual basis.|$|R

25|$|On 21 July 2005, the peg {{was finally}} lifted, which saw an {{immediate}} one-time RMB <b>revaluation</b> to ¥8.11 per USD. The exchange rate against the euro stood at ¥10.07060 yuan per euro.|$|E
25|$|After a {{property}} <b>revaluation</b> {{was completed in}} 2013 and based on changes in tax levies by the municipality and the local school districts, the property tax rate increased by almost 50%, from $2.01 per $100 in assessed value in 2012 to $2.93 in 2013. A group of residents has complained to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the <b>revaluation</b> complied with all state legal requirements.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} Rating Ordinance, in 1845, {{provided that}} “the said Governor and Council may cause a new valuation {{to be made}} annually”. However, resource constraints made annual <b>revaluations</b> difficult and an amending Ordinance in 1851 introduced the concept of “adoption” of an existing valuation list, thus avoiding the need for annual <b>revaluations.</b> The “adoption” provision remained a feature in the rating system in Hong Kong until 1973, when the requirement for annual valuations was removed. Henceforth a valuation list would remain in force until a new one was declared.|$|R
25|$|Initially {{struck in}} 2002, the coins were {{intended}} for use shortly after the dollar peg {{was removed from the}} currency. The 50 chon and 1 won were smaller than the previous designs, while the new 10 chon was {{the same size as the}} old. Hyperinflation became a very sudden reality, however, and the new coins were never released as planned. In 2008, 1 and 5 chon coins were also struck when a plan for monetary <b>revaluation</b> began. The coins were finally released into circulation in December 2009 but due to the flawed nature of the <b>revaluation</b> these coins again carry very little value, with especially the 1 and 5 chon being virtually irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|These {{new forms}} of {{monetary}} interdependence made possible huge capital flows. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had {{a direct impact on}} certain domestic economic groups, they came to be seen as political risks for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a <b>revaluation</b> occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid <b>revaluation,</b> they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of huge sums was highly destabilizing.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{prior to}} the {{implementation}} of annual <b>revaluations</b> in 1999, long periods between general <b>revaluations</b> had resulted in large increases in rateable values, giving rise to a very significant increase in the rates burden and causing hardship to ratepayers. To soften the impact of these increases, a Public Revenue Protection (Rating) Order was made in March 1977 to limit the increases in the amount of rates payable for the years 1977/78 and 1978/79 to not more than one third of the amount of rates payable for the preceding year. This measure was also known as the “Rates Relief Scheme”.|$|R
40|$|Theoretically, devaluations and <b>revaluations</b> should {{modify the}} market price of traded goods, but market {{structure}} may influence this process and have a determining impact {{on the nature of}} the trade flows. Market structure forces are shown to have the potential to be able to neutralize the expected effects of devaluations and <b>revaluations</b> on a country's trade balance. This is shown to be a Canadian problem dating back to the 18 th and 19 th centuries that may force Canada to look for other policies to influence the flow of traded goods and its balance of trade. ...|$|R
