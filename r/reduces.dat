5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly <b>reduces</b> her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference.

They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it <b>reduces</b> their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child <b>reduces</b> the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months <b>reduces</b> risk by 23%. Increased physical activity <b>reduces</b> an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
