50|$|If they {{continue}} to enlarge or fail to settle within a few months, smaller lesions may be injected with a corticosteroid, or larger ones may be surgically removed using local anesthesia. This is usually done from underneath the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin. If the chalazion is located directly under the eyelid's outer tissue, however, an excision from above may be more advisable {{so as not to}} inflict any unnecessary damage on the lid itself. Eyelid epidermis usually mends well, without leaving any visible scar. Depending on the chalazion's texture, the excision procedure varies: while fluid matter can easily be removed under minimal invasion, by merely puncturing the chalazion and exerting pressure upon the surrounding tissue, hardened matter usually necessitates a larger incision, through which it can be scraped out. Any <b>residual</b> <b>matter</b> should be metabolized {{in the course of the}} subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible hematoma around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. Chalazion excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional.|$|E

Pig slurries and poultry manures have remained a common source of composting ingredient (Pampuro et al. 2016). Co-composting of wastes from winery distilleries with animal and poultry manure under static pile composting system was assessed on different parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, soluble carbon, polyphenolics content, humification characteristics, and plant germination index (Bustamante et al. 2008). Agricultural food wastes are also attractive composting materials for their conversion into decomposed manures to be used for producing high-value crops (Rubio et al. 2013). It was largely considered that composting processes that ensure nutrient-rich conditions, appropriate carbon rating, organic matter humification and adequate bulking for reducing N-losses are required to overcome production cost (Bernal et al. 2009).

40|$|Abstract—Loading-unloading {{of goods}} is an {{essential}} task that is undertaken at every industrial site. Mines witness a large scale transportation activity. As the volume of such goods is large in size, the mode of transport used for delivery is usually dumpers. Huge cranes load the dumpers at one location with some material and then the dumper moves to the desired destination for unloading. After the unloading process, the dumper may still hold some <b>residual</b> <b>matter</b> in its dumping bed which may be misused stealthily; theft of which may amount to huge loss for the concerned industry. This paper mainly discusses attempts in the direction to devise an automatic system that will detect and quantify the remnant material which is {{left behind in the}} dump-trucks after the unloading process is formally completed.

40|$|Purpose: Processing and {{selection}} {{of fruits and}} vegetables generate high amounts of wastes that represent an economical and environmental issue for the agroindustry sector. Nevertheless, according to so called “biorefinery” approach, this waste biomass can be exploited for the recovery of value added molecules. In this paper the residues of industrial processing of fennels, carrots, lemons and tomatoes were used as sources of polyphenols. Methods: In order to optimize the recovery of polyphenols, different extraction techniques (maceration, ultrasound and microwave assisted extraction) were used in combination with different extraction media (water, ethanol, methanol and their mixtures). The polyphenols’ fractions were tested for their chemical and biological properties. Results: All the obtained phenol fractions showed high antioxidant power and scavenging ability towards stable radical species and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the isolated polyphenol mixtures (containing remarkable compounds like quercetin, kaempferol, naringin, hesperetin) also displayed potential activities as anti-cancer, anti-microbial and acetylcholinesterase inhibiting agents. Conclusions: Overall the obtained results showed that the <b>residual</b> <b>matter</b> produced by the industrial processing {{of fruits and vegetables}} contain high amounts of polyphenols. These polyphenolic fractions still retain their biological and antioxidant properties and therefore could be further exploited for other industrial applications...|$|E

Its characteristics and similarity with properties of gamma emission temporal structure suggest that it reflects the behaviour of internal engine – supposedly, a hyperaccreting solar-mass black hole formed in the collapse of a massive stellar core. In the last several years a general picture that explains the basic observed properties of gamma-ray bursts has been developed (1, 2). Its main part is the formation of a compact relativistic object, a black hole or a highly-magnetized neutron star, as the result of either the collapse of the core of a massive star (3, 4), or the merging of two neutron stars (5). Such a black hole is surrounded by a massive disk of <b>residual</b> <b>matter</b> that avoided the collapse; and its accretion and interaction with the envelope leads to the launch of relativistic ejecta; its kinetic energy eventually transforms to the emission of various wavelengths.

Crop by-products are energy rich feedstuffs in the form of chemical substance such as cellulose and hemicellulose.

Cellulose is polymer of glucose while hemicellulose is polymer of xylose which both can be converted to volatile fatty acids by rumen microbial enzyme activities and subsequently used by the host animal as source of energy.

We stress the unexpected cloud of microscopic dust resulting from the DEEP IMPACT mission, and the existence of molten nodules in STARDUST samples. And the theory of star formation does not explain the common occurrence of binary and multiple star systems in the standard gas fragmentation scenario. No current theory of planet formation can explain the iron core of the earth, under oceans of water. These difficulties are avoided in a scenario where the planet mass objects form primordially and are today the baryonic dark matter.

Between 1992 - 1998, over 50 % of the mangrove cover was removed in order to establish shrimp aquaculture. This severely affected the functioning of coastal ecosystems, reducing their provision of useful services and increasing coastal vulnerability to climate change. Changes in the hydrology and polluted <b>residual</b> <b>matter</b> make the soil unsuitable for other agricultural purposes without costly restoration.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficient}} use of biogenic by-products, residues and waste offers an extensive range of advantages. As well as fulfilling requirements of public services, intelligent “cascading” can tap alternative sources of carbon and play a key part in a system using renewable sources of energy. However, a comprehensive overview of existing resources and their current use is required as a sufficient basis for decision-making. Accordingly, this article studies the development and application of a four-stage categorisation of relevant biomasses and a consistent comparison of existing findings in form of a literature review. Taking the case example of Germany, 30 studies were evaluated {{with regard to their}} information on the theoretical and technical potential of biomass and its current use as a material and source of energy. The compiled results offer a detailed, consistent overview of the status quo in Germany for a total of 93 individual biomass types. The findings show a technical biomass potential between 92. 7 and 122. 1 million Mg (DM) that means up to 1, 500  kg per capita. A share of 62. 7 – 71. 2 million Mg (DM) is already in established use. 26. 9 – 46. 9 million Mg (DM) are still unused. Currently, however, there is no guaranteed, unified reference year for cross-sectoral reporting on the potential and use of biomass. Also, the handling of sustainability criteria is regulated insufficiently. Thus, long-term monitoring is required to manage the efficient, sustainable use of resources in a future-proof manner.
