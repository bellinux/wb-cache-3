5|$|The {{most widely}} {{documented}} mechanism {{is that the}} ingestion of food causes gastric distention, which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material {{to return to the}} mouth. There are several offered explanations for the sudden <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> the LES. Among these explanations {{is that it is a}} learned voluntary relaxation, which is common in those with or having had bulimia. While this relaxation may be voluntary, the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary. Relaxation due to intra-abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation, which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism. The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex, which is the most commonly described mechanism. The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> the LES. Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination.|$|E

Nevertheless, these relaxations have a different numerical behavior and practical usefulness depending on the semidefinite programming solver. We discuss such issues by reporting some computational experiments...|$|R

Phenylephrine (0. 1 – 100 [*]μM) produced concentration-related contractions of the mouse isolated anococcygeus muscle; 0. 2 [*]μM phenylephrine (EC 26) was used to raise tone in subsequent experiments. Field stimulation (0. 5, 1. 0 and 5. 0 [*]Hz) produced frequency-dependent <b>relaxations</b> <b>of</b> phenylephrine-induced tone.

Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside (0. 01 – 5 [*]μM) were unaffected by L-NOARG but strongly inhibited by ODQ; neither enzyme inhibitor affected relaxations to 8 -Br-cyclic GMP (10 [*]μM).
