40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{accurately}} simulate the <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviors</b> of food objects undergoing a loading-unloading operation using finite element (FE) model. Due to the presence of residual deformation, it is difficult to model <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Especially, it is hard to accurately reproduce both rheological force and residual deformation simultaneously. In this study, objects made of food materials were tested. Force and deformation measurements were recorded for parameter estimation. Constitutive models were investigated for describing <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviors.</b> A parallel five-element model including two dual-moduli viscous elements was proposed to accurately predict both rheological force and residual deformation simultaneously. 2 D/ 3 D FE model was formulated for simulating <b>rheological</b> <b>behaviors.</b> To estimate the parameters, an effective four-step method was established based on nonlinear optimization which aimed at minimizing the differences of forces and deformation between simulation and experiments.

50|$|There are {{two major}} die types for coextrusion: single {{manifold}} and multi manifold. Both types rely on a separate extruder for each polymer chemistry. In multi manifold dies, each layer is extruded separately and only combined just before the die lips.

Single manifold dies form the multiple layers into a single layer, allowing contact between the polymer layers {{for a longer period}} of time.

Since 1990 ’s, for the sake of reducing the manufacturing costs of ceramics and enhancing material reliability, the in-situ consolidation colloid forming processes of ceramics have been investigated. The two sorts of in-situ consolidation colloid forming processes which have been paid great attention to at present are direct coagulation casting (DCC) and gelcasting. Compared with other forming processes of ceramics, for example, dry pressing, isostatic pressing etc. DCC and gelcasting are able to remove flocculations and coagulations in ceramics powders as near net shape forming processes of ceramics with high strength and good homogeneity of green body [1]. Thus the purpose of reducing manufacturing costs and enhancing material reliability are to be achieved. And the precondition of the in-situ consolidation colloid forming is the preparation of concentrated suspension, the most important of which is the preparation of homogeneous ceramics aqueous suspension with high solid loading and low viscosity...|$|R

5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated spring to a disk or bob spindle immersed in test fluid and the spring deflection measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, Brookfield viscosities measured under the same conditions (model, spindle, speed, temperature, time of test, container, and any other sample preparation procedures that may affect the behavior of the fluid) can be compared. When developing a new test method, trial and error is often necessary {{in order to determine the}} proper spindle and speeds. Successful test methods will deliver a % torque reading between 10 and 100. The <b>rheological</b> <b>behavior</b> of the test fluid can be observed using the same spindle at different speeds, but because the geometry of the fluid around a rotating bob or disk spindle in a large container does not allow a single shear rate to be assigned, proper rheometry is not feasible using this setup.|$|E
