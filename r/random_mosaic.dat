After recalling briefly the results before 1959, sets with positive reach and their associated curvature measures are introduced. We develop an integral and current representation of these curvature measures and show how the current representation helps to prove integralgeometric formulas, such as the principal kinematic formula.

We attribute the attraction to correlation between negative and positive regions on opposing surfaces, facilitated by the lateral mobility of the charge patches on the surfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{concept that}} all complex life {{evolved from a}} simple bacterium-like life form has been questioned by comparative genomics and proteomics. Several discoveries, including the occurrence of entirely new genes in unexpected life forms without any precursors, and the <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> distribution of genes across organisms in higher taxa undermine the principal assertions of this theory. We present {{a new model of}} the pre-biotic parallel evolution of eukaryotic genomes starting with the structurally complex split genes, which are far more probable of supporting biological information and of occurring in random DNA sequences than contiguous genes. By comparing the mosaic patterns of simulated genomes and extant genomes, we show that genomes arising from simulated assembly of random split genes form the same gene distribution patterns observed in extant eukaryotes. This parallel genome origin model eliminates the post-genomic and classical conundrums faced by the linear branching evolution model. |$|E

In the fly eye, the <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> of color-detecting R 7 photoreceptor subtypes is determined by stochastic ON/OFF expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). In a genome-wide association study, we identified a naturally occurring insertion in a regulatory DNA element in ss that lowers the ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. This change in photoreceptor fates shifts the innate color preference of flies from green to blue. The genetic variant increases the binding affinity for Klumpfuss (Klu), a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates ss expression. Klu is expressed at intermediate levels to determine the normal ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. Thus, binding site affinity and transcription factor levels are finely tuned to regulate stochastic expression, setting the ratio of alternative fates and ultimately determining color preference...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare {{different}} policy instruments for cost-effective habitat conservation on agricultural lands, when the desired spatial pattern of reserves is a <b>random</b> <b>mosaic.</b> We use a spatially explicit mathematical programming model which studies the farmers' behavior as profit maximizers under technical and administrative constraints. Facing different policy measures, each farmer chooses its land-use at the field level, which determines the landscape at the regional level. A spatial pattern index (Ripley L function) is then associated to the obtained landscape, indicating on the degree of dispersion of the reserve. We compare a subsidy per hectare of reserve with an auction scheme and an agglomeration malus. We find that the auction is superior to the uniform subsidy both for cost-efficiency and for the spatial pattern of the reserve. The agglomeration malus does better than the auction for the spatial pattern but is more costly. agri-environmental policies, biodiversity, mathematical programming, spatial optimization, reserve design, cost-efficiency, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, H 23, Q 57, Q 12, Q 28,...|$|E

The size of large cells is measured by a class of general functionals. The main result implies that the asymptotic shapes of large cells are completely determined by the extremal bodies of an inequality of isoperimetric type, which connects the size functional and the expected number of hyperplanes of the generating process hitting a given convex body.

Consequently, mosaics of connected interneurons either may show some type of correlation to photoreceptor placement or may establish an independent lattice with compensatory dendritic organization. Since axonless horizontal cells (A-HC’s) are supposed to direct all dendrites to overlying cones, we studied their spatial interaction with chromatic cone subclasses. In the cheetah, the bobcat, and the leopard, anti-S-opsin antibodies have consistently colabeled the A-HC’s {{in addition to the}} S cones. We investigated the interaction between the two cell mosaics, using autocorrelation and cross-correlation procedures, including a Voronoi-based density probe. Comparisons with simulations of <b>random</b> <b>mosaics</b> show significantly lower densities of S cones above the cell bodies and primary dendrites of A-HC’s.

Many generations are required to reach inbreeding, and so a number of investigators have sought to make use of phenotype and genotype data on mice from intermediate generations during the formation of the CC lines (so-called pre-CC mice). The development of a hidden Markov model for genotype reconstruction in such pre-CC mice, on the basis of incompletely informative genetic markers (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms), formally requires the two-locus genotype probabilities at an arbitrary generation along the path to inbreeding. In this article, I describe my efforts to calculate such probabilities. While closed-form solutions for the two-locus genotype probabilities could not be derived, I provide a prescription for calculating such probabilities numerically.

The size range, as estimated from 801 microspherules, vary from 3 to 100 μm, with a peak size distribution between 10 - 20 μm. Three broad shapes are recognized : spherical-, drop- and rocket-shaped, all categories including hollow particles. The surface textures as studied from scanning electron microscope show five dominant varieties : <b>random</b> <b>mosaic,</b> dendritic mosaic, feather crystal, scaly and cracked, with intermediate textures between these types.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a severe progressive muscular disorder caused by reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, preventing {{the synthesis of}} functional dystrophin. As dystrophin provides muscle fiber stability during contractions, dystrophin negative fibers are prone to exercise-induced damage. Upon exhaustion of the regenerative capacity, fibers {{will be replaced by}} fibrotic and fat tissue resulting in a progressive loss of function eventually leading to death in the early thirties. With several promising approaches for the treatment of DMD aiming at dystrophin restoration in clinical trials, there is an increasing need to determine more precisely which dystrophin levels are sufficient to restore muscle fiber integrity, protect against muscle damage and improve muscle function. To address this we generated a new mouse model (mdx-Xist Dhs) with varying, low dystrophin levels (3 – 47 %, mean 22. 7 %, stdev 12. 1, n = 24) due to skewed X-inactivation. Longitudinal sections revealed that within individual fibers, some nuclei did and some did not express dystrophin, resulting in a <b>random,</b> <b>mosaic</b> pattern of dystrophin expression within fibers. Mdx-Xist Dhs, mdx and wild type females underwent a 12 week functional test regime consisting of different tests to assess muscle function at base line, or after chronic treadmill running exercise. Overall, mdx-Xist Dhs mice with 3 – 14 % dystrophin outperformed mdx mice in the functional tests. Improved histopathology was observed in mice with 15 – 29 % dystrophin and these levels also resulted in normalized expression of pro-inflammatory biomarker genes, while for other parameters. 30 % of dystrophin was needed...|$|E
40|$|Across {{the animal}} kingdom, {{specialized}} sensory epithelia {{are used for}} photoreception, allowing individuals to interact with their environment based on visual cues. Generally, neuronal photoreceptor cells (PRs) are organized in the retina, a specialized part of body tissue exposed to the outside world, and transform the energy of incoming electromagnetic radiation into neuronal excitation. This process depends on the large family of opsin proteins which are required in PRs of all animal species. This lead to the theory, that the very divergent eye structures may share a common ancestor, although they most likely arose several times independently during evolution. PRs transmit their electrical excitation to higher order neurons, which are organized in the brain of the animal. How the brain then integrates the incoming signals from a multitude of PRs to reproduce a reliable representation of the world {{remains one of the}} central questions of neurobiology. Most animals can extract different kinds of visual information from their environment. Besides detecting the shape and movement of objects, additional qualities like color or degree of polarization can also be distinguished. In most cases, different classes of PRs are used for each of these visual tasks. For instance, color discrimination is achieved by comparing the outputs of PRs having different spectral sensitivity, as they express different opsin molecules. In humans, three different subclasses of so-called cone PRs, are specialized to absorb light of either short, medium or long wavelengths, corresponding to blue, green or red colors, respectively. Loss of any one of these PR classes leads to a dramatic impairment in the ability to discriminate between colors. Cones are most highly concentrated {{in the center of the}} retina (fovea), where the three subclasses form a <b>random</b> <b>mosaic.</b> Much remains to be understood about how different PR subtypes choose expression of their opsin and how they distribute in the retina. The developing eye of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster was used here as a model system to investigate both nature and regulation of the different strategies involved in retinal patterning. The adult Drosophila eye consists of ~ 800 stereotypical unit eyes (ommatidia), each containing exactly 8 PRs (R 1 -R 8). The six �outer PRs� (R 1 -R 6) are molecularly identical in all ommtidia as they always express the same opsin. They form a separate visual system contributing to the detection of shapes and motion. The morphological and molecular differences between inner PRs (R 7 and R 8) from different ommatidia leads to the formation of a retinal mosaic in Drosophila. Three ommatidial subtypes can be distinguished: while the ommatidia of the �dorsal rim area� (DRA) are always found precisely localized in the dorsal periphery, the remaining �pale� and yellow� ommatidia are distributed stochastically through the rest of the retina. Only DRA ommatidia can be identified based on morphologic criteria, as these ommatidia form a polarizing filter which the fly uses to measure e-vector orientation of polarized sunlight for navigational purposes. The remaining two ommatidial subtypes are believed to serve color discrimination. They can only be identified based on the combination of opsins their inner PRs express. In order to identify genes and pathways involved in generating the retinal mosaic in Drosophila, a GAL 4 enhancer trap screen was performed. Genes exhibiting expression patterns similar to inner PR opsins were analyzed genetically. The homeodomain transcription factor Homothorax (Hth) was identified as the key regulator of DRA specification. Hth is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the polarization sensors. During pupal development, positional information provided by the diffusible morphogen Wingless (Wg), as well as the dorsal selector genes of the Iroquois complex (IRO-C) and the gene optomotorblind (omb) get integrated, leading to the specific induction of Hth expression in inner PRs of prospective DRA ommatidia. In contrast to this localized specification approach, stochastic expression of the Drosophila arylhydrocarbon receptor Spineless (Ss) in a large subset of pupal R 7 cells is responsible for the specification of color ommtidia. Ss is both necessary and sufficient to induce the �yellow� R 7 fate (yR 7). Ss was therefore identified as the key effector of a stochastic specification approach. How stochastic expression of Ss is regulated, remains obscure. However, an activating effect of the Notch (N) pathway on yR 7 specification indicates that retinal patterning in Drosophila might combine the inductive effects of both wg and N signaling once again during pupal development. Further investigation of the regulatory relationship between Hth and Ss (or Wg and N) will provide a better understanding how retinal patterning contributes to the integration of different kinds of visual information...|$|E

40|$|Butterfly color {{patterns}} are built as finely tiles mosaics of colored scales, each {{the product of}} a single epidermal cell. The overall pattern is composed of a small number of pigments. Each scale appears to make an all-or-none “choice ” to synthesize only one of this small set of alternative pigments. Gradual transitions from one color to another on the wing are accomplished by graded changes in the proportions of discretely colored scales, and areas of intermediate coloration are made up of a <b>random</b> salt-and-pepper <b>mosaic</b> of discretely colored scales. In transition regions, and at boundaries between colors, scales also exhibit stochastic patterns of pigment expression. A model for a stochastic mechanism for gene expression is presented that can account for the observed stochastic patterns of pigmentation. This model shows that stochastic gene expression provides a simple mechanism for establishing a step-like, or threshold, response to a spatially graded signal. Conditions that affect the steepness of the threshold are examined. It is shown that stochastic gene expression also results in the emergence of interesting patterns of dominance among the alleles of a gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolving}} {{history of}} the small intestinal biopsy and its interpretation—and misinterpretations—are described in this paper. Certain interpretative errors in the technical approaches to histological assessment are highlighted—even though we may never be rid of them. For example, mucosal “flattening” does not reduce individual villi to their cores, as {{still seems to be}} widely believed. Neither is the mucosa undergoing an atrophic process—since it can recover structurally. Rather, the intestinal mucosa manifests a vast hypertrophic response resulting in the formation of large plateaus formed from partially reduced villi and their amalgamation with the now increased height and width of the inter‐villous ridges: this is associated with considerable increases in crypt volumes. Sections through mosaic plateaus gives an erroneous impression of the presence of stunted, flat‐topped villi which continues to encourage both the continued use of irrelevant “atrophy” terminologies and a marked failure to perceive what <b>random</b> sections through <b>mosaic</b> plateaus actually look like. While reviewing the extensive 40 + year literature on mucosal analysis, we extracted data on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) counts from 607 biopsies, and applied receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) ‐curve analysis. From that perspective, it appears that counting IEL/ 100 enterocyte nuclei in routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) sections provides the most useful discriminator of celiac mucosae at histological level, with an effective cut‐off of 27 IEL, and offering a very high sensitivity with few false negatives. ROC‐curve analysis also revealed the somewhat lesser accuracies of either CD 3 + or γδ+ IEL counts. Current official guidelines seem to be somewhat inadequate in clearly defining the spectrum of gluten‐induced mucosal pathologies and how they could be optimally interpreted, as well as in promoting the ideal manner for physicians and pathologists to interact in interpreting intestinal mucosae submitted for analysis. Future trends should incorporate 3 ‐D printing and computerised modelling in order to exemplify the subtle micro‐anatomical features associated with the crypt‐villus interzone. The latter needs precise delineation with use of mRNA in‐section assays for brush border enzymes such as alkaline phosphate and esterase. Other additional approaches are needed to facilitate recognition and interpretation of the features of this important inter‐zone, such as wells, basins and hypertrophic alterations in the size of inter‐villous ridges. The 3 ‐D computerised models could considerably expand our understandings of the microvasculature and its changes—in relation both to crypt hypertrophy, in addition to the partial attrition and subsequent regrowth of villi from the inter‐villous ridges during the flattening and recovery processes, respectively...|$|R
