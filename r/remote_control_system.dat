The transmitter part {{is divided}} into two parts, the RF remote control and the transmitter module. This allows the transmitter module {{to be used as a}} component in a larger application. The transmitter module is small, but users must have detailed knowledge to use it; combined with the RF remote control it is much simpler to use.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the British government announced an award of £25,000 to anyone who could create a weapon against zeppelins or remotely control unmanned vehicles. Matthews claimed that he had created a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that used selenium cells. He successfully demonstrated it with a remotely controlled boat to representatives of the Admiralty at Richmond Park's Penn Pond. He received his £25,000 but the admiralty never used the invention.|$|E

The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings in the event of possible enemy attack during the Cold War. Whitney is also credited with creating many of the remote control systems used by radio stations, including the microwave <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The National Association of Broadcasters presented Whitney with its annual Engineering Award on April 7, 1970, for his work.|$|E

2500|$|Video game {{consoles}} had not used wireless controllers until recently, {{mainly because of}} the difficulty involved in playing the game while keeping the infrared transmitter pointed at the console, or like the Wii whose remotes require line of sight to the infrared sensor bar. [...] Early wireless controllers were cumbersome and when powered on alkaline batteries, lasted only a few hours before they needed replacement. Some wireless controllers were produced by third parties, in most cases using a radio link instead of infrared. Even these were very inconsistent, and in some cases, had transmission delays, making them virtually useless. Some examples include the Double Player for NES, the Master System <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> <b>System</b> and the Wireless Dual Shot for the PlayStation.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon with 150 rounds {{was fixed}} on the lower {{starboard}} side of the nose; it was fired by the pilot who had a primitive ring sight to use for aiming. The dorsal turret mounted two [...] Berezin B-20E guns with 400 rounds per gun and was capable of almost 360° of traverse; special microswitches prevented the gunner from firing into the bomber's tail. The turret was remotely controlled by the radio operator and was powered by electric motors for both traverse and elevation. The gunner and his gunsight used a small observation blister {{at the rear of}} the main crew compartment to lay the guns on their target. The sight automatically compensated for parallax between the gunner and the turret as well as the required amount of target lead and the shell's ballistics. The remote-control system offered several advantages including a smaller turret that had less drag, the guns could be fixed more rigidly to their mounts, the sight was not exposed to vibrations from firing and could track targets more smoothly and the gunner's comfort did not have to be sacrificed to optimize the performance of the turret. The major disadvantage, of course, was that the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was exceedingly complicated for the period and prone to breaking down. The rear gunner was placed at the very tail of the Il-22 to optimize his field of fire in an electro-hydraulically powered Il-KU3 turret that mounted another NS-23 cannon. The turret could traverse a total of 140°, elevate 35° and depress 30°.|$|E

50|$|Work using Drosophila has {{dispensed}} with stimulating electrodes {{and developed a}} 3-part <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that evokes action potentials in pre-specified Drosophila neurons using a laser beam. The central component of the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is a Ligand-gated ion channel gated by ATP. When ATP is applied, uptake of external calcium is induced and action potentials generated. The remaining {{two parts of the}} <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> include chemically caged ATP, which is injected into the central nervous system through the fly's simple eye, and laser light capable of uncaging the injected ATP. The giant fibre system in insects consists of a pair of large interneurons in the brain which can excite the insect flight and jump muscles. A 200 ms pulse of laser light elicited jumping, wing flapping, or other flight movements in 60%-80% of the flies. Although this frequency is lower than that observed with direct electrical stimulation of the giant fibre system, it is higher than that elicited by natural stimuli, such as a light-off stimulus.|$|E
