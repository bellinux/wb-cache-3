50|$|As of mid-2004, the US had ACSAs with 76 countries, {{including}} most NATO nations, {{as well as}} the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), NATO Allied Command Transformation, and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). ACSAs diminish logistics burdens and are considered vital logistics enablers by providing on site commanders increased interoperability, enhanced operational readiness and cost effective joint support.

40|$|This {{unpublished}} paper, {{written for}} distribution on the OPE-L list, seeks {{to clarify the}} conception of socially necessary labour time in Marx’s conception of value. It shows {{that this is not}} reducible to ‘replacement cost’ as simultaneist authors argue. Moreover that the implied conception of a compulsion upon capitalists to replace consumed inputs, along with attendant concepts such as a physical surplus product arising from <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> is alien to Marx’s thinking. The notion of replacement cost leads to obvious logical contradiction, and a full treatment must account properly for stocks of constant capital. This is an earlier version of the paper by the same name that was submitted to the 1995 conference of the Eastern Economic Association...|$|E

40|$|Damages caused to {{agriculture}} and horticulture by defensive measures could be reimbursed in various ways. Reimbursement could be by replacement at government expense, <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> or by financial compensation. Three systems were draughted for estimating damages in field cropping or pasturing: 1. The book-keeping method {{in which the}} financial surplus was calculated on the damaged farm and similar undamaged farms; 2. Immediate settlement based on {{an estimate of the}} surplus for the crop derived from data on this crop for 3 similar farms; 3. Fixed damages, which were an extreme simplification of method 1. These systems were equally suitable for estimating compensation in land reallocations and in land acquisition for roads. The principle of damage estimates by calculating farm profits after excluding 'internal risks' was important for many studies on farm economics, especially studies on the financial consequences of changes in farming system. <p/...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} sandstone masonry of Durham Castle, a World Heritage site located in Durham, England. The study encompasses {{a focus on}} its current condition, deterioration mechanisms, and in particular, alveolar erosion, {{and the performance of}} previous repair techniques. The stone and weathering observed at the castle appear to be consistent across the entire site, regardless of age or location and are representative of other buildings in the area. The obvious diagnosis therefore appears {{to be related to the}} geo-chemical nature of the stone more than any other single factor. Alveolar erosion is particularly evident and poses the greatest risk given its resultant loss of stone and unit volume, leading to visual disfigurement and structural instability. Because of this long-lived problem, composite mortar repairs and stone replacement have frequently been performed on the castle. This study researches this current deterioration mechanism through literature reviews, archival research, on-site survey and investigation, and material analysis including thin section petrography, soluble salt and clay identification, porosity, and water absorption/desorption. This study concludes with possible sources of alveolar erosion at Durham Castle and conservation recommendations to maximize the retention of original stone through both preventive and remedial treatments before <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> becomes necessary...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{defines the}} baseline scope, schedule, and cost {{requirements of the}} Nuclear Materials Safeguards System (NMSS) replacement for the Plutonium Finishing Plant. The Nuclear Material Safeguards System (NMSS), operating in PFP, comprises data from several site safeguards systems that have been merged since 1987. NMSS was designed and implemented {{to the state of}} computer technology for the mid 1970 `s. Since implementation, the hardware vendor has stopped producing computer systems and the availability of personnel trained and willing to work with the technology has diminished. Maintenance has become expensive and `reliability is a serious concern. -This effort provides a <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> of the NMSS, using modern, scalable, upgradable hardware and software to the same standards used for the Hanford Local Area Network (HLAN) system. The NMSS Replacement is a Client/Server architecture designed on a Personal Computer based local area network (LAN) platform. The LAN is provided through an ethernet interface running the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This architecture conforms to the HLAN standard, including the End System Operating Environment (ESOE). The Server runs the Microsoft Windows NT` Server operating system, Microsoft SQL Server 2 database management system, and application tools. Clients run Microsoft Windows` and application software provided as part of the system. The interface between the clients and the database is through Microsoft ODBC 4...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveHeart valve {{abnormalities}} {{are commonly}} found in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome but experience with valve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> such patients is limited. We analyzed the results of valve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> patients with this condition at our institution. MethodsBetween 1989 and 2002, 10 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (8 women, 2 men; aged 38 - 73 years, mean 49 years) with severe mitral valve disease (n = 7), aortic valve disease (n = 2), or combined mitral-aortic disease (n = 1) underwent valve replacement. We reviewed retrospectively their clinical data, operative and postoperative courses, and the long-term results. Pathological reassessment was performed in all cases. ResultsProcedures performed included mitral valve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> 7 patients, aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> 2 patients, and combined aortic valve replacement plus mitral valve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> 1 patient. In addition, 2 patients underwent tricuspid annuloplasty. The immediate mortality was 20 % (2 patients). Major complications occurred in 2 other cases. During a follow-up period of up to 8 years, 2 patients required repeat operation for valve-related complications (1 death). An additional patient died of cardiac causes 13 months after surgery. One patient had major thromboembolic events 3 and 10 months after the operation. The late outcome was uneventful in only 4 patients. ConclusionValve <b>replacement</b> <b>in</b> patients with antiphospholipid syndrome may carry significant early and late mortality and morbidity, particularly when such patients are referred with advanced valvular heart disease...|$|R
