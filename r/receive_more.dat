5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> precipitation than the western areas since they <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E
5|$|The TSO {{board had}} not renewed the musicians' {{contracts}} {{hoping that it}} would <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> concert invitations from the United States. However, it received only eight invitations in the following four years, all {{from the state of}} Michigan. The eighth tour had to be cancelled because of a snowstorm.|$|E

In March 1999, A-10s escorted and supported search and rescue helicopters in finding a downed F-117 pilot. The A-10s were deployed to support search and rescue missions, but over time the Warthogs began to <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> ground attack missions. The A-10's first successful attack in Operation Allied Force happened on 6 April 1999; A-10s remained in action until combat ended in late June 1999.|$|E

5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

25|$|The Prohibition Party has {{continued}} running presidential candidates every four years, but its vote totals have steadily dwindled.

5|$|Previous {{collaborative}} efforts between Britain and France had been complicated – the AFVG programme ended in cancellation, and controversy surrounded {{the development of}} the supersonic airliner Concorde. Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well, when Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super Étendard naval attack aircraft and the Mirage F1, for which it would <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> profit, over the Anglo-French Jaguar.|$|E

The party was strongest in the West and South, {{but in no}} state did Weaver <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> than 12% of the vote, and his nationwide total was just 3%. That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.|$|E

5|$|His last novel, Hamlet oder Die lange Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Tales of a Long Night), was {{published}} in 1956, and was favorably received. Döblin's remaining years were marked by poor health (he had Parkinson's disease) and lengthy stays in multiple clinics and hospitals, including his alma mater, Freiburg University. Through the intervention of Theodor Heuss and Joachim Tiburtius, {{he was able to}} <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> money from the Berlin office in charge of compensating victims of Nazi persecution; this, and a literary prize from the Mainz Academy in the sum of 10,000 DM helped finance his growing medical expenses.|$|E

Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, Miller {{divorced}} {{his wife}} Peg, {{with whom he}} had four sons. He did so to marry his long-term mistress Marie Challman, {{with whom he had}} been living since 1999. Challman was a hospital receptionist and Miller reasoned that he would <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> effective medical treatment by moving to Melbourne to live with her, as his specialist doctors also lived there. He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was photographed in public. During his later years, his illness contributed to what his family felt was a deteriorating attitude and he fell out with his sons, but they were reconciled shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Kelly, {{naturally}} a first baseman, saw regular time as {{a second}} baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base. With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade {{so that he could}} <b>receive</b> <b>more</b> playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush. The Reds traded Roush due to a contract dispute. With Wally Pipp at first base for the Reds, Kelly was slated to play center field. The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to first base.|$|E

Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies. The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand-by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred. Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert, though none issued evacuations.
