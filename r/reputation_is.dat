5|$|Although the Saturn {{is remembered}} for several well-regarded games, {{including}} Nights into Dreams, the Panzer Dragoon series, and the Virtua Fighter series, its <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> mixed {{due to its}} complex hardware design and limited third-party support.

5|$|The square is a tree-lined {{section of}} Millennium Park {{with a large}} lawn. The area {{broadcasts}} free wifi wireless technology. The square has {{earned a reputation as}} an outdoor culture spot by hosting a wide range of cultural events such as local and international art and photography exhibitions, as well as occasional live musical performances. This <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of the earlier neo-classical meeting place. When Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley dedicated the square, it was dedicated to the donors, known as the Founders Group, who funded Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Foshan is a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts, where various schools {{actively}} recruit disciples {{and compete}} against each other. Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man {{is the most}} skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and keeps a low profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often resentful {{of the time he}} spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{which has}} likely done the {{greatest}} damage to Harding's <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> Teapot Dome. Like {{most of the}} administration's scandals, it came to light after Harding's death, {{and he was not}} aware of the illegal aspects. Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside {{for the use of the}} Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary Franklin Knight Lane was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior. This was done with the consent of Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby.|$|E
5|$|Rhys discovers Zak and Gilly are {{planning}} a strip show at nightclub The Loft. Rhys agrees to join, however, is replaced by Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle). During the strip show, Rhys tries to chat up a girl, who is only interested in Gilly. Gilly meets a young woman named Molly Traverse (Kate Deakin), whom he is put off by when she mentions marriage. During her battle with anorexia, Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby) and friend, Melissa Hurst (Carla Chases), begin being horrible to Gilly. Hannah hits him, however, after returning from hospital, she apologises. After finding out his girlfriend Beth is his half-sister, Rhys begins being jealous after she and Gilly grow close. Gilly and Beth grow closer and kiss. They start a relationship and agree to take it slowly. Gilly decides to become a lifeguard. Whilst cleaning up, Gilly sees boss, Simon Crosby (Simon Lawson), leaving a cubicle with a crying child. Gilly automatically assumes he is a paedophile. Gilly breaks into Simon's house and finds pictures of children in their swimwear, {{one of whom is}} Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins). He also finds a boy's room with a lock on the door. Gilly shows various residents the proof. Angry parents begin to gather outside Simon's home and vandalise it by smashing the windows. Realsing his <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> ruined, Simon attempts suicide. Simon's wife Gemma Grosby (Gemma Langford) shows Gilly a picture of their son, who died. Gilly realises Simon is innocent and feels guilty.|$|E

40|$|Residents and {{non-residents}} {{are likely}} to think differently about a neighbourhood's <b>reputation.</b> Relatively little <b>is</b> known about {{the similarities and differences}} between these internal and external types of neighbourhood reputation or the relationship between reputations and 'real' or 'objective' neighbourhood characteristics. This paper addresses two points: first, the extent to which neighbourhood reputations differ between and within groups; second, {{the extent to which these}} neighbourhood <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> associated with measured neighbourhood characteristics. Data from a specially designed survey carried out in 24 neighbourhoods in Utrecht, the fourth largest city in the Netherlands, are used. Analysis of the data showed that neighbourhood <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> rated higher by residents and estate agents than by other city residents. Within the group of other city residents, differences were found in how neighbourhood <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> rated by socio-economic status, ethnicity and educational background. Further, it was found that neighbourhood <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> correlated with measured social characteristics of the neighbourhood, while physical and functional neighbourhood characteristics are of less importance.

25|$|The {{evolution}} of her <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> {{a case study}} in the maxim that each age creates its own history. If Eleanor of Castile can no longer be seen as a paradigm of queenly virtues, her career can now be examined as the achievement of an intelligent and determined woman who was able {{to meet the challenges of}} an exceptionally demanding life.|$|E
25|$|Hitotsubashi is a {{specialized}} institution only in social science, {{thus it is}} not as well known as other big universities such as University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Although it has only social science departments and the place in the university rankings is always underrated, the <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> very high. Consequently, its outstanding position in Japan {{can be seen in the}} several rankings below.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{succession of}} humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilya. Her best friend encourages {{her to join}} her in prostitution, but Lilya declines. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and says the money belongs to Lilya, whose <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> subsequently ruined {{in the community and}} at school, culminating in her being raped by a group of boys she knows. Lilya ultimately has to actually become a prostitute to support herself.|$|E

25|$|Robert Young Pelton (born July 25, 1955 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian-American author, {{journalist}} and documentary filmmaker. Pelton's journalistic work usually consists of conflict reporting {{and interviews with}} military and political figures in warzones. His career is notable {{because of the number}} of conflict zones he has reported from and the breadth of important figures he has interviewed. His <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> built on his history of entering forbidden, deadly and violent places.|$|E
25|$|During these tours, they {{continued}} to collect folksongs, and Rosalind alerted Cecil Sharp {{to the work of}} Olive Dame Campbell; he immediately undertook the research on which half of his <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> founded. After Walter married Crystal Eastman, the great socialist feminist, Rosalind (who had embraced a philosophy of free love long before she knew what this actually implied) had sex with Crystal’s brother Max. Shortly after, she slept with Walter's friend Norman Angell. She maintained intimate relations with both men for many years.|$|E
25|$|Downing was {{undoubtedly}} {{a man of}} great political, diplomatic, and financial ability, but his character has often been maligned by his enemies because of his willingness {{to make the most of}} changing political circumstances, and to brutally betray former comrades in order to win favour from his current masters. Today his <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> undergoing a revision among scholars of the period as his contributions as a financial reformer and diplomat are again recognised. On the other hand, one of his many less attractive personal qualities – miserliness – is well-documented.|$|E
50|$|Émile Amélineau (1850 - 12 January 1915 at Châteaudun) was a French Coptologist, {{archaeologist}} and Egyptologist. His scholarly <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> {{established as}} an editor of previously unpublished Coptic texts. But his <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> destroyed by {{his work as a}} digger at Abydos, after Flinders Petrie re-excavated the site and showed how much destruction Amélineau had wrought.|$|R

25|$|The more fearsome a mafioso's <b>reputation</b> <b>is,</b> {{the more}} he can win {{disputes}} without having recourse to violence. It can even happen that a mafioso who loses his means to commit violence (e.g. his soldiers are all in prison) can still use his reputation to intimidate and provide protection if everyone is unaware of his weakness and still believes in his power. However, in the tough world of the Mafia, such bluffs generally do not last long, as his rivals will soon sense his weakness and challenge him.|$|E
25|$|Although Rawdon knows Becky is {{attractive}} to men, he believes her <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> spotless {{even though she is}} widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.|$|E
25|$|Although Dryden's <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> greater today, contemporaries saw the 1670s and 1680s as {{the age of}} courtier poets in general, and Edmund Waller was as praised as any. Dryden, Rochester, Buckingham, and Dorset {{dominated}} verse, and {{all were}} attached {{to the court of}} Charles. Aphra Behn, Matthew Prior, and Robert Gould, by contrast, were outsiders who were profoundly royalist. The court poets follow no one particular style, except that they all show sexual awareness, a willingness to satirise, and a dependence upon wit to dominate their opponents. Each of these poets wrote for the stage as well as the page. Of these, Behn, Dryden, Rochester, and Gould deserve some separate mention.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, {{the current}} revival of her {{reputation}} rides {{on the work}} Oroonoko (1688), {{a story that is}} taken to promote modern, progressive views on gender, race and class. Todd maintains that the fiction has been co-opted by modern interests and that such views are not views that Behn clearly expressed. Her <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> not helped by the fact that almost nothing is known of her first 27 years; and while she was a pioneer, she also faced debt for much of her life and was a propagandist and writer for hire. She was ambitious, desiring fame and literary prestige, which for a woman of the time and in times since, is often regarded as suspect.|$|E
25|$|John S. Monagan, {{who was a}} {{prolific}} author {{in addition to his}} political responsibilities, served as Waterbury's mayor from 1943 to 1948. He also served as its district's congressional representative from 1959 to 1973. George Harlamon, a member of the Waterbury Hall of Fame, was the city's 40th mayor. He served from 1969 to 1970 during a period of racial tension. The city is known for its hard-nosed political culture compared locally to Cook County, Illinois, close elections, and a number of scandals. This <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> so solidified that U.S. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman once joked that upon his death, he hoped to be buried in Waterbury so he could remain politically active.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seven}} years when he was {{prevented}} from teaching, he produced, besides the Fragments, the edition {{of the works of}} Proclus (6 vols., 1820-1827), and the works of René Descartes (II vols., 1826). He also commenced his Translation of Plato (13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One sees in the Fragments very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the Fragments of 1826 that the first great widening of his <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> associated. In 1827 followed the Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie.|$|E
