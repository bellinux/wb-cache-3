The final temperature of the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about −5 °C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30-50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall.

5000|$|The {{choice of}} which space heating or cooling {{technology}} {{to use in}} buildings can {{have a significant impact}} on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient natural gas furnace with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. Ground source heat pumps can be even more energy efficient and cost effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> around a thermodynamic cycle in order to [...] "pump" [...] heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.|$|E

This research studied {{the influence of the}} operating conditions on the ice crystal size and the draw temperature of the sorbet during the freezing process. The evolution of ice crystal size was tracked with the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique, which uses an in situ sensor that makes it possible to monitor online the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> temperature had the most significant influence on the mean ice crystal chord length, followed by the dasher speed, whereas the mix flow rate had no significant influence. A decrease in the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> temperature led to a reduction in ice crystal size, due to the growth of more small ice crystals left behind on the scraped wall from previous scrapings. Increasing the dasher speed slightly reduced the mean ice crystal chord length, due to the production of new small ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. For a given <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> temperature and dasher speed, low mix flow rates resulted in lower draw temperatures, {{due to the fact that}} the product remains in contact with the freezer wall longer. High dasher speeds warmed the product slightly, due to the dissipation of frictional energy in the product, the effect of which was in part moderated by the improvement in the heat transfer coefficient between the product and the freezer wall.

During sorbet and ice cream manufacturing, a narrow ice crystal size distribution with a small mean size is desired, {{in order to obtain}} a smooth texture in the final product. This research studied the influence of the mix flow rate, the evaporation temperature of the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> and the dasher speed on the ice crystal size and the draw temperature during sorbet freezing, so as to identify optimal operating conditions. The evolution of the ice crystal size was followed by the focused beam reflectance method (FBRM), which uses an in situ sensor that provides accurate and repeatable information about the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals. Our results showed that the FBRM sensor is a promising tool which makes it possible to monitor online the development of the ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. Decreasing the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>fluid</b> temperature allows us to reduce the ice crystal size and to lower the product's temperature, due to the increase of the supercooling driving force. High dasher speeds slightly decrease the ice crystal chord length, due to the attrition of the bigger ice crystals, which produces new smaller ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. Also, an increase of the dasher speed slightly warms the product, due to the dissipation of frictional energy into the product. Low mix flow rates result in lower draw temperatures because the product remains longer in contact with the freezer wall extracting thus more heat from the product...|$|E
