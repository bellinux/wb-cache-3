5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against the <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> took place in the sport. As a result of protests and communities coming together to support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E

25|$|Some African American {{students}} have reported feeling that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class.

The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a deep futures {{analysis}} of "race" {{and the many}} <b>racisms</b> <b>that</b> compete to colonize the future. Using poststructuralism it challenges the frames that shape our thinking on race and the "Other". Cultural narrative and boundary drawing are explored as sources of racist frames. Three distinct possible scenarios along with their defining myths and metaphors are also examined. The hidden economy of racism is also addressed as it underpins economic affluence and cultural hegemony. Finally, questions of integrity and identity are considered from the transformative logic of neohumanism...|$|R

On that same trip they also spent six weeks at Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a kibbutz in the newly established Israel; although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and anti-Arab <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, Jews were {{subjected}} to antisemitism based on Christian theology, which blamed them for killing Jesus. Even after the Reformation, Catholicism and Lutheranism continued to persecute Jews, accusing them of blood libels and subjecting them to pogroms and expulsions. The {{second half of the}} 19th century saw the emergence in the German empire and Austria-Hungary of the völkisch movement, which was developed by such thinkers as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Paul de Lagarde. The movement embraced a pseudo-scientific <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> viewed Jews as a race whose members were locked in mortal combat with the Aryan race for world domination. These ideas became commonplace throughout the Germany, with the professional classes adopting an ideology that did not see humans as racial equals with equal hereditary value. Although the völkisch parties had support in elections at first, by 1914 they were no longer influential. This did not mean that antisemitism had disappeared; instead it was incorporated into the platforms of several mainstream political parties.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} new <b>racisms</b> <b>that</b> {{have emerged in}} Australia and their {{negative}} impact on asylum seekers. After broadly defining new racisms, the characteristics of new racisms {{will be discussed in}} the context of impacting upon asylum seekers. These characeristics include the close linking of new racisms to the promotion of fear of the "other", lslamophobia, the promotion of new fonns of citizenship rights and new definitions of Australian identity. It is argued that the negative portrayal of asylum seekers to justify the Australian govermnent's policies relating to border control and the war on terror has resulted in the racialisation of asylum seeker issues and has resulted in their victimisation, demonisation and social exclusion and has contributed to increased levels of fear and insecurity at the broader community level. In the meantime, there has been a total silence on issues of racism and an official denial <b>that</b> <b>racism</b> exists...|$|R

500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> denies the humanity of Tom Robinson....

500|$|Prior to {{its release}} in North America, 1UP blogger Alejandro Quan-Madrid equated the Moja {{characters}} in LocoRoco to blackface, and citing {{the game as}} an example of [...] "institutionalized <b>racism</b> <b>that</b> needs calling out". Quan-Madrid and 1UP reporter Jemery Parish noted that the Japanese culture does not have the same racial population as western countries like the United States, and as such, blackface or other similar representations of black persons are taken for granted in that country, and localization usually handles such issues. Quan-Madrid called on Sony to make a simple color change to the Moja, similar to what Capcom had done for the character of Oilman in Mega Man Powered Up. Developers for the game, including Kouno, noted that the Moja character design was based on the hairstyle of Keigo Tsuchiya, the game's artist, at the time of development, and did not mean to imply any racist tones. The accusation of racism came days before a similar charge against Sony for an advertisement for the white-colored PSP, portraying a white woman subjugating a black woman.|$|E
500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not <b>racism)</b> <b>that</b> cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
