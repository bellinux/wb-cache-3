This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E

We also estimated direct (costs of hospital stays, drugs, outpatient care) and indirect costs (production losses) related to morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality (years of lost production). Production losses for paid work and unpaid domestic activities were taken into account. Results: The social cost of <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancers</b> (lung, larynx, sinonasal, pleural mesothelioma) attributable to exposure to asbestos, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, painting occupations (unidentified carcinogen), crystalline silica, wood and leather dust in France in 2010 was estimated to be between 960 and 1, 866 million. The cost of lung cancer represents between 804 and 1, 617 million.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inhalation of {{high levels}} of {{airborne}} inorganic arsenic is a recognized cause of <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer.</b> Although multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated this association, {{there have been few}} analyses of the mathematical relationship between cumulative arsenic exposure and risk of <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer,</b> and no assessment as to whether and how arsenic concentration may modify this association. OBJECTIVES: The objective is an evaluation of the shape of the relationship between <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality and cumulative inhaled arsenic exposure among copper smelter workers, and the modification of that relationship by arsenic concentration. METHODS: We used Poisson regression methods to analyze data from a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers under a linear-exponential model for the excess relative risk. RESULTS: Within categories of arsenic concentration, the association between <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> and cumulative arsenic exposure was consistent with linearity. The slope of the linear relationship with cumulative exposure increased with increasing arsenic concentration category. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested a direct concentration effect from inhaled inorganic arsenic, whereby the excess relative risk for a fixed cumulative exposure was greater when delivered at a higher concentration and shorter duration than when delivered at a lower concentration and longer duration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} examine whether methods proposed to control the healthy worker survivor effect would influence the shape or magnitude of the dose-response curve for <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> induced by arsenic. METHODS [...] Results from an unadjusted analysis are compared with results obtained by applying four different methods {{for control of the}} healthy worker survivor effect to data on arsenic exposure and <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer.</b> The four methods are: exposure lag, adjustment for work status, cohort restriction, and the G null test. RESULTS [...] Cohort restriction gave erratic results depending upon the minimum years of follow up used. Exposure lag substantially increased the rate ratios and a non-linear shape (decreasing slope) compared with an unlagged analysis. Adjusting for work status (currently employed upsilon retired or otherwise not employed) yielded slightly higher rate ratios than an unadjusted analysis, with an overall shape similar to the baseline analysis. Results from the G null test procedure of Robins (1986), although not directly comparable with the baseline analysis, did show an adverse effect of exposure that seemed to reach a maximum when exposure was lagged between 10 and 20 years. CONCLUSIONS [...] All results confirm an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer.</b> In these data, it seems that the healthy worker survivor effect was not strong enough to mask the strong effect of arsenic exposure on <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer.</b> Nevertheless, several methods show a stronger association between arsenic exposure and <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> after adjustment for the healthy worker survivor effect, suggesting that for weaker causal associations, studies not controlling for this source of bias will have low power to detect results.

The agents considered in this series all have the potential for widespread community exposures, either because there is widespread long-term exposure (passive smoking), the agents are direct byproducts of energy consumption (organic particles), have ubiquitous production and use patterns (formaldehyde and fibers), or occur widely in natural settings (radon). Several issues [...] measurement of exposure, latency, confounding factors and bias, extrapolation from animals to humans, population at risk, and attributable risk [...] must be considered for each agent. A further issue related to exposure estimates is the relationship of exposure to actual dose. Understanding exposure some 25 to 40 years in the past is important because of the prolonged latency period in the development of respiratory cancers. To the degree that these agents act synergistically with smoking, the reduction of smoking or of exposure to these agents may have greater public health consequences than would be anticipated from the directly measured attributable risk of each of these agents separately...|$|E

Subjects were {{selected on the basis}} of job classification, and cause specific mortality was ascertained for subjects who died (n = 501) up to 1979. The total follow up period was 28. 4 (X 1000) person-years. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for the cohort, based on United States national rates, was 87 (95 % confidence limits 80, 95), and there were no significant differences from expected number of deaths for any specific neoplasm. The directly standardised rate ratio for <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> among diesel exposed subjects relative to unexposed subjects was 1. 42 +/- 0. 50 (means +/- SE). A proportional hazards model was consistent with the findings of the standardised rate ratio, but in neither analysis was the increased risk of <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancer</b> in diesel exposed subjects statistically significant...|$|E
50|$|Malignant {{tumors of the}} {{respiratory}} system, particularly primary carcinomas of the lung, are a major health problem responsible for 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 30% of all cancer deaths. The majority of <b>respiratory</b> system <b>cancers</b> are attributable to smoking tobacco.|$|R
40|$|Werner {{syndrome}} is a premature aging disorder characterized by cancer predisposition that {{is caused by}} loss of the Werner syndrome protein (WRN) helicase/exonuclease DNA repair pro-tein. Hexavalent chromium is an environmental carcinogen and genotoxicant {{that is associated with}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancers</b> and induces several forms of DNA damage, including lesions that interfere with DNA replication. Based on the evidence that WRN protein facilitates repair of stalled and collapsed replication forks, we hypothesized that WRN functions in the cellular response to and recovery from Cr(VI) -induced genotoxicity and genomic instability. Here we report that human cells deficient in WRN protein are hypersensitive to Cr(VI) toxicity, and exhibit a delayed reduction in DNA breaks and stalled replication forks, indicated by gH 2 AX foci, during recovery from Cr(VI) exposure. Cr(VI) -induced WRN protein translocation from the nucleoli int...|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the meta-analysis by Zhang et al. (1). The authors summarized the most recent evidence available (2009 – 2013) {{to address the question}} of whether use of metformin is inversely associated with the risk of cancers of the lung and/or respiratory system. They came to the con-clusion that metformin use appears to be associated with lower risks of lung and <b>respiratory</b> <b>cancers.</b> We contest this conclusion. Zhang et al. included 6 observational studies, 4 of which were cohort studies and 2 of which were case-control studies (2 – 7). They mention that “each study was evaluated with re-gard to the [Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology] statement [8] for ascertainment of data quality ” (1, p. 12). However, they appear to have missed (or ignored) the issue of bias...|$|R
