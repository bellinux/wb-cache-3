There is now particular uncertainty regarding {{the fate of the}} EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the UK, while, beyond the UK, Brexit will again put the spotlight on the EU’s criterion of ‘adequacy’ for data transfers to third countries. These implications will be briefly sketched here. The decision {{to leave the}} EU is likely to have data protection consequences within the UK. The Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998, which transposed the European Data Protection Directive (Directive 95 / 46 EC), was due to be replaced by the GDPR on 25 May 2018. While the UK’s Minister for Data Protection has not ruled out the possibility that the GDPR will still take effect in the UK on that date, this is not certain. The UK has yet to trigger the exit mechanism to leave the EU (Article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU). However, if it does, it will ordinarily have two years to renegotiate its legal relationship with the EU. There will therefore be a time period between the entry into force of the GDPR in May 2018 and the conclusion of the <b>re-negotiation</b> <b>agreement</b> when the UK will find itself in a legal limbo...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{innovative}} research aiming at supporting autonomous establishment {{and maintenance of}} service level agreements in order to guarantee end-to-end {{quality of service requirements}} for service composition provision. In this research, a set of interrelated service level agreements is established and maintained for a service composition, through autonomous agent negotiation. To enable this, an innovative framework is proposed in which agents on behalf of the service requestor and the service providers can negotiate service level agreements in a coordinated way. This framework also enables adaptive service level <b>agreement</b> <b>re-negotiation</b> in the dynamic and ever-changing service environment...|$|R

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are an {{essential}} {{foundation for the}} realisation of Business Grids as they provide a mechanism for a service provider to charge a customer for meeting an agreed quality of service. However, once an SLA has been formed it {{may need to be}} re-negotiated as the requirements of the SLA participants change. This paper describes an abstract, domain-independent protocol for the <b>re-negotiation</b> of an <b>agreement,</b> including SLAs formed using the WS-Agreement stan-dard. The protocol is based on the principles of contract law to make the new agreements formed using it legally-compliant. It allows for multi-round re-negotiation in a network environment where messages may be lost, delayed, duplicated and re-ordered. ...|$|R

It is {{time to take a}} retrospective look at what were the expected gains for India, how was the AOA implemented, and ponder over India’s prospects in the up-coming re-negotiations. While the predictions of various macro-models about the gains to Indian agriculture and farmer were not unequivocal, their implicit assumption of perfectly competitive export markets is also questionable. Under imperfectly competitive export market structure, improvement in the terms-of-trade for Indian agriculture may be very limited. Whatever little improvement in terms-of-trade may occur, it may not have a favourable effect as agricultural supply response to changes in terms-of-trade is quite ambiguous. Moreover, the ex-post gains accruing to Indian agriculture so far seem to be very little since developed countries have used various escape routes in the WTO agreements to minimise their reform commitments. India will have to concentrate on non-price factors to improve welfare in the agricultural sector. The prospects of getting additional gains in the up-coming re-negotiations hinge on how India can take maximum advantage of the existing clauses of the AOA, and, to what extent it is successful in amending some of the clauses to its advantage. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} guide to the current interpretation {{of the principle of}} good faith in the lex mercatoria. It sets out the full background to this interpretation, exploring the development of good faith in major legal cultures in the Western world and in arbitral practice. Modern lex mercatoria {{is one of the most}} conspicuous manifestations of globalization in the field of law. Previous examples of global law are the Roman ius gentium and the medieval law merchant. The principle of good faith has been fundamental in all these manifestations. The thrust of this thesis represents an investigation of the reasons for the essential role of good faith in universal contexts, and in particular, its meaning in the lex mercatoria. It is argued here that national laws have been influential on the meaning of good faith in the current lex mercatoria. Hence, four major legal systems in the civil and the common law areas are studied: German, French, US and English. Nonetheless, other national systems are also mentioned throughout the thesis. This analysis will reveal the fundamental dynamism of the concept of good faith. This thesis challenges the traditional view of good faith as a moral and subjective concept, impractical and difficult to assess. It will show that an objective notion of good faith is vigorous in international commerce nowadays. This thesis explains that good faith in the lex mercatoria is interpreted as cooperation of the parties to a commercial contract. This notion fits the experience of global trade today. This theory will be verified through an analysis of: comparative legal history, sociological, philosophical and political theories, international instruments embracing the lex mercatoria and also through cases from national courts and international arbitration. This comprehensive study will serve as a context for future investigations on ancillary duties that emanate from good faith and on the principle of good faith in specific stages of the contractual iter, such as <b>re-negotiation</b> of the <b>agreement.</b> It will contribute to the harmonization and unification of law in different regions of the world and also to global projects containing the language of good faith. Likewise, it will be useful for traders and practitioners, especially arbitrators dealing with good faith in international disputes between merchants.
