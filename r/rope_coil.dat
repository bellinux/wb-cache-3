50|$|The {{regiment}}al {{badge of}} the new regiment was a silver cross patee (from the badge of the former Wiltshire Regiment), at the centre {{of which was a}} silver Chinese-style dragon (from the badge of the former Royal Berkshire Regiment). The Chinese dragon was surrounded by a gilt/gold double coil of naval rope (commemorating the service of the former regiments' service as marines, especially that of the 49th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801). This <b>rope</b> <b>coil</b> was surmounted by the ducal coronet of the regiment's Colonel-in-Chief in gilt/gold. The badge was invariably set upon a piece of red material known as the Brandywine Flash (commemorating the regiment's action at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777, during the American Revolutionary War). This red backing was configured as a square (with the red colour showing between the four arms of the cross patee) where the badge was worn as a collar badge or on a peaked cap, but as an inverted triangle approximately 2 X 2.5 inches in size where it was worn on the beret.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of direct electrospinning {{is the key to}} control fiber morphologies that are critical for the development of new electrospinning methods and novel materials. Here, we propose the theory for direct electrospinning based on theories for (liquid) "rope coiling" and experimentally test it. For the experiments, the buckling of microscale liquid ropes formed from polymer solutions is studied systematically using three different electrospinning setups and for different polymer concentrations. We show that different buckling regimes exist, whose dynamics are governed by an interplay of electrical, inertial, and viscous forces, and that three different buckling regimes emerge depending on the dominant forces. For low polymer concentrations, we observe an inertial regime similar to that observed for viscous liquid ropes at high velocities. By increasing the polymer concentration and consequently decreasing the rope velocity, we enter an inertial-electrical regime for which discontinuities occur in the buckling frequency as a function of applied voltage. These observations can be accounted for quantitatively by replacing the gravitational forces in viscous <b>rope</b> <b>coiling</b> theory with the electrical forces of our electrospinning experiment. Finally, for the highest polymer concentration, we observe a purely electrical regime for a solidified rope; this regime is well described by "elastic" <b>rope</b> <b>coiling</b> theory...|$|R

The discarded piece of his former one he gave to Gazan for a plaything, for Tarzan had it in his mind to instruct Teeka's balu after ideas of his own when the youngster should be old and strong enough to profit by his precepts.

50|$|A {{spinning}} top is a toy designed to spin rapidly on the ground, {{the motion of}} which causes it to remain precisely balanced on its tip because of its rotational inertia. Such toys have existed since antiquity. Traditionally tops were constructed of wood, sometimes with an iron tip, and would be {{set in motion by}} aid of a string or <b>rope</b> <b>coiled</b> around its axis which, when pulled quickly, caused a rapid unwinding that would set the top in motion. Today they are often built of plastic, and modern materials and manufacturing processes allow tops to be constructed with such precise balance that they can be set in motion by a simple twist of the fingers and twirl of the wrist without need for string or rope.|$|R

It is a massive block of timber moving on a pivot, which is turned round by wooden levers, called capstan bars, or hand-spikes, and is used for any purpose that requires great tractive power--the drawing in of the cable, for instance, or warping the ship; which means that a rope is fixed on shore, or by an anchor {{to the bottom of the}} sea, and the other end of it is coiled round the capstan, so that when the capstan is forced round by the handspikes, the <b>rope</b> <b>coils</b> on to it, and the ship is slowly dragged forward.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the fire {{behaviour}} of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> under axial loading conditions is addressed. Since there are no standards for these structural elements, ISO 834 standard curve was considered as fire model for its severity. The analysis of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> fire behaviour was carried out both from the experimental and numerical point of view, thus obtaining a complete description of rope responses. Two distinct full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> were tested and heat fluxes, temperature fields in the rope cross-section and fire endurance times were determined. An experimental campaign, aimed to establish how wires mechanical properties change with temperature, was also carried out. Subsequently, a parametric Finite Element model (FE) able to predict the rope response, undergoing to the experimental thermal and mechanical loads, was implemented, thus obtaining the time evolution of damage and the failure mechanisms for the rope. The numerical model was then validated by comparing the predicted fire endurance times with those obtained from the experimental tests {{and a very good}} agreement was found. A method for determining the fire endurance times of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> by using the numerical model, once the material properties and loading conditions are established, was thus define...|$|R

Systematic experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the transformation behavior and the size changing rules for various deposited microstructures, and highly aligned serpentine microfibers were directly written by controlling the applied voltage, nozzle-to-collector distance and collector velocity. Furthermore, a hyper-stretchable piezoelectric device that can detect stretching, bending and pressure has been successfully fabricated using the printed serpentine micro/nanofibers, demonstrating the potential of HE-printing in stretchable electronics manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{an elastic}} strip subject to vertical compressive stress on a frictional rigid substrate is investigated {{by a combination}} of theory and experiment. We find a rich variety of morphologies, which -when the bending elasticity dominates over the effect of gravity- are classified into three distinct types of states: pinned, partially slipped, and completely slipped, depending on the magnitude of the vertical strain and coefficient of static friction. We develop a theory of elastica under mixed clamped-hinged boundary conditions combined with the Coulomb-Amontons friction law, and find excellent quantitative agreement with simulations and controlled physical experiments. We also discuss the effect of gravity in order to bridge the difference in qualitative behaviors of stiff strips and flexible strings, or ropes. Our study thus complements recent work on elastic <b>rope</b> <b>coiling,</b> and takes a significant step towards establishing a unified understanding of how a thin elastic object interacts vertically with a solid surface.

50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer.

The half-locked <b>coil</b> <b>rope</b> and the full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>rope</b> always have a centre made of round wires. The locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|R
