5|$|The {{boxes are}} found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these are after effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.|$|E
25|$|Their son Jed (Devon Graye) {{has begun}} exhibiting violent behavior, {{speaking}} in tongues and disemboweling their livestock, but then {{is unable to}} <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done. Monsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph Fiennes) and Father Malachi (John Aylward) arrive to perform an exorcism on Jed, and Dr. Thredson is shocked at the idea, informing him that he will report the sanitarium to the proper authorities. Monsignor Howard instead asks Dr. Thredson to join them, as an exorcism requires {{the presence of a}} certified doctor.|$|E
25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} unsworn {{statement}} from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.|$|E
60|$|Frank could readily {{understand}} this, and <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had read}} about the gyroscope.|$|R
60|$|Kim smiled, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had overheard in the dressing-room. Decidedly {{he was a}} {{favourite}} of the stars.|$|R
60|$|George {{lost his}} self-control. He {{was glad to}} see her back, but <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had {{suffered}} for her sake.|$|R
25|$|As a major, {{he landed}} in France on Gold Beach on D-Day on 6 June 1944, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General (DAQMG) of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, a first line TA formation, {{under the command}} of Major-General Douglas Graham. Macleod {{embarked}} on 1 June, ready for the invasion which was then postponed from 5 June to 6 June. The 50th Division, a highly experienced veteran formation which had fought in North Africa and Sicily, was tasked with capturing Arromanches, where the Mulberry artificial harbour was to be set up, {{and by the end of}} the day patrols had pushed to the outskirts of Bayeux. Macleod spent much of the day touring the beachhead area to check on progress, driving past enemy-held strongpoints, with Lieutenant Colonel “Bertie” Gibb. He later recorded that he had “a patchwork of memories” of D-Day. He could <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ate but not when he ate it, or that when he went to load his revolver he found his batman had instead filled his ammunition pouch with boiled sweets. British planners had expected 40% casualties on D-Day, and Macleod later recorded that he himself had fully expected to be killed, but on realising at midnight that he had survived D-Day decided that he would survive the war and see the birth of his second child in October.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{expressed}} {{pleasure that}} Stevenson, whom he termed {{a man who}} inherited wealth from his father, could run for president. But people [...] "of modest means" [...] must also get a chance, and the candidate recited the quotation attributed to Lincoln: [...] "Remember Abraham Lincoln, you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said: 'God must have loved the common people—He made so many of them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On a busy New York City street, Jones and {{his team}} use the energy cell to open a doorway into a {{parallel}} universe and bring a truck through, but are apparently unsuccessful, as Jones complains he used the [...] "wrong coordinates". Having previously observed Walter at the graveyard, The Observer (Michael Cerveris) arrives with Walter at the Bishops' beach house, and gives Walter a coin, telling him to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to find. Walter goes on alone into the house, while Olivia and Charlie interview witnesses who saw Jones extract the truck from the doorway. They discover that the truck's VIN numbers do not exist, which implies the [...] "truck was never made". A further interview with Nina reveals to the Fringe team that the truck is from another universe, and that Jones is using the stolen energy cell to travel to that universe.|$|E
6000|$|Brooke, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had heard}} from Saxton, looked hard at him. [...] "You have sold it out to English company promoters?" ...|$|R
60|$|A quiet grin spread itself {{slowly across}} Jimmy's face. <b>He</b> had <b>{{remember}}ed</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had been trying}} to remember for over a week.|$|R
60|$|Daddy <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had heard}} about the {{singular}} generosity of the Natchez team to supply the balls for the games they played.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode is}} also {{important}} in the main story arc concerning the cracks in time and space. The idea of the crack {{was inspired by a}} similar crack in the wall of Moffat's son. As the crack reappears, several facts about it are revealed. In the episode, the Doctor speculates that they are connected to the fact that Amy could not remember the events of several previous episodes, as well as events in history that had occurred in [...] "The Next Doctor". He also discovers that the time explosion that caused the crack is 26 June 2010, which is also the original airdate of the final episode of the series, [...] "The Big Bang". Before the Doctor, River, and Octavian leave Amy and the other clerics, the Doctor briefly returns to console Amy and to ask her to trust him and <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> told her when she was younger; however, the Doctor in this scene is shown wearing his jacket, which he had lost to the Angels earlier in the episode, as well as a different wristwatch. It is revealed in [...] "The Big Bang" [...] that this was in fact the Doctor from later in his timeline, setting up events in Amy's past to try to help her remember him after he has rebooted the universe. River Song tells the Doctor she will see him again when the Pandorica opens; the Pandorica was previously referred to by Prisoner Zero in [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] and is revealed in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", which also sees the return of River Song.|$|E
2500|$|Jason is alive, {{and held}} captive by Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis). Victor forces Robin to revive Jason, {{but the two}} escape Victor's {{clutches}} {{and come back to}} Port Charles. Jason is hit by a car, though, and has to undergo a complete facial reconstruction. Jason's vitals spike while Sam is holding his hand, even though he is under heavy sedation. Jason (Billy Miller) awakens with amnesia, and starts going by [...] "Jake". He bonds with both Sam and Danny, who feel drawn to him while he's unconscious. Though he wakes up with no memory, he's under Helena Cassadine's (Constance Towers) mind control, and holds Sam hostage while freeing a prisoner. Sam suspects Jake, but he denies the accusation. Helena orders him to kill Sam, but [...] "Jake's" [...] unable to fulfill this order. When [...] "Jake" [...] is eventually arrested, Sam helps him break Helena's mind control, and <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done. [...] "Jake" [...] asks Sam for help to figure out who he is. [...] "Jake" [...] has obscure dreams about his past, specifically of Sam and Danny. He starts a relationship with Elizabeth, while Sam dates Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson). When Hayden Barnes (Rebecca Budig), who knew his true identity, is shot, Sam and Jake stop their investigation. On their wedding anniversary, Sam and [...] "Jake" [...] unknowingly renew their vows.|$|E
60|$|The German seemed bewildered; he ran {{his fingers}} through his bushy hair as if trying to <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had said.|$|E
6000|$|Then the sachem {{turned as}} if to move away, and General Herkimer, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had promised Sergeant Corney and Jacob, said, in a {{friendly}} tone: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was by}} {{no means}} easy to set about {{discovering}} Henchard. He had apparently sunk into the earth on leaving Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae's door. Elizabeth-Jane <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had once attempted; and trembled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure Mr. Charlecote would, my dear little man,' began Honora, then {{checked by}} <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have said. 'But didn't {{you think of}} One more sure {{to take care of}} you than Mr. Charlecote?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said of you, Loo?" [...] {{said the}} {{young man with a}} {{flashing}} eye. [...] "Do you think I can ever forget that?" ...|$|E
60|$|I fancy Melville said {{something}} about carrying the thing too far. He doesn't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did say. I don't think he even knew at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I'll {{write him}} such a letter this instant as shall make him <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is, and show him who {{he has to}} deal with. Eh, Charlie?' ...|$|E
60|$|In this {{extremity}} <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had told}} the little spinner long ago. If Death was so slow in coming, {{it was because he}} was not ready to follow him, having no shroud for his burial.|$|R
60|$|One thing seems {{certain to}} me. If Shakspere read and {{borrowed}} from Greek poetry, {{he knew it}} as well (except Homer) as Mr. Collins knew it; and <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knew with Mr. Collins's extraordinary tenacity of memory.|$|R
5000|$|After the fight, McDaniel {{remained}} on the canvas due to a pain in his eye. He then admitted to not <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was hit with. White then stated that Hall was the [...] "nastiest fighter in TUF history." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we must <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to bear. It is {{not every}} {{one that can}} endure such a life as his without false pride and false shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And," [...] he continued, [...] "when {{they hear}} Tarzan call to them, let them <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{has done for}} Akut and come to him with great speed. Shall it be as Tarzan says?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, madam, I {{have only}} one more {{question}} to ask, and you can no doubt answer it. When your son wakes, will he <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has said to Captain Bervie and to myself?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rideau frowned, and for {{a moment}} it {{appeared}} that he would have preferred the African custom of choosing his bride; but <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claimed to be, he stood upright, a full-fleshed, crisp-haired figure, with his sensual lips showing too prominently.|$|R
6000|$|... "The consul {{will not}} be <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> hears of all the ships," [...] {{interposed}} the young girl, with the same gentle affectation of superior worldly knowledge which had before amused him. [...] "We'll be wearying him, father," [...] and the subject dropped.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} remembered even now how {{extraordinarily}} CLEAR--he couldn't call it anything else--she had looked, in her prettiness, {{as she had}} said it. <b>He</b> also <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been moved to reply. [...] "The happiest reigns, we are taught, you know, are the reigns without any history." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess that}} 'd depend. Mostly, you know, Dick does what you want. But you couldn't stop him--nobody could--if there was reason, a man's reason, to get started. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did to Rojas!... Nell, tell me what's happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Holy One!' he gasped. 'My horoscope! The {{drawing in}} the dust by the priest at Umballa! <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said. First come two--ferashes--to make all things ready--in a dark place, as it is always at the {{beginning}} of a vision.' ...|$|E
60|$|Appleby did not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> answered, but {{he drove}} {{away with a}} curious feeling of content, and Mrs. Wayne {{went back to the}} room where her {{daughter}} sat very still in her chair. Stooping down she kissed her gently.|$|E
60|$|He was {{sensible}} of {{a pain in}} {{his left}} side, which, as other men have discovered, not infrequently follows enforced abstinence from food, but <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted the half-dollar in his pocket for. The hotel-keeper had possibly some notion {{of the state of}} affairs, for he laughed a little.|$|R
60|$|Lady Clarice had not {{forgotten}} the brave {{act of the}} boy, and also <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> liked best in the world. So she had him taught to draw and paint, and in process of time he became a great artist, and all the world knew of his name and fame.|$|R
60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} Leonard <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had promised--to go on seeking till he died. Very good, he would keep the promise--till he died. And he remembered also that curious prophecy to which Thomas had given {{utterance}} on the previous night, that prophecy of wealth which should come to him.|$|R
