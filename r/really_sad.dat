500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> song so I thought if the lyrics are <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> like that I should write some chords that are happier".|$|E

As {{a nod to the}} moods created by the album, Champion has compared the song lyrics to the 1972 song [...] "Perfect Day" [...] by American rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed, stating that the [...] "lyrics are beautiful and they're really, really happy, but the music is really, <b>really</b> <b>sad.</b> It's that kind of thing, where you can create [...] moods through the music and lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Several Americans {{died during}} and after the raid. A {{prisoner}} weakened by illness {{died of a heart attack}} as a Ranger carried him from the barracks to the main gate. The Ranger later recalled, [...] "The excitement had been too much for him, I guess. It was <b>really</b> <b>sad.</b> He was only a hundredfeet from the freedom he had not known for nearly threeyears." [...] Another prisoner died of illness just as the group had reached Talavera. Although Mucci had ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could evacuate Fisher to get medical attention, it was never dispatched, and he died the next day. His last words were [...] "Good luck on the way out." [...] The other Ranger killed during the raid was Sweezy, who was struck in the back by two rounds from friendly fire. Both Fisher and Sweezy are buried at Manila National Cemetery. Twenty of Pajota's guerrillas were injured, as were twoScouts and twoRangers.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis focused lyrically {{on sexual}} {{references}} and innuendos {{as they were}} frequently on his mind. Songs such as [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "If You Have to Ask", [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" [...] all contained various sexual links, with lyrics like [...] "A state of sexual light / Kissing her virginity / My affinity" [...] and [...] "Glorious euphoria / Is my must / Erotic shock / Is a function of lust." [...] The concept behind [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] was a request by Rubin, who asked Kiedis to write a song solely about girls and cars. Although Kiedis disliked the concept, he wrote the song as Rubin requested and ended up hating nearly {{every aspect of the}} lyrics. Kiedis also began to write about anguish, and the self mutilating thoughts he would experience {{as a result of his}} heroin and cocaine addiction; he believed his life had come to its lowest point under a bridge in downtown Los Angeles. Over a month later, Rubin stumbled upon a poem that would become the lyrics to [...] "Under the Bridge", and suggested Kiedis show it to the rest of the band. Kiedis was, however, apprehensive because he believed the lyrics to be [...] "too soft" [...] and unlike the band's style. After singing the verse to Frusciante, they began structuring the song the next day. The two worked for several hours arranging chords and melodies until they both agreed it was complete. Frusciante ultimately chose the chords he played in the intro to balance out the depressing atmosphere of the song: [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> song so I thought if the lyrics are <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> like that I should write some chords that are happier." [...] "Naked in the Rain" [...] was one of the first songs written for the album and even played once at the end of the Mother's Milk Tour in 1990 while the intros for [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] and [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] were also teased during the end of that tour but neither song was completed or had lyrics.|$|E

'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year or two ago, down the street from where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> to witness." [...] 'Edward Benz, 27 Times' {{is the story of a}} father dealing with the pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son, while [...] "I See Everything" [...] describes parents losing their seven-year-old son to cancer.|$|E

[...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no idea what I have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E

She said that [...] "I Am the Woman Who Loves You" [...] is about when she and Universe first met and that [...] "Love Me Again" [...] is about [...] "taking the piss out of [...] love for Azaria", calling the latter [...] "a real Anika Moa song." [...] According to Moa, [...] "Two Hearts" [...] and [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] were inspired by people who [...] "fucked [...] off". [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] was written while Moa says she was [...] "in a really bad mood", however she asserts that it is her favourite track on the album. Moa said that [...] "Blame It On the Rain" [...] is about a person who Moa [...] "will never ever name because they will be really, <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> if they knew".

500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The <b>really</b> <b>sad</b> thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere.

[...] "Everytime" [...] was used during the 2009 Irish production of the 1896 play The Seagull. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album Prelude to a Dream (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on Billboards Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in 2010. This caused the song to re entry the top 50 singles chart in the UK.| On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, [...] "This song {{is one of my}} favourite songs.

500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me <b>really</b> <b>sad.</b> I'm not, like, a negative person.
