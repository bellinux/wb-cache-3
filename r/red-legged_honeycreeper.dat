25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper,</b> emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The call of <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> is a thin, high-pitched tsip.|$|E
50|$|Common and widespread, the <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> is not {{considered}} a threatened species by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|The shining {{honeycreeper}} {{is easily}} {{distinguished from the}} larger <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> with which its shares its range by the latter species’ red legs and, in the male, black mantle.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> {{builds a}} small cup nest in a tree, and incubates the clutch of two brown-blotched white eggs for 12-13 days, with a further 14 days to fledging.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} over 200 species of birds, {{including}} unusual tropical {{species such as}} the slaty antwren, piratic flycatcher and <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper.</b> Species considered local specialties are tody motmot and northern nightingale-wren.|$|E
50|$|The purplish {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes purpurascens), a bird from Venezuela {{known only}} from the type specimen, {{is considered to be}} an intergeneric hybrid between the green honeycreeper and either the <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> or the blue dacnis.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{species of}} {{terrestrial}} birds on the island, {{probably due to}} the large number of reptile predators. The most common include endemic subspecies of black-crowned antshrike (Thamnophilus atrinucha gorgonae), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola gorgonae) and <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> (Cyanerpes cyaneus gigas).|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> (Cyanerpes cyaneus) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} {{species in}} the tanager family (Thraupidae). It {{is found in the}} tropical New World from southern Mexico south to Peru, Bolivia and central Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, and on Cuba, where possibly introduced.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a species}} of forest edge, open woodland, and cocoa and citrus plantations. The <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> is often found in small groups. It feeds on insects and some fruit and nectar. It {{responds}} readily to the (easily imitated) call of the ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum).|$|E

50|$|The <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> is {{on average}} 12.2 cm long, weighs 14 g {{and has a}} medium-long black, {{slightly}} decurved, bill. The male is violet-blue with black wings, tail and back, and bright red legs. The crown of its head is turquoise, and the underwing, visible only in flight, is lemon yellow. After the breeding season, the male moults into an eclipse plumage, mainly greenish with black wings.|$|E
50|$|The purplish {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes purpurascens) is {{a bird in}} the Thraupidae, or tanager family. It {{is known}} only from the type specimen, a trade-skin held in the British Museum, and {{is thought to be}} an intergeneric hybrid between the green honeycreeper (Chlorophanes spiza) and either the <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> (Cyanerpes cyaneus) or the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), though Hellmayr, in his Catalogue of birds of the Americas and the adjacent islands, considered it a good species.|$|E
50|$|The green {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes spiza) {{is a small}} bird in the tanager family. It {{is found in the}} tropical New World from southern Mexico south to Brazil, and on Trinidad. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Chlorophanes. The purplish honeycreeper (Chlorophanes purpurascens), a bird from Venezuela known only from the type specimen, is now thought to be an intergeneric hybrid between the {{green honeycreeper}} and either the <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> or the blue dacnis.|$|E
5000|$|Birds of Cuba's moist forests {{include the}} Cuban tody (Todus multicolor), bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban {{solitaire}} (Myadestes elisabeth), hook-billed kite (Chondrohierax uncinatus), <b>red-legged</b> <b>honeycreeper</b> (Cyanerpes cyaneus), Cuban parakeet (Aratinga euops), stygian owl (Asio stygius) and Gundlach's hawk (Accipiter gundlachi).

5000|$|... 2014 saw {{the first}} continent-wide [...] "green year", a big year {{executed}} {{with a minimum of}} environmental impact. In his rather extreme instance, Dorian Anderson bicycled 17,830 miles around the United States, amassing a self-powered, petroleum-free 617 species during his 365 days on America's roads. If <b>Red-legged</b> <b>Honeycreeper,</b> a would-be first for North American, is accepted by the ABA, he will add one additional bird to reach 618 species. Dorian visited 28 states (some twice) during his adventure and, beyond his species total, raised $49,000 for habitat conservation. He shunned all motorized transportation for the entire adventure, refusing even ferries that would have saved him sometimes hundreds of miles of riding around various bodies of water. Once hit by a car and many times nearly missed, it was a minor miracle that he survived the entire year without major injury.|$|E
