40|$|Abstract Extreme flood {{events have}} been and {{continue}} {{to be one of the}} most important natural hazards responsible for deaths and economic losses. Extreme floods result in direct destructive effects during the time of the event, and they also may be followed by a related chain of indirect calamities such as famines and epidemics that produce additional damages and suffering. Extreme hydrological events that have occurred in the historical past may also occur in the future. Knowledge about magnitudes and <b>recurrence</b> <b>frequencies</b> of past extreme hydrological events in most regions are too short to adequately evaluate potential magnitudes and <b>recurrence</b> <b>frequencies</b> of extreme hydrological events. Stationary climate in which the mean and variance do not change over time is a basic underlying assumption of standard methodological procedures for estimating recurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events. Palaeo-archives contained in river and lake sediments, fossil plant and animal matter, ice layers, and otJier natural archives show that the assumption of stationary climate is not valid when the time scale is extended beyond centuries and millennia.

40|$|In urban areas, {{the impacts}} of flash floods can be very severe as these regions are {{generally}} densely populated and contain vital infrastructure. Parts of the UK have been particularly prone to serious urban flooding in recent years, such as Boscastle in 2004. Due to climate change, the occurrence of urban flooding is predicted to increase in the future, {{which is likely to}} lead to increasing flood risk to people and property in urban areas. It is therefore appropriate to estimate potential flood risk to people and property for improved flood risk management. This paper outlines an integrated numerical model for estimating flood risk in urban areas. The model includes a module for predicting the two-dimensional hydrodynamic characteristics of urban floods and a new module for predicting the flood risk to people (both children and adults) and property (including vehicles and buildings). The hydrodynamic module of this model was verified against laboratory experimental data and real flood tracks in urban areas. The integrated model was also applied to predict the flood risk to people and property for the Boscastle 2004 floods, with different <b>recurrence</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The developed integrated model can be used to predict the potential flood risk to people and property in urban areas and such predictions {{can be used as a}} rough assessment in improving flood risk management...|$|R

Usually, the FDC is constructed empirically for a given set of flow data, and the FDC so constructed is found to vary from one year to another and from one gauging station to another within the same watershed. This article attempts to analytically derive the FDC by maximizing the Tsallis entropy based on the knowledge that the mean discharge is known, thus obviating the need for any fitting. The mean discharge is found to be strongly related to the drainage area. The Tsallis entropy-based FDC is tested using field data and is found to be in agreement with the observed curve. The entropy method permits a probabilistic characterization of the FDC and hence a quantitative assessment of its uncertainty. With this method, the flow duration curve can also be forecasted for different recurrence intervals. The entropy is found to monotonically increase with the increase in time interval, indicating that the flow system becomes more complex but the degree of complexity decreases with increasing time interval after a certain time, eventually reaching a constant value, reflecting a reduced influence of land use change and other human influences on the flow regime...|$|R

Although single neuron responses in the PFC have shown some aspects of this profile, a network dynamic that follows the dopamine–NMDA dependence has not been identified. We studied neuronal network activity in acute medial PFC slices of adult rats by recording local field potentials (LFPs) with microelectrode arrays. Bath application of dopamine or the dopamine D 1 agonist SKF 38393 [(�/�) - 1 -phenyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro-(1 H) - 3 benzazepine- 7, 8 -diol hydrochloride] in combination with NMDA induced spontaneous LFPs predominantly in superficial cortex layers. The LFPs at single electrodes were characterized by sharp negative peaks that were clustered in time across electrodes revealing diverse spatiotemporal patterns on the array. The pattern formation required fast GABAergic transmission, coactivation of the dopamine D 1 and NMDA receptor, and depended in an inverted-U profile on dopamine. At moderate concentrations of dopamine or the dopamine D 1 agonist, the pattern size distribution formed a power law with exponent � �� 1. 5, indicating that patterns are organized {{in the form of}} neuronal avalanches, thereby maximizing spatial correlations in the network.
