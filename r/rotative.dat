5000|$|THE SIMAR Co. (Société Industrielle de Machines Agicoles <b>Rotatives)</b> of Switzerland began {{development}} of a similar machine and by 1932 were producing several size machines ranging from 2½ to 10 horsepower, with a tilling width of 14" [...] to 36", and weight from 220 to 880 pounds.|$|R
5000|$|Japanese {{entrepreneurs}} {{began to}} indigenously design and manufactured two-wheel tractors {{in the early}} 1920s. According to Francks (1996) an Okayama farmer Nishizaki Hiroshi (b. 1897) was returning from the World War I determined not to walk behind his father's draft animals and began experimenting with attaching a plow to the newly available small horsepower kerosene engines that farmers were beginning to use for pumping water and threshing. Nishazaki saw a Swiss made garden tractor (? SIMAR ?- Société Industrielle de Machines Agicoles <b>Rotatives</b> [...] ) being demonstrated through a Japanese government technology demonstration initiative in a nearby village (The Japanese agent of the Swiss machine company stopped importing by 1925 as the machine reportedly proved not capable of handling Japanese heavy rice soils). By 1926 Nishizaki had made his first version from diesel powered engine connected by a belt to rotating blades mounted on a wooden frame with two wheels. Soon he began renting it out to neighbors. And as with all good ideas soon local multiple small workshops entered the scene producing various versions. By 1938 there were 22 manufacturers in Japan with 17 of them in Okayama. By 1939 there were over 2800 two-wheel tractors/rotovators in use in Japan. But by the early 1940s {{nearly half of all}} the machines were out of commission due to lack of quality and spare parts. After World War II small 2-wheel tractors were imported from the United States and were mainly intended for use in transportation/pulling carts and small trailers. As these gained popularity many Japanese manufacturers [...] "...taking hints gleaned from foreign machines..." [...] started production using the American as their initial model (Francks 1996: 789). Farmers quickly found that 2-wheel tractors were more economical to use, as compared to keeping animals for tillage and 2-wheel tractors began selling widely. Agricultural machinery dealers received cattle for the barter for tractors and they and in turn sold the cattle in the meat market. Average tractor horsepower per hectare in 1950 was nearly zero. This average grew to 0.86 PS per hectare within ten years with the rapid spread of 2-wheel tractors. Trailer attachments were also being widely utilized for transportation.|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} complexity and organisational responses to critical supply chain failure, it also assess whether the operating principles of high reliability organisations ("HROs") can offer any benefit to commercial organisations in avoiding or mitigating the impact of future critical failure events. Supply chain performance is a necessity for maintaining competitive advantage within the market place; global firms look to use the supply chain to access global markets, raw materials, scarce skills and cost competitive labour. As supply chain networks become more globalised these open systems become more complex and exposed to failure. The cost of a supply chain failure in operational performance and reputational damage is high. This study develops a conceptual framework for assessing complexity of a supply chain within the aerospace industry sector, taking into consideration both complexities derived through product manufacturing process and supply chain configuration. Then four case studies of recent critical supply chain failures from the Rolls-Royce Group are applied to this framework and a qualitative structured interview process conducted with those personnel involved in the response to this supply chain failure. An assessment is made from the interview outcomes on whether in the cases reviewed complexity changes the response, how it should influence future responses and whether „HRO‟ principles would have had any value in pre-empting or responding to the failure. The study indicated that complexity does influence the type of organisational response to a critical supply chain failure; within the case studies reviewed this was particularly pronounced as manufacturing process complexity varied. Though {{it was noted that}} this change in response was not a planned or structured decision process arising from an organisational awareness to complexity, but a haphazard response to a critical customer failure. The study scope was limited to the "Rotatives" commodity supply chains. Research indicated that effective adoption of HRO principles in these cases would have avoided or mitigated the customer disruption caused by these critical supply chain failures, the key outcomes were; the group fails to integrate "signals" and "indicators" that might provide an "early warning alarm" about critical supply chain failure, those individuals who are best post positioned to foresee supply chain disruption within the network (though not necessarily „delivery‟ accountable) are not fully utilised to provide this intelligence and problem resolution methodologies following a critical supply chain failure are not cross-functionally consistent or integrated – impacting the pace and quality of fix and containment in these incidences. Using complexity to direct a standardised organisational response would allow the Rolls-Royce business to be more proficient in its containment and fix activities in response to a critical supply chain failure; though the limited scope of the case studies to the <b>Rotatives</b> commodity means that the sample of cases reviewed would need to be increased, taking in a broader scope of commodities and "mix" of supply chain complexities thus having sufficient scope of relevance for Rolls-Royce practitioners to adopt. In response to the adoption of HROs principles a number of priority areas were identified. Firstly, the business {{needs to be able to}} recognise and "stem" the "incubation period" of critical supply chain failures; this will happen through identification of „lead indicators‟ for supply chains that signify potential pending failure, a process for integrating these lead indicators to act as meaningful intelligence that supply chain practitioners can use to pre-empt supply chain failure in order to take pro-active action to avoid or mitigate customer disruption. Secondly, making use of key roles within the supply chain network that have early visibility of potential hazards in order to increase early feedback of intelligence. Thirdly, adopting a cross-functionally agreed problem resolution methodology for responding to events of critical supply chain failure, ensuring that governance puts pace into a comprehensive cross-functionally agreed set of activities that are robust in ensuring fix and containment at sufficient programme pace...|$|R

25|$|Until about 1800 {{the most}} common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an {{integral}} part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained <b>rotative</b> engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. Around the start of the 19th century, at which time the Boulton and Watt patent expired, the Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick and the American Oliver Evans began to construct higher-pressure non-condensing steam engines, exhausting against the atmosphere. High pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats.|$|E
25|$|Innovations in carding and {{spinning}} enabled by advances in cast iron technology {{resulted in the}} creation of larger spinning mules and water frames. The machinery was housed in water-powered mills on streams. The need for more power stimulated the production of steam-powered beam engines, and <b>rotative</b> mill engines transmitting the power to line shafts on each floor of the mill. Surplus power capacity encouraged the construction of more sophisticated power looms working in weaving sheds. The scale of production in the mill towns round Manchester created a need for a commercial structure; for a cotton exchange and warehousing. The technology was used in woollen and worsted mills in the West Riding of Yorkshire and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Mazda had {{improved}} the fuel {{efficiency of the}} thermal reactor system by 40% when the RX-7 was introduced in 1978. However, Mazda eventually shifted to the catalytic converter system. According to the Curtiss-Wright research, the factor that controls the amount of unburned hydrocarbon in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature, with higher temperatures producing less hydrocarbon. Curtiss-Wright showed also that the rotor can be widened, keeping the rest of engine's architecture unchanged, thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output. The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical, especially shaft deflection at high <b>rotative</b> speeds. Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds, and leakage at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the canal barge being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see <b>rotative</b> steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E
500|$|When {{the lake}} first opened {{there were four}} Woolf {{compound}} <b>rotative</b> beam pumping engines, housed in two separate buildings.

The flywheel is [...] in diameter and weighs 20tons, having a crank throw of [...] Each beam engine had an output of [...] at 17rpm. The high-pressure cylinders, [...] in diameter and with a [...] stroke, were supplied by steam from horizontal Lancashire-type twin flue boilers with Green's economisers at [...] The low-pressure cylinder was [...] in diameter and has a [...] stroke.

A mechanical efficiency of 90% was claimed, the [...] diameter pump bucket, [...] strike and plunger diameter of [...] gave a pump output of [...] per stroke. They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps. In 1950 automatic shutdown equipment was installed to prevent damage {{in the event of a}} burst main or overloading of the new electric pumps. This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day. The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s. In 2014 new split-case vertical pumps and various other new equipment was installed to replace those installed in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
500|$|The pumping {{engine for}} use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt's {{invention}} so that the engine had a rotary motion, making it suitable {{for use in}} mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect. [...] Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching {{the limits of the}} pumping engine market: [...] "There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, which is certainly an extensive field." [...] Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it {{at the end of the}} year. [...] One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. [...] George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine. [...] As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. [...] While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a [...] "publicity stunt par excellence" [...] for the firm's latest innovation. [...] Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill's fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, [...] "spread far and wide", and orders for <b>rotative</b> engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

2500|$|Duchamp's {{interest}} in kinetic works can be discerned {{as early as}} the notes for The Large Glass and the Bicycle Wheel readymade, and despite losing {{interest in}} [...] "retinal art", he retained interest in visual phenomena. In 1920, with help from Man Ray, Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, <b>Rotative</b> plaques verre, optique de précision ("Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics"). The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle. When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, in which the segments appear to be closed concentric circles. Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine on for the second time, a belt broke, and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} European {{method of}} achieving {{low and high}} beam from a single bulb involves two filaments along the axis of the reflector. The high beam filament is on the focal point, while the low beam filament is approximately 1cm forward of the focal point and 3mm above the axis. Below the low beam filament is a cup-shaped shield (called a [...] "Graves Shield") spanning an arc of 165°. When the low beam filament is illuminated, this shield casts a shadow on the corresponding lower area of the reflector, blocking downward light rays that would otherwise strike the reflector and be cast above the horizon. The bulb is rotated (or [...] "clocked") within the headlamp to position the Graves Shield so as to allow light to strike a 15° wedge of {{the lower half of}} the reflector. This is used to create the upsweep or upstep characteristic of ECE low beam light distributions. The bulb's <b>rotative</b> position within the reflector depends on the type of beam pattern to be produced and the traffic directionality of the market for which the headlamp is intended.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or <b>rotative</b> movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E
2500|$|One of Murdoch's most {{significant}} inventions, for which evidence exists to attribute it to him, was {{the sun and}} planet gear which allowed steam power to be used to [...] "produce a continued <b>Rotative</b> or Circular Motion round an Axis or Centre, and thereby to give Motion to the Wheels of Mills or other Machines". This gear converted the vertical motion of a beam, driven by a steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed {{at the end of a}} rod connected to the beam of the engine. With the motion of the beam this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun' a second rotating cog fixed to and which turned the drive shaft. This system of achieving rotary motion was patented in his own name by James Watt in October 1781 although Samuel Smiles, biographer of Boulton and Watt, attributes this to Murdoch and there also exists a drawing of the sun and planet system in Murdoch's hand dated August 1781. Other evidence attributing this invention to William Murdoch takes the form of a letter from Boulton to a colleague concerning Watt's forthcoming October patents in which he writes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{old design}} is the {{shoulder}} vise. The {{best thing about}} this design {{is that it allows}} clamping directly behind the screw. This yields unobstructed vertical clamping for cutting dovetails and similar operations. There is also typically a little play in the screw/jaw attachment that provides for clamping of tapered work. This is one vise that should be designed into the bench from the beginning, as it is difficult to retrofit into an existing bench. The primary drawback of the shoulder vise is its fragility, unless the [...] "arm" [...] is attached to the [...] "end cap" [...] using a dovetail or finger joint, usually glued or [...] "pinned" [...] to eliminate <b>rotative</b> movement about the joint, otherwise it is fairly easy to break it with a big steel bench screw. But one should never really have to put that much force on it. Some woodworkers say that the big vise {{gets in the way of}} some jobs, others find it unobtrusive. Implicit in a shoulder vise is an integral planing stop, formed by the intersection of the jaw and the jaw spacer, and which allows the shoulder vise to perform multiple duties, such as jointing long boards with a [...] "bench slave" [...] to hold the opposite end. In earlier times, a crochet and a holdfast would perform the same function.|$|E
