6000|$|Lastly, a phaenomenon {{universal}} in all societies, {{and constantly}} assuming a wider extension as they advance in their progress, is the co-operation of mankind one with another, by {{the division of}} employments and interchange of commodities and services; a communion which extends to nations as well as individuals. The economic importance of this spontaneous organization of mankind as joint workers with and for one another, has often been illustrated. Its moral effects, in connecting them by their interests, and as a more <b>remote</b> <b>consequence,</b> by their sympathies, are equally salutary. But {{there are some things}} to be said on the other side. The increasing specialisation of all employments; the division of mankind into innumerable small fractions, each engrossed by an extremely minute fragment of the business of society, is not without inconveniences, as well moral as intellectual, which, if they could not be remedied, would be a serious abatement from the benefits of advanced civilization. The interests of the whole--the bearings of things on the ends of the social union--are less and less present to the minds of men who have so contracted a sphere of activity. The insignificant detail which forms their whole occupation--the infinitely minute wheel they help to turn in the machinery of society--does not arouse or gratify any feeling of public spirit, or unity with their fellow-men. Their work is a mere tribute to physical necessity, not the glad performance of a social office. This lowering effect of the extreme division of labour tells most of all on those who are set up as the lights and teachers of the rest. A man's mind is as fatally narrowed, and his feelings towards the great ends of humanity as miserably stunted, by giving all his thoughts to the classification of a few insects or the resolution of a few equations, as to sharpening the points or putting on the heads of pins. The [...] "dispersive speciality" [...] of the present race of scientific men, who, unlike their predecessors, have a positive aversion to enlarged views, and seldom either know or care for any of the interests of mankind beyond the narrow limits of their pursuit, is dwelt on by M. Comte {{as one of the great}} and growing evils of the time, and the one which most retards moral and intellectual regeneration. To contend against it is one of the main purposes towards which he thinks the forces of society should be directed. The obvious remedy is a large and liberal general education, preparatory to all special pursuits: and this is M. Comte's opinion: but the education of youth is not in his estimation enough: he requires an agency set apart for obtruding upon all classes of persons through the whole of life, the paramount claims of the general interest, and the comprehensive ideas that demonstrate the mode in which human actions promote or impair it. In other words, he demands a moral and intellectual authority, charged with the duty of guiding men's opinions and enlightening and warning their consciences; a Spiritual Power, whose judgments on all matters of high moment should deserve, and receive, the same universal respect and deference which is paid to the united judgment of astronomers in matters astronomical. The very idea of such an authority implies that an unanimity has been attained, at least in essentials, among moral and political thinkers, corresponding or approaching to that which already exists in the other sciences. There cannot be this unanimity, until the true methods of positive science have been applied to all subjects, as completely as they have been applied to the study of physical science: to this, however, there is no real obstacle; and when once it is accomplished, the same degree of accordance will naturally follow. The undisputed authority which astronomers possess in astronomy, will be possessed on the great social questions by Positive Philosophers; to whom will belong the spiritual government of society, subject to two conditions: that they be entirely independent, within their own sphere, of the temporal government, and that they be peremptorily excluded from all share in it, receiving instead the entire conduct of education.|$|E

6000|$|That {{there is}} a portion of truth {{at the bottom of}} all this, we should be the last to deny. No respect is due to any {{employment}} of the intellect which does not tend to the good of mankind. It is precisely on a level with any idle amusement, and should be condemned as waste of time, if carried beyond the limit within which amusement is permissible. And whoever devotes powers of thought which could render to Humanity services it urgently needs, to speculations and studies which it could dispense with, is liable to the discredit attaching to a well-grounded suspicion of caring little for Humanity. But who can affirm positively of any speculations, guided by right scientific methods, on subjects really accessible to the human faculties, that they are incapable of being of any use? Nobody knows what knowledge will prove to be of use, and what is destined to be useless. The most that can be said is that some kinds are of more certain, and above all, of more present utility than others. How often the most important practical results have been the <b>remote</b> <b>consequence</b> of studies which no one would have expected to lead to them! Could the mathematicians, who, in the schools of Alexandria, investigated the properties of the ellipse, have foreseen that nearly two thousand years afterwards their speculations would explain the solar system, and a little later would enable ships safely to circumnavigate the earth? Even in M. Comte's opinion, it is well for mankind that, in those early days, knowledge was thought worth pursuing for its own sake. Nor has the [...] "foundation of Positivism," [...] we imagine, so far changed the conditions of human existence, that it should now be criminal to acquire, by observation and reasoning, a knowledge of the facts of the universe, leaving to posterity to find a use for it. Even in {{the last two or three}} years, has not the discovery of new metals, which may prove important even in the practical arts, arisen from one of the investigations which M. Comte most unequivocally condemns as idle, the research into the internal constitution of the sun? How few, moreover, of the discoveries which have changed the face of the world, either were or could have been arrived at by investigations aiming directly at the object! Would the mariner's compass ever have been found by direct efforts for the improvement of navigation? Should we have reached the electric telegraph by any amount of striving for a means of instantaneous communication, if Franklin had not identified electricity with lightning, and Ampère with magnetism? The most apparently insignificant archaeological or geological fact, is often found to throw a light on human history, which M. Comte, the basis of whose social philosophy is history, should be the last person to disparage. The direction of the entrance to the three great Pyramids of Ghizeh, by showing the position of the circumpolar stars at the time when they were built, is the best evidence we even now have of the immense antiquity of Egyptian civilization.[24] The one point on which M. Comte's doctrine has some colour of reason, is the case of sidereal astronomy: so little knowledge of it being really accessible to us, and the connexion of that little with any terrestrial interests being, according to all our means of judgment, infinitesimal. It is certainly difficult to imagine how any considerable benefit to humanity can be derived from a knowledge of the motions of the double stars: should these ever become important to us it will be in so prodigiously remote an age, that we can afford to remain ignorant of them until, at least, all our moral, political, and social difficulties have been settled. Yet the discovery that gravitation extends even to those remote regions, gives some additional strength to the conviction of the universality of natural laws; and the habitual meditation on such vast objects and distances is not without an aesthetic usefulness, by kindling and exalting the imagination, the worth of which in itself, and even its re-action on the intellect, M. Comte is quite capable of appreciating. He would reply, however, that there are better means of accomplishing these purposes. In the same spirit he condemns the study even of the solar system, when extended to any planets but those which are visible to the naked eye, and which alone exert an appreciable gravitative influence on the earth. Even the perturbations he thinks it idle to study, beyond a mere general conception of them, and thinks that astronomy may well limit its domain to the motions and mutual action of the earth, sun, and moon. He looks for a similar expurgation of all the other sciences. In one passage he expressly says that the greater part of the researches which are really accessible to us are idle and useless. He would pare down the dimensions of all the sciences as narrowly as possible. He is continually repeating that no science, as an abstract study, should be carried further than is necessary to lay the foundation for the science next above it, and so ultimately for moral science, the principal purpose of them all. Any further extension of the mathematical and physical sciences should be merely [...] "episodic;" [...] limited to what may from time to time be demanded by the requirements of industry and the arts; and should be left to the industrial classes, except when they find it necessary to apply to the sacerdotal order for some additional development of scientific theory. This, he evidently thinks, would be a rare contingency, most physical truths sufficiently concrete and real for practice being empirical. Accordingly in estimating the number of clergy necessary for France, Europe, and our entire planet (for his forethought extends thus far), he proportions it solely to their moral and religious attributions (overlooking, by the way, even their medical); and leaves nobody with any time to cultivate the sciences, except abortive candidates for the priestly office, who having been refused admittance into it for insufficiency in moral excellence or in strength of character, may be thought worth retaining as [...] "pensioners" [...] of the sacerdotal order, on account of their theoretic abilities.|$|E

40|$|Procuramos averiguar qual a verdadeira significação da {{eosinophilia}} sanguinea na ancylostomose. Ao contrario do que affirmavam autores antigos, tentamos demonstrar que a eosinophilia não tem nenhuma relação com toxinas ou venenos porventura secretados pelos helminthos. Dado o incompleto conhecimento da funcção do leucocyto eosinophilo, a interpretação que damos da eosinophilia na ancylostomose, tem um carater, simplesmente, provisorio. Mostramos que a eosinophilia verificada no inicio da doença é provocada pela migração das larvas no interior do organismo, porém, que a eosinophilia observada posteriormente, não é uma consequencia longiqua desta inicial, pois que ella é devida á acção de albuminas heterologas acantonadas no intestino e provenientes de secreções dos vermes apensos á mucosa deste orgão. Como mechanismo desta eosinophilia, lembramos a possibilidade de que a eosinophilia localisada no intestino possa provocar uma diminuição passageira destas cellulas na circulação, o que determinaria uma excitação da medulla ossea (tal como a excitação trazida oelas perdas sanguineas nas hemorrhagias agudas) e a producção de novos leucocytos. Em virtude da constante secreção helminthica, este orgão seria constantemente excitado, por este processo indirecto, o que acarretaria finalmente uma eosinophilia sanguinea persistente. Por alguns estudos que apresentamos e baseados em resultados encontrados na literatura, affirmamos a inexistencia de qualquer relação de causa a effeito entre a eosinophilia e os atores productores da syndrome anemica. Assim dizemos porque verificamos a cura completa da anemia, apezar da persistencia de intensas eosinophilias periphericas, e ainda que a taxa de eosinophilos no sangue é tanto menor quanto mais grave é a anemia. Além disto, chamamos a attenção para que a eosinophilia é um phenomeno sempre presente quando se encontra no interior do organismo albumínas a elle heterogeneas; e que, finalmente, este phenomeno póde ser provocado por agentes physicos, e, portanto, apparece independentemente de qualquer toxinas ou substancias que ajam directamente sobre a medulla ossea. We tried do ascertain {{what was}} the real significance of blood eosinophilia in ankylostomiasis and to prove that eosinophilia {{is not related to}} toxins or poisons elaborated by these helminthes. The problem is rendered on account of knowledge of the function of the eosinophils, the interpretation we present of eosinophilia in ankylostomiasis is merely provisional. We showed that the eosinophilia verified {{at the beginning of the}} disease is induced by the migration of larvae inside the organism; still the eosinophilia observed later on is not a <b>remote</b> <b>consequence</b> of the initial one, for it is due to the action of heterologous albumins lodged in the intestine and deriving from secretions of the worms appended to the mucosa of this organ. With regard to the mechanism of this eosinophilia, we will mention that eosinophilia located in the intestine may induce a transient decrease of these cells, in the circulation, which may determine an excitation of bone marrow (just like the excitation occasioned by loss of blood in acute hemorrhages) to produce new leucocytes. By virtue of the constant helminthic secretion, this organ may be constantly stimulated by this indirect condition, which mau finally convey a persistent blood eosinophilia. On the strength of some studies presented by us and on the basis of a number of results met with in the literature, we assert the inexistence of any relationship of cause and effect between eosinophilia and the factors producing the anemic syndrome. Such is our statement because we verified the complete cure of the anemia, despite the persistence of intense peripheral eosinophilia, and moreover because the more severe the anemia is the lesser the rate of eosinophilia is in blood. Apart from this, we call attention to the fact that eosinophilia is a phenomen always present when in the in most of the organism there are heterogeneous albumins, and finally that this phenomenon can be induced by physical agents and, therefore, may appear independently of any toxin or substance acting directly upon bone marrow...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the output}} of a deductive research into the emergence, in OECD's countries, of a performance audit system composed of three somewhat coordinated layers: performance audit, internal audit, and internal control. The objective is to anticipate {{the emergence of a}} debate as to the implementation of such a system in federal Belgium. Two research questions are derived: a theoretical one (how to explain the emergence of the research objects?) and an empirical one (do the research objects actually emerge in OECD countries?). Part one reviews the performance audit and sociology of professions literature in search for an explanatory hypothesis. The will of synthesizing the incommensurable but equally relevant hypotheses of functionalism (public audit fulfils a given policy objective) and monopolism (public audit results from the imperialism of the accounting profession) brought forward in both fields leads to adopt Andrew Abbott's System of Profession theory as main theoretical hypothesis. In order to falsify it empirically, it is translated into the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDeF". This means that a given public administration, in order to obtain a jurisdiction like performance audit, internal audit and internal control, should first, claim it ("A"). This claim should moreover fit in a public policy ("B"). Theoretically, these two conditions are sufficient for a jurisdiction to emerge, provided that no other public administration already performs it ("C"). If this jurisdiction is already occupied ("c"), the claimant group should moreover ambit the jurisdiction ("D"), the incumbent must be perceived as having failed to perform its work on a satisfactory way ("e"), and the local system of professions should allow such shifts occurring ("F"). It is proposed to systematically confront empirical evidence from Canada and the Netherlands with this theoretical hypothesis in order to assess its explanatory value. Part two analyses seven cases in Canada. Performance audit emerges shortly after another jurisdiction related to the scientific establishment of the budget. It carries with it another jurisdiction, related to the organization of the departmental production of effectiveness studies to be reviewed by the performance auditor. The latter even tries to federate both groups in a wider one of comprehensive auditors, but fails. Jurisdictions of internal audit and financial internal control are carved out of a more general management jurisdiction {{in the aftermath of a}} political scandal. Part three analyses nine cases in the Netherlands. Performance audit first fails in the absence of a professional provider. It is the delegation of the financial audit jurisdiction to public accountants that frees up the resources for developing performance audit. Internal audit is a <b>remote</b> <b>consequence</b> of this delegation: when a reform expands departmental reports to financial and management information beyond financial one, the public accountants are upgraded to internal auditors; internal control being the object of their work. In the current case study, departmental internal auditors are merging together. Aimed at sparing on financial audit work to develop consulting activities, this episode could threaten at term the performance audit jurisdiction. Part four bridges the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical evidence. After having re-examined the measurement decisions, it proceeds to the cross-case comparison. This confirms that the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDe" adequately explains the emergence of performance audit, internal audit and internal control in the public sector of OECD countries, with, however, two nuances. On the one hand, the within-case analyses have allowed deleting condition "F": theoretically suspending competition, it requires suppression because competition is an emerging phenomenon. On the other hand, the cross-case analysis indicates that conditions "C" and "c" could be deleted from the equation, with an eye on theoretical parsimony: they are somewhat implied by the relevance or not of conditions "D" and "e". But because conditions "C" and "c" allow observing the transition from a non-competitive to a competitive situation, they are kept in the equation in order to emphasize this transition. This finding that a growing share of public administrations tasks are organized in jurisdictions and that this leads over time to the emergence of a competitive system of professions inside the state is discussed as a conclusion: some further research needs on systems are identified, the insights this approach could deliver in Belgium are previewed, and the role of the discipline of public administration in this context of professionalization is considered.

It was the fiery Leggett that urged on Bryant to attack William Leete Stone, Sr., a brother editor, in Broadway. Soon afterward he fought a duel at Weehawken with Blake, the treasurer of the old Park Theatre. To the surprise of all New York, Leggett selected James Lawson, a peacefully disposed Scottish-American poet, who was slightly lame, as his second; and when asked after the bloodless duel for his reasons, he answered: [...] "Blake's second, Berkeley, was lame, and I did not propose that the d--d Englishman should beat me in anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{the social}} failure of this attempt to guide our conduct by pure reason alone is no ground for discrediting reason itself. On the contrary, Hazlitt argues passionately, {{reason is the}} glue that binds {{civilisation}} together. And if reason {{can no longer be}} considered as [...] "the sole and self-sufficient ground of morals", we must thank Godwin for having shown us why, by having [...] "taken this principle, and followed it into its <b>remotest</b> <b>consequences</b> with more keenness of eye and steadiness of hand than any other expounder of ethics." [...] By doing so, he has revealed [...] "the weak sides and imperfections of human reason as the sole law of human action." [...] "The Spirit of the Age was never more fully shown than in its treatment of this writer—its love of paradox and change, its dastard submission to prejudice and to the fashion of the day."

40|$|Purpose. Research {{objective}} — studying {{of consequences}} of the operated traumatic intracranial hematomas in the remote period. Material. The nearest and remote results of the operated traumatic intracranial hematomas at 105 patients in terms from 6 months till 3 years are analyzed. During research the anamnesis was studied, neurologic investigation, and also research cognitive functions by means of scale MMSE, the test of drawing of hours, a scale of studying of alarm/depression HADS, learning of 5 words, scale quality of life SF- 36. Results. It is established, that in the remote period {{the condition of the}} majority of patients gradually improves, at the same time, frequent enough and expressed consequences which are necessary for analyzing with the purpose of optimization of outcomes and the forecast at the given disease are observed. The special attention should be given again developing complications to which it is possible to carry epileptic seizures and behavioral-memorable infringements. Conclusion. Studying of the <b>remote</b> <b>consequences</b> of this heavy kind of craniocereberal trauma allows to optimize results of treatment and to provide complex medical, labor, social and family adaptatio...|$|R
50|$|The {{attitudes and}} thought habits {{characteristic}} of the learning tradition are as evident {{in the street and}} market place as the yeshiva. The popular picture of the Jew in Eastern Europe, held by Jew and Gentile alike, is true to the Talmudic tradition. The picture includes the tendency to examine, analyze and re-analyze, to seek meanings behind meanings and for implications and secondary consequences. It includes also a dependence on deductive logic as a basis for practical conclusions and actions.In life, as in the Torah, it is assumed that everything has deeper and secondary meanings, which must be probed. All subjects have implications and ramifications. Moreover, the person who makes a statement must have a reason, and this too must be probed. Often a comment will evoke an answer to the assumed reason behind it or to the meaning believed to lie beneath it, or to the <b>remote</b> <b>consequences</b> to which it leads. The process that produces such a response—often with lightning speed—is a modest reproduction of the pilpul process.|$|R
40|$|The {{resurgence}} of creative accounting {{has become an}} issue of concern globally. The conflicts of interest among different interest groups amongst others represent the real causes of creative accounting. This study focused on determinants of creative accounting {{to determine whether the}} identified causes such as employees and top management compensation package tied to performance, loophole in GAAP, flexibility in accounting standard, agency rating, shareholders' demand for regular dividend and improved earning, actually encourage creative accounting or that they are a product of intuition that have no empirical basis. The study made use of primary survey data sourced through the administration of questionnaires on 200 respondents using random sampling. Three hypotheses were tested using Chi square test statistic. The three null hypotheses were rejected. The researchers therefore conclude that the identified factors actually correlate with creative accounting. It is recommended amongst others that the policy makers and regulators should ensure the bridging of the gap and loopholes inherent in GAAP and accounting standards. Investing public should also be enlightened to frown at creative accounting under any guise because of its <b>remote</b> <b>consequences</b> on their investments...|$|R
6000|$|Finally, {{the social}} {{instincts}} which no doubt were acquired by man, {{as by the}} lower animals, {{for the good of}} the community, will from the first have given to him some wish to aid his fellows, and some feeling of sympathy. Such impulses will have served him at a very early period as a rude rule of right and wrong. But as man gradually advanced in intellectual power and was enabled to trace the more <b>remote</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions; as he acquired sufficient knowledge to reject baneful customs and superstitions; as he regarded more and more not only the welfare but the happiness of his fellow-men; as from habit, following on beneficial experience, instruction, and example, his sympathies became more tender and widely diffused, so as to extend to the men of all races, to the imbecile, the maimed, and other useless members of society, and finally to the lower animals,—so would the standard of his morality rise higher and higher. And it is admitted by moralists of the derivative school and by some intuitionists, that the standard of morality has risen since an early period in the history of man.[137] ...|$|R

Currently, {{there are two}} terms for his disorder: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder – ADHD (DSM-IV) and hyperkinetic disorder – HKD (ICD- 10). ADHD in childhood can persist into adolescent and adulthood with long-term negative outcomes. The aim of treatment for ADHD is to decrease symptoms, enhance functionality, and improve well-being for the child {{and his or her}} close contacts and to prevent other psychopathology. Psychoeducation is a paradigm, which includes information about the illness and its treatment. Educating parents to apply consistent behaviour modification techniques at home can help improve to children with ADHD. This study was aimed at assessment <b>remote</b> <b>consequences</b> of psychoeducation in ten years observation of children with ADHD. The treatment was conducted during periodical visit (at 4 -weeks intervals) with application of psychoeducation for parents and elements of behavioural therapy. The effects of the psychoeducation were evaluated after 12 months and ten years of its duration. The results were statistically analysed. Research finds that psychoeducational interventions are effective in preventing relapse and improving social functioning. The relevance of psychoeducation has long been recognized as an important part of effective treatment for ADHD. The parental psychopathology entail restrictions of effective therapy...|$|R
