Consequently, the catalytic <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> a threonine protease is located at it N-terminus.|$|E

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{measure the}} <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> {{spinosad}} and chlorhexidine in the tissues of sheep after treatment of blowfly strike. Procedure Fourteen sheep with natural myiasis and 12 with artificial infestations of Lucilia cuprina larvae had the wool removed over their infestations and {{were treated with}} an aerosol wound dressing containing spinosad and chlorhexidine. Sheep were killed up to 14 days after treatment and <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> the chemicals measured in tissues. Results Chlorhexidine was not detected in any tissue. <b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> spinosad were highest in fat, lowest in muscle and intermediate in liver and kidney. The highest residue detected was 0. 2 mg/kg spinosad in perirenal fat 7 days after generous treatment of a sheep with a large fly strike. <b>Residues</b> <b>of</b> spinosad in fat peaked 3 to 7 days after treatment and 1 to 3 days after treatment in liver and kidney. Conclusion These studies present a realistic worst-case in struck sheep and at the highest dose studied, equivalent to 5. 8 mg spinosad per kg body weight, the maximum <b>residue</b> detected <b>of</b> 0. 2 mg/kg in peri-renal fat was 20 % of the Australian maximum residue limit.

5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> the active site triad performs a nucleophilic {{attack on the}} peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of the early Universe in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of}} the heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the {{hypothesis}} that functional erythrocyte-type glucose transporters (GLUT 1) exist as oligomeric complexes by expressing chimeric transporter proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring endogenous GLUT 1 transporters. The chimeric transporters were GLUT 1 - 4 c, in which the 29 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> human GLUT 1 were replaced by the 30 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> rat skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT 4), and GLUT 1 n- 4, containing the N-terminal 199 <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> GLUT 1 and the 294 C-terminal <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> GLUT 4. Endogenous GLUT 1 was quantitatively co-immunoprecipitated by using an anti-GLUT 4 C-terminal peptide antibody from detergent extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either of the chimeric proteins, as detected by immunoblotting the precipitates with an anti-GLUT 1 C-terminal peptide antiserum. No co-immunoprecipitation of native GLUT 1 with native GLUT 4 from extracts of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, which contain both these transporters, was observed with the same antibody. These data {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that GLUT 1 transporters exist as homodimers or higher order oligomers and that a major determinant of oligomerization is located within the first 199 <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> GLUT 1...|$|R

Aim {{of this investigation was}} to get more information about the threat to groundwater quality as a consequence of application of pesticides, in order to consider possible measures for protection of groundwater quality in the future. A total of 59 groundwater samples have been taken in regions where pesticides are applied and where the soil is relatively vulnerable for leaching <b>of</b> pesticide <b>residues</b> to groundwater. In contract for two provinces (Zuid-Holland and Noord- Brabant) some extra samples have been taken. Most of the samples have been taken from a depth of 5 or 10 m below soil surface. From the results can be concluded that in 36 cases groundwater contained <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> pesticides at concentrations higher than the EC-guideline for drinking water, where a maximum concentration of 0. 1 mug/l is mentioned for one pesticide and 0. 5 mug/l for the total of several compounds.
