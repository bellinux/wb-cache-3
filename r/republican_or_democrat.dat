2500|$|Romney said of {{the measure}} overall, [...] "There really wasn't <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrat</b> in this. People ask me if this is {{conservative}} or liberal, and my answer is yes. It's liberal {{in the sense that}} we're getting our citizens health insurance. It's conservative in that we're not getting a government takeover." [...] The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office. [...] When Romney's official portrait was made for the Massachusetts State House, the composition included a leather binder with a medical seal representing the healthcare legislation.|$|E

5000|$|Carmichael always {{championed the}} need for a two-party system in {{politics}} whether this meant [...] "Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats</b> and Loyal Democrats." [...] In mid-century Georgia this statement risked political suicide to a politician with statewide aspirations. However, in 1960 he introduced Richard Nixon at his campaign event in Atlanta.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{they may}} be {{dissatisfied}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats</b> who {{are open to the}} idea of voting for other parties, or they could be people who have never had a strong affiliation with any political party, and will vote depending on certain things that influence them: healthcare, benefits, election campaign etc.|$|R
2500|$|The {{political}} {{dominance of}} the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies such as the successful establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or his failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income {{by way of a}} negative income tax. Affirmative action in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon [...] "War on Drugs" [...] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and his policy of détente with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.|$|E

50|$|In 1982, when Dan Stein was twenty-seven-years old, FAIR—with {{its small}} {{headquarters}} on P Street in Washington, D.C.—had only ten members. At {{the time it}} was not widely accepted by either the <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Throughout the 1980s FAIR's lobbying efforts on Capital Hill met with more success as did their direct mail campaigns. FAIR received funds from donors such as Cordelia Scaife May (1928-2005) through her Laurel Foundation(1928-2005) and the Pioneer Fund which contributed $1.2 million to FAIR in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The American Party, {{formerly}} the Native American Party, was the vehicle of the Know Nothing movement. The American Party absorbed {{most of the}} former Whig Party that had not gone to either the <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 1854, and by 1855 it had established itself as the chief opposition party to the Democrats. In the 82 races for the House of Representatives in 1854, the American Party ran 76 candidates, 35 of whom won. None of the six independents or Whigs who ran in these races were elected. The party then succeeded in electing Nathaniel P. Banks as Speaker of the House in the 34th Congress.|$|R
50|$|Muste was {{influenced}} by the prevalent theology of the social gospel, and began to read the written ideas of various radical thinkers of the day, {{going so far as to}} vote for Socialist candidate Eugene V.

We need sound business principles in Baton Rouge and not more politics. To attract business, we need leaders who know how to talk business, not politics," [...] Francis said.|$|E

During the 2002 campaign he claimed he was beaten, arrested and jailed (in Brighton, Michigan) for attempting {{to participate in a}} gubernatorial debate from which he was excluded, at the time being the only candidate who was not either a <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It was {{reported}} that Tester opposed the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, where {{it was decided that}} corporations and unions had free-speech rights that allow them to donate money to third party political groups.

[...] He {{went on to say that}} he didn't believe that the forefathers envisioned corporations enjoying the same or more rights than people, which he thought was happening.

I ask {{attention}} to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the Declaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile; that man with body and soul is a matter of dollars and cents. I suggest to this portion of the Ohio <b>Republicans,</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats,</b> if there be any present, the serious consideration of this fact, that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject. With this, my friends, I bid you adieu.|$|R

50|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1972 {{was an extremely}} partisan election for New York, with 99.75% of the electorate voting either <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Having delivered as President a period of relative economic stability and growth, and showing promising movements towards peace in Vietnam, Nixon was able to gain reelection with electors from every State in the U.S., except Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. The Vietnam War {{continued to be a}} strong issue during this election, with both candidates declaring desire to end the conflict.|$|E
50|$|This {{experience}} led President Truman {{to nominate}} General Kuter for {{the chairmanship of}} the Civil Aeronautics Board. At this time several military figures had recently been appointed to high civilian positions and General Eisenhower was emerging as a possible political figure, <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrat.</b> The Senate committee refused to confirm the nomination of another military man to such position, and indicated that it would be necessary for General Kuter to resign from the service before accepting the position. General Kuter preferred not to resign from the Air Force and asked that his nomination be withdrawn.|$|E

And I think it’s a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements. I think that gives more credibility, frankly, to SNAP." ...|$|E
50|$|When Arthur C. Townley came to Bismarck, North Dakota in 1915, he saw strife {{between a}} {{conservative}} legislature and farmers' interest groups. With his background in organizing farmers for the Socialist Party, Socialist activity {{had begun in}} North Dakota in 1900 when Arthur Basset organized a socialist club in Fargo. Townley brought his expertise to North Dakota. He knew that with the recent strife in Bismarck between a conservative legislature and the American Society of Equity and its farm following, the time was ripe for a political revolution. Townley resolved to organize the farmers, {{so that they could}} control the primaries, whether it be <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> both. This was the organization of the Farmers Nonpartisan League (later called the National Nonpartisan League). Townley organized the farmers of the state together for united action in nominating at the primaries and electing at the polls the men of their own choosing and men who would carry out their programs.|$|R
500|$|In 2014, Gibbs {{discussed}} his preference for local politics: “At the state level, it’s {{much more about}} whether you are a <b>Republican</b> <b>or</b> a <b>Democrat</b> and winning and losing, rather than making decisions that are good for Colorado. The more dysfunctional things get at {{the federal and state}} levels, the more people seem to come together at the local level to accomplish goals that are important to communities.” ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} in both finance {{and political science}} has identified a series of systematic patterns in the way stock market responds to significant political events. The lack of a common theoretical core {{as well as the}} use of different empirical specifications in two literatures which hardly cross-reference each other has led to contradictory results. Several relevant questions arise: do stock markets really prefer <b>Republicans</b> <b>or</b> <b>Democrats?</b> Is divided government somehow better or worse for the stock market? We develop a theoretical framework to comprehend two under-theorized mechanisms through which political factors affect stock market performance: redistributive and regulatory policies. Two main predictions follow from the model: stock market performs better under Democratic Presidencies and under Divided Government. We then test them by looking at monthly changes in US stock market performance from the 1870 s until today. We control for all relevant variables used in both previous literatures and subject the results to robustnes...|$|R
