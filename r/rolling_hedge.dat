40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} hedging {{effectiveness}} and unbiasedness hypothesis of the IMAREX PM 4 TC freight futures contract. First, we present theory of dry bulk shipping and risk management. Then, we study hedging {{effectiveness of the}} futures contract. This is performed by using regression models and a VAR model to calculate constant hedge ratios and a VAR-GARCH model to calculate time-varying hedge ratios. We find the hedging effectiveness to range from 29, 50 % to 31, 78 %, when hedging {{one of the four}} T/C routes underlying the futures contract. Hedging with time-varying hedge ratios is in most cases shown to be superior to hedging with a constant hedge ratio. Finally, the unbiasedness hypothesis is studied. We find that one month to maturity futures contracts give an unbiased prediction of the spot price at maturity. This implies that a hedger can trade in one month to maturity futures contracts without paying a risk premium. A <b>rolling</b> <b>hedge</b> can thus be executed efficiently. In addition, the futures price can be used to guide in decision making. Unbiasedness is also indicated for two and three months to maturity contracts, but, due to a small data sample and residual diagnostics problems, we have not drawn any conclusions.

40|$|We explore {{strategic}} {{trade in}} short-lived securities by agents who possess long-term information. Trading short-lived securities is profitable only if {{enough of the}} private information becomes public prior to contract expiration; otherwise the security will worthlessly expire. We highlight how this results in trading behavior fundamentally different from that observed in standard models of informed trading in equity. Specifically, we show that informed agents are more reluctant to trade shorter-term securities too far in advance of when their information will necessarily be made public, and that existing positions in a shorter-term security make future purchases more attractive. Because informed agents prefer longer-term securities, this can make trading shorter-term contracts more attractive for liquidity traders. We characterize {{the conditions under which}} liquidity traders choose to incur extra costs to roll over short-term positions rather than trade in distant contracts, providing an explanation for why most longer-term derivative security markets have little liquidity and large bid-ask spreads. Priviate information, derivative securities, <b>rolling</b> the <b>hedge,</b> fixed transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|Vattenfall hedge {{its future}} {{electricity}} production {{in order to}} decrease fluctuations in the result. Hedging can in a simplified way be described as selling the future electricity deliveries in long-term contracts so that the future price of the delivery becomes fixed. The contracts used are electricity forwards traded at the Nordic electricity market Nord Pool. An imbalance between buyers and sellers {{can lead to a}} situation where the forward price not equals the expected spot price. The difference between the forward price and the expected spot price {{is referred to as the}} market risk premium. This is the extra premium that market participants are willing to pay to offset risk. Vattenfall’s production portfolio is one of the largest in the Nordic region and the lack of liquidity at Nord Pool’s long-term contracts is therefore a limiting factor in effective risk management. The theory is that partly due to the lower liquidity in the longer contracts, Vattenfall pays an unfavorable risk premium in its long term hedges (i. e. selling the electricity to a discount). In this master thesis the risk premia in the Nord Pool electricity market is measured. It is also investigated if the risk premia changes with different time left to delivery. The results show that the risk premia is positive for contracts entered close to delivery, i. e. the forward price exceeds the expected spot price. When time to delivery increases the risk premia decreases and turns negative around one and a half year prior to delivery. The second part of this master thesis consists of an introduction and evaluation of a hedge strategy which is commonly referred to as <b>rolling</b> the <b>hedge.</b> This strategy is supposed to remove the negative effects of the long term negative risk premium. The concept is to use two or more short-term contracts instead of a long-term contract. In this way the negative risk premium is avoided. This can be done because the price movements of the short-term contracts are correlated with the long-term contracts so that the result is protected in the same way as with a long-term contract. However less than perfect which means that the volatility (i. e. the risk) will increase. To investigate whether this strategy, in an efficient way, can be applied to increase the expected return without a significant increase in risk, the outcome of the strategy in terms of risk and return from several different starting points are calculated with actual historical price data. It is showed, although the significance of the result should be interpreted with caution, that the expected return of the combined spot delivery and hedge program can be increased without any major increase in the volatility of the returns...|$|R
