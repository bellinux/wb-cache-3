40|$|<b>Sile</b> <b>river</b> can be {{considered}} one of the most important water infrastructures of the central Veneto region. Through the centuries, natural processes and anthropic transformations strongly modified its structure creating a unique landscape, in which the different traces of the past are still visible. In fact, due to the conclusions of several economical cycles, the river slowly lost his infrastructural role not only from the productive perspective but also from the spatial one. Consequently, as an unpleasant legacy, some industrial sites, such as mines, furnaces, potteries, granaries lost their functions or/and their relations with the watercourse. Nowadays, the <b>Sile</b> <b>River</b> constitutes one of the richest ecological environments, creating a biological continuity across different landscapes in which wastelands are perceived as obstacles. Based on this assumption, firstly the paper explores the paradoxical relationships between wastelands and water landscape, secondly, trough a research by design investigation and observation of the systemic territorial dynamics it aims to give new values to wastelands. Therefore <b>Sile</b> <b>river</b> is not be seen as line across the territory but as thick bound, in which the complexity of the ecological dynamics are deeply intertwined with the social and the productive one. status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|The Venetian Lagoon {{stretches}} from the <b>River</b> <b>Sile</b> {{in the north}} to the Brenta in the south, with a surface area of around 550 km2. It is around 8% land, including Venice itself and many smaller islands. About 11% is permanently covered by open water, or canal, as the network of dredged channels are called, while around 80% consists of mud flats, tidal shallows and salt marshes. The lagoon is the largest wetland in the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E

40|$|During the ’ 80 s of {{the last}} century the {{activity}} of local amateurs led to the identification and collection of several thousand lithic artefacts mostly referred to the Mesolithic {{in the area of the}} Sile river springs (Veneto, North-Eastern Italy). Although representing one of the rare evidence of occupation of alluvial plains by Mesolithic groups in the Italian peninsula, for several years such discoveries have been completely forgotten. Starting from 2012 a new research project aimed at the diachronic reconstruction of prehistoric settlement dynamics related to environmental changes has been undertaken over this area. The preliminary data indicate an intense occupation near the springs of the <b>river</b> <b>Sile</b> by the Mesolithic groups during the ancient and middle Holocene, in close connection to the peculiar features of this wetland area which possibly represented the focus of rich biotopes suitable for subsistence...|$|E

The city lay in proximity of the Via Postumia, which connected Opitergium to Aquileia, two major cities of Roman Venetia during Ancient and early medieval times. Treviso is rarely mentioned by ancient writers, although Pliny writes of the Silis, that is the <b>Sile</b> <b>River,</b> as flowing ex montibus Tarvisanis.|$|R

40|$|The hamlet Le Trezze di Quarto d’Altino is {{situated}} in the contact area where the mainland {{gives way to the}} Venice lagoon. The lagoon is made up of a complex network of land and salt marshes crossed by canals: a physical and environmental system subjected to deep transfor- mation processes both of natural and anthropic origin. The reclamation works carried out by the fascist regime starting from 1927 constitute the last phase of impressive land modification initiated by the Venetian Republic in the 16 th century. Along the provincial road running on the left bank of the <b>River</b> <b>Sile,</b> a long row of farmhouses was erected along three kilometres. These houses were part of a linear settlement placed between the canal Taglio del Sile and the lagoon, {{at the edges of the}} large reclamation area. The rhetoric of the regime is reflected in the propagandistic names of the houses, referring to the position (Sile House); the productivity of the soil (Florid House, Fertile House, Fecund House, Favourite House); the land reclamation (Resurrected House, Hope House); the politi- cal propaganda (Rebirth House, Redeemed House, Victory House, Imperial House). The building typologies comply with three recurring solutions, taking into account the num- ber of hosted families and the activities performed. The settlement was designed in stylis- tic continuity with the Venetian rural architectural tradition but it was built with advanced techniques. In fact, the houses are exemplary of an important moment of transition from traditional construction methods to one based on the use of materials and techniques typi- cal of industrial production. Since the 1960 s, due to the increasing attractiveness of the industrial complexes in the region, the whole area has been abandoned by its inhabitants. Nowadays, in the total absence of policies of landscape enhancement, this modern rural building heritage which carries a controversial historical memory for the country is gradually degrading...|$|E
500|$|In summer 1356, Louis invaded Venetian territories {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war. He laid siege to Treviso on 27 July. A local nobleman, Giuliano Baldachino, noticed that Louis sat alone while writing his {{letters on the}} banks of <b>Sile</b> <b>River</b> on each morning. Baldachino proposed the Venetians to assassinate him in exchange for 12,000 golden florins and Castelfranco Veneto, but they refused his offer because he did not share the details of his plans with them. Louis returned to Buda in the autumn, but his troops continued the siege. Pope Innocent VI urged the Venetians to make a peace with Hungary. The pope made Louis the [...] "standard-bearer of the Church" [...] and granted him a three-year tithe to fight against Francesco II Ordelaffi and other rebellious lords in the Papal States. Louis sent an army under Nicholas Lackfi's command to support the pope's troops in Italy.|$|R
40|$|The Venice Lagoon {{mainland}} {{is affected}} by salt water contamination in coastal and circum-lagoonal aquifers due to the close vicinity of both the sea and lagoon. The territory, characterized lithologically by alternating layers of silt, clay and sand which have marine, continental and/or marsh origins, is characterized by several critical conditions. These include the existence of paleorivers, lagoonal paleochannels, and rivers which are artificially suspended above the surrounding land by dikes. All of these conditions contribute {{to an increase in}} groundwater salinization. Areas with high permeability seem to constitute a preferential way of movement for salt water from the sea or lagoon towards the mainland. Old fossil water seems to be able to reach the surface and contribute to an increase in the process of salt pollution. In fact, during the 1970 s, several studies had detected, throughout the territory, the existence of a deep salt water aquifer storing fossil saline water. This aquifer lies at a depth of about 300 - 450 m {{in the southern part of}} the study area and of more than 600 m in the northern part of the Venice mainland. Salt water contamination of subsoil could cause ground salinization and, consequently, desertification of the area, with great economical consequences. These include damaging the large agricultural development of the territory as well as having adverse impacts on the tourist industry. The combined use of adequately validated geophysical and geochemical tools confers a multidisciplinary character to the research and allows for the definition of the phenomenon’s superficial extension. Geophysical analysis based on Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and conductivity logs have been performed together with water table measurements and geochemical analysis on samples collected from selected wells. Moreover, a critical review of old geophysical data allowed for the verification of possible saline contamination changes in time. Interesting results have been obtained within the northern sector of the Venice lagoon mainland, specifically within territory of Jesolo. In this case, considering the influence of the Piave and <b>Sile</b> <b>rivers</b> and the presence of a coastal sand dune, it is possible to create a map of salt water contamination to evaluate the agricultural use of superficial water. Therefore, the aim of this research is to define the effective origin of salt water found in the aquifers of the northern lagoon mainland, its distribution, extension and its preferential way of movement within the territory. Thereby, relating all the information acquired to the geological, geomorphological and stratigraphic characteristics of the area...|$|R
