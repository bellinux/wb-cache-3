At the time McKinstry already held a commission as Colonel, 48th Alabama Militia Regiment, based in Mobile County, Alabama. As an officer of militia, on Feb. 18, 1862, McKinstry purchased 854 uniform jackets and pants, 677 pair of shoes, plus shirts, great coats and flannel drawers. The Confederate Government later reimbursed the state for this clothing, suggesting that officers and men of McKinstry's 32nd Alabama Regiment received it. The regiment entered Confederate service at Camp Goodwin, near Mobile, Alabama, Apr. 18, 1862.|$|E

In 1529 {{he was made}} chancellor {{of the church of}} Salisbury, and in 1530 received a prebend at York, and a prebend of the royal chapel, and was incorporated D.D. at Oxford. Lee made himself useful to the king at home in the matter of the divorce, and on 1 June 1531 was one of a deputation which was sent to the queen to persuade her to forgo her rights. He spoke freely to the queen, who told him that what he said was untrue. In September, Henry wrote to the pope <b>requesting</b> <b>authority</b> for Lee's elevation to the archbishopric of York. On 13 October, Lee and others had an interview with Catharine, in which they urged her to withdraw her cause from Rome and submit to the decision of bishops and doctors. Clement granted a bull for Lee's elevation on the 30th; he was consecrated to the see of York on 10 December, and was enthroned by proxy on the 17th.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, {{a handful}} of owners in both Riverdale Park and the nearby West Riverdale petitioned the Maryland General Assembly <b>requesting</b> <b>authority</b> to {{incorporate}} the two neighborhoods as a municipality. On June 14, 1920, the two communities were incorporated as the Town of Riverdale. As {{a result of the}} transfer of power from the Riverdale Park Company to the municipal government, the importance of the real estate company began to diminish, prompting a financial strain. Within ten years of the town’s incorporation, the Riverdale Park Company went bankrupt.Numerous annexations in the mid-twentieth century increased Riverdale’s overall size. The municipal government continued to grow and change during this period. In 1941, the town changed the name of its roads to conform to the standards of the United States Postal Service, carrying a similar pattern as those of Washington, D.C., and nearby College Park. The increasing population and commercial and governmental growth of metropolitan Washington, D.C., most notably during the last twenty years of the twentieth century, has resulted in further development of the town of Riverdale. This late-twentieth-century growth was predominantly commercial and centered along Baltimore Avenue, thereby physically and visually separating West Riverdale from Riverdale Park.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, Meng had Li Hao draft {{petitions}} on {{the part}} of the five acting military governors of the five subsidiary circuits, asking that Meng be given acting imperial authority in the region and asking for imperially-issued staffs for their own commands. Li Hao pointed out that this is the authority that Meng himself should be asking for, lest that he be viewed as needing the sanctioning from his subordinates. Under Li Hao's suggestion, Meng therefore submitted a petition of his own, <b>requesting</b> <b>authority</b> to commission prefectural prefects and lower-level officials on his own, while requesting that the imperial government officially command the five acting military governors as military governors. He also requested that the imperial government send the wives and children of the soldiers from the Central Plains to allow the families to be reunited. In winter 932, Emperor Mingzong again sent Li Cungui to Chengdu to deliver his edict, largely approving Meng's requests, and further giving him the authority to commission even military governors in the region. However, he refused to send the wives and children of the soldiers to the region, but also did not (as Meng had feared that he might) order that they be returned to the imperial government. Shortly after, Meng, under authorities granted by Emperor Mingzong, formally bestowed the five acting military governors full commands.|$|E

On 25 August Sultan of Zanzibar Hamad bin Thuwaini died, his nephew Khalid proclaiming himself sultan. The British authorities had the right to appoint the Sultan and had chosen Hamoud bin Mohammed. The Consul-General, AH Hardinge, was away in Britain at the time and it fell to Cave, as the most senior British diplomat present, to issue a warning to Khalid. He did so in person at the Sultan's palace alongside General Mathews, but was ignored and Khalid began fortifying the area. Cave continued to send messages to Khalid informing him that the British government considered this an act of rebellion and requesting that he stand down his troops and renounce the sultancy. This was ignored and Cave telegraphed his superiors at the Foreign Office for authorisation to use force. He also informed all other foreign official not to recognise Khalid, to which they agreed. During this time of unrest Mrs Cave lent her sitting rooms at the Consulate as a refuge for the European ladies of the town and instructed her cook to provide for them.|$|E
