The tax on expenses is accrued on the annual basis of taxation and is paid once until 31 March of the following year.The main group of taxable persons are local legal entities and foreign legal entities by place of business within the country. Therein are also included sole proprietors in respect of taxes withheld at source on expenses, {{as well as in}} cases where they are subject to an alternative tax.For the purposes of taxation under Bulgarian law the key term is [...] "local legal entity".

40|$|Around year 2004, a {{new service}} was {{introduced}} on the Swedish housing market {{with the purpose}} of increasing the sell price, namely homestaging. Homestaging means that a home gets in order before a open house, for example by removing personal affections or the leasing of new furniture. The phenomenon originates from the United States, where it has existed for several decades. Most components, but not all, that is included in the homestaging concept is tax-deductible and this has lead to several questions around the law and foremost within tax law. To elucidate this complexity of problems around the right to deduction for homestaging, the Swedish tax agency, Skatteverket, has formulated a letter stating the authority’s attitude towards the phenomenon. The letter functions as a recommendation but is not comparable with law. The operators within the real estate sector that is most likely to come in contact with the concept is homestagers and real-estate agents. How extensive is these operators’ knowledge within the right to deduction and the complex of problem around this? On these premises, a telephone survey has been carried out to find out which knowledge 20 real-estate agents and 25 homestagers posseses within the right to deduction and which information they give to their customers. To check which information is given via the homestagers webpages, 50 homepages has also been analyzed. Moreover, a representative from the Swedish tax agency has been interviewed to create deeper understanding regarding the authority’s attitude. In addition to these interviews, a survey has been done with the aim to find what tax-law-legislated demarcations considered compitable to what applies for homestaging and the right to deduction. The survey of the webpages shows that the homestagers with a webpage linking/referring to Skatteverkets letter is the homestagers that is most knowledgeable within the tax law and the right to deduction. The interviews with the real-estate brokers and homestagers show existence of significant knowledge gap in both groups concerning the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>deduction.</b> The deficiency is more alarming in the real-estate agent group, because of their legal advisory role. The different components within the concept of homestaging are related to the following cost areas; sale costs, improvement costs or personal living expenses. Costs that are related to sale costs are tax-deductible without reservations, costs that are related to improvement costs is considered as tax-deductible if they meet certain criteria and costs that are related to personal living expenses are never tax-deductible. Sometimes, the boundaries are somewhat indistinct {{and the nature of the}} costs becomes a matter of interpretation. The letter from Skatteverket, the right to deduction, the media attention, requests from homestagers and real-estate brokers and the possibility to get a higher sale price for a real estate, concludes that homestaging is not a temporary fad but is here to stay...|$|E
40|$|Nevtralnost davka na dodano vrednost je v tem, da omogoča pravico do odbitka vstopnega davka na dodano vrednost. Pravica do odbitka vstopnega DDV je vezana na pogoje, ki jih z zakonom predpisuje slovenska nacionalna zakonodaja in pravo ES. Davčni zavezanec sme praviloma pri izračunu svoje davčne obveznosti odbiti vstopni DDV, ki ga je dolžan ali ga je plačal, če so kumulativno izpolnjeni naslednji pogoji: 1. da se DDV nanaša na dobavo blaga ali storitev od drugega davčnega zavezanca 2. da ima davčni zavezanec ustrezen račun 3. da gre za uporabo tega blaga ali storitev za namene njegovih obdavčenih transakcij 4. da ne gre za goljufijo ali zlorabo sistema DDV, oziroma da davčni zavezanec ni vedel ali moral vedeti, da je bila transakcija, na katero se sklicuje pri utemeljitvi pravice do odbitka, povezana z goljufijo, ki jo je storil izdajatelj računa ali drug gospodarski subjekt višje v dobavni verigi. V Sloveniji temeljijo pravila dokaznega bremena na zakonu. Davčni organ mora dokazati dejstva na podlagi katerih davčna obveznost nastane ali ne nastane oz. se poveča ali zmanjša. Davčni zavezanec pa je dolžan za svoje navedbe ponuditi dokaze in jih tudi predložiti. V praksi se izvaja doktrina, da je dokazno breme na davčnem zavezancu. Po sodbi Mahageben, mora davčni organ, ki nosi breme dokazovanja, dokazati, da je inšpicirani davčni zavezanec (profiter, buffer) vedel oz. bi moral vedeti, da sodeluje v goljufiji davčne utaje. Davčni inšpektorji v svojih postopkih ravnajo po ZDavP- 2, ZUP in ZIN, ter nimajo pooblastil za dokazovanje naklepa, kot ga imajo organi pregona za ugotavljanje elementov kaznivih ravnanj po ZKP. Do sodbe Mahageben so bili davčni organi precej uspešnejši pri dokazovanju, kot po izdani sodbi, vendar je razlika predvsem na strani sodišč RS, ki po tej sodbi zahtevajo veliko višji dokazni standard, kot prej. Lahko bi celo rekli, da sodišče pred to sodbo ni zahtevalo dokazovanja o vedenju zavezanca o goljufiji dobavitelja. The {{neutrality}} of {{the value}} added tax (VAT) allows the right to deduct the input value added tax. The right to deduct the input VAT is linked with the conditions which are prescribed by the Slovenian national law and European law as well. Generally, the taxpayer in their calculation of their tax liability could deduct the input VAT which is obliged or paid if the following cumulative conditions are met. Firstly, the VAT shall {{be related to the}} supply of goods or services from another taxable person. Secondly, the taxpayer has the appropriate bank account. Thirdly, the use of the goods or services shall be used for the purposes of its taxable transactions. Finally, the transactions shall not be connected with the tax fraud or abuse of the VAT system. That means that the taxpayer did not know or should have known that the transaction related to the justify of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>deduction</b> is not connected to the tax fraud which is committed by the issuer of the invoice or other economic operator in the supply chain. In Slovenia, the burden of proof is based on the law. The tax authority shall prove the facts on which the tax liability arises, does not arise, increases or decreases, respectively. Taxpayer is obliged to offer their arguments and submit the evidence. In practice, it carries out the doctrine that the burden of proof bears on the taxpayer. Following the judgment of Mahageben, the tax authority which bears the burden of proof has to demonstrate that the inspected taxpayer (profiter, buffer) knew or should know that participates itself in the fraud of tax evasion. In Slovenia, the tax inspectors in their procedures comply with the Tax Procedure Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Inspection Act, and they are not authorized to prove the intent like the law enforcement authorities which are focused to determine the elements of the offense according to the Criminal Procedure Act. Until the judgment of Mahageben,the tax authorities were quite successful in demonstrating the proofs as the judgment was issued, but the difference is mainly {{on the side of the}} courts of the Republic of Slovenia which after this judgement require much higher standard of the burden of proof than before. We could even say that the court before this judgment does not require any proof of the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about the tax fraud of the supplier...|$|E
