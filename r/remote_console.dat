5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The <b>remote</b> <b>console</b> and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
25|$|During the 2013-16 {{restoration}} and {{renovation of the}} Cathedral, the gallery organ was completely dismantled and rebuilt by the organ builders Diego Cera of the Philippines. The organ was dismantled and shipped to the Philippines and revoiced and repaired while the cathedral was closed. The organ was provided with a new console and a new tracker action, while the original organ case was restored and extended. One no longer sees the asymmetrical facade, as all the pipe work was re-organized into the new case. The organ is also playable from a <b>remote</b> <b>console</b> located in the south transept, where the choir is now located. The cherubs and Saint Caecilia statue were not reinstalled after the restoration.|$|E

In some cases, the base station was located at the same address as the control console. In other cases, the base station was located at a distant site.

5000|$|Universal <b>Remote</b> <b>Console</b> (URC) is a {{standard}} for defining alternative user interfaces for devices {{that can be used}} remotely. In the vocabulary of URC, the remote devices are called [...] "controllers", while the devices they control are called [...] "targets". The controller presents a user interface for the target that can be an alternative in various respects: the user interface language, its ease of use, its accessibility to persons with disabilities, etc. Since user interfaces in different devices or products ("targets") can vary a lot, Universal <b>Remote</b> <b>Console</b> would enable a user to control these products through a single device; this single device would present interfaces that are adapted to the user's needs. The communication between a target and a controller typically uses a wireless protocol; the URC standard does not restrict which protocols can be used. For example, the [...] "Universal <b>Remote</b> <b>Console</b> on HTTP" [...] (URC-HTTP) protocol is a protocol that can be implemented by servers that are compliant with UPnP RemoteUI (CEA-2014).|$|E

25|$|All games {{made for}} the Xbox 360 are {{required}} to support at least Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The console works with over 256 audio channels and 320 independent decompression channels using 32-bit processing for audio, with support for 48kHz 16-bit sound. Sound files for games are encoded using Microsoft's XMA audio format. An MPEG-2 decoder is included for DVD video playback. VC-1 or WMV is used for streaming video and other video is compressed using VC-1 at non-HD NTSC and PAL resolutions or WMV HD. The Xbox 360 also supports H.263 and H.264 MPEG-4 videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is no voice echo to game players on the same console; voice only goes to <b>remote</b> <b>consoles.</b>|$|R
