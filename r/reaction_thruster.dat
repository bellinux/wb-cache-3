40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and design of a <b>reaction</b> <b>thruster</b> attitude control for the Brazilian Multimission platform satellite. The three-axis attitude control systems are activated in pulse mode. Consequently, a modulation of the torque command is compelling {{in order to avoid}} high nonlinear control action. This work considers the Pulse-Width Pulse-Frequency (PWPF) modulator which is composed of a Schmidt trigger, a first-order filter, and a feedback loop. PWPF modulator holds several advantages over classical bang-bang controllers such as close to linear operation, high accuracy, and reduced propellant consumption. The Linear Gaussian Quadratic (LQG) technique is used to synthesize the control law during stabilization mode and the modulator is used to modulate the continuous control signal to discrete one. Numerical simulations are used to analyze the performance of the attitude control. The LQG/PWPF approach achieves good stabilization-mode requirements as disturbances rejection and regulation performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} continuation {{method is}} used for bifurcation analysis of the complex behavior that appears in the attitude dynamics of rigid spacecraft {{as a result of}} switching logics in control system elements.

25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, <b>reaction</b> <b>thrusters,</b> and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|R
30|$|A high-precision full {{quaternion}} based finite-time three-axis cascade {{attitude control}} strategy is {{considered in the}} present research with respect to state-of-the-art {{to deal with a}} class of overactuated space systems. The main idea behind the subject is to design a new quaternion based proportional derivative approach, which is realized along with the linear quadratic regulator method. In a word, the control technique proposed here is organized based upon an inner closed loop control to handle the angular rates in the three axes and the corresponding outer closed loop to handle the rotational angles in the same three axes, as well. It aims us to cope with the present complex and complicated systems, in the productive and constructive manner, in a number of programmed space missions such as orbital, communicational, thermal and so on maneuvers. It can be shown that the proposed cascade control strategy is organized in association with a set of pulse-width pulse-frequency modulators to drive a number of on–off <b>reaction</b> <b>thrusters.</b> It should be noted that these ones could significantly be increased w. r. t. the investigated control efforts, in order to provide overall accurate performance of the present space systems. There is currently a control allocation realization to complete the process of the approach presentation and organization. At last, the investigated results are presented in comparison with some potential benchmarks to guarantee and verify the approach performance.|$|R
