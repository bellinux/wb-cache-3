50|$|In {{the on-line}} process, the {{cleaning}} body {{moves through the}} tubes with the conveying medium and cleans them by means of its oversize compared to the tube diameter. In the range of diameters of up to 50 mm these cleaning bodies consist of <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber,</b> in larger diameters up {{to the size of}} oil pipelines {{it is a matter of}} scrapers or so-called pigs. <b>Sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls are applied mainly for cooling water, like sea, river, or cooling tower water. For the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, specially adapted cleaning bodies are imaginable but the conveying media flows are so weak that off-line processes are employed in most cases. Given the fact that the cleaning bodies are not allowed to remain in the conveying medium they have to be collected after passing through the tubes. In the case of <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls this is done through special strainer sections; for scrapers or pigs an outward transfer station is provided. According to the Taprogge process, the <b>sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls are re-injected upstream of the system to be cleaned by a corresponding ball recirculating unit whereas the scraper or pig is mostly taken out by hand and re-injected into another collector. <b>Sponge</b> <b>rubber</b> balls therefore safeguard a continuous cleaning while the scraper or pig system is discontinuous.|$|R

40|$|Haptic {{information}} is a bilateral information {{of the law}} of action and reaction. Most of the researchers have done experiments on bilateral teleoperation but still they haven’t given much attention on force lock during bilateral teleoperation even though it’s important in the latest technology. This research proposes an enhanced force limiting gripper to avoid object deformation when it is in contact with the slave due to excessive forces imposed by the master operator in bilateral control. The force lock protects the gripped object on the slave and the attainment of the force limit is notified to the master operator via a small vibration. Master operator is expected to experience a spring effect if the operator presses his leaver towards the force increasing direction. The continuous copying of the slave position as the reference to the virtual spring controller’s spring equilibrium point allows smooth releasing. In addition to vibration the loss of reaction force coming from the slave environment could also be sensed by the master operator. Releasing logic of force lock can be determined by the operator. In this proposed system sensor-less sensing is used. Disturbance Observer (DOB) is used to estimate disturbances and Reaction Torque Observer (RTOB) estimates reaction forces. The reaction from real world includes not only position and force information but also environmental impedance. The griped object impedance variation with the motion parameters of the actuator should also be analyzed. In this research, the behavior of environmental object impedance has been studied with the changes of the different motion parameters of the actuator, like applied force, velocity, position and depth on the object 3 D space. This idea is exemplified using a rubber balloon and a <b>rubber</b> <b>sponge</b> which is often modeled using simple linear equations. The proposed system is tested using hardware setup and results prove the applicability of RTOB and DOB for force feedback gripper for haptic teleoperation.

Soil removal methods such as vacuuming, wetcleaning, and solvent cleaning may remove unsatisfactory quantities of soil or cannot {{be used due to}} the condition or characteristics of a textile. Natural <b>rubber</b> block <b>sponges</b> and polyurethane foam sponges, commonly sold as cosmetic applicators, have been used for surface cleaning by some textile conservators. Published literature that focuses on sponges’ efficacy, risks, or benefits is limited; existing research is limited to paintings conservation research and brief mentions in case studies. This study is a comparison of sponge types and brands to determine the most appropriate product for soil removal from the surface of fabrics. ^ The lack of published standards for textile conservation methods and research required pretests to determine soiling, vacuuming, and sponging procedures. One pretest demonstrated that sponges are effective for a surprisingly small number of tamps before soil is redeposited onto the surface. The method section also includes detailed descriptions of material selection for the sponges, soil, and substrate. Five sponges were selected based on composition, brand, and physical characteristics. ^ Trial 1 results, comparing sponge efficacy, found that the polyurethane Studio 35 Beauty™ cosmetic wedge sponge was the most effective at removing soot. Trial 2 results, testing the number of clean sponge surfaces, found that two to four sponge surfaces tamped ten times each may be used to remove soil after which point additional clean sponge surfaces do not remove significant amounts of carbon black. Trial 3 results, observing damage to aged textiles, determined that all tested sponges equally produced little damage. Trial 4 results, evaluating residue and debris, indicate that the use of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>sponges</b> should be discontinued, due to the high quantities of potentially damaging residue left after tamping. The most effective sponge in this study was the Studio 35 Beauty™ cosmetic wedge sponge, a small-cell polyurethane sponge with calcium carbonate additives. ...|$|R
