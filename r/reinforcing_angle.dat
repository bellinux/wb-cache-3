In addition, the same structure execution mechanisms are currently implemented redundantly in different systems rather than reusing structure execution services.

Moreover the presence (or not) of connections of the angles with the end joints influences their capacity to support vertical loads. In the two cases the mechanical models have to account for buckling or frictional effects. In this frame this paper presents a selected review of literature confinement models for steel jacketed concrete elements, presenting a parametric study in which the main confinement parameters predictable by each of them are compared. The reliability of the models in object is finally tested comparing analytical predictions of the ultimate vertical capacity with experimental results coming from several literature compressive tests of reinforced column specimens...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Conducting {{stability}} tests in avalanche terrain is inherently dangerous since it exposes the observer {{to the potential}} of being caught in an avalanche. Recent work shows that such exposure may be unnecessary since the results of extended column tests (ECTs) and propagation saw tests (PSTs) are largely independent of slope angle, allowing for data collection in safer locations. Conversely, some past work shows that compression tests (CTs) are slope angle dependent. In this paper, we test the effect of slope angle on CTs using similar methods as the recent ECT work. We collected field data on three sep-arate days with persistent weak layers in Montana and California. Our slopes exhibited gradual changes in steepness, allowing us to sample a variety of slope angles with minimal snow structure changes. We also employed a second method to reinforce our results. Utilizing the SnowPilot dataset, we analyzed the difference between propagating ECTs and CTs on the same layer, and compared that difference with slope angle. Our fieldwork shows that the CT test results either did not change or increased slightly with increasing slope angle. Further, the SnowPilot data demonstrate {{that the difference between}} ECTs and CTs is not statistically dependent on slope <b>angle,</b> <b>reinforcing</b> conclusions from our field work. Our results have significant theoretical implications, but the practical implications are even more important since this work suggests that, in addition to ECTs and PSTs, CTs can be conducted in safer low-angle terrain...|$|R

40|$|This {{study had}} three main objectives; to {{investigate}} the safety of empirically used slopes for landfill caps, to automate the direct shear apparatus, and to compare the results received with our apparatus to that received for a larger testing apparatus. Direct shear tests were conducted {{to investigate the}} shear qualities for soil-geomembrane interface for three liner materials and three soils. The three liner materials used were a textured high density poly ethylene, a smooth poly vinyl chloride, and a reinforced poly propylene. The three soils used were a clean fine sand, a clay and a residual soil. All samples were actual materials used {{for the construction of}} a landfill cap. The tests were conducted for each combination of soils and geomembranes for both dry and wet interfaces. The direct shear apparatus was modified to be an automated process, where the shear force was motor driven, with a variable speed motor drive system, and the shearing force and horizontal displacement was measured using a force transducer and a linear variable displacement transducer respectively. The output from these instruments were logged onto a computer software package using a data acquisition system. Unfortunately a valid comparison of the results I received and those received for a larger shear apparatus could not be compared due to an incomplete set of data for the larger apparatus and the differences in the testing, procedure. The results received for the study indicated that the empirically used slope for landfill caps was not safe for the clay-geomembrane or residual soilgeomembrane interfaces but safe for the sand-geomembrane interface. Other trends that that were noticed were that the internal friction of the soils were always greater than the angles of friction for that soil with any geomembrane, the textured HDPE always had the greatest angle of friction with all soils compared to the smooth PVC and <b>reinforced</b> polypropylene. The <b>angle</b> of friction for the sand-geomembrane and soil-geomembrane decreased as the interface was wetted, and that for the clay-geomembrane increased or stayed the same as the interface was wetted. Considerable cohesion was seen in some tests and was probably due to imperfections in the soil samples. Edge effects were investigated as a probable cause and discarded. Most of the plots had good linear fits, and therefore indicated a fair amount of accuracy in the testing procedure. Altogether the study was a success and provided some useful insights into conducting an independent project...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} a number of {{unanswered}} questions regarding repair and fatigue design of welded joints in bridges, including developing and evaluating repair methods for enhancing the fatigue behaviour of web stiffeners in steel bridge girders, using local stress-based methods for evaluating the effectiveness of various repair methods and predicting the fatigue life of welded joints, and studying the effectiveness of high frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatments under actual in-service loading conditions in the long fatigue life regime. Along with extensive fatigue testing programs and finite element (FE) analyse studies, a strain based fracture mechanics (SBFM) model is used to predict the fatigue behaviour of repaired welds under realistic loading conditions. Through this research, a methodology is developed for generating structural stress design curves for retrofitted highway bridge welds based on small-scale fatigue experiments, relatively simple and inexpensive fatigue tests of smooth specimens, conventional static materials tests, and laboratory measurements. The idea of retrofitting web stiffener ends in steel bridge girders susceptible to distortion-induced fatigue using adhesively-bonded fibre <b>reinforced</b> polymer (FRP) <b>angles</b> is introduced through this research. The proposed retrofit method is relatively cheap {{and easy to use}} and does not require deck removal or any other severe modification to the steel girder. Fatigue tests were conducted on specimens designed to model the conditions in the region between a web stiffener and a flange in a steel girder bridge. Fatigue life increases on the order of several hundred percent were achieved by implementing the proposed retrofit. A coarse FE analysis is used to predict the effectiveness of the proposed retrofit methods in terms of the reduction in the structural stress value. A comprehensive variable amplitude (VA) fatigue testing program and analysis was performed {{to address a}} number of concerns raised regarding the use of impact treatments for the fatigue enhancement of welds in the high cycle (> 10 million cycles) domain. The test results are then used to evaluate a number of available recommendations for the fatigue design of impact treated welds. The nominal, structural, and effective notch stress approaches are considered. An SBFM model was lastly used to predict the effectiveness of an HFMI treatment applied to welded details. The model is evaluated using the experimental results and found to be capable of predicting the fatigue lives for both the as-welded and impact treated specimens for all of the studied loading conditions. The idea of using the analytical structural stress S-N curves to predict the fatigue behaviour of welded joints with a similar load carrying condition welds was then explored...|$|R

A formaÃÃo de complexos polieletrolÃticos (PECs) alia a biocompatibilidade {{superior}} da quitosana com a densidade de carga da carragenana, gerada pela presenÃa dos grupos sulfato. Esse trabalho teve por objetivo estudar os efeitos da calcificaÃÃo e da trombogenicidade de filmes de quitosana e carragenana caracterizando-os atravÃs de tÃcnicas de microscopia e espectroscopia, assim como realizar estudo de revestimento de superfÃcie metÃlica utilizando estes polÃmeros. Observou-se uma diminuiÃÃo nos efeitos de calcificaÃÃo para as blendas de quitosana e carragenana e nos filmes sulfonatados (Ca/P 0, 11 ou ausÃncia de fÃsforo), reduzindo a formaÃÃo e deposiÃÃo de sais de cÃlcio quando comparados com a quitosana natural (Ca/P 2, 78). Ensaios de adesÃo plaquetÃria mostraram melhoria das superfÃcies de quitosana quando modificadas pela sulfonataÃÃo, ou quando misturadas com carragenana, apresentando adesÃo, em mÃdia, de 1 a 2 plaquetas/ 0, 01 mmÂ, contra a formaÃÃo de trombos em filme de quitosana. No ensaio de revestimento, a modificaÃÃo da superfÃcie metÃlica foi evidenciada pela alteraÃÃo da quantidade percentual de carbono e oxigÃnio na composiÃÃo quÃmica da superfÃcie quando comparado o aÃo eletropolido bruto e apÃs a inserÃÃo da quitosana. As sucessivas mudanÃas sofridas pelo Ãngulo de contato reforÃam o sucesso do grafting dos polÃmeros, atravÃs da formaÃÃo de uma camada hidrofÃlica tanto para quitosana natural quanto para a sulfonatada. Pelos resultados obtidos, pode-se inferir que a quitosana sulfonatada e as blendas de quitosana/carragenana mostram-se promissoras para serem utilizadas como biomateriais em contato com sangue. Various {{strategies have}} been proposed to reduce the plasma proteins adsorption and consequently the probability of thrombus formation on materials when contacted with blood. Furthermore, another problem associated with biomaterials is the calcification process, which is described as calcium phosphate formation, which is {{the primary cause of}} failures in soft tissues and implants. Chitosan and carrageenan are two polymers that show properties that make them promising for use as biomaterials. Chitosan, due to amino groups in its structure, may promote platelet adhesion, being necessary to perform a chemical modification on it, such as sulfonation reactions, in order to reduce plasma protein adsorption. The presence of sulfate groups in carrageenan structure may contribute to obtain surfaces with antithrombogenic properties without the need of chemical modification on its structure. The formation of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) combines the high biocompatibility of chitosan with the charge density of carrageenan, generated by the presence of sulfate groups. This work aimed to study the effects of calcification and thrombogenicity of chitosan and carrageenan films, characterizing them by microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. We also conducted the study of metal surfaces coating using these polymers. A reduction in the effects of calcification for chitosan and carrageenan blends and for sulfonated chitosan films (Ca/P 0. 11 or phosphate absence) was observed, reducing the formation and deposition of calcium salts when compared with pristine chitosan (Ca/P 2. 78). Assays of platelet adhesion for chitosan surfaces when modified by sulfonation reaction or when blended with carrageenan, showed adhesion on average of 1 to 2 platelets/ 0. 01 mm 2 against thrombus formation on chitosan film. For the coating essays, the modification on metal surface was characterized by the changing of carbon and oxygen percentage amount on the chemical composition surface, comparing the raw electropolished steel and grafted chitosan. The successive changes observed in the contact <b>angle</b> <b>reinforce</b> the success of the grafting of polymers, forming a hydrophilic layer both for pristine and sulfonated chitosan. From the results obtained, it can be inferred that the sulfonated chitosan and chitosan/carrageenan blends are promising for use as biomaterials in blood contact...|$|R
