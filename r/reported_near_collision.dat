40|$|Due to the {{frequency}} of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> with other road users, many Australian’s perceive that cycling on the public road network is unsafe; {{this is a significant}} barrier to the uptake of cycling for transport (Fishman, Washington, & Haworth, 2012). <b>Near</b> <b>collisions</b> need to be better understood to identify appropriate countermeasures, improve cycling safety, and encourage cycling participation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sequence of behaviours and factors involved in cyclists’ <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> with other road users. Twenty cyclists rode a pre-defined urban route whilst providing concurrent think aloud verbal protocols and being filmed by a researcher travelling behind. Three researchers identified <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> from the video footage, with a <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> defined as any conflict between moving road users or situation of very close proximity (Johnson et al., 2010). The data were then analysed to identify: 1) the type of conflict; and 2) the sequence of behaviours and contributory factors involved using a sequential model of crashes/near crashes (Guo et al., 2010) and an adapted version of Stanton and Salmon’s (2009) taxonomy of driver error causal factors. The majority of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> occurred as cyclists approached or negotiated an intersection, as car drivers attempted to overtake the cyclist, and car drivers had to swerve or break to avoid a <b>collision.</b> All <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> involved contributing factors relating to road layout; the majority also involved factors related to driver behaviour and the road rules. The implications for designing countermeasures to improve cycling safety are discussed...|$|R

40|$|On the road, <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> events (also {{close calls}} or {{near-miss}} incidents) largely outnumber actual crashes, yet {{most of them}} can never be recorded by current traffic data collection technologies or crashes analysis tools. The analysis of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> data {{is an important step}} in the process of reducing the crash rate. There have been several studies that have investigated near collisions; to our knowledge, this is the first study that uses the functionalities provided by cooperative vehicles to collect near misses information. We use the VISSIM traffic simulator and a custom C++ engine to simulate cooperative vehicles and their ability to detect <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> events. Our results showed that, within a simple simulated environment, adequate information on <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> events can be collected using the functionalities of cooperative perception systems. The relationship between the ratio of detected events and the ratio of equipped vehicle was shown to closely follow a squared law, and the largest source of nondetection was packet loss instead of packet delays and GPS imprecision...|$|R

For SIMD- 256, We give a free-start <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> attack on the compression function reduced to 20 steps with complexity 2 − 107. And for SIMD- 512, we give a free-start <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> attack on the 24 -step compression function with complexity 2 208.

40|$|Abstract. In August 2012, the Stribog hash {{function}} {{was selected as}} the new Russian hash standard (GOST R 34. 11 - 2012). Stribog is an AES-based primitive and is considered as an asymmetric reply to the new SHA- 3. In this paper we investigate the collision resistance of the Stribog compression function and its internal cipher. Specifically, we present amessage differential path for the internal block cipher that allows us toefficiently obtain a 5 -round free-start collision and a 7. 75 free-start <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> for the internal cipher with complexities 2 8 and 2 40, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The hash {{function}} Skein is the submission of Ferguson et al. to the NIST Hash Competition, and is arguably a serious candidate for selection as SHA- 3. This paper presents the first third-party analysis of Skein, with an extensive study {{of its main}} component: the block cipher Threefish. We notably investigate <b>near</b> <b>collisions,</b> distinguishers, impossible differentials, key recovery using related-key differential and boomerang attacks. In particular, we present <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> on up to 17 rounds, an impossible differential on 21 rounds, a related-key boomerang distinguisher on 34 rounds, a known-related-key boomerang distinguisher on 35 rounds, and key recovery attacks on up to 32 rounds, out of 72 in total for Threefish- 512. None of our attacks directly extends to the full Skein hash. However, the pseudorandomness of Threefish is required to validate the security proofs on Skein, and our results conclude that at least 36 rounds of Threefish seem required for optimal security guarantees. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Side channel {{collision}} {{attacks are}} a powerful method to exploit side channel leakage. Otherwise {{than a few}} exceptions, collision attacks usually combine leakage from distinct points in time, making them inherently bivariate. This work introduces the notion of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> to exploit the fact that values depending on the same sub-key can have similar while not identical leakage. We show how such knowledge can be exploited to mount a key recovery attack. The presented approach has several desirable features {{when compared to other}} state-of-the-art <b>collision</b> attacks: <b>Near</b> <b>collision</b> attacks are truly univariate. They have low requirements on the leakage functions, since they work well for leakages that are linear in the bits of the targeted intermediate state. They are applicable in the presence of masking countermeasures if there exist distinguishable leakages, {{as in the case of}} leakage squeezing. Results are backed up by a broad range of simulations for unprotected and masked implementations, as well as an analysis of the measurement set provided by DPA Contest v 4...|$|R
