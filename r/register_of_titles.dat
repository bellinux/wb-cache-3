40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} conveyancing risks which cannot be cured {{under the present}} legal regime for land registration in Nigeria. Two fundamental issues motivated this study. The first is that, in Nigeria, registration <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to land is mandatory and meant to assure certainty <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>title</b> amongst other reasons. However, it is settled law that registration <b>of</b> <b>title</b> per se cannot cure any defect in the title or confer validity which it does not possess. This phenomenon not only exposed registered title holders to hidden conveyancing risks, but also threatened the effectiveness and public trust in registration <b>of</b> <b>title</b> regime. The second problem {{is the lack of}} appropriate risk control measures that are specifically designed for registered title holders in country. Consequently, this paper evaluates the existing conveyancing risks in the particular context of the extant rules on land registration. Although the paper commends legal efforts aim at strengthening land registration in Nigeria, it demonstrates that there is enormity of conveying perils which largely defeats the benefits <b>of</b> <b>registering</b> <b>title</b> to land. In that regard, the study proposes the establishment <b>of</b> <b>title</b> insurance as new commercial model that will be tailored for conveyancing risks control in the country. It concludes that since insurance regulation is the exclusive preserve of the Federal government, the National Insurance Commission should pioneer the reform suggested in this paper by invoking section 101 of the Insurance Act 2003...|$|R

40|$|Since {{public access}} to the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> land <b>titles</b> was {{introduced}} under the Land Registration Act 1988, title registration has undertaken a transformation.
