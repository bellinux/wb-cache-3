40|$|Rice {{crop height}} is an {{important}} agronomic trait linked to plant type and yield potential. This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect rice crop height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server. The camera acquires rice paddy images daily at a consistent time of day. The images include the rice plants and a <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> used to provide a height reference. The rice crop height can be indirectly measured from the images by measuring {{the height of the}} <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> compared to the height of the initial <b>marker</b> <b>bar.</b> Four digital image processing steps are employed to automatically measure the rice crop height: band selection, filtering, thresholding, and height measurement. Band selection is used to remove redundant features. Filtering extracts significant features of the <b>marker</b> <b>bar.</b> The thresholding method is applied to separate objects and boundaries of the <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> versus other areas. The <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> is detected and compared with the initial <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> to measure the rice crop height. Our experiment used a field server with a digital camera to continuously monitor a rice field located in Suphanburi Province, Thailand. The experimental results show that the proposed method measures rice crop height effectively, with no human intervention required...|$|R

We hypothesized that greater responses in these areas to sad stimuli, but not happy stimuli, would predict better subsequent clinical outcome. We also explored areas that would predict a poor outcome. Twelve melancholically depressed individuals {{in the early stages}} of antidepressant treatment in a secondary care setting participated in two experiments comparing responses to varying intensities of sad and happy facial stimuli, respectively, using event related functional MRI. They repeated the experiments after a mean delay of 12 weeks of treatment. There was a variation in response to treatment. Greater right visual cortex and right subgenual cingulate (R-BA 25) responses to sad stimuli, but not happy stimuli, {{in the early stages of}} treatment were associated with a good clinical outcome. Greater ventrolateral prefrontal cortex responses to either stimulus type were associated with a relatively poor outcome. The sample size was modest and patients were taking a variety of antidepressants. Right subgenual cingulate and right visual cortical responses to sad stimuli predict good clinical outcome in the context of antidepressant treatment for severe depression in a naturalistic setting.

In {{a series of}} experiments, we investigated the haptic perception of spatial relations in a systematic way. We restricted ourselves to a horizontal plane at waist height. Blindfolded {{subjects were asked to}} perform three tasks with their right hand: (i) a reference bar was presented under four different orientations and subjects were asked to rotate a test bar such that it felt to be parallel to the reference bar; (ii) subjects had to rotate two test bars {{in such a way that}} they felt collinear; (iii) subjects had to point a test bar in the direction of a <b>marker.</b> <b>Bars</b> and <b>marker</b> could appear at nine different locations. In all experiments large systematic deviations (up to 408) were made. The deviations strongly correlated with horizontal (right ^ left) but not with vertical (forward ^ backward) distance. Subjects showed qualitatively identical trends but the size of the deviations was strongly subject-dependent. In addition, a significant haptic oblique effect was found.

40|$|Background By {{measuring}} alcohol retailersâ�� {{propensity to}} illegally sell alcohol {{to young people}} who appear highly intoxicated, we examine whether UK legislation is effective at preventing health harms resulting from drunk individuals continuing to access alcohol. Methods 73 randomly selected pubs, bars and nightclubs in a city in North West England were subjected to an alcohol purchase test by pseudo-drunk actors. Observers recorded venue characteristics to identify poorly managed and problematic (PMP) bars. Results 83. 6 % of purchase attempts resulted in a sale of alcohol to a pseudo-intoxicated actor. Alcohol sales increased {{with the number of}} PMP <b>markers</b> <b>bars</b> had, yet even in those with no markers, 66. 7 % of purchase attempts resulted in a sale. Bar servers often recognised signs of drunkenness in actors, but still served them. In 18 % of alcohol sales, servers attempted to up-sell by suggesting actors purchase double rather than single vodkas. Conclusions UK law preventing sales of alcohol to drunks is routinely broken in nightlife environments, yet prosecutions are rare. Nightlife drunkenness places enormous burdens on health and health services. Preventing alcohol sales to drunks should be a public health priority, while policy failures on issues, such as alcohol pricing, are revisited...|$|R
40|$|The genomes {{of modern}} cultivars have been {{painstakingly}} {{selected for the}} presence of favorable alleles at multiple loci, which interact to produce superior phenotypes. Genetic transformation provides a tool to introduce new genes without altering the original gene combinations. However, the random genetic and epigenetic changes sometimes generated by the transformation process have been associated with losses in agronomic performance. The agronomic performance of 50 transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines containing additional copies of native or modified high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes and the selectable <b>marker</b> <b>bar,</b> their untransformed parent 'Bobwhite', four lines containing only bar, and 10 null segregant lines were assessed in small plot trials over 2 yr and three locations. Most of the transgenic lines did not show significant changes in performance relative to Bobwhite, although the transgenic lines as a group tended toward lower performance. Null-segregant and bar-only lines performed similarly to Bobwhite. No relationship could be established between performance and particular transgenes or their expression levels. Despite the overall lower performance of the transgenic lines, many with agronomic performance equivalent to Bobwhite were identified. These findings suggest that extant techniques for genetic engineering of wheat are capable of producing agronomically competitive lines for use as cultivars or parents in breeding programs. © Crop Science Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Silencing {{of genes}} {{inserted}} near telomeres provides {{a model to}} investigate the function of heterochromatin. We initiated a study of telomeric silencing in Neurospora crassa, a fungus that sports DNA methylation, unlike most other organisms in which telomeric silencing has been characterized. Results The selectable marker, hph, was inserted at the subtelomere of Linkage Group VR in an nst- 1 (n eurospora s ir t wo - 1) mutant and was silenced when nst- 1 function was restored. We show that NST- 1 is an H 4 -specific histone deacetylase. A second <b>marker,</b> <b>bar,</b> tested at two other subtelomeres, was similarly sensitive to nst- 1 function. Mutation of three additional SIR 2 homologues, nst- 2, nst- 3 and nst- 5, partially relieved silencing. Two genes showed stronger effects: dim- 5, which encodes a histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase and hpo, which encodes heterochromatin protein- 1. Subtelomeres showed variable, but generally low, levels of DNA methylation. Elimination of DNA methylation caused partial derepression of one telomeric marker. Characterization of histone modifications at subtelomeric regions revealed H 3 trimethyl-K 9, H 3 trimethyl-K 27, and H 4 trimethyl-K 20 enrichment. These modifications were slightly reduced when telomeric silencing was compromised. In contrast, acetylation of histones H 3 and H 4 increased. Conclusion We demonstrate the presence of telomeric silencing in Neurospora and show a dependence on histone deacetylases and methylation of histone H 3 lysine 9. Our studies also reveal silencing functions for DIM- 5 and HP 1 that appear independent of their role in de novo DNA methylation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{or plant}} cells {{can be used}} to produce {{pharmacological}} glycoproteins such as antibodies or vaccines. However these proteins carry N-glycans with planttypical residues [β(1, 2) -xylose and core α(1, 3) -fucose], which can greatly impact the immunogenicity, allergenicity, or activity of the protein. Two enzymes are responsible for the addition of plant-specific glycans: β(1, 2) -xylosyltransferase (XylT) and α(1, 3) - fucosyltransferase (FucT). Our aim consisted of knocking-out two XylT genes and four FucT genes (12 alleles altogether) in Nicotiana tabacum BY- 2 suspension cells using CRISPR/Cas 9. Three XylT and six FucT sgRNAs were designed to target conserved regions. After transformation of N. tabacum BY- 2 cells with genes coding for sgRNAs, Cas 9, and a selectable <b>marker</b> (<b>bar),</b> transgenic lines were obtained and their extracellular as well as intracellular protein complements were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing β(1, 2) -xylose and α(1, 3) -fucose. Three lines showed a strong reduction of β(1, 2) -xylose and α(1, 3) -fucose, while two lines were completely devoid of them, indicating complete gene inactivation. The absence of these carbohydrates was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of the extracellular proteins. PCR amplification and sequencing of the targeted region indicated small INDEL and/or deletions between the target sites. The KO lines did not show any particular morphology and grew as the wild-type. One KO line was transformed with genes encoding a human IgG 2 antibody. The IgG 2 expression level was as high as in a control transformant which had not been glycoengineered. The IgG glycosylation profile determined by mass spectrometry confirmed that no β(1, 2) -xylose or α(1, 3) -fucose were present on the glycosylation moiety and that the dominant glycoform was the GnGn structure. These data represent an important step toward humanizing the glycosylation of pharmacological proteins expressed in N. tabacum BY- 2 cells. © 2017 Mercx, Smargiasso, Chaumont, De Pauw, Boutry and Navarre.

To establish a stable and efficient biolistic-mediated genetic transformation system for bentgrass trait improvement, this research focused on: (1) comparing growth media for embryogenic callus induction and plantlet regeneration; (2) transferring bar, chitinase, glucanase and barnase genes into embryogenic calli of creeping and velvet bentgrasses, and regenerating transgenic plants from the transformed calli; (3) evaluating the transgenic plants by using herbicide glufosinate, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot and northern blot hybridization assays; and (4) analyzing the transgenic bentgrass lines for resistance to dollar spot (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa) and brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani). Embryogenic calli with high regeneration rates were initiated from creeping and velvet bentgrasses on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 500 mg/l casein hydrolysate, 6. 63 mg/l 3, 6 -dichloro-o-anisic acid and 0. 5 – 2. 0 mg/l 6 -benzyladenine. Microprojectile bombardment resulted in stable genetic {{transformation of}} the creeping and velvet bentgrass cultivars with transformation efficiencies up to 0. 78 – 0. 86 transgenic plants per bombardment. Co-transformation efficiency of chitinase/glucanase genes with an unlinked selectable <b>marker</b> <b>bar</b> gene was 62 % in ‘Providence’ creeping bentgrass. Northern blot hybridization indicated that bar and chitinase transgenes in lines containing simple insertions were expressed at the mRNA level. Transgenic plants with simple insertion of the bar were consistently resistant to the herbicide glufosinate under greenhouse and field conditions. However, the bar and chitinase transgenes were silent in transgenic lines with complex insertion patterns. No glucanase gene was expressed at the mRNA level in any transgenic lines containing the glucanase gene. The transgenic lines expressing the chitinase gene at the mRNA level were not resistant to dollar spot and brown patch, indicating that the chitinase gene was silent or the chitinase protein was unable to defend against the pathogens under the experimental conditions used. The glufosinate-resistant transgenic lines expressing the bar gene were resistant to dollar spot and brown patch when 560 mg/l glufosinate was sprayed three hours before or one day after pathogen inoculation, indicating that glufosinate reduced fungal infection on the glufosinate-resistant transgenic grasses. ...|$|R

The simple principle is that DNA-coated microscopic particles (microcarriers) are accelerated at high speed by helium gas within a vacuum and travel at such a velocity as to penetrate target cells. However, the process itself involves a range of parameters which are open to variation: microparticle type and size, gun settings (rupture pressure, target distance, vacuum drawn, etc.), preparation of components (e. g., gold coating), and preparation of plant tissues.

40|$|Background: The {{perturbation}} of {{the steady}} state of {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) due to biotic and abiotic stresses in a plant could lead to protein denaturation through the modification of amino acid residues, including the oxidation of methionine residues. Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to the methionine residue. To assess the role of this enzyme, we generated transgenic rice using a pepper CaMSRB 2 gene {{under the control of}} the rice Rab 21 (responsive to ABA protein 21) promoter with/without a selection <b>marker,</b> the <b>bar</b> gene. Results: A drought resistance test on transgenic plants showed that CaMSRB 2 confers drought tolerance to rice, as evidenced by less oxidative stress symptoms and a strengthened PSII quantum yield under stress conditions, and increased survival rate and chlorophyll index after the re-watering. The results from immunoblotting using a methionine sulfoxide antibody and nano-LC-MS/MS spectrometry suggest that porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which is involved in chlorophyll synthesis, is a putative target of CaMSRB 2. The oxidized methionine content of PBGD expressed in E. coli increased in the presence of H 2 O 2, and the Met- 95 and Met- 227 residues of PBGD were reduced by CaMSRB 2 in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT).

Finch trichomonosis, {{caused by a}} protozoan Trichomonas gallinae emerged in Great Britain in 2005 and led to epidemic mortality and a significant population decline of greenfinches, Carduelis chloris in UK and Northern European countries in subsequent years. We recorded covariation between plumage characteristics and trichomonosis-induced mortality among wild-caught greenfinches brought into captivity in Tartu, Estonia. Occurrence of fault <b>bars</b> (<b>markers</b> of stressful conditions experienced during feather growth) on tail feathers was five times higher among the dead birds than among survivors. Black (eumelanotic) compartments of tail feathers of survivors were on average 22 % darker than feathers of dead birds. Such pattern is best explained by proposed pleiotropic effects of genes involved in eumelanin production on immune function. These findings suggest that melanin-based coloration can evolve via mechanisms that are independent of visual {{information provided by the}} pigment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{provide an}} ovine model of {{ventricular}} remodeling and reverse remodeling by creating {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF) and then treating it by implanting a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Methods. We induced volume-overload heart failure in 2 sheep; 20 weeks later, we implanted an LVAD and assessed recovery 11 weeks thereafter. We examined changes in histologic and hemodynamic data and levels of cellular markers of CHF. Results. After CHF induction, we found increases in LV end-diastolic pressure, LV systolic and diastolic dimensions, wall thickness, left atrial diameter, and atrial natriuretic protein (ANP) and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) levels; β-adrenergic receptor (BAR) and dystrophin expression decreased markedly. Biopsies confirmed LV remodeling. After LVAD support, LV systolic and diastolic dimensions, wall thickness, and mass, and ANP and ET- 1 levels decreased. Histopathologic and hemodynamic <b>markers</b> improved, and <b>BAR</b> and dystrophin expression normalized. Conclusions. We describe a successful sheep model for ventricular and reverse remodeling...|$|R
