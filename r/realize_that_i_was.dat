500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dani first {{appeared}} in the 1999 song [...] "Californication", which includes the lyrics [...] "Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information" [...] although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single [...] "By the Way" [...] as [...] "Dani the girl". Kiedis commented: [...] "When this funky groove came up it struck me as a perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing about the same girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|All at once {{a terrible}} thing {{happened}} ... at least, I thought it a terrible thing then. I knew why I had wanted Sidney to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> no longer a child. It was because I loved him! I knew it the moment I saw that strange, new expression leap into his eyes.|$|E
30|$|Oh how {{extraordinarily}} nice <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> {{she told}} my father, without <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{listening to their}} conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "In other words, I should {{cooperate}} with Colonel Varney and other disinterested philanthropists," [...] he supplied, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> losing my temper.|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Miss Howard seem to {{know what}} you are talking about," [...] I {{observed}} coldly. [...] "Perhaps you don't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> that jayhawker chief. I {{am glad to}} {{know you}} now and take you to my heart and call you friend"--then he added, {{in a voice that}} was pathetic with regret, [...] "but if I had only known you then, what tumultuous {{happiness}} I should have had in your society!--while it lasted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not on the}} sick-list," [...] he said, gruffly. There was {{something}} in the hard, rasping voice which dispelled all softer illusions, and made me <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{face to face with the}} man of the Lena Valley and Bluemansdyke, the bloodiest bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut the throats of its occupants.|$|E
60|$|It was odd {{to wake up}} and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in London. Years {{seemed to}} have passed since I had left it. Time is a thing of emotions, not of hours and minutes, and I had {{certainly}} packed a considerable number of emotional moments into my stay at Sanstead House. I lay in bed, reviewing the past, while Smith, with a cheerful clatter of crockery, prepared my breakfast in the next room.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been several hours before I regained {{consciousness}} and I well remember the feeling of surprise which swept over me as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not dead.|$|R
60|$|I {{remained}} thus in deep thought, sinking {{further and}} further into the tar-bucket. By the time I reached {{the bottom of it}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love with Edith Croyden.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{behind the}} world's best goalkeeper, undeniably, in everyone's mind. You {{know where you}} stand. That part is very clear. — Christopher Duplantyon {{attempting}} to supplant Wilson as starting goalkeeper.|$|R
60|$|Before we {{were half}} a mile from the island I came to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing the part of a fool by {{allowing}} my mind to dwell upon the possibilities of the future, and, forcing thought into a different channel, I began to speak of the village which it was proposed to build {{on the bank of the}} river, little dreaming that it would one day be a great city known as Louisville, as if named for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder do {{you know}} all that you did?" [...] she asked him, musingly. [...] "Shall I tell you, my lord? You cured me of a folly. I had been blind, and you made me see. I had foolishly thought to escape one evil, and you made me <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rushing into a worse. You saved me from myself. You may have made me suffer then; {{but it was a}} healing hurt you dealt me. And should I bear you an ill-will for that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had an odd {{experience}} this morning, when I {{was waiting for}} Mrs. Pomfret outside the state-house," [...] she said. [...] "A man was standing {{looking up at the}} statue of the patriot with a strange, rapt expression on his face,--such a good face,--and he was so big and honest and uncompromising I wanted to talk to him. I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> staring at him so hard, because I was trying to remember where I had seen him before,--and then I remembered suddenly that it was with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as {{you think}} best, Dick," [...] sighed Mr. Rover. [...] "From now on I shall leave these {{business}} matters in your hands. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too feeble to attend to them properly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{the time}} of the Indians?' Then smiling, 'I had forgotten. It <b>is</b> hard to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> where <b>I</b> have so long wished to <b>be.</b> Am <b>I</b> {{actually}} in a room 360 years old?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange. I {{know your}} home town quite well. But I {{have not yet}} made my birthplace famous; in fact, I doubt whether I ever shall. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{beginning}} to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of the failures." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{hurried to}} the town by the Roods. That brae was as deserted as the country roads, except where {{children}} had escaped from their mothers to wade in it. Here and there dams were keeping the water away from one door to send it with greater volume to another, and at points the ground had fallen in. But this I noticed without interest. I did not even <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> holding my head painfully to the side {{where it had been}} blown by the wind and glued by the rain. I have never held my head straight since that journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I {{had been}} a widow twenty-four hours, I began to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an escaped woman. It wasn't the {{particular}} marriage.... It was any marriage.... All we women are tied. Most of us are willing to be tied perhaps, but only as {{people are willing to}} be tied to life-belts in a wreck--from fear from drowning. And now, I am just one of the free women, like the women who can earn large incomes, or the women who happen to own property. I've paid my penalties and my service is over.... I knew, of course, that you would ask me this. It isn't that I don't care for you, that I don't love your company and your help--and the love and the kindness...." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was fast}} getting {{adjusted}} to my situation and circumstances. For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my [...] "dream," [...] and {{listen for the}} Colt's factory whistle; but {{that sort of thing}} played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur's court, not a lunatic asylum. After that, I was just as much at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and as for preference, I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth. Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains, pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country. The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor; not a man who wasn't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities; whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century? I should be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{introduced}} them to Victory, {{and told them}} that she was queen of England. They thought, at first, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> joking. But when I had recounted my adventures and they <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in earnest, they believed me.|$|R
30|$|To {{be quite}} honest, not really… I {{have learned a}} lot of math but <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more applied math, the math {{department}} at [my school] on the whole is not an applied math department. It is much more theory-based.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>realize</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong.|$|R
60|$|All this I say {{came into}} my mind {{as if it were}} a part of that {{recovery}} of my mind from its first passionate abjection. And it seemed a simple and obvious part of the same conversion to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ignorant and narrow, and that, too, in a world which is suffering like a beast in a slime pit by reason of ignorance and narrowness of outlook, and that it was my manifest work and purpose to make myself less ignorant and to see and learn with all my being. It came to me as a clear duty that I should get out of the land of hotels and leisure and go seeking the facts and clues to human inter-relationship nearer the earthy roots of things, and I turned my thoughts to India and China, those vast enigmas of human accumulation, in a spirit extraordinarily like that of some mystic who receives a call. I felt I must go to Asia and from Asia perhaps round the world. But it was the greatness of Asia commanded me. I wanted to see the East not as a spectacle but as the simmering vat in which the greater destiny of man brews and brews....|$|E
60|$|It may {{not seem}} proper {{at such a time}} and place as this that I should {{describe}} that lady. And yet her personality is the very essence of my case. Let me only say that I cannot believe that Nature ever put into female form a more exquisite combination of beauty and intelligence. She was twenty-five years of age, blonde and tall, with a peculiar delicacy of features and of expression. I have read of people falling in love at first sight, and had always looked upon it as an expression of the novelist. And yet from the moment that I saw Ena Garnier life held for me but the one ambition--that she should be mine. I had never dreamed before of the possibilities of passion that were within me. I will not enlarge upon the subject, but to make you understand my action--for I wish you to comprehend it, however much you may condemn it--you must <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in the grip of a}} frantic elementary passion which made, for a time, the world and all that was in it seem a small thing if I could but gain the love of this one girl. And yet, in justice to myself, I will say that there was always one thing which I placed above her. That was my honour as a soldier and a gentleman. You will find it hard to believe this when I tell you what occurred, and yet--though for one moment I forgot myself--my whole legal offence consists in my desperate endeavour to retrieve what I had done.|$|E
5000|$|... "Never in all {{my years}} in this chancy and {{unstable}} profession did I ever <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sleepwalking along a precipice. I ignored the fact that the rate of professional mortality among screen writers is extremely high...It wasn't courage or arrogance or insensitivity; I suspect it was the irascible Horatio Alger in my blood. If I had it to do all over again I would perish of sheer fright." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Until <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{enclosing}} {{these huge}} spectacles inside a little box, [...] "the box" [...] {{as it became}} known in America, seemed more suitable for the transmission of soccer matches. After a few years, I fled {{and moved on to}} other endeavours.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> and am the center, {{the focus}} of {{attention}} by millions and millions of people ... My family and everyone <b>I</b> knew <b>were</b> and are actors in a script, a charade whose entire purpose is to make me {{the focus of}} the world's attention.|$|R
5000|$|The duke responded, [...] "How can I forget? What <b>I</b> regret <b>is</b> not <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the {{presence}} of a dragon." [...] Liu Cong, impressed by the flattery, then asked, [...] "How is it that your clan members slaughtered each other?" [...] The duke replied: ...|$|R
5000|$|Athletically, Christensen’s early desire was to {{continue}} excelling {{in track and}} field as he had when he set the world records as a 9-year-old boy. [...] "Puberty and adolescence helped me <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not as fast as I had thought," [...] he recalled. [...] "My body went a different direction and that was when I started leaning towards football." [...] He graduated from Sheldon High School in Eugene in 1974, and then attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah.|$|E
5000|$|She {{lost her}} job on The Dinah Shore Show when, as she said, [...] "We were {{shooting}} all night, and into the next day, and time just got away from me, and I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to be on}} the set working as Dinah's double on her show, Chevy Theatre. I completely messed up my job, I was what they called a no show." [...] She also appeared on an episode of It's a Great Life as [...] "the blonde in the mink coat." ...|$|E
5000|$|Scriptwriter Marti Noxon {{said that}} prior to working on Buffy, she had written several times about ghosts, which for her are figurative {{expressions}} {{of the need for}} [...] "repentance and second chances", drawing on her own family background. [...] "I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> constantly telling the story of my family and fears," [...] she says. Noxon was influenced in her storytelling by the movies Poltergeist and Truly, Madly, Deeply, which featured a widow who was unable to move on after the loss of her husband.|$|E
5000|$|.....in 1992 {{everything}} changed and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{living in a}} war in which sex was used {{as part of a}} war strategy to humiliate women and thereby cause the destruction of an ethnic group. 20,000 women were systematically raped in Bosnia during the war." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>realize</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite a {{stranger}} to you. Nevertheless, my gratitude is your due and I hope you will accept it as the least tribute I can pay you. Of all that throng of bathers, only you noticed my peril and came to my assistance." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> think <b>that</b> up to <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> {{had never}} {{experienced}} such a thrill as passed through me when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> navigating these historic waters. The lifelong dreams <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never had dared hope to see fulfilled were at last a reality--but under what forlorn circumstances! ...|$|R
