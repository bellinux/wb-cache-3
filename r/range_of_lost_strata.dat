The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>lost</b> circulation problems begins in the shallow, unconsolidated formations and extends into the well-consolidated formations that are fractured by the hydrostatic head imposed by the drilling mud (Moore 1986). Two conditions are both necessary for lost circulation to occur downhole: (1) the pressure in the wellbore must exceed the pore pressure and (2) {{there must be a}} flow pathway for the losses to occur (Osisanya 2002).

40|$|Short {{toroidal}} Alfven eigenmode (TAE) avalanche {{bursts in}} the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) cause {{a drop in}} the neutron rate and sometimes a loss of neutral beam ions at or near the full injection energy over an extended <b>range</b> <b>of</b> pitch angles. The simultaneous loss <b>of</b> wide <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> pitch angle suggests stochastic transport of the beam ions occurs.

The purpose of this randomized, controlled {{study was to determine}} which factors are predictive <b>of</b> postoperative <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion. Fifty-six patients received either a standard or a high-flexion design NexGen Legacy Posterior-Stabilized TKA (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana). The relationship between preoperative flexion, intraoperative flexion, and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion 1 year postoperatively was determined. The influence of soft tissue release and the type of femoral component was also investigated. A significant correlation existed between preoperative flexion, intraoperative flexion, and maximum flexion 1 year postoperatively. Patients who had a preoperative <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion less than the mean <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion for the overall group gained flexion, whereas patients with a preoperative <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion greater than the mean <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion <b>lost</b> flexion. The degree of soft tissue release performed and the type of implant used had no influence on maximum flexion at 1 year. The principal predictive factor <b>of</b> postoperative <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion, regardless of the degree of soft tissue release or implant design, is the preoperative and intraoperative <b>range</b> <b>of</b> flexion.

30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} the composition change of BCR repertoire of two SLE patients after treatment in various angles. In the gene usage, {{we found that}} there were some losses of IGHV usages in P 1 after treatment, including IGHV 3 - 38, IGHV 3 - 25, IGHV 3 - 7, IGHV 3 - 35 and IGHV 3 - 38 - 3. As for P 2, although there were two new gene expressions with low frequency [IGHV 3 - 7 (0.0025  %) and IGHV 3 - 64 D (0.0086  %)] at the first month after treatment, there were still losses of IGHV 3 - 35 and IGHV 3 - 7 gene at the third month after treatment. It was worth noting that the <b>lost</b> two genes <b>of</b> P 2 were also in the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>lost</b> gene <b>of</b> P 1. Although the frequencies <b>of</b> these <b>lost</b> genes are low, some genes with lower frequency can be detected at each time point. Although these two SLE patients had some losses of gene usages, the number of these genes was not over 100. Such an amount of scale was very small for BCR repertoire. When we investigated the change of IGHV–IGHJ gene pairing over time, these two SLE patients had striking similarity, which no evident change was observed in IGHV–IGHJ pairing at each time point. In addition, analyses of the composition of H-CDR 3 showed overall AA compositions of H-CDR 3 at three time points in each SLE patient were very similar, and the results of H-CDR 3 AA usage that had the same length (14 AA) and the same position were similar. These results support one possibility that this treatment will barely affect the composition of SLE patients’ BCR repertoire in a short term.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveCardiometabolic {{risk factors}} such as overweight/obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and {{hypertension}} are prone to cluster {{together in the same}} individual and result in an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine and quantify the impact of cardiometabolic risk factor clusters independent of heart disease on productivity in a nationally representative sample of US adults. MethodsThe current study estimated the impact of cardiometabolic risk factor clusters on missed work days and bed days, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity, and smoking status in a nationally representative, pooled 2000 and 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey sample. Cardiometabolic risk factor clusters included BMI ≥ 25 and two of the following three: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertension. All estimates were expressedin $US 2005. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of varying assumptions on the results. ResultsAfter controlling for differences in sociodemographics, smoking and comorbidity, individuals with cardiometabolic risk factor clusters missed 179 % more work days and spent 147 % more days in bed (in addition to lost work days) than those without. Lost work days and bed days resulted in $ 17. 3 billion annually in lost productivity attributable to cardiometabolic risk factor clusters in the United States. Sensitivity analyses resulted in a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> annual <b>lost</b> productivity costs from $ 3. 2 to $ 23. 1 billion. ConclusionsCommon cardiometabolic risk factor clusters have a significant deleterious impact on the US economy, resulting in $ 17. 3 billion in lost productivity...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between central and local government - and specifically the County Boroughs - in interwar England and Wales {{with respect to the}} provision of municipal health services. It is argued that this relationship was complex, with different local authorities being compliant {{to a greater or lesser}} degree with the aspirations of the Ministry of Health. The latter, it is further suggested, started off its life as a relatively dynamic, well-run and farsighted part of central government, but for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> reasons <b>lost</b> authority and influence as the interwar era progressed. This was not helped by the limited powers the Ministry held. The local authorities, meanwhile, differed widely in their aspirations for municipally-provided health care. Some were reluctant to do much, others had ambitions somewhat in advance of those of the Ministry of Health. What did unite local authorities was their collective desire to preserve the longstanding tradition of a high degree of local independence. As is also shown, specifically local factors and personnel - for example the political dynamics of the council or the standing of the Medical Officer of Health - could significantly shape a County Borough's approach to health care. The article thus contributes to the history of English and Welsh local government and, especially, to the relatively neglected period in the history of the health services which falls between the demise of the Poor Law and the coming of the National Health Service...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Rest is {{commonly}} used as primary treatment, rather than just palliation, for injured limbs. We searched the literature for evidence of benefit or harm from immobilization or mobilization of acute limb injury in adults. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched for and retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mobilization or rest for treatment of acute limb injuries, in Medline (1966 - 2002), EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library, in all languages. REVIEW METHODS: We examined patient-centered outcomes (pain, swelling, and cost), functional outcomes (<b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion, days <b>lost</b> from work) and complications of treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine trials of immobilization for soft tissue injuries and fractures of both upper and lower limbs were identified (3366 patients). All studies reported either no difference between rest and early mobilization protocols, or found in favor of early mobilization. Reported benefits of mobilization included earlier return to work; decreased pain, swelling, and stiffness; and a greater preserved <b>range</b> <b>of</b> joint motion. Early mobilization caused no increased complications, deformity or residual symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We should not assume any benefit for immobilization after acute upper or lower limb injuries in adults. Rest appears to be overused as a treatment. More trials are needed to identify optimal programs for early mobilization...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} for calculation of the years <b>of</b> life <b>lost</b> per excess death due to stochastic health effects is applied to external exposure pathways. The short-term external exposures are due {{to the passage of}} radioactive cloud and due to the skin and clothes contamination. The long-term external exposure is the one from the radioactive material deposited on the ground (groundshine).

50|$|Between {{producers}} and consumers, {{there is the}} possibility of externalities arising.

Under the assumptions of perfect information, both parties being price-takers, costless court systems, profit and utility maximization by {{producers and}} consumers respectively, no income/wealth effects, and no transaction costs, the parties may be able to meet an efficient level of compensation. Although these assumptions are rarely simultaneously met, an arrangement can be made between parties. In the case of water trading, an example occurs when those accessing their water rights infringe on others’ rights of another nature. A Coasean bargaining system would unfold if the damaged parties offered to pay the rights holders to refrain from accessing part of their rights. This payment would fall within the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> the rights-holders <b>lost</b> benefits and the victim’s damages. Another example of the Coase Theorem is when a water rights owner pays a land owner to access a body of water on their property. An appropriate price will fall between the cost of damages incurred by the landowners and the benefit to the individual accessing their rights.|$|R
