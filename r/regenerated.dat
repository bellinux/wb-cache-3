40|$|Erasure {{correcting}} {{codes are}} widely used to ensure data persistence in distributed storage systems. This paper addresses the simultaneous repair of multiple failures in such codes. We go beyond existing work (i. e., <b>regenerating</b> codes by Dimakis et al.) by describing (i) coordinated <b>regenerating</b> codes (also known as cooperative <b>regenerating</b> codes) which support the simultaneous repair of multiple devices, and (ii) adaptive <b>regenerating</b> codes which allow adapting the parameters at each repair. Similarly to <b>regenerating</b> codes by Dimakis et al., these codes achieve the optimal tradeoff between storage and the repair bandwidth. Based on these extended <b>regenerating</b> codes, we study the impact of lazy repairs applied to <b>regenerating</b> codes and conclude that lazy repairs cannot reduce the costs in term of network bandwidth but allow reducing the disk-related costs (disk bandwidth and disk I/O).

40|$|Regeneration, {{the ability}} to re-grow a missing body part after removal, is seen in many phyla across the animal kingdom. However, {{the degree to which}} {{regeneration}} occurs varies. For example, some amphibians can <b>regenerate</b> limbs while some fish can <b>regenerate</b> fins. In addition, the mechanisms differ. In some planarians, stem cells divide and their progeny readily differentiate into needed cell types while Hydra can <b>regenerate</b> without cell division. Essential questions of regeneration studies are what is the origin of the regenerative tissue, and what is the mechanism of regeneration? Though many annelids can <b>regenerate</b> following transverse body amputation, the cellular mechanisms of regeneration in this phylum are poorly studied. The purpose of my project was to describe what happens in <b>regenerating</b> juveniles of the annelid Capitella teleta. Juveniles are more transparent and <b>regenerate</b> faster than adults. This study aims to characterize the cellular events during posterior regeneration in <b>regenerating</b> juveniles.

40|$|<b>Regenerating</b> code is a {{class of}} code very {{suitable}} for distributed storage systems, which can maintain optimal bandwidth and storage space. Two types of important <b>regenerating</b> code have been constructed: the minimum storage regeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code. However, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes, the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose two optimal constructions of <b>regenerating</b> codes through rate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile networks: 2 -layer rate-matched <b>regenerating</b> code and $m$-layer rate-matched <b>regenerating</b> code. For the 2 -layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage efficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that our code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency compared to the universally resilient <b>regenerating</b> code which is a straightforward extension of <b>regenerating</b> code with error detection and correction capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the 2 -layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching the code rate of each layer's <b>regenerating</b> code. We also demonstrate that the optimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same constraint. Compared to the universally resilient <b>regenerating</b> code, our code can achieve much higher error correction efficiency. Comment: 31 pages, 7 figures, journal pape...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Regenerating</b> code is a {{class of}} storage codes that achieve the optimal {{trade-off}} between storage capacity and repair bandwidth, which are two important performance metrics in data storage systems. However, existing constructions of <b>regenerating</b> codes rely on expensive computational operations such as finite field multiplication. The high coding and repair complexity limit their applications in large-scale practical storage systems. In this paper, we show {{that it is possible}} to achieve the full potential of <b>regenerating</b> codes with low computational complexity. In particular, we propose a new class of <b>regenerating</b> codes, called BASIC codes, that can achieve two specific points (i. e., minimum-bandwidth and minimum-storage <b>regenerating</b> points) on the storage and repair bandwidth trade-off curve, using only binary addition and shift operations in the coding and repair processes. Although in this paper we focus on constructing and analyzing BASIC codes for two specific exact-repair settings, our framework can be generalized to develop BASIC codes for more general exact- and functional-repair <b>regenerating</b> codes.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} metabolisms of [14 C] 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) {{anthracene}} (DMBA) by post-mitochondrial supernates and microsomes from intact and <b>regenerating</b> rat livers were compared. Both cell fractions from <b>regenerating</b> livers at 48, 72, and 96 h after partial hepatectomy metabolized less [14 C]DMBA than similar fractions from intact livers. Prior in vivo treatment with DMBA enhanced metabolism by the cell fractions from both groups, but specific activities of cell fractions from <b>regenerating</b> livers were always about 60 % {{or less of}} those from intact livers. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of metabolites formed in incubations using either cell fraction failed to reveal distinct differences between ether-soluble or water-soluble products of similar fractions from intact and <b>regenerating</b> livers.

5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is <b>regenerated</b> from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash.

With the advent of digital radiography, it has been postulated {{that it is possible to}} quantify the mechanical properties of the <b>regenerate.</b> Kolbeck et al.

In their cohort of patients, the average healing index was 59  days/cm, more than 10  days/cm longer than previously published clinical research using DXA to evaluate <b>regenerate</b> [8]. The higher healing index is clinically significant as delayed external fixator removal can lead to osteoporosis and fractures unrelated to the <b>regenerate,</b> increased opportunity for pin site infection and an adverse psychological and socio-economic impact to the patient.|$|R
