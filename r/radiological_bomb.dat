25|$|Another American {{that was}} not of recent {{immigrant}} background, José Padilla, of Puerto Rican descent and the first Hispanic-American to be imprisoned and convicted on suspicion of plotting a <b>radiological</b> <b>bomb</b> ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing {{that he was not}} entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison. He had converted to Islam while serving his last jail sentence in prison, and went to Pakistan where he was recruited into Al-Qaeda.|$|E
2500|$|Padilla {{was arrested}} in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on {{suspicion}} of plotting a <b>radiological</b> <b>bomb</b> ("dirty bomb") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing {{that he was not}} entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison in South Carolina. Padilla was held {{for three and a half}} years as an enemy combatant. Upon pressure and lawsuits from civil liberties groups, he was transferred to a civilian jail in 2006. In August 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit murder and fund terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a [...] "dirty bomb" [...] in the United States, but he was never charged with this crime. He was initially sentenced to 17 years in prison, which was increased on appeal to 21 years. His lawsuits against the military for allegedly torturing him were rejected by the courts for lack of merit, and jurisdictional issues.|$|E
50|$|After Kreider's arrest, the {{terrorist}} front New Dawn is revealed by Nikogos Fazekas, who {{is intent on}} getting Kreider released from a NATO prison. New Dawn and the remnants of APF forces lead {{an attack on a}} Mediterranean oilrig but are stopped by the Delta team. A New Dawn launches several attacks on the West, from taking hostages in Mayan ruins to hiding weapons and drugs in Lebanon and Indonesia. A spetsnaz officer taken hostage in Lebanon is rescued in a heavily defended compound by the Delta Team. The squad then destroys drug shipments in Indonesia. A New Dawn training facility is neutralized during an ambush in the Banda Sea. Later, the head of the World Bank is rescued in a Japanese saiguden. Finally the team comes together to rescue the American ambassador to Mexico in the Palenque Ruins and stops the delivery of a <b>radiological</b> <b>bomb</b> from the Yucatan to Los Angeles. However, another <b>radiological</b> <b>bomb</b> escaped to an abandoned detention center near Ciudad Juarez, but was seized in time by Delta Force members Snakebite and Pitbull.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{proposed}} legislation {{was against the}} Patriot Act, however. In July 2004, Senator Jon Kyl introduced the Tools to Fight Terrorism Act into the Senate. In a statement given on September 13 to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senator Kyl stated his concern that [...] "Congress has enacted no major antiterror legislation since {{the passage of the}} USA Patriot Act almost three years ago." [...] The bill would have allowed FBI agents to seek warrants for surveillance of [...] "lone wolf terrorists," [...] allowed greater sharing of intelligence between federal authorities and state and local authorities, punish those making terrorism hoaxes, and impose 30-year mandatory-minimum penalties for possession of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, atomic and <b>radiological</b> <b>bombs,</b> and variola virus. However, perhaps due to the increasingly controversial nature of the Act, the Senate did not further consider the {{proposed legislation}}.|$|R
50|$|This speech came {{three days}} after Dhiren Barot was sentenced to 40 years {{for his part in}} the 2004 Financial {{buildings}} plot in which he had a plan to build a <b>radiological</b> dirty <b>bomb</b> that involved setting fire to 10,000 smoke alarms. In September 2011 Eliza Manningham-Buller delivered one of the BBC Radio Reith Lectures and answered questions from an audience that included historian Peter Hennessy and novelist Ian McEwan.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{possible}} threat of illicit trafficking of radioactive or nuclear material it is of great importance to stop the transport of such material across international borders in order to prevent terrorist groups from facilitating nuclear explosive devices or <b>radiological</b> <b>bombs</b> containing this kind of material. The TACIS (Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States) program of the European Commission comprises several projects concerning the enhancement of borders of former Soviet Union states to the European Union (EU) with respect to nuclear security. One of these projects refers to a common project of the European Commission and the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine concerning Ukrainian border stations. The Fraunhofer INT attends to this project as consortium leader. Other projects in that respect refer e. g. to Republic of Belarus and Republic of Armenia. Several Ukrainian border stations to EU states were examined concerning the necessities and options for installing radiation detection equipment for the purpose of monitoring of vehicles and pedestrians crossing the Ukrainian border. For that reason Fraunhofer INT scientists visited some of the Ukrainian border stations. To assure an appropriate selection of equipment several aspects were taken into consideration, e. g. general layout of the station, traffic flow, and detection systems which had already been installed at or near the station. Based on these considerations both the technological needs for the detection of radioactive and nuclear material including a priority list and the associated technical specifications were provided to the contracting entity by the Fraunhofer INT. The next step, which is currently under way, is an invitation to tender addressed to manufacturers of relevant equipment concerning appropriate measuring systems with requirements specifications based upon the Fraunhofer INT's expertise. After the acquisition and installation of the measuring devices at the border stations in question, demonstration exercises of the new detection systems will follow, also with participation of the Fraunhofer INT. Furthermore Fraunhofer INT will be involved in supporting the training of the Ukrainian experts. This project serves as a further step towards a higher degree of security in the nuclear sector at EU borders. The course and the preliminary results of the project will be presented...|$|R

50|$|The {{range was}} {{intended}} as a temporary facility, according to the plans laid out by Robert Moses and Mayors Robert F. Wagner, Jr., John Lindsay, and Abraham D. Beame. However, Mayor Ed Koch favored it becoming permanent. The range was previously part of Pelham Bay Park. In the late 1980s, Governor Mario Cuomo signed an eminent domain law separating this land from the park and giving the NYPD the right to stay permanently. The range was to have been converted into the Olympic Firing Range for the unsuccessful New York City 2012 Olympic bid. The range has Biohazard Safety Level 4 lab facilities to deal with <b>radiological</b> devices, bioweapon <b>bombs</b> and gas chemical weapons.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be very}} {{interesting}} to use the bombsight to drop newly added ordnance onto a target like the Little Boy, Fat Man, German <b>radiological</b> dirty <b>bombs</b> or the Tallboy bomb. However some of these aircraft are hypothetical especially the German designs some of which never saw aerial combat during World War II. So is the German ordnance hypothetical as well. Another feature in this add on is that you can fly bombers in a formation, with FLAK effects when under enemy anti aircraft fire. Twenty-five missions of the Memphis Belle B-17 Flying Fortress are included in this add on. One thing that's lacking though is a sophisticated simulation of the Norden Bombsight which B-17 Flying Fortress the Mighty 8th has a decent representation of albeit not fully emulating the Norden computer, it's gyrostabilizer and ancillary equipment. Instead the Bombsight in Firepower is fixed but it is functional. Even so, this is workable in the simulation add on with a fixed sight but {{it takes a lot of}} practice. Firepower is one of the most popular add ons to Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3.|$|R
50|$|In {{much the}} same fashion as the area denial effect {{resulting}} from fission product (the substances that make up most fallout) contamination in an area following a conventional surface burst nuclear explosion, as considered in the Korean War by Douglas MacArthur, it would thus {{be a form of}} radiological warfare—with the difference that neutron bombs produce half, or less, of the quantity of fission products relative to the same-yield pure fission <b>bomb.</b> <b>Radiological</b> warfare with neutron bombs that rely on fission primaries would thus still produce fission fallout, albeit a comparatively cleaner and shorter lasting version of it in the area if air bursts were used, as little to no fission products would be deposited on the direct immediate area, instead becoming diluted global fallout.|$|R
40|$|Terrorism using <b>radiological</b> dirty <b>bombs</b> or improvised nuclear devices is {{recognized}} as {{a major threat to}} both public health and national security. In the event of a radiological or nuclear disaster, rapid and accurate biodosimetry of thousands of potentially affected individuals will be essential for effective medical management to occur. Currently, health care providers lack an accurate, high-throughput biodosimetric assay which is suitable for the triage of large numbers of radiation injury victims. Here, we describe the development of a biodosimetric assay based on the analysis of irradiated mice, ex vivo-irradiated human peripheral blood (PB) and humans treated with total body irradiation (TBI). Interestingly, a gene expression profile developed via analysis of murine PB radiation response alone was inaccurate in predicting human radiation injury. In contrast, generation of a gene expression profile which incorporated data from ex vivo irradiated human PB and human TBI patients yielded an 18 -gene radiation classifier which was highly accurate at predicting human radiation status and discriminating medically relevant radiation dose levels in human samples. Although the patient population was relatively small, the accuracy of this classifier in discriminating radiation dose levels in human TBI patients was not substantially confounded by gender, diagnosis or prior exposure to chemotherapy. We have further incorporated gene...|$|R
40|$|When a <b>radiological</b> weapon (dirty <b>bomb)</b> is detonated, {{radioactive}} debris can {{be spread}} over a wide area impacting on {{a large number of}} citizens. In addition to people {{at the site of the}} incident, downwind members of the public, first responders, physicians, nurses, on-site public officials, police officers, firemen, and press members could also receive significant radiation exposures. The risk of harm to irradiated individuals depends on the types of radiation involved, dose rate, the medical support received, and whether combined injuries (e. g., burns and wounds in addition to radiation damage) occur. Effective management of dirty bomb incidents requires a reliable computer code system for predicting the expected health effects to each of the indicated groups of humans. Such a code system requires at least three related components: a radioactivity/radiation transport component, a radiation-dose-estimation component, and a health-risk-characterization component. The focus of this paper is on the health-risk-characterization component and on deterministic (nonstochastic) effects of high-level radiation exposures. A hazard function model is presented that can be used along with radioactivity/radiation transport and dosimetry models to calculate the expected deterministic effects (morbidity and lethality cases) associated with dirty bomb incidents. Information is also provided to facilitate characterizing uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The all-hazards {{willingness}} to respond (WTR) of local public health personnel {{is critical to}} emergency preparedness. This study applied a threat-and efficacy-centered framework to characterize these workers' scenario and jurisdictional response willingness patterns toward a range of naturally-occurring and terrorism-related emergency scenarios. Methods Eight geographically diverse local health department (LHD) clusters (four urban and four rural) across the U. S. were recruited and administered an online survey about response willingness and related attitudes/beliefs toward four different public health emergency scenarios between April 2009 and June 2010 (66 % response rate). Responses were dichotomized and analyzed using generalized linear multilevel mixed model analyses that also account for within-cluster and within-LHD correlations. Results Comparisons of rural to urban LHD workers showed statistically significant odds ratios (ORs) for WTR context across scenarios ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 4. When employees over 40 years old were compared to their younger counterparts, the ORs of WTR ranged from 1. 27 to 1. 58, and when females were compared to males, the ORs of WTR ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 61. Across the eight clusters, the percentage of workers indicating they would be unwilling to respond regardless of severity ranged from 14 - 28 % for a weather event; 9 - 27 % for pandemic influenza; 30 - 56 % for a <b>radiological</b> 'dirty' <b>bomb</b> event; and 22 - 48 % for an inhalational anthrax bioterrorism event. Efficacy was consistently identified as an important independent predictor of WTR. Conclusions Response willingness deficits in the local public health workforce {{pose a threat to}} all-hazards response capacity and health security. Local public health agencies and their stakeholders may incorporate key findings, including identified scenario-based willingness gaps and the importance of efficacy, as targets of preparedness curriculum development efforts and policies for enhancing response willingness. Reasons for an increased willingness in rural cohorts compared to urban cohorts should be further investigated in order to understand and develop methods for improving their overall response. </p...|$|R

40|$|Right At Your Door (2006), {{the debut}} feature of writer/director Chris Gorak, plays on current fears about {{terrorist}} attacks on American cities that involve nuclear weapons or <b>radiological</b> materials. Dirty <b>bombs</b> are detonated in several locations around L. A., disrupting the mundane morning routines of an ordinary American couple on a typical workday. After a futile effort to drive into the city to rescue his wife, a man returns to his home and follows official instructions to seal his house from the toxic ash falling like snow on his pleasant, prosperous neighborhood. He ultimately has {{to decide whether to}} allow his contaminated wife into the house. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and was picked up for release by Lionsgate, but not widely distributed. The critical response to the film, while mostly positive, is illuminating: Right At Your Door is too 2 ̆ 2 realistic 2 ̆ 2 to be entertaining. This representation of terrorism involving dirty bombs, which experts consider the mostly likely scenario for nuclear terrorism, is particularly terrifying because it occurs in the domestic sphere, The attack is not experienced from within the high tech headquarters of counter-terrorism experts, but through the confusing fog of misinformation and haphazard Homeland Security efforts that would be the experience of average citizens if such an attack actually occurs. This paper will examine the way Right At Your Door mobilizes the conventions of the docudrama to enact its discourse on the uneasy intersection between homeland security, personal morality and civic responsibility...|$|R
