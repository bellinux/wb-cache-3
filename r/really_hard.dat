5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, <b>really</b> <b>hard.</b> I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|Fear of suffocation—something that I have or fear {{is never}} {{being able to}} enjoy myself,... 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> {{to go out and}} have a good time.... I don't go to nightclubs,... You don't see {{pictures}} of me falling out of a club drunk. I don't go—and that's because I usually go and then, you know, a whiskey and a half into it, I {{got to get back to}} work.|$|E

25|$|The {{indigenous}} training -to {{enable them}} to perform the most delicate tasks (indeed {{in order to do}} the concrete mixes and the containment of carpentry works, you have to bend and tie the reinforcing steel, making it properly or lose it)- was <b>really</b> <b>hard,</b> because the Somalian men (mostly Bantu Somali) were used to do only subsistence farming.|$|E
25|$|All I ask {{of you is}} one thing... I {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism.

But if you work <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're <b>really</b> as <b>hard</b> up as you pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|R

60|$|Five roubles {{was a large}} sum to the soldier. The life of {{the guards}} was <b>really</b> <b>harder</b> {{than that of the}} prisoners, except that they did no work, for they had to mount guard at night when the convicts slept, and their rations were much more scanty than those given to the working convicts, and they were {{accustomed}} to eke out their scanty pay by taking small bribes for winking at various infractions of the prison rules. The Cossack at once held out his hand. Godfrey slipped five rouble notes into it. They kept on till they reached a wood, where beneath the shadow of the trees it was already perfectly dark.|$|R
25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar <b>really</b> <b>hard,</b> Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

500|$|Perfume {{had found}} {{recording}} English lyrics hard; member Kashiyuka explained, [...] "'Spending all my time' is completely in English, so I struggled <b>really</b> <b>hard</b> with the pronunciation.
