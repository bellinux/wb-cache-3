More specifically, multilevel models are estimated: First to measure variability of antibiotics prescription by French general practitioners for acute <b>rhinopharyngitis,</b> a clinical decision making context with weak uncertainty, and to tests its significance; Second to prioritize its determinants, especially those relating to GP or its practice setting environment, by controlling visit or patient confounders. The study was based on the 2001 activity data, added by an ad hoc questionnaire, of a sample of 778 GPs arising from a panel of 1006 computerized French GPs. We observe that a great part of the total variation was due to intra-physician variability (70 %). Hence, in the French general practice context, we find empirical support for the rejection of the ‘practice style’, the ’enthusiasm’ or the ‘surgical signature’ hypothesis. Thus, it is patients' characteristics that largely explain the prescription, even if physicians' characteristics (area of practice, level of activity, network participation, participation in ongoing medical training) and environmental factors (recent visit from pharmaceutical sales representatives) also exert considerable influence. The latter suggest that MPV are partly caused by differences in the type of dissemination or diffusion of information.

Then she developed a polyarthritis of the small joints of the hands (II, III and IV right DIP, I, III, e V left DIP; III and V bilateral PIP), knees, tarsi, toes and left elbow. An HCV chronic hepatitis was discovered 6 years before. She is affected by productive cough, dysphonia, dyspnea at rest, feveret, cephalea and asthenia for over 5 years. Laboratory examination revealed leukopenia, HCV hepatitis with anti HCV, HCV-RNA, transaminases elevated and cryoglobulinemia. HCV may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of rheumatic diseases, lung fibrosis and may moreover contribuite to the onset or progression of sarcoidosis; the possible pathogenesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCommon Infectious Diseases (CIDs) of the airways and the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract {{are still}} a considerable cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in elderly. The present study examined the beneficial effect of a dairy product containing the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei DN- 114 29 001 (fermented product) on the resistance of free-living elderly to CIDs. The study was multicentric, double-blind and controlled, involving 1072 volunteers (median age= 76. 0 years) randomised for consumption of either 200 g/day of fermented (N= 537) or control (non fermented) dairy product (N= 535) for 3 -months, followed by an additional 1 -month's follow up. The results showed that, when considering all CIDs, the fermented product significantly reduced the average duration per episode of CID (6. 5 vs. 8 days in control group; P= 0. 008) and the cumulative duration of CIDs (7 vs. 8 days in control group; P= 0. 009). Reduction of both episode and cumulative durations was also significant for all upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (P< 0. 001) and for <b>rhinopharyngitis</b> (P< 0. 001). This was accompanied with an increase of Lactobacillus casei species in stools throughout the fermented product consumption (2 to 3. 8 x 107 eq. CFU/g of stools, P< 0. 001). The cumulative number of CIDs (primary outcome) was not different between groups nor was the CID severity, fever, pathogens occurrence, medication, immune blood parameters and quality of life. The fermented product was safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, consumption of a fermented dairy product containing the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei DN- 114 001 in elderly was associated with a decreased duration of CIDs in comparison with the control group, especially for URTIs such as rhinopharyngiti...|$|E

Purpose: To describe French GPs’ daily practice in the management of respiratory infections and the prevention of their recurrence in children. Methods: A sample group of French GPs answered a structured questionnaire on risk factors, RRTI management, antibiotic use and prevention measures. Results: A total of 358 GPs participated in the survey. <b>Rhinopharyngitis,</b> the most frequent respiratory infection, was considered to be recurrent if six or more episodes occurred in a year. Four risk factors were acknowledged as substantial: living in communities, passive smoking, pollution and allergies. Around 63 % of GPs said that RRTIs are too often treated with antibiotics. More than 85 % thought that prevention of RRTIs is possible. Smoking cessation, vaccination, allergen avoidance and hygiene were identified as the main preventive measures. A large majority of GPs (84 %) prescribed products for prevention and ~ 90 % would prescribe a product stimulating immunity if the efficacy and tolerability of these agents was proven and confirmed in their daily practice. Conclusions: French GPs are well aware of the health and socioeconomic burdens resulting from RRTIs, as well as the risk of antibiotic overuse. They have a prevention-oriented approach, implement preventive measures when possible and prescribe products for prevention.

40|$|The use of {{homeopathy}} {{is increasing}} world-wide {{and the number}} of physicians with the additional qualification homeopathy has doubled since 1993 (5900 physicians). But {{there is a lack of}} large systematic data on the characteristics of patients who seek homeopathic care, the spectrum of diagnoses and the position of the physicians practising homeopathy in public health. In a prospective cohort study from september of 1997 to June 1999, 3981 patients (2851 adults and 1130 children) treated by 103 physicians (100 physicians from Germany, 3 from Switzerland) practising homeopathy were consecutively included at their initial office visit and subsequently monitored using standardized questionnaires. The physicians documented the diagnoses in textform and were coded in ICD- 9 and ICD- 10 by specialist of the institute. The most frequent diagnoses were allergic rhinitis in men (10, 3 %), migraine in women (9, 7 %) and atopic dermatitis in children of both gender (21, 2 % in girls and 18, 7 % in boys). 36, 4 % of the disorders were coded as symptoms (e. g. headache, sleep disturbances). This spectrum of diagnoses is markedly different from those of patients seeking primarily conventional care. In comparison an analysis of 70. 000 patients under conventional treatment showed that hypertension (21, 9 %) in adults and acute <b>rhinopharyngitis</b> (4, 2 %) in children were the most frequent diagnoses. Additionally patients seeking homeopathic differed in socio-demographic factors from those seeking conventional care. Homeopathic treated patients were on average younger, had a higher education and lived more often in partnerships. 97 % of the patients had chronic disorders with an average duration of 10. 3 ± 9. 8 years in adults and 4. 3 ± 3. 7 years in children. Homeopathic care, therefore, appears to be a treatment which is mainly used by patients with chronic disorders...|$|E

Bei den 0 - bis 2 -Jährigen war die Prävalenz am höchsten (74, 9 %). Mädchen wiesen mit 53, 1 % eine signifikant höhere Prävalenzrate auf als Jungen (48, 7 %). Kinder aus Familien mit niedrigem Sozialstatus und Kinder mit Migrationshintergrund gaben seltener eine Arzneimittelanwendung an als Kinder aus Familien mit höherem Sozialstatus und ohne Migrationshintergrund. Am häufigsten wendeten die Jungen und Mädchen Präparate zur Behandlung von Erkrankungen des Respirationstraktes (ATC-Code R 00 : 16, 8 %) an. Es folgten Alimentäres System und Stoffwechsel (ATC-Code A 00 : 16, 0 %) und Dermatika (ATC-Code D 00 : 9, 7 %). Zu den häufigsten Indikationen gehörten mit 12, 4 % aller Arzneimittelnennungen sonstige näher bezeichnete prophylaktische Maßnahmen (ICD-Code Z 29. 8), mit 11 % Akute <b>Rhinopharyngitis</b> (ICD-Code J 00) und mit 10, 9 % Husten (ICD-Code R 05). Der überwiegende Teil der genannten Arzneimittel war vom Arzt verordnet (58 %), ein Viertel (25 %) wurde ohne Rezept selbst gekauft, 14 % stammten aus sonstiger Quelle unter anderem auch der Hausapotheke, und 2 % waren vom Heilpraktiker verordnet. Hinsichtlich der Anwendungsdauer überwog die kurzfristige Anwendung (unter einer Woche: 55 %), für 13 % aller Arzneimittelnennungen wurde angegeben, dass diese seit mindestens einem Jahr angewendet worden waren. Die dargestellten Ergebnisse beschreiben wesentliche Eckpunkte des Arzneimittelgebrauchs repräsentativ für die Kinder- und Jugendpopulation in Deutschland.

Prevalence was found to be highest (74. 9 %) in the age group 0 to 2 years. Girls showed with 53. 1 % a significantly higher prevalence rate than boys (48. 7 %). Children from families with low socioeconomic status and children from migrant families stated a less frequent use of medication compared to children from families with higher socio economic status and no migration background. Most frequently, the boys and girls used medicines for the treatment of respiratory tract conditions (ATC code R 00 : 16. 8 %). This was followed by Alimentary System and Metabolism (ATC code A 00 : 16. 0 %) and Dermatological Preparations (ATC code D 00 : 9. 7 %). The most frequent indications included with 12. 4 % of all medicines reported Other Specified Prophylactic Measures (ICD code Z 29. 8), with 11 % Acute <b>Rhinopharyngitis</b> (ICD code J 00), and with 10. 9 % Cough (ICD code R 05). Most of the drugs named were prescribed by a doctor (58 %), one quarter (25 %) was independently bought without prescription, 14 % came from other sources, including the medicine chest, and 2 % were prescribed by a non-medical practitioner. Regarding the duration of use, short-term use (less than 1 week: 55 %) was encountered most frequently, while a duration of use of at least one year was reported for 13 % of all medicines named. The results presented here describe the key points of medicine use among children and adolescents in Germany and are representative for this population segment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prescribing of {{antibiotics}} for {{upper respiratory tract}} infections (URTI) varies substantially in primary care. OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare antibiotic and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs use, URTI symptoms' resolution and occurrence of potentially-associated infections in patients seeking care from general practitioners (GPs) who exclusively prescribe conventional medications (GP-CM), regularly prescribe homeopathy within a mixed practice (GP-Mx), or are certified homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho). METHOD: The EPI 3 survey was a nationwide population-based study of {{a representative sample of}} 825 GPs and their patients in France (2007 - 2008). GP recruitment was stratified by self-declared homeopathic prescribing preferences. Adults and children with confirmed URTI were asked to participate in a standardized telephone interview at inclusion, one-, three- and twelve-month follow up. Study outcomes included medication consumption, URTI symptoms' resolution and potentially-associated infections (sinusitis or otitis media/externa) as reported by patients. Analyses included calibration to account for non-respondents and groups were compared using multivate analyses adjusting for baseline differences with a propensity score. RESULTS: 518 adults and children with URTI (79. 3 % <b>rhinopharyngitis)</b> were included (36. 9 % response rate comparable between groups). As opposed to GP-CM patients, patients in the GP-Ho group showed significantly lower consumption {{of antibiotics}} (Odds ratio (OR)  =  0. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 27 - 0. 68) and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs (OR =  0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 38 - 0. 76) with similar evolution in related symptoms (OR =  1. 16, 95 % CI: 0. 64 - 2. 10). An excess of potentially-associated infections (OR =  1. 70, 95 % CI: 0. 90 - 3. 20) was observed in the GP-Ho group (not statistically significant). No difference was found between GP-CM and GP-Mx patients. CONCLUSION: Patients who chose to consult GPs certified in homeopathy used less antibiotics and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs for URTI than those seen by GPs prescribing conventional medications. No difference was observed in patients consulting GPs within mixed-practice. A non-statistically significant excess was estimated through modelling for associated infections in the GP-Ho group and needs to be further studied...|$|E
40|$|Kingella kingae is an {{important}} cause of invasive infections in young children from Western countries. Although increasing reports indicate that this organism is the leading agent of bone and joint infections in early childhood, data on K. kingae infections from resource-limited settings are scarce, and none has yet been reported in Africa. We herein report the diagnostic and epidemiological investigations of the first case of K. kingae arthritis identified in a child from sub-Saharan Africa. A 5 -year-old Cameroonian boy presented with a sudden painful limp {{which appeared in the}} course of a mild <b>rhinopharyngitis.</b> He lived in Cameroon where he had been vaccinated with BCG at birth and moved to France for holidays 4 [*]days before consultation. There was no history of trauma and he did not have any underlying medical condition. Upon admission, he had a temperature of 36. 7 °C, and clinical examination revealed right-sided knee tenderness and effusion that was confirmed by ultrasound imaging. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 5, 700 [*]cells/mm 3, C-reactive protein level of 174 [*]mg/L, and platelet count of 495, 000 [*]cells/mm 3. He underwent an arthrocentesis and was immediately given intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate. Conventional cultures from blood samples and synovial fluids were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the broad-range 16 S rRNA gene and real-time quantitative PCR assays targeting Mycobacterium species were negative. Surprisingly, real-time PCR assays targeting the cpn 60, rtxA, and rtxB genes of K. kingae were positive. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization specific for K. kingae identified the presence of numerous coccobacilli located within the synovial fluid. Finally, multilocus sequence typing analysis performed on deoxyribonucleic acid directly extracted from joint fluid disclosed a novel K. kingae sequence-type complex. This case report demonstrates that K. kingae may be considered as a potential cause of septic arthritis in children living in sub-Saharan Africa, and hence the burden of K. kingae infection may be not limited to the Western countries. Further studies are required to determine the prevalence of K. kingae infection and carriage in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Two {{outbreaks}} of zigomycosis with rhinofacial {{and two other}} with rhinopharyngeal lesions involving fungi with filamentous coaenocytic hyphae characteristic of entomoph-thoramycetous fungi are reported {{in the state of}} Paraíba, northeastern Brazil. One outbreak of rhinofacial zygomycosis occurred during the rainy season affecting 5 sheep. Another outbreak of the clinical form affected one out of 40 sheep during the dry season. Common clinical signs of the rhinofacial infection were bilateral serosanguineous nasal discharge with swelling of nostrils, upper lip, and the skin of the face. At necropsy the nasal mucosa showed dark brownish ulcerated areas which extended from the mucocutaneous region to 10 cm inside the nasal vestibule. The mucosa of the hard palate was also ulcerated. The cutting surface of nostrils and palate showed a brownish or red spongeous tissue of friable consistency. One outbreak of <b>rhinopharyngitis</b> took place on an irrigated coconut farm; 7 out of 60 adult sheep were affected. Another outbreak affected a sheep in a flock of 80 during the dry season. Clinical signs as noisy respiration and dyspnoea due to mechanical blockage of the nasal cavities, swelling of the nostrils, and serosanguineous nasal discharge were observed. Six out of 8 sheep in this group showed exophthalmia, keratitis and unilateral corneal ulceration of the eye. The sheep either died of their infection or were euthanized after a clinical course of 7 - 30 days. At necropsy there was a dense yellow exudate in the nasopharyngeal area affecting the ethmoidal region, turbinate bones, paranasal sinuses, hard and soft palates, orbital cavity, pharynges, regional muscles and lymph nodes. Histopathologically both forms of the disease showed multifocal granulomas with an eosinophilic necrotic reaction (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon) containing ribbon-type coenocytic hyphae with 7 - 30 mum in diameter similar to hyphae of zygomycetous fungi, possibly Conidiobolus spp. Outbreaks of both forms of mycotic rhinitis are common in northeastern Brazil and in other regions of the country...|$|E
