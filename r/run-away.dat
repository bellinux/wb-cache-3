5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of <b>run-away</b> accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from <b>run-away</b> peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

50|$|Nitric acid {{or forced}} air oven {{oxidation}} {{can also be}} used to dissolve iron from the electrowinning cathodes before smelting. Gravity concentrates can often contain high grinding steel contents, and so their removal using shaking tables or magnets is used before smelting.During smelting iron can be oxidized using nitre. Excessive use of nitre will corrode the smelting pot, increasing both maintenance costs and the risk of catastrophic leaks (known as <b>run-aways,</b> or holes in the pot through which the molten charge is lost). Magnetic separation is also very effective for separating iron impurities.|$|R
50|$|The {{extended}} Gregs {{family were}} {{also involved in}} slavery: some with the Triangular trade and some with abolition. Samuel Greg's brother-in-law Thomas Hodgson owned a slave ship; his son Adam Hodgson was {{a founding member of}} the Liverpool Anti-slavery Society in 1822. Thomas Greg, Samuel's father and his brother John Greg part-owned some sugar plantations in the Caribbean, especially Dominica. The best documented is Hillsborough, which included the ownership of 71 male slaves and 68 female slaves. In January 1814, twenty slaves absconded, and were recaptured and punished with 100 lashes for the males and 50 lashes for the females. The incident was triggered by the death of a slave in the plantation-run hospital; the <b>run-aways</b> believed he had been poisoned.|$|R
25|$|The {{initiation}} of a snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which {{would result in}} an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's albedo, which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, <b>run-away</b> cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.|$|E
25|$|City {{started the}} 2016–17 season with mixed form, winning two and losing {{two of their}} opening four games. This was {{followed}} by a run of victories that resulted in the Imps sitting top of the table after a victory at Tranmere, the first time the club had topped any table in ten years. The form again dipped with defeats to Dover and Barrow in late September, but that would be the last time that the Imps would taste defeat in any competition until a last minute defeat to Guiseley on Boxing Day. During that run the Imps travelled to <b>run-away</b> leaders Forest Green and would have fallen twelve points behind with a defeat, but three goals in the final 30 minutes turned around a 2–0 deficit.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{of such a}} large bubble to the legs {{can be a problem}} for a number of reasons: It balloons the legs, and it may inflate thin rubber booties enough to cause fins to pop off; a diver without fins has more restricted ability to move and become upright, and also loses the ability to kick downward to maintain depth, so that the bubble expansion problem does not grow worse. Movement of gas into the legs and feet may also cause special difficulties in drysuits that have air exhaust values only at the shoulders or wrists, because the air in the legs and booties cannot be evacuated while the diver is inverted, and such a diver may be moving toward the surface, causing the problem of expanding air in the suit to grow worse with each meter of lost depth. (Some low-quality buoyancy control devices also cannot vent air, when inverted). If the diver is positively buoyant and rising, the buoyancy of the dry suit becomes uncontrollable after rising though a certain fraction of depth, and there is then an increased risk of a rapid ascent which grows more rapid, as the distance to the surface decrease. The final result of such a <b>run-away</b> inversion is a diver rising {{all the way to the}} surface, feet first, in an uncontrolled ascent that is too rapid for decompression safety.|$|E
60|$|For this {{expedition}} (which occupied three months), all {{the arrangements}} were undertaken for me by Dr. Campbell, who afforded me every facility which in his government position he could command, besides personally superintending {{the equipment and}} provisioning of my party. Taking horses or loaded animals of any kind was not expedient: the whole journey was to be performed on foot, and everything carried on men's backs. As we were to march through wholly unexplored countries, where food was only procurable at uncertain intervals, {{it was necessary to}} engage a large body of porters, some of whom should carry bags of rice for the coolies and themselves too. The difficulty of selecting these carriers, of whom thirty were required, was very great. The Lepchas, the best and most tractable, and over whom Dr. Campbell had the most direct influence, disliked employment out of Sikkim, especially in so warlike a country as Nepal: and they were besides thought unfit for the snowy regions. The Nepalese, of whom there were many residing as British subjects in Dorjiling, were mostly <b>run-aways</b> from their own country, and afraid of being claimed, should they return to it, by the lords of the soil. To employ Limboos, Moormis, Hindoos, or other natives of low elevations, was out of the question; and no course appeared advisable but to engage some of the Bhotan <b>run-aways</b> domiciled in Dorjiling, who are accustomed to travel at all elevations, and fear nothing but a return to the country which they have abandoned as slaves, or as culprits: they are immensely powerful, and though intractable to the last degree, are generally glad to work and behave well for money. The choice, as will hereafter be seen, was unfortunate, though at the time unanimously approved.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We study a 2 D {{quasi-static}} discrete crack anti-plane {{model of}} a tectonic plate with long range elastic forces and quenched disorder. The plate is driven at its border and the load is transfered to all elements through elastic forces. This model {{can be considered as}} belonging to the class of self-organized models which may exhibit spontaneous criticality, with four additional ingredients compared to sandpile models, namely quenched disorder, boundary driving, long range forces and fast time crack rules. In this ”crack ” model, as in the ”dislocation ” version previously studied, we find that the occurrence of repeated earthquakes organizes the activity on well-defined fault-like structures. In contrast with the ”dislocation ” model, after a transient, the time evolution becomes periodic with <b>run-aways</b> ending each cycle. This stems from the ”crack ” stress transfer rule preventing criticality to organize in favor of cyclic behavior. For sufficiently large disorder and weak stress drop, these large events are preceded by a complex space-time history of foreshock activity, characterized by a Gutenberg-Richter power law distribution with universal exponent B = 1 ± 0. 05.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a microwave heated apparatus for the production of silicon carbide (SiC) based ceramic matrix composites via chemical vapor infiltration. An innovative pilot scale reactor was designed and built. A coupled thermal and electromagnetic model was developed in order to predict the temperature profile inside the reactor. The results obtained from the model demonstrated that the electric field inside the sample was constant. This fact is particularly important in order to prevent the thermal instabilities (<b>run-aways)</b> that are typical in the case of microwave heating. Therefore the heating was uniform {{with the aid of a}} mode stirrer that achieved a better distribution of the microwave power and then improved the process efficiency. The infiltration cycles were carried out on SiC fiber preforms and resulted in an excellent average weight increase with respect to the initial sample. By using microwave heating, the treatment times were considerably reduced with respect to the conventional process times reported in the literature. The microstructure of the SiC composites were observed by scanning the electron microscopy in order to evaluate the quality and the degree of densification which was achieved within the fiber tows. The SiC deposition inside of the sample was sufficiently homogeneous and compact, even if a certain degree of inter-tow porosity was still evident...|$|R

2500|$|Zaporizhian Sich was {{a pirate}} {{republic}} in Europe from the 16th {{through to the}} 18th century. Situated in Cossack territory in the remote steppe of Eastern Europe, it was populated with Ukrainian peasants that had run away from their feudal masters, outlaws, destitute gentry, <b>run-away</b> slaves from Turkish galleys, etc. The remoteness of the place and the rapids at the Dnepr river effectively guarded the place from invasions of vengeful powers. The main target of the inhabitants of Zaporizhian Sich who called themselves [...] "Cossacks" [...] were rich settlements at the Black Sea shores of Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate. By 1615 and 1625, Zaporozhian Cossacks had even managed to raze townships {{on the outskirts of}} Istanbul, forcing the Ottoman Sultan to flee his palace.

Either the horse was a <b>run-away,</b> or the driver had left it for a little and it had strayed. Whatever the cause of its being there John's alert mind saw at once that a collision was inevitable. He shut off steam, and was about to whistle for the guard to apply the brakes, while Will Garvie, who also saw the danger, was already turning on the brakes of the tender.|$|E
