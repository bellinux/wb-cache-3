Kinalas/luglog, from the old Bicol word [...] "kalas", refers to the [...] "fall off the bone" [...] meat that is placed on top of the noodles. The soup is the broth of beef bone and bone marrow (sometimes skull and brain included) or what Manileños call [...] "bulalo". [...] The soup is topped with very tender meat slices that also came from the pig's head. It is usually served hot with an egg, {{sprinkled}} with <b>roasted</b> <b>garlic</b> and spring onions.

5000|$|Romesco (...) is a nut and red pepper-based {{sauce that}} {{originated}} from Tarragona, Catalonia, in Northeastern Spain. The fishermen {{in this area}} made this sauce to eat with fish. It is typically made from any mixture of roasted or raw almonds, pine nuts, and/or hazelnuts, <b>roasted</b> <b>garlic,</b> olive or sunflower oil, bitxo peppers (similar to New Mexico chiles) and/or nyora peppers (a sun dried, small, round variety of red bell pepper). Flour or ground stale bread {{may be used as}} a thickener or to provide texture. Other common ingredients include roasted tomatoes, red wine vinegar and onions. Leaves of fennel or mint may be added, particularly if served with fish or escargot. It is very often served with seafood, but can also be served {{with a wide variety of}} other foods, including poultry and some red meats like lamb and vegetables. During the springtime, salsa romesco is served as an accompanying dip for calçots, a spring onion typical to Catalonia, during traditional springtime calçot barbecues called [...] "calçotades". During calçotades, calçots are roasted over an open fire until their outer layer is charred. The charred layer is then removed and the tender part of the onion may be dipped into the romesco.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1991, {{partners}} Jonathan King and Jim Stott combined {{their interests}} in horticulture and cooking to create recipes for oils, jams, chutneys and more. At {{the urging of}} a friend, they began their business by selling their homemade products at the local farmers’ market. Working from a small folding table and calling themselves Stonewall Kitchen, after the historic New England stone walls visible outside their kitchen window, the two ended up selling every product they brought with them. Able to repeat their success at farmers’ markets and other local venues, Jonathan and Jim expanded their product line to include new kinds of vinegars, oils, pesto, jams and baked goods. At one event, a local business owner asked if they sold wholesale. Not knowing exactly what she meant, Jonathan and Jim ended up selling every jar before the market even opened. And with that, a new revenue stream emerged. In 1993, demand for Stonewall Kitchen products was growing. National retailer Crate & Barrel approached Jonathan and Jim with an order for 2500 jars of their Orange Cranberry Marmalade. The order was filled {{but it took a}} month {{for the two of them}} to do it. Realizing they needed to increase production capacity, they purchased and renovated an eighteenth-century era barn in Kittery, Maine. Though adequate, when another larger property became available in nearby York, Maine, the two purchased it and opened a new center of operations. As production became more structured and streamlined, Jonathan and Jim attended the Fancy Food Show in New York City - the largest specialty food and beverage marketplace that attracts 1,100 exhibitors and 36,000 buyers. The result was unprecedented for first time attendees—the Outstanding Preserve award for their <b>Roasted</b> <b>Garlic</b> Onion Jam. They also earned a second highest honor award, for Outstanding Product Line. By the time the show was over, Jonathan and Jim had 500 orders from retailers across the country.|$|E
40|$|On 30 April 2009, the Communicable Disease Control Branch (CDCB) South Australia was {{notified}} of a Salmonella infection {{in a person}} who attended a wedding reception on 25 April 2009. Several other attendees reported becoming unwell with a similar gastrointestinal illness. The CDCB commenced an investigation to: characterise the outbreak in terms of person, place and time; identify probable source or sources; and implement control measures. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken among wedding reception attendees. A questionnaire collecting information on demographics, illness and menu items consumed {{was given to the}} majority of attendees. An environmental inspection of the wedding reception premise and food supplier premise, including food sampling was conducted to identify plausible sources of infection. The questionnaire response rate was 77 %, from which an attack rate of 20 % was calculated. There was a significant association between consumption of garlic aioli and illness(OR 5. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 6, 18. 1). Nine wedding reception attendees’ stool samples tested positive for Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 44. A sample of garlic aioli also tested positive for Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 44. The ingredients of the garlic aioli included raw egg yolk, <b>roasted</b> <b>garlic,</b> Dijon mustard, vinegar and vegetable oil. The raw egg yolk was identified as a high risk food item; however no eggs tested positive for Salmonella. Emma J. Denehy, Jane C. A. Raupach, Scott A. Cameron, Kamalini M. Lokuge and Ann P.

5000|$|The {{first edition}} of Pantagruel, another novel by Rabelais, {{published}} in Lyon in 1532 before Gargantua, is inspired by the adventures of a comedic doctor {{who is said to}} be inspired by the Lyonnaise comportment. The book evokes Lyonnaise cuisine, citing a list of dishes: [...] "sausage, sausage, ham, sausages, huge wild boar <b>roasts</b> with <b>garlic</b> sauce, pluck, fricandeau, fat capons in white Mangier, hochepots, beef stew, cabirotades, hastereaux, game animals and birds, stuffed lamb, stuffed carp, whitefish, annealed (cheese flavored with peach leaves), crackers and macaroons (dry cakes), fruit jellies, fritters, and so on".|$|R
5000|$|Broken rice is {{consumed}} {{as part of}} local cuisine in West Africa (where the traditional African rice is easier to break), Thailand, Bangladesh and elsewhere in South East Asia. In Vietnam Cơm tấm (literally [...] "broken rice") is a popular rice dish with pork. Thieboudienne is a popular dish in west Africa often made with broken rice. Broken rice is called rice grist or middlins in South Carolina. In Bangladesh it is called khood.

5000|$|Peanuts are {{particularly}} common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, {{both of which}} marry indigenous and European ingredients. For instance, in Peru, a popular traditional dish is picante de cuy, a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts (ingredients native to South America) with <b>roasted</b> onions and <b>garlic</b> (ingredients from European cuisine). Also, {{in the city of}} Arequipa in Peru, a well known dish called ocopa consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers (both native to the region) with <b>roasted</b> onions, <b>garlic,</b> and oil, poured over meat or potatoes. Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with sautéed seafood or boiled and shredded chicken. These dishes are generally known as ajíes, meaning [...] "hot peppers", such as ají de pollo and ají de mariscos (seafood ajíes may omit peanuts).Likewise, during colonial times, the Spanish in Peru used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable in Peru, but used extensively in Spanish cuisine, such as almonds, pine nuts, and other nuts, typically ground or as paste and mixed with rice, meats, and vegetables for dishes such as rice pilaf.|$|R
50|$|Porchetta {{is one of}} two iconic culinary {{products}} of the Lazio region, the other being the sheep cheese pecorino romano. Porchetta is also common in Abruzzo.
