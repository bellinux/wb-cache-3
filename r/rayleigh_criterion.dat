25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>criterion</b> or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>criterion</b> {{dictates}} that any radio wave, microwave or laser beam will spread and become weaker and diffuse over distance; {{the larger the}} transmitter antenna or laser aperture compared to the wavelength of radiation, the tighter the beam and the less it will spread {{as a function of}} distance (and vice versa). Smaller antennae also suffer from excessive losses due to side lobes. However, the concept of laser aperture considerably differs from an antenna. Typically, a laser aperture much larger than the wavelength induces multi-moded radiation and mostly collimators are used before emitted radiation couples into a fiber or into space.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> is {{extensively}} used in {{optical microscopy}} {{for determining the}} resolution of microscopes. This criterion imposes a resolution limit {{that has long been}} held as an impediment for studying nanoscale biological phenomenon through an optical microscope. However, {{it is well known that}} <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> is based on intuitive notions. For example, <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> is formulated in a deterministic setting that neglects the photon statistics of the acquired data. Hence it does not take into account the number of detected photons, which, in turn, raises concern over the use of <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> in photon-counting techniques such as single-molecule microscopy. Here, we re-examine the resolution problem by adopting a stochastic framework and present a resolution measure that overcomes the limitations of <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion.</b> This resolution measure predicts that the resolution of optical microscopes is not limited and that it can be improved by increasing the number of detected photons. Experimental verification of the resolution measure is carried out by imaging single-molecule pairs with different distances of separation. The resolution measure provides a quantitative tool for designing and evaluating single-molecule experiments that probe biomolecular interactions...|$|R
40|$|In 1878, Lord <b>Rayleigh</b> {{formulated}} his <b>criterion</b> {{to explain}} several examples of acoustic waves excited and maintained by heat addition. It is a qualitative explanation successfully capturing {{the essence of}} the phenomena but not providing a basis for quantitative predictions. The widespread appeal of <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> merits placing this important result on a more rigorous basis. To do so requires careful formulation grounded in the theory of small amplitude motions in a compressible fluid. In this chapter, we review the construction of an approximate analysis and establish the equivalence of <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> and the condition for linear stability of small amplitude motions. Thus <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> is formulated explicitly {{in the context of an}} analysis applicable to any combustion chamber.

2500|$|Two point sources {{will each}} produce an Airy pattern – see {{the photo of}} a binary star. [...] As the point sources move closer together, the {{patterns}} will start to overlap, and ultimately they will merge to form a single pattern, {{in which case the}} two point sources cannot be resolved in the image.

40|$|<b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion</b> {{states that}} it becomes {{essentially}} difficult to resolve two incoherent optical point sources separated by a distance below the width of point spread functions (PSF), namely in the subdiffraction limit. Recently, researchers have achieved superresolution for two incoherent point sources with equal strengths using {{a new type of}} measurement technique, surpassing <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion.</b> However, situations where more than two point sources needed to be resolved have not been fully investigated. Here we prove that for any incoherent sources with arbitrary strengths, a one- or two-dimensional image can be precisely resolved up to its second moment in the subdiffraction limit, i. e. the Fisher information (FI) is non-zero. But the FI with respect to higher order moments always tends to zero polynomially as the size of the image decreases, for any type of measurement. We call this phenomenon a modern description of <b>Rayleigh's</b> <b>criterion.</b> For PSFs under certain constraints, the optimal measurement basis estimating all moments in the subdiffraction limit for 1 D weak-source imaging is constructed. Such basis also generates the optimal-scaling FI with respect {{to the size of the}} image for 2 D or strong-source imaging, which achieves an overall quadratic improvement compared to direct imaging.
