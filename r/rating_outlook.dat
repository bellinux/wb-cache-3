40|$|Domestic credit-rating {{agencies}} in China {{have been criticized}} for having no effect on the decisions of investors. We examine whether credit ratings and <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks</b> of the listed companies that are assigned by Chinese rating agencies have any effect on their stock returns. We use the pooled time-series cross-sectional issuer-rating data of 160 companies that are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from XinhuaâFar East China Credit Ratings (a Hong Kongâbased credit-ratings agency) for 2002 to 2004. Using a simultaneous equation model, we offer new insights into the determinants of Chinese credit ratings and whether credit ratings affect stock returns. The results suggest that profitability, debt structure, firm size, and past stock performance are important factors in determining Chinese credit ratings and <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks.</b> The model shows that credit ratings and the stock performance of the rated companies simultaneously influence each other. Chinese credit ratings are important to the stock returns of the rated issuers in China. Our empirical results provide preliminary evidence that contrasts the conceptual argument that credit ratings in China are not important to investors. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} global corporate {{credit rating}} transition and default rates during the 1995 - 2003 period conditional {{on the full}} information in Moody's published credit opinions, which, {{in addition to the}} current credit rating, include prior rating actions and current <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks</b> and reviews. The primary findings of this study are: • Moody’s rating system management practices attempt to limit rating reversals and dampen rating change volatility and, as a consequence, different issuers carrying the same rating may have different risks of rating migration and default. • As noted in Moody’s prior research dating back to 1993, recently downgraded issuers have a greater likelihood of future rating downgrades and default than do recently upgraded issuers. For example, obligors downgraded in the past twelve months are eight {{times more likely to be}} downgraded than upgraded in the next year. Downgraded issuers are eleven times more likely to default over one year than upgraded issuers. • Moody’s <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks</b> and reviews are used to signal the likely direction and timing of future rating actions and the evolution of default risk. For example, at a one-year time horizon, issuers with negative outlooks are seven times more likely to be downgraded than upgraded; issuers with positive outlooks are nearly twice as likely to be upgraded as downgraded; and issuers with stable outlooks have the highest probability of no rating change. Default rates within a given rating category also vary systematically by outlook status. For example...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the information fl ow between the {{credit default swap}} market {{and the stock market}} as well as insider trading in the credit default swap market. Methodology: For my analysis I use the event study methodology. Using the event study methodology I calculate abnormal stock returns and abnormal credit default swap premium changes. The analysis is based on 175, 874 observations collected for 92 companies between the years 2001 and 2010. Findings: The results show that the information fl ow from the credit default swap market to the stock market is the most signifi cant in terms of negative <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks.</b> The information fl ow is much less signifi cant in relations to negative surprises during announcements of annual fi nancial results and rating upgrades. Evidence of insider trading is also most evident with reference to negative <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks.</b> Additionally, a distinctive feature of the credit default swap market and the stock market is the asymmetric response to negative and positive credit information. Research limitations: The event study methodology does not consider other potentially important reasons for the information flow between markets than the ones actually investigated. The credit events and credit risk information used in this research are just a proposal and can be extended by future researchers. Originality: This paper discusses a new research area. The main research area in terms of insider trading is still the stock market, with special focus on the US market. I decided to explore the insider trading phenomenon in the credit default swap market. I only considered contracts that are quoted with reference to European underlying assets. This part of the fi nancial market is attractive in terms of economic research as credit derivatives are more commonly used not only in North America but also in Europe...|$|R

The conducted event study and panel regression indicate that there is a significant impact of rating downgrades and negative <b>rating</b> <b>outlooks</b> on sovereign bond markets. Moreover, we have found significant contagion effect spreading from downgraded countries to non-event Euro zone members, namely not only to sovereign bond markets, but also to stock markets.

We show that the developments in the domestic fundamentals and in the risk appetite of foreign investors on the international markets explain the developments in the spreads. Using data for EMBIG spreads for Romania and other ten Emerging Economies, we find a long-run relationship between the spreads {{on the one hand and}} a Credit <b>Rating</b> <b>Outlook</b> Index (CROI) and the volatility index VIX on the other hand. The CROI is a proxy for the developments in the domestic fundamentals, while the VIX is a proxy for the risk appetite of the international investors. To estimate the long-run relationship, we use both a pool equation with fixed effects and the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1997). There is a large similitude between the deviations of spreads from the level implied by the long-run relationship in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, which we explain by the EU accession process of these two countries. We find also a comovement in the volatility of daily returns of CEE sovereign bonds, with spillover effects especially between Bulgaria and Romania. The domestic fundamentals were the main drivers of the cumulated change in the equilibrium level of spreads for Romanian sovereign bonds between May 2002 and April 2008.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} cross-market {{correlations between}} means and variances in sovereign credit markets and captures {{the presence of}} any contagion effect by focusing on parallel movements between markets {{in the wake of}} the recent crisis. Furthermore, it focuses on the effect of policy interventions on the dynamics of these correlations. First, to look at the correlation between markets, we investigate the interaction between sovereign spreads and creditworthiness. Our results suggest that there are stable long-term cointegration relationships and significant short-term reactions between government CDS spreads to <b>rating</b> and <b>outlook</b> changes, with <b>rating</b> and <b>outlook</b> leading CDS spreads. After confirming the leading role of credit ratings, we further investigate the spillover effect from ratings to CDS spreads across markets and countries. We are concerned with the spillover effect of a change in the sovereign credit <b>rating</b> and <b>outlook</b> of one country on the sovereign CDS spreads of other countries. We find that <b>rating</b> and <b>outlook</b> announcements originating from different countries have a strong spillover effect across countries but not across regions, while countries’ initial credit status has limited effect on such spillover. Moreover, the US market is a strong source of global spillover to all the countries. After controlling for US factors, the international spillover effects are found to be stronger during crisis periods than in tranquil periods. In addition, credit outlook changes have a greater impact on sovereign CDS spread responses than rating change announcements, suggesting that outlook changes carry more new information. Furthermore, we are also concerned with the influences of rescue plans by the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the interdependence of sovereign credit risk, measured by CDS spreads, in the Eurozone. The study focuses on the interaction between two groups of nations, ‘cores’ (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the UK) and ‘PIIGS’ (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain), before and after these bailouts. We are able to control for the rating and other external influences affecting sovereign CDS spreads. There are three principal findings. (1) Before the EU interventions, the spreads of the rescued countries – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain (PIGS) – had a strong influence on rating changes in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the UK (core European countries). (2) After bailout, our results underline increased interdependencies between sovereign credit risk in the EU area, especially between the rescued country and the core countries. This suggests that these bailout plans not only increase the influence of the rescued country on the development of the core nations, but also amplify the sensitivity of PIIGS to changes in the cores. (3) Different countries will vary in their financial stability and their fundamentals will differ, so they will be expected to respond differently to a bailout. Indeed, distinctive interaction behaviours across countries, related to country-specific characteristics (fiscal outlook), is found for each of the financial policy interventions. Second, to look at the correlation between variances, this study investigated correlation between 9 major EMU countries’ CDS markets during the sovereign debt crisis, and hence examined the impacts of policy interventions on these markets, using the DCC-GARCH model. The main purpose was to assess the extent to which the policy interventions influenced the dynamics of correlations in sovereign CDS markets, after controlling for international influence (US VIX), and both domestic and foreign sovereign credit <b>rating</b> and <b>outlook.</b> Our results suggest that correlations are time-varying for all the sample countries. Most of the policy interventions led to a significant increase in the pairwise correlations. Our interpretation is that the “two-way feedback” between the healthy country and the bailed-out country causes the public-to-public risk transfer. The increased debt and deficit partly result from assisting other troubled nations. Through policy interventions, any deterioration in the sovereign creditworthiness of the healthy countries could transmit back to the bailed-out countries. Moreover, the estimation result suggests that policy interventions, rather than VIX and credit rating/outlook, play the most direct and significant role in shaping the structure of dynamic correlation in the EMU markets...|$|R
