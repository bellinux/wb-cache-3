25|$|For {{the first}} four of those years, she {{operated}} out of Port Hueneme, contributing {{to the development of}} the <b>Regulus</b> missile <b>system.</b> Except for a short period of type training, Tunny engaged entirely in the launching and guidance of Regulus missiles for purposes of missile evaluation in the development of the system. In 1957, she shifted her base of operations to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, bringing Regulus to initial operational capability, where she conducted the first submarine deterrent patrols and fired exercise missiles.|$|R
40|$|The rapidly {{rotating}} {{primary component}} of <b>Regulus</b> A <b>system</b> has been observed, {{for the first}} time, using the technique of differential interferometry at high spectral resolution. The observations have been performed across the Br_γ spectral line with the VLTI/AMBER focal instrument in high spectral resolution mode (R ≈ 12000) at ≈ 80 - 130 m (projected on the sky) Auxiliary Telescopes triplet baseline configurations. We confirm, within the uncertainties, the results previously obtained using the techniques of classical long-baseline interferometry, although the question of anomalous gravity darkening remains open for the future study...|$|R
50|$|At full speed, Vought OS2U Kingfisher {{could be}} {{launched}} from these catapults and later Curtiss SC-1 Seahawk as well. These planes {{were used for}} reconnaissance, anti-submarine, and rescue missions. The planes were seaplanes, and after their missions would land in the water near the cruiser and be lifted back up into the ship by the crane or cranes in the rear and reset upon their catapults. In the 1950s, the catapults and the accompanying capacity to launch airplanes were removed, though the cranes were left and the hangars used to house helicopters, ship's boats or {{the workings of the}} <b>Regulus</b> missile <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Regulus</b> <b>system</b> as a {{whole is}} the twenty-first {{brightest}} star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of +1.35. The light output is dominated by Regulus A. Regulus B, if seen in isolation, would be a binocular object of magnitude +8.1, and its companion, Regulus C, the faintest of the three stars that has been directly observed, would require a substantial telescope to be seen, at magnitude +13.5. Regulus A is itself a spectroscopic binary: the secondary star has not yet been directly observed as it is much fainter than the primary. The BC pair lies at an angular distance of 177 arc-seconds from Regulus A, making them visible in amateur telescopes.|$|E
50|$|Regulus A is {{a binary}} star {{consisting}} of a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B7V, which is orbited by a star of at least 0.3 solar masses, which is probably a white dwarf. The two stars take approximately 40 days to complete an orbit around their common centre of mass. Given the extremely distorted shape of the primary, the relative orbital motion may be notably altered {{with respect to the}} two-body purely Keplerian scenario because of non-negligible long-term orbital perturbations affecting, for example, its orbital period. In other words, Kepler's third law, which holds exactly only for two point-like masses, would no longer be valid for the <b>Regulus</b> <b>system.</b> Regulus A was long thought to be fairly young, only 50 - 100 million years old, calculated by comparing its temperature, luminosity, and mass. The existence of a white dwarf companion would mean that the system is at least a 1,000 million years old, just to account for the formation of the white dwarf. The discrepancy can be accounted for by a history of mass transfer onto a once-smaller Regulus A.|$|E
40|$|We {{show how}} the recent {{discovery}} of a likely close white dwarf companion to the well known star Regulus, {{one of the brightest}} stars in the sky, leads to considerable insight into the prior evolutionary history of this star, including the cause of its current rapid rotation. We infer a relatively narrow range for the initial masses of the progenitor system: M 10 = 2. 3 ± 0. 2 M ⊙ and M 20 = 1. 7 ± 0. 2 M⊙, where M 10 and M 20 are the initial masses of the progenitors of the white dwarf and Regulus, respectively. In this scenario, the age of the <b>Regulus</b> <b>system</b> would exceed 1 Gyr. We also show that Regulus, with a current orbital period of 40 days, has an interesting future ahead of it. This includes (i) a common envelope phase, and, quite possibly, (ii) an sdB phase, followed by (iii) an AM CVn phase with orbital periods � 1 hr. Binary evolution calculations are presented in support of this scenario. We also discuss alternative possibilities, emphasizing the present uncertainties in binary evolution theory. Thus, this one particular star system illustrates many different aspects of binary stellar evolution...|$|E
50|$|The Ares I design updated in 2006 {{featured}} one five-segment SRB (originally {{developed for}} the Shuttle, but never used) as a first stage - the second stage was powered by an uprated J-2X engine, derived from the J-2, which {{had been used in}} the upper stage of Saturn V and Saturn IB. In place of the standard SRB nosecone, the Ares I would have a tapered interstage assembly connecting the booster proper with the second stage, an attitude control system derived from the <b>Regulus</b> missile <b>system,</b> and larger, heavier parachutes to lower the stage into the Atlantic Ocean for recovery.|$|R
25|$|In May 1965, the <b>Regulus</b> missile <b>system</b> was phased out, {{having been}} {{superseded}} by the Polaris missile, and Tunny was redesignated with hull classification symbol SS-282. She {{remained in the}} Hawaiian operating area {{until the end of}} the year, conducting training exercises and providing various other services. In 1966, she was converted to a troop-carrying submarine and redesignated with hull classification symbol APSS-282, being re-equipped with a deck shelter for small amphibious vehicles and other equipment. In February 1967, Tunny began missions in unconventional warfare, operating off the coast of Vietnam. She conducted reconnaissance in preparation for amphibious assault operations and gathered navigational and oceanographic information. Ideally suited for transporting small teams for specialized operations as well as for gathering information, she participated in Operation Deckhouse VI.|$|R
5|$|The game begins 32 {{years after}} the events in Descent: FreeSpace. Following {{the end of the}} Great War, both the GTA and PVE {{cemented}} their alliance by combining together to form the Galactic Terran–Vasudan Alliance (GTVA)—a single entity formed to cement the alliance between the Terran and Vasudan races after the destruction of Vasuda Prime by the Lucifer and the subsequent collapse of all subspace nodes to the Sol system {{as a result of the}} superdestroyer's destruction inside the Sol–Delta Serpentis jump node. Despite this alliance, however, opposition still exists to this union in the form of a faction of Terrans led by Great War veteran, Admiral Aken Bosch, who leads the rebel group under the banner of the Neo-Terran Front (NTF). The NTF's rebellion led to the faction gaining control over the Sirius, Polaris and <b>Regulus</b> star <b>systems,</b> while engaging the GTVA for 18 months, before launching attacks on the Vasudan systems of Deneb and Alpha Centauri.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 [...] For the {{purposes}} of Behenian Fixed Stars the Star known as Alpha Leo or Cor Leonis, also known as Regulus, should be considered {{under the auspices of}} the differences noted in zodiacs as listed above, sidereal versus tropical.

50|$|During 1948-1949, {{shortly after}} {{completing}} his bachelor's degree {{in electrical engineering}} from New York University, Lawrence Fogel worked at Watson Laboratories (USAF) computing radiation patterns for VHF and UHF radio direction finders for use in ground-to-air operations. He designed feedback amplifier filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for these radio systems. At Eglin Air Force Base, he controlled the final flight test program for the Diversity Antenna Array. Between 1950 and 1953, Fogel worked for Coles Signal Laboratory (U.S. Army Signal Corps) as an engineer {{in charge of the}} installation of electronic communication and navigation equipment in Army aircraft and helicopters. He completed his master's degree in electrical engineering at this same time from Rutgers University. During his time with Stavid Engineering, Inc. (New Jersey) between 1953-1956, he directed field operations of the <b>Regulus</b> Missile guidance <b>system</b> for submarines and also assisted with the design of flight instrumentation, communications, and electronics for aircraft and helicopters. As a part of this research, he formulated a solution for a mathematical model of the human operator as part of an aircraft flight control system that included such qualities as anticipation, development of a computer facility incorporating such a mode for use in the design of more effective human-machine relations. His efforts also led to five patents between 1958 and 1961 regarding active noise cancellation to reduce noise in helicopter cockpit environments for improved communication. These were the first patents in noise-cancelling headphone systems.|$|R
