After researching the status of the <b>rotary</b> power <b>head,</b> we invented a new decelerator—roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission, and applied it in cutting drill, we presented the <b>rotary</b> power <b>head</b> with roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission. The moving components, such as the input shaft and the output shaft, of the roulette curve profile movable tooth transmission are self-balance, so the transmission can bring about random tooth number difference. Analyzing the principle of the transmission, we create the three-dimensional modeling by using Solidworks 2010. The <b>rotary</b> power <b>head</b> with the new transmission installed is convenient in assembling and disassembling, transferring bigger torque, having a relatively small radial dimension, suitable for heavy-loaded rock drill machine...|$|R

40|$|The appellants, Philips Electronics and Philips Australia ("Philips"), {{respectively}} manufactured {{and distributed}} in Australia men's rotary electric shavers.

For many years and until June 1997, Philips' rotary shavers were the only rotary shavers sold in Australia {{with the result that}} these shavers had become exclusively associated with Philips. Philips Electronics owned a registered design in respect of the shape and configuration of their shaver. They also owned two trademarks. The trademarks each consisted of drawings or logos depicting three circles arranged to form an equilateral triangle. In June 1997, the respondent, Remington, who had hitherto sold only "foil" shavers, began importing and selling men's triple-headed rotary electric shavers.

40|$|Abstract. As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial <b>rotary</b> milling <b>heads</b> are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing a biaxial <b>rotary</b> milling <b>head</b> with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity. So a new design for biaxial <b>rotary</b> milling <b>head</b> with mechanical spindle, gear transmission and swinging fork structure is proposed. An integral supporting axis is applied to increase the rigidity of A-axis; through the closed numerical loop control based on precise encoder and the decoupling technology of feed motion of A/C axis, the contradiction between large reduction ratio and high precision transmission is solved, and then the requirement of high positioning accuracy (10 ") is met. Theoretical calculation and simulated analysis shown, the new design not only can guarantee transmission accuracy and dynamic characteristics of biaxial <b>rotary</b> milling <b>head,</b> but also can improve its structural stiffness and meet the high demands of large torque, high precision and high rigidity...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Melbourne {{businessman}} Isador Magid imported a <b>rotary</b> <b>head</b> extruder from the United States which initially did not work. After bringing out a technical expert from the USA {{as well as}} receiving valuable advice from the CSIRO, Magid started producing Twisties. The product was popular but large scale distribution was difficult so Magid decided to sell the machine and the brand in 1955 to Monty Lea from Darrell Lea for £12,000. Monty and his brother Harris experimented with the machine further using rice and various flavourings. Twisties became popular in Australia - some of its early success is attributed to promotional activity that included advertising the product on Graham Kennedy and Bert Newton's TV show In Melbourne Tonight, {{making it one of}} the earliest products advertised on that program. After an unsuccessful attempt to launch Twisties in the UK and competition for shelf space in Australia the Lea brothers agreed to sell the Twisties brand to the Smith's Snackfood Company.|$|E
5000|$|Twisties {{are also}} {{sold on the}} Italian market with the name ''''Fonzies''''. [...] Fonzies are pale yellow in colour, {{because they do not}} use the bright orange food {{colouring}} that normal Twisties use. As well as this, they are easier to chew because they're baked, unlike its Australian inspiration which is fried. Their cheese flavouring is very similar to that used in the Oceanian varieties bearing the 'Twisties' name, lighter and less prone to clump together during consumption, and with a more natural cheese flavour. The only quality that differentiates it from said varieties is its slight egg-like taste upon first bite, though it wears away after continued consumption. It is made through the same <b>rotary</b> <b>head</b> extrusion technique as in all other localisations, though the snacks are much smaller than those found in Australia, sticking more to a general thin shape rather than a selection of both thin and stout snacks. Its smell is much more pungent, as well. Fonzies are available in 'Gli Originali' ('Original') flavour, as well as 'Time Out', 'Choco', 'Hot Passion', 'Bacon','Hot Chili' and others.|$|E

50|$|DCC uses a 9-track {{magneto-resistive}} (MR) {{head for}} playback. The head is {{fixed to the}} mechanism of the recorder, unlike <b>rotary</b> <b>heads</b> {{that are used in}} helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS to increase head-to-tape speed. Because of the reduced number of moving parts, DCC decks are less sensitive to shock and vibration. And because of the dimensions that are so similar to analog compact cassettes, existing auto-reverse audio cassette recorder mechanisms can easily be adapted for use in DCC recorders simply by mounting a DCC head instead of only an analog head. In fact, Philips did this during development.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{was written}} during an {{internship}} at ProCom GmbH in Aachen, Germany. It {{is a project}} with the goal to upgrade their already existing three linear axis test bench with two additional rotary axes. The task is to either find an already existing solution or to design, manufacture and install a <b>rotary</b> <b>head</b> on the test bench. The test bench is used to simulate water jet, laser and plasma cutting machines and is designed for internal use by ProCom. It is used to test new developed algorithms of their CNC software but also to test newly developed hardware before it is introduced to the market. The test bench has its axis driven by electrical motors and the additional two rotary axes would also be controlled the same way. The test bench is operated without any process force which means that only its own weight {{will have to be}} taken into consideration. The background to this requirement of an extra two axis is that customers are starting to demand a five axis control system for their machines and therefore it must be possible to test and verify the software in a realistic environment.
