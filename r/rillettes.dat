5000|$|Like cassoulet or fondue, this French dish has {{its many}} {{regional}} definitions. In general most <b>rillettes</b> are served at room temperature, as a spread with toast points, {{much like a}} pâté. Pork <b>rillettes</b> from the northwestern regions of Tours and Anjou are famous for the rich texture and bronze color achieved during the cooking process. Rabelais called <b>rillettes</b> [...] "the brown jam from the pig" [...] (brune confiture de cochon). <b>Rillettes</b> from the adjacent département of Sarthe are distinguished by a more rustic texture, complete with larger pieces of pork and less color.|$|E

50|$|Corner 103's {{tasting room}} {{is located in}} {{downtown}} Sonoma, California. It {{is located in the}} historic Feed Store building. The tasting room is open to the public. Davis pairs seasonal food with the wines in order to provide guests an educational experience. Staff lead guests through seven food and wine pairings which include charcuterie, local cheese, <b>rillette</b> and other gourmet foods paired with Corner 103 wine. The wines served during the tasting represent a different AVA in Sonoma County. Staff share information on the soil and growing conditions of each vineyard from which the wines come from and also discuss the correct type of glass the wines should be served in and the temperature the wines should be served at.|$|R
50|$|The term {{rillette}} perhaps {{refers to}} the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. <b>Rillettes</b> were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly {{over low heat until}} very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. <b>Rillettes</b> could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated {{in the shape of a}} pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the <b>rillettes</b> were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood <b>rillettes</b> were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.|$|E
50|$|Sarthe (Le Mans), Tours, and Anjou, all {{in central}} France, are notable sources of <b>rillettes.</b>|$|E

50|$|The word <b>rillettes</b> is thus cognate or {{linked with}} the English words rail, {{referring}} to railways, and ruler, meaning a straight strip of wood for measuring.|$|E
50|$|Fouée, {{also known}} as fouace is a round, airy bread from the western France (Touraine and Anjou region of the Loire Valley, Poitou, Charente). It looks {{somewhat}} similar to pita. It is served with pork <b>rillettes,</b> salted butter and mogettes (white beans).|$|E
50|$|A toast {{point is}} a {{triangular}} slice of bread that has been toasted after the crusts have been cut off. Toast points are commonly served {{as a side dish}} or as part of a hors d'oeuvre or snack using ingredients such as caviar and <b>rillettes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The French word <b>rillettes</b> {{is first}} {{evidenced}} in 1845. It {{derives from the}} Old French rille, meaning a slice of pork, which is first attested in 1480. This is a dialect variation of the Old French reille, meaning a lath or strip of wood, from the Latin regula.|$|E
50|$|Non-waterfowl meats are {{frequently}} treated to the confit process, {{but they are}} not classically considered true confits. The French refer only to duck and goose confits as true confits; other meats poached in duck or goose fat are considered en confit ("in confit"). For example, chicken cooked in goose fat is called poulet en confit. Pork is often confit and shredded to create <b>rillettes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Quebec cuisine, [...] (sometimes gorton or corton, {{especially}} among New Englanders of French-Canadian origin) is a forcemeat-style pork spread containing onions and spices. Due to its fatty texture and taste, it resembles French <b>rillettes.</b> Cretons are usually served on toast {{as part of}} a traditional Quebec breakfast. It is {{not to be confused with}} [...] "fromage de tête" [...] (tête fromagée in Quebec) or head cheese.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rillettes</b> ( [...] or French [...] ) are a {{preparation}} of meat similar to pâté. Commonly made from pork, {{the meat is}} cubed or chopped, salted heavily and cooked slowly in fat until it is tender enough to be easily shredded, and then cooled with enough of the fat to form a paste. They are normally used as spread on bread or toast and served at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} version uses white {{chicken breast}} meat, preferably freshly slaughtered capon. The meat is softened by boiling and separated into very fine fibers or <b>rillettes.</b> Modern recipes often pound the meat into a fine powder instead. The meat {{is mixed with}} milk, sugar, cracked rice and/or other thickeners, and often some sort of flavoring such as cinnamon. The result is a thick pudding often shaped for presentation.|$|E
5000|$|The French {{word for}} a person who prepares charcuterie is charcutier, {{generally}} translated into English as [...] "pork butcher". This {{has led to the}} mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork. The Food Lover's Companion, however, says, [...] "it refers to the products, particularly (but not limited to) pork specialties such as pâtés, <b>rillettes,</b> galantines, crépinettes, etc., which are made and sold in a delicatessen-style shop, also called a charcuterie." [...] The 1961 edition of Larousse Gastronomique defines it as: [...] "The art of preparing various meats, in particular pork, in order to present them in the most diverse ways." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charcuterie is {{the branch}} of cooking devoted to {{prepared}} meat products such as bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, galantines, pâtés, and confit, primarily from pork. Originally intended {{as a way to}} preserve meats before the advent of refrigeration, these preparations are prepared today for the flavours that are derived from the preservation processes. In 15th century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers. The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only [...] "raw" [...] meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The charcutier prepared numerous items, including pâtés, <b>rillettes,</b> sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} century AD, Strabo {{recorded}} the import of salted meat from Gaul and the Romans {{may have been the}} first to regulate the trade of charcuterie as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints, but the French have also had some influence. In 15th-century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers. The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried fruits, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only [...] "raw" [...] meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The charcutier prepared numerous items, including pâtés, <b>rillettes,</b> sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese (brawn). These preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer shelf-lives.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe city of Le Mans, and its {{surrounding}} region, is renowned well beyond the French border by its famous endurance motor races and perhaps also by its delicious <b>rillettes</b> (shredded pork pâté). The area is also appreciated by historians for its artistic and historical past, such as its long link with the Plantagenet lineage (Louis II, King of England {{and the father of}} Richard I, the Lionheart, was born in Le Mans!), or as being the country of the Aulerques Cenomans, the celtic tribe from which Le Mans derives its name. For geologists, this is a familiar toponym that inspired Alcide d’Orbigny to create the name Cenomanian, the earliest stage of the Upper Cretaceous and one of the fifty or so French stratotypes identified during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. This book proposes to describe the rich history of this geological stage. The Cenomanian is today an official stage of the International Geological Timescale; it is the basal stage of the Upper Cretaceous, spanning 6. 6 million years. Its boundaries are clearly defined and dated by a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), which for the Albian-Cenomanian boundary is dated to 100. 5 Ma, while that for the Cenomanian-Turonian is dated to 93. 9 Ma...|$|E
40|$|In France, {{listeriosis}} surveillance {{is based}} on mandatory notification of all culture-confirmed cases, with systematic typing of isolates and routine collection of the patient’s food history. From October 1999 to March 2000, two outbreaks of listeriosis were detected through this enhanced surveillance system. In outbreak 1, analysis of the food histories of cases suggested brand X “rillettes, ” a pâté-like meat product, as the vehicle of infection, and the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes was subsequently isolated from the incriminated <b>rillettes.</b> In outbreak 2, a case-control study showed that consumption of jellied pork tongue was strongly associated with infection with the outbreak strain (odds ratio = 75. 5, 95 % confidence interval: 4. 7, 1, 216. 0). However, trace-back results did not permit incrimination of any particular manufacturer of jellied pork tongue, and the outbreak strain was not isolated from the incriminated food or from any production sites. Consumption of jellied pork tongue was discouraged on epidemiologic evidence alone. The consecutive occurrence of these two outbreaks confirms the epidemic potential of listeriosis, even {{in a context of}} decreasing incidence, and underlines the importance of timely case-reporting and systematic typing of human L. monocytogenes strains to allow early detection and separate investigation of different clusters.
