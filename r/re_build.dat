The party was founded by its current President Maxwell Zeb Shumba, who once served as the Chief Political Strategist for the other opposition political party's leader Morgan Tsvangirai. [...] According to the official statement posted on the party's website, ZimFirst 's main objective is to form the next government through the electoral process, [...] National elections in Zimbabwe are slated for 2018 [...] and the party states that it will contest the presidential and parliamentary election. According to the party's manifesto primary focus of its government would be to <b>re</b> <b>build</b> the economy from an alleged US$4 billion to a [...] "near US$1,5 trillion robust economy".

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in computation of engineering flows is to derive and improve turbulence models built on turbulence physics. Here, {{we present a}} physics-based modified k-ω equation for canonical wall bounded turbulent flows (boundary layer, channel and pipe), predicting both mean velocity profile (MVP) and streamwise mean kinetic energy profile (SMKP) with high accuracy {{over a wide range}} of Reynolds number (<b>Re).</b> The result <b>builds</b> on a multi-layer quantification of wall flows, which allows a significant modification of the k-ω equation. Three innovations are introduced: First, an adjustment of the Karman constant to 0. 45 is set for the overlap region with a logarithmic MVP. Second, a wake parameter models the turbulent transport near the centerline. Third, an anomalous dissipation factor represents the effect of a meso layer in the overlap region. Then, a highly accurate (above 99 %) prediction of MVPs is obtained in Princeton pipes, improving the original model prediction by up to 10 %. Moreover, the entire SMKP, including the newly observed outer peak, is predicted. With a slight change of the wake parameter, the model also yields accurate predictions for channels and boundary layers. Comment: 22 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

By its structure NU is similar to other methods for solving multiscale elliptic problems, such as the multiscale finite element method, the multiscale mixed finite element method, the numerical subgrid upscaling method, heterogeneous multiscale method, and the multiscale finite volume method. The difference with those methods is {{in the way the}} coarse scale equation is build and solved, and in the way the fine scale solution is reconstructed. Essential components of the presented here NU approach are the formal homogenization in the coarse blocks and the usage of so called multipoint flux approximation method, MPFA.

A computer-based questionnaire was carried out among pig farmers in 1999 and 2000. Farmer plans were analysed using a multivariate probit model. The results show that farm size and life cycle are important variables explaining the probability of farmers having plans. Furthermore, risk averse farmers more frequently have plans {{to improve the quality of}} the production process, whereas farmers with a negative attitude towards biological farming search for opportunities to make a manure processing facility at their own farm. Results also reveal that most plans are significantly correlated and that the explanatory power of the model is relatively low, with the latter finding suggesting that more study is required to obtain a good understanding of strategic planning.
