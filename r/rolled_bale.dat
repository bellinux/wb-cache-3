"Thou art {{not equal}} to thy task," [...] he said, {{addressing}} {{one who was}} vainly endeavoring to <b>roll</b> a <b>bale</b> {{to the side of}} the vessel, a little apart from the rest of the busy crowd; [...] "thou wilt do better to assist the others, than to waste thy force here." ...|$|R
50|$|Originally called Pickering {{when it was}} {{established}} in 1872, the town is built on cliffs overlooking a protected bay. In 1882 a jetty was built. Wide enough to <b>roll</b> wool <b>bales</b> out to the ships, the locals came to know the jetty as Wool Bay jetty and by 1940, {{the name of the}} town had also changed to Wool Bay. For many years, the town functioned as a wool, grain and lime exporting port.|$|R

40|$|This {{feeding trial}} was to {{determine}} the effects of various field-conditioned alfalfa hays on the winter performance of heifer calves. Second-cutting alfalfa was field-conditioned or processed as follows: 1. 	Control-mowed, raked, baled. 2. 	Crushed-mowed, crushed with one smooth steel roll and a spiral-grooved rubber <b>roll,</b> raked and <b>baled...</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{found it}} {{unexpectedly}} difficult, {{for when he}} had almost dragged himself up the <b>bale</b> <b>rolled</b> over and dropped him in again; while, {{when he tried to}} wriggle up the front of it, it stood upright and then fell upon him. After several attempts he gave it up, and set out for the steamer with little pieces of barley-straw and spiky ears sticking all over him. He could swim tolerably well, and swung along comfortably enough over the smooth-backed swell, for his light clothing did not greatly cumber him. Still, he did not desire that any one beyond the Estremedura's crew should witness his arrival.|$|R
60|$|By nightfall, {{the apartments}} were {{completely}} dismantled. The furniture was all stowed away, in a vault which the Rajah had had constructed for the purpose, when the palace was rebuilt. Access was obtained to {{it through the}} floor {{in one of the}} private apartments. The floor was of tessellated marble, but some ten squares of it lifted up in a mass, forming together a trapdoor, from which steps led down into the vault. When the block was lowered again, the fit was so accurate that, after sweeping a little dust over the joint, the opening was quite imperceptible to any one not aware of the hiding place. The cushions of the divans were taken down here, as well as the furniture, and all the less valuable carpets, rugs and hangings, while the costlier articles were <b>rolled</b> up into <b>bales,</b> for transport.|$|R
5000|$|The clue where teams {{travelled}} to {{a farm in}} Grandview {{where they}} had to <b>roll</b> over several <b>bales</b> of hay until they found one that had their next clue beneath, directing them to the Beaumont Ranch where they encountered their next Roadblock, asking [...] "Who is ready to equip themselves?". The other team member rode a zip line over the ranch, {{and along the way}} would be able to see six pictures along the ground. After getting off the zip line, they had to choose from a set of pictures to find the same pictures they saw along the way {{and put them in the}} correct order in order to receive their next clue. This clue gave teams a map of Beaumont Ranch and a compass, and directed them through a series of necessary check points before they could check in at the Pit Stop at the ranch's Bell House.|$|R
40|$|Of 22 {{patients}} {{admitted to}} Plains Health Centre, Regina, from January 1979 to April 1986 with spinal injuries due to farming accidents, 7 had injuries related to tractor-mounted front-end bale loaders. In contrast, {{none of the}} 12 patients admitted with farm-related spinal injuries from 1974 through 1978 had injuries related to bale loaders. All seven injuries occurred when a front-end loader was used to move a large, round hay bale. In each case when the loader arms were raised past the horizontal plane the <b>bale</b> <b>rolled</b> back onto the unprotected tractor operator. There were five thoracic injuries, one cervical injury and one lumbar injury. All seven bony injuries healed. Four of the patients had permanent neurologic sequelae; {{two of the four}} had paraplegia. All seven patients suffered disability that impaired work performance; all five farmers suffered some loss of income. None of these injuries would have occurred if available safety equipment had been in place...|$|R
60|$|While we looked, {{the waters}} {{increased}} so fast {{in this place}} {{that in a few}} minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river, for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals. We waded knee-deep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of <b>baled</b> hay and <b>roll</b> the <b>bales</b> up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it was discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out, breast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.|$|R
5000|$|General Price had {{established}} his headquarters in Lexington {{in a bank}} building at 926 Main Street on September 18, 1861, located {{across the street from}} the Lafayette County Courthouse. During the Battle of Lexington, Price directed State Guard operations from a room on the second floor. On the following day a cannonball, probably fired from Captain Hiram Bledsoe’s State Guard Battery, struck the courthouse only about one hundred yards from General Price’s headquarters. [...] According to accounts dating from 1920, the ball did not originally lodge in the column, but fell out and was recovered by a collector. Decades after the battle the then elderly gentleman signed an affidavit with his story, and gave the cannonball to County Commissioners who had the ball screwed onto a two-foot iron rod embedded in the column for the purpose. On the evening of September 19, soldiers of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Harris's 2nd Division (State Guard) began using hemp bales seized from nearby warehouses to construct a moveable breastwork facing the Union entrenchment. These bales were all soaked in river water overnight, to render them impervious to any heated rounds fired from the Federal guns. Harris's plan was for his troops to <b>roll</b> the <b>bales</b> up the hill the following day, using them for cover as they advanced close enough to the Union garrison for a final charge. The hemp bale line started in the vicinity of the Anderson house, extending north along the hillside for about 200 yards. In many places the hemp bales were stacked two high to provide additional protection.|$|R
60|$|As we {{advanced}} up the Camiño de Chasna, a road only by name, the quintas were {{succeeded by}} brown-thatched huts, single or in clumps. On the left, 3,400 feet above sea-level, stood the Pino del Dornajito ('of the Little Trough'), {{one of the}} few survivors in this once wealthy pine-ground. The magnificent old tree, which was full grown {{in the days of the}} conquest, and which in the seventeenth century was a favourite halting-point, suffered severely from the waterspout of November 7, 1826; but still measured 130 feet long by 29 in girth. The vegetation now changed. We began brushing through the arbutus (callicarpa), the wild olive (Olea excelsa), the Canarian oak, the daphne, the myrtle entwined with indigenous ivy (Hedera canariensis); the cytisus, the bright green hypericum of three species, thyme, gallworts, and arborescent and other ferns in numbers, especially the hare's-foot and the peculiar Asplenium canariense, the Trichomanes canariensis, and the Davallia canariensis; the brezo (Erica aborea and E. scoparia), a heath whose small white bells scented the air; and the luxuriant blackberry, used to fortify the drystone walls. The dew-cloud now began to float upwards from the sea in scarf-shape, only a few hundred feet thick; it had hangings and fringes where it was caught by the rugged hill-flanks; and above us globular masses, white as cotton <b>bales,</b> <b>rolled</b> over one another. As in the drier regions of Africa the hardly risen sun made itself felt.|$|R
