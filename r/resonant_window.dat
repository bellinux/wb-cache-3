Fast energy transients, {{incident}} on the DIII-D divertors due to Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs), are eliminated using small dc currents {{in a simple}} set of non-axisymmetric coils that produce edge resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). In ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, with electron pedestal collisionalities matched to those expected in ITER a sharp <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> in the safety factor at the 95 percent normalized poloidal flux surface is observed for ELM suppression at q 95 = 3. 57 with a minimum width �q 95 of ± 0. 05. The size of this <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> has been increased {{by a factor of}} 4 in ISS plasmas by increasing the magnitude of the current in an n= 3 coil set along with the current in a separate n= 1 coil set. The resonant ELM-suppression window is highly reproducible for a given plasma shape, coil configuration and coil current but can vary with other operating conditions such as � N. Isolated resonant windows have also been found at other q 95 values when using different RMP coil configurations. For example, when the I-coil is operated in an n= 3 up-down asymmetric configuration rather than an up-down symmetric configuration a <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> is found nea...|$|E

40|$|The RF {{electric}} field {{is reduced by}} more than a factor of two using a pair of symmetrically located irises in a new type of klystron window operating in the TE 01 mode at XBand. The advantages of this window over the usual TE 01 half-wave <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> are discussed as well as theory and operating results.

INTRODUCTION RF {{electric field}} breakdown in the output window is one of the mechanisms that frequently limits the peak power that can be produced by klystrons at X-band. Conventional pillbox windows operating in the TE 11 mode in single-mode sized circular waveguide are at risk when operated above about 10 MW depending on pulse width. Thicker, sometimes larger diameter, windows have been successfully tested at SLAC to 85 MW in a resonant ring but have a history of failing in the 25 to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{scattering}} processes {{among the members of}} a rich family of kinks which arise in a (1 + 1) -dimensional relativistic two scalar field theory. These kinks carry two different topological charges that determine the mutual interactions between the basic energy lumps (extended particles) described by these topological defects. Processes like topological charge exchange, kink-antikink bound state formation or kink repulsion emerge depending on the charges of the scattered particles. Two-bounce <b>resonant</b> <b>windows</b> have been found in the antikink-kink scattering processes, but not in the kink-antikink interactions.

40|$|Determining {{the correct}} {{start for the}} late-time or <b>resonant</b> {{response}} <b>window</b> is a crucial parameter for uncooperative, resonance-based target identification by means of ultra-wideband radar. For low resonance (low-Q) targets this is particularly vital, as the processing must be set late enough to avoid including signal data caused by early-time (non-resonant) scattering, but early enough to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio for the late-time component of the target response. Without knowledge of the target 2 ̆ 7 s orientation to the incident excitation, the late-time start must be determined from the signal data alone. The spectral norm of the impulse response data matrix (Hankel matrix), examined over a sliding window, provides a robust indicator of the late-time commencement...|$|R

40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNT) have unique photo-physical properties which, {{through the}} work in this dissertation, are investigated and harnessed to produce optical sensors with unique capabilities. Early studies of the modulation of SWNT optical properties???both photoluminescence and resonance Raman scattering???demonstrate their tunable nature. Solution dispersed SWNT are sorted by length and the photoluminescence quantum yield is shown to increase nonlinearly with length, suggesting that SWNT ends quench the exciton. The change in Raman scattering cross section and <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> is mapped {{as a function of}} SWNT aggregation, as well as sonochemical effects on photoluminescence. Nanotube photoluminescence and scattering are then detected, via imaging and spectrometry, from within live murine macrophage cells, and shown to be extremely resilient, demonstrating the potential of nanotube-based molecular probes and biosensors. The work culminates in several major findings in optical sensing. We show that a nanotube-ds(GT) 15 DNA complex can detect genotoxic analytes by solvatochromism, and measure this from within live cells and tissues in real-time. We find that such optical signals can be multiplexed, resulting in analyte fingerprinting, and a bioanalyte can be detected at the single-molecule level stochastic operation of such sensors. These concepts are employed to detect, identify, and measure bioanalytes, such as reactive oxygen species, as well as explosives, such as TNT and RDX, with single-molecule sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Edge {{localized}} mode (ELM) {{control is}} a critical issue for ITER because the impulsive power loading from ELMs is predicted to limit the divertor lifetime to {{only a few hundred}} full-length pulses. Consequently, a technique that replaces the ELM-induced transport with more continuous transport while preserving the H-mode pedestal height and core performance would significantly improve the viability of ITER. One approach is to use edge resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) to enhance pedestal transport enough to reduce the pedestal pressure gradient {del}p{sub ped} below the stability limit for Type I ELMs. In DIII-D, n = 3 RMPs have been used to eliminate Type I ELMs when the edge safety factor is in the <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> q 95 {approx} 3. 5 without degrading confinement in H-modes with ITER-relevant pedestal collisionalities v*{sub e} {approx} 0. 2. The RMP reduces {del}p{sub ped} as expected, with {del}p{sub ped} controlled by the RMP amplitude. Linear peeling-ballooning (P-B) stability analysis indicates that the ELMs are suppressed by reducing {del}p{sub ped} below the P-B stability limit. The {del}p{sub ped} reduction results primarily from an increase in particle transport, not electron thermal transport. This result is inconsistent with estimates based on quasi-linear stochastic diffusion theory based on the vacuum field (no screening of the RMP). The particle transport increase is accompanied by changes in toroidal rotation, radial electric field, and density fluctuation level {tilde n} in the pedestal, suggesting increased fluctuation-driven particle transport...|$|E
40|$|A set of in-vessel {{resonant}} magnetic perturbation (RMP) coil {{has been}} recently installed in EAST. It can generate {{a range of}} spectrum, {{and there is a}} relatively large window for edge localized mode (ELM) control according to the vacuum field modeling of the edge magnetic island overlapping area. Observation of mitigation and suppression of ELM in slow rotating plasmas during the application of an n[*][*]=[*][*] 1 RMP is presented in this paper. Strong ELM mitigation effect is observed in neutral beam injection heating plasmas. The ELM frequency increases by a factor of 5, and the crash amplitude and the particle flux are effectively reduced by a similar factor. Clear density pump-out and magnetic braking effects are observed during the application of RMP. Footprint splitting is observed during ELM mitigation and agrees well with vacuum field modelling. Strong ELM mitigation happens after a second sudden drop of plasma density, which indicates the possible effect due to field penetration of the resonant harmonics near the pedestal top, where the electron perpendicular rotation becomes flat and close to zero after the application of RMP. ELM suppression is achieved in a <b>resonant</b> <b>window</b> during the scan of the n[*][*]=[*][*] 1 RMP spectrum in radio-frequency (RF) dominant heating plasmas. The best spectrum for ELM suppression is consistent with the resonant peak of RMP by taking into account of linear magnetohydrodynamics plasma response. There is no mode locking during the application of n[*][*]=[*][*] 1 RMP in ELMy H-mode plasmas, although the maximal coil current is applied...|$|E

40|$|In this report, we {{have studied}} {{exceptional}} spectra of the two-qubit quantum Rabi model in two situations. Firstly, an exceptional spectra is achieved in resonant condition, {{in which the}} frequencies of two qubit and photon field satisfy resonant relation. With transformed rotating-wave approximation (TRWA) method, the Rabi model can be mapped into the solvable formation in qubit-photon Fock states space. Based on the quantum supperconducting circuits experiment setup, the best value range of the system parameters are discussed. In the <b>resonant</b> station working <b>window,</b> the energy spectrums are calculated. Secondly, a special quasi-exact solution of two qubits Rabi model in reservoir is achieved. The algebraic structure of Hamiltonian is analyzed in the photon number space, a closed quasi-exact eigenstates space is found, and the quasi-exact solution can be clearly found from the algebraic structure of Hamiltonian.

40|$|Large Type-I edge {{localized}} modes (ELMs) {{are completely}} eliminated with small n = 3 resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) in low average triangularity, (delta) over bar = 0. 26, plasmas and in ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, delta = 0. 53, with ITER relevant collisionalities v(e) * <= 0. 2. Significant {{differences in the}} RMP requirements and in {{the properties of the}} ELM suppressed plasmas are found when comparing the two triangularities. In ISS plasmas, the current required to suppress ELMs is approximately 25 % higher than in low average triangularity plasmas. It is also found that the width of the <b>resonant</b> q(95) <b>window</b> required for ELM suppression is smaller in ISS plasmas than in low average triangularity plasmas. An analysis of the positions and widths of resonant magnetic islands across the pedestal region, in the absence of resonant field screening or a self-consistent plasma response, indicates that differences {{in the shape of the}} q profile may explain the need for higher RMP coil currents during ELM suppression in ISS plasmas. Changes in the pedestal profiles are compared for each plasma shape as well as with changes in the injected neutral beam power and the RMP amplitude. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of requirements for optimal ELM control coil designs and for establishing the physics basis needed in order to scale this approach to future burning plasma devices such as ITER...|$|R
