5000|$|A {{science fair}} {{experiment}} is generally a competition where contestants present their science project, {{results in the}} form of a <b>report,</b> <b>display</b> board, and/or models that they have created. Science fairs allow students in elementary, middle and high schools to compete in science and/or technology activities. The main motive of a science fair is for students to answer a question or task, not from a textbook but found out themselves by conducting a range of experiments and ongoing research in the short amount of time allocated to them. In order that the questions or tasks spark a true interest in the student they should be able to have an interesting, eye catching project often portrayed on a display board. Interactive display boards have a Tablet computer attached to the display board at eye-level to improve communication between student and teacher or audience. Projex Boards manufactures display boards that hold tablets. [...] Science fairs also provide a mechanism for students with intense interest in the sciences to be paired with mentors from nearby colleges and universities, so that they can access to instruction and equipment that the local schools can not provide.|$|E

This remains unchanged from 1998, when we estimated 18. 7 % of all deaths {{were due to}} smoking. Using the Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity and Economic Costs (SAMMEC 3. 0) software program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a model, Florida’s smoking-attributable deaths were calculated based on the available smoking and mortality data. In 1999, there were 162, 122 deaths to Florida residents from all causes including 79, 669 (49. 1 %) among women and 82, 446 (50. 9 %) among men. Smoking accounted for 30, 181 (18. 6 %) of these deaths. Among males, smoking accounted for 18, 685 deaths while among females, smoking accounted for 11, 496.

40|$|Caspases are {{fundamental}} {{components of the}} mammalian apoptotic machinery, but the precise contribution of individual caspases is controversial. CPP 32 (caspase 3) is a prototypical caspase that becomes activated during apoptosis. In this study, we took a comprehensive approach to examining the role of CPP 32 in apoptosis using mice, embryonic stem (ES) cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for CPP 32. CPP 32 ex 3 −/− mice have reduced viability and, consistent with an earlier <b>report,</b> <b>display</b> defective neuronal apoptosis and neurological defects. Inactivation of CPP 32 dramatically reduces apoptosis in diverse settings, including activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells, as well as chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of oncogenically transformed CPP 32 −/− MEFs. As well, the requirement for CPP 32 can be remarkably stimulus-dependent: In ES cells, CPP 32 is necessary for efficient apoptosis following UV- but not γ-irradiation. Conversely, the same stimulus can show a tissue-specific dependence on CPP 32 : Hence, TNFα treatment induces normal levels of apoptosis in CPP 32 deficient thymocytes, but defective apoptosis in oncogenically transformed MEFs. Finally, in some settings, CPP 32 is required for certain apoptotic events but not others: Select CPP 32 ex 3 −/− cell types undergoing cell death are incapable of chromatin condensation and DNA degradation, but display other hallmarks of apoptosis. Together, {{these results indicate that}} CPP 32 is an essential component in apoptotic events that is remarkably system- and stimulus-dependent. Consequently, drugs that inhibit CPP 32 may preferentially disrupt specific forms of cell death...|$|E

40|$|Water-pipe smoking (WPS) is {{the most}} {{widespread}} tobacco use in the Middle-East, and is rapidly spreading globally. Smoke from WP contains most of the compounds present in cigarette smoke, although in different proportions. WPS {{is associated with the}} risk of several human diseases; however, its impact on the early stage of normal development has not been investigated yet. Thus, in this investigation, we assess the effect of WPS on the embryo at the early stage of development. Chicken embryos at three days of incubations were used in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the outcome of WPS on angiogenesis using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryos. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was used to study the regulation of some key control genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration. Our data reveal that WPS inhibits angiogenesis of the CAM and in embryos in comparison with their matched controls; in addition, WPS-exposed embryos show slight reduction in their sizes. We also noted that around 80 % of WPS-exposed embryos die before ten days of incubation. More significantly, WPS induces up-regulations of BCL- 2, Caspase- 8, ATF- 3, INHIB-A and Cadherin 6 genes, which are important key regulators of cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration. Our data reveal, for the first time, that WPS has very toxic effects during the early stage of embryogenesis. Thus, we believe that further studies are required to elucidate the pathogenic effect of WPS on human health especially on the embryo at the early stage of its development. This investigation addresses an important gap on the outcome of WPS during the early stage of embryogenesis. Data of this study point out that WPS can have a very toxic effect on the embryo at this stage. Additionally, results from this <b>report</b> <b>display</b> {{for the first time that}} WPS can damage normal angiogenesis of the embryo thus provoking a significant number of embryonic death. Moreover, this study reveals that this effect can occur via the deregulation of several genes related to cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the three-dimensional (3 D) inversion results of surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data collected over the Hanford Site B-Complex. The {{data were collected}} in order to image the subsurface distribution of electrically conductive vadose zone contamination resulting from both planned releases of contamination into subsurface infiltration galleries (cribs, trenches, and tile fields), as well as unplanned releases from the B, BX, and BY tank farms and/or associated facilities. Electrically conductive contaminants are those which increase the ionic strength of pore fluids compared to native conditions, which comprise most types of solutes released into the subsurface B-Complex. The ERT data were collected and originally inverted as described in detail in report RPP- 34690 Rev 0., 2007, which readers should refer to for {{a detailed description of}} data collection and waste disposal history. Although the ERT imaging results presented in that report successfully delineated the footprint of vadose zone contamination in areas outside of the tank farms, imaging resolution was not optimized due to the inability of available inversion codes to optimally process the massive ERT data set collected at the site. Recognizing these limitations and the potential for enhanced ERT characterization and time-lapse imaging at contaminated sites, a joint effort was initiated in 2007 by the U. S. Department of Energy – Office of Science (DOE-SC), with later support by the Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM), and the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD), to develop a high-performance distributed memory parallel 3 D ERT inversion code capable of optimally processing large ERT data sets. The culmination of this effort was the development of E 4 D (Johnson et al., 2010, 2012) In 2012, under the Deep Vadose Zone Applied Field Research Initiative (DVZ-AFRI), the U. S. Department of Energy – Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) and CH 2 M Hill Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) commissioned an effort for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to re-invert the ERT data collected over the B-Complex using E 4 D, with the objective to improve imaging resolution and better understand the distribution of vadose zone contamination at the B-Complex. The details and results of that effort as documented in this <b>report</b> <b>display</b> a significant improvement in ERT image resolution, revealing the nature and orientation of contaminant plumes originating in former infiltration galleries and extending toward the water table. In particular, large plumes originating in the BY-Cribs area appear to have intercepted, or are close to intercepting the water table after being diverted eastward, possibly by the same low permeability unit causing perched water north of the B-Tank Farm boundary. Contaminant plumes are also evident beneath the BX-Trenches, but do not appear to have intercepted the water table. Imaging results within the tank farms themselves are highly biased by the dense network of electrically conductive tanks and dry wells, and are therefore inconclusive concerning contaminant distributions beneath tanks. However, beneath the diversion boxes, the results do reveal highly conductive anomalies that are not associated with metallic infrastructure, and may be diagnostic of extensive contamination. Overall, the parallel ERT inversion provides additional detail concerning contaminated zones in terms of conductive anomalies. These anomalies are consistent with waste disposal histories, and in several cases reveal lateral contaminant transport caused by heterogeneity within the vadose zone...|$|E
