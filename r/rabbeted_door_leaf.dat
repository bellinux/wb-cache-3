40|$|Aim: As {{door handles}} {{represent}} a transmission route for viruses and micro-organisms, a door {{opening and closing}} mechanism should be developed without manual operation. Method: To solve the problem, a device for opening {{the door with the}} help of a foot pedal was built into the <b>door</b> <b>leaf.</b> Results: The design enables mechanical opening of the door with a foot pedal without manual operation. Subsequently, the door closes {{with the help of a}} mechanical locking mechanism. Discussion: The foot-operated door opener constitutes an additional option to the door handle. Together with the equipment of a soft closing mechanism, it is possible to prevent noise emanating from the door latch impinging on the door frame. Using this construction, the door handle as a transmission vector is eliminated. In addition, the transport of goods held with two hands simultaneously is facilitated. Conclusion: With a foot-operated door opener instead of the traditional manual door handle, it is possible to open doors with a foot pedal.

50|$|The Forum at {{the present}} Meienbergstrasse lane hosted on its eastern side (Rütistrasse) a stone with two {{distinctive}} front pillars. The forum was accessible by a wide staircase and by a double door to the main room. The foundations are rreserved, {{as well as the}} pivots of the <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> and the locking hole. Due to its central location and the front pillars, the building may also interpreted as a temple. The front of the large square was completed by symmetrical lateral walls. To the west of the plant, there was another stone building with columns, maybe uses as a Curia or temple.Public institutions, such as the spas, are suspected at the area of the present cemetery at the St. Ursula church, and a walled temple precinct with two Gallo-Roman temples, a fire altar and two chapels on the northwest of the settlement at the Seewiese area, then the edge of the settlement on Kempratnerbucht. On the exit road (Rütistrasse-Rebacker) towards Vitudurum, a digger fire field with around 50 burials archaeologically was recorded.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The article takes a gate as {{an example}} for {{studying}} the collecting，switching and using of the discontinuous mechanical energy created by opening and closing a gate. Firstly, we can generate power by mechanical energy created {{during the process of}} pulling and pushing a gate through devices which can collect mechanical energy and transform power. Then we'll store the power in the nickel-metal hydride batteries after rectifying and boosting for supporting power for counting device. This device can generate power for counting devices by mechanical energy which is seemingly useless in our normal life. It can save energyconsumption but cater to the idea of energy conservation and emission reduction. Foreword Generally, a door refers to the alleyway of a building or the device installed in the passageway. In normal life, people of high life-pace will be in and out of doors many times everyday. Most of the doors are equipped with a switch device-the doors in common sense. Although the alleyways in public spaces are using electric doors, most of the interior doors are opened flat rotaries which are still need to be manually pushed. Energy generated in the opening and closing process that people act on the <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> is wasted in the rotation of the sash or even the damper installed by the sash. This sort o...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a part of the course MSGC 17 for Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering. The course were held at the University of Karlstad. The project was {{performed}} on behalf of a company that manufactures doors. The purpose of the project was to develope a door closing device. The closing device were supposed to be innovative and have an aesthetically pleasing design, since this was lacking in current products. The work resulted in a design proposal for a doorcloser which is recessed in the <b>door</b> <b>leaf.</b> This type of mounting results in a aesthetically pleasing design since it is not visible at all. This result were achieved through the use of the product development process according to Johannesson et al. (2013). This process included a plan for the project, prestudy, concept generation, evaluation and selection, layout design and prototyping. The prestudy was an important part of the project. This part led to many innovative ideas that could be brought into the concept generation phase. The final design proposal was inspired by a cord retractor from a vacuum cleaner. When the design proposal was developed a prototype were made as a final part of the project. The task of the prototype was to show the function of the structure in a simple way. The conclusion to be drawn is that the generated construction meets the requirements of the specification. Further work after this project will be to produce a prototype in full scale for different types of tests...|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} have a natural curiosity and have not yet learned to avoid and get away from danger. It is often necessary to take measures {{to protect children from}} hazards. Parents buy protective products to avoid or decrease risks in their own and their children’s lives. Different kinds of protective products, including finger protection, are also common in nurseries, hospitals and other institutions. When a finger protection is bought and installed this gives the consumer a greater sense of security. It is vital that reality agrees with this sense. Otherwise the risk of injury may in fact increase, since a sense of security in the parent/supervisor often implies less supervision. It is therefore important to make sure that protective products on the market are safe and that they give the protection they were designed to give. This report presents a background study including injury statistics and discusses the hazards as well as methods of prevention/protection. Finger protection devices are divided into categories based on their protection method. Reasonable requirements, based on children’s characteristics and abilities, and ways to test these are discussed. Finally, suggestions of requirements and test methods are presented in the form of complete product standards for the different kinds of finger protection. ‘Finger protection’ in this report refers to protective devices designed to prevent crushing injuries between <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> and <b>door</b> frame. This report deals only with non-integrated finger protection for inner doors, i. e. devices which are mounted onto an existing inner door. Currently there is no European standard regulating this kind of products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} blast-resist-door were used widely. In order {{to know the}} {{behavior}} of the doors under blast load and verify the safety of the doors, dynamic finite element analysis and simulation are carried out with advanced FEA software, ANSYS/LS-DYNA and SAP. Contact surfaces are introduced to simulate the relation between the <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> and doorframe, as well as the relation between the door hinges and bearings. Altogether 24 different load cases are analyzed to simulate various load conditions. For example, the difference between conventional explosive blast load and nuclear blast load are compared. Different doorframes are also discussed. And blasts that are much larger than the designed ones are analyzed to obtain the damage process of the doors and to get the safety margin to the original design. From the numerical computations, some special results are obtained, which are difficult from static analysis. For instant, the damage process shows that even if there is very large plastic strain in the door, the door may still be safe. So traditional allowable stress design method may be uneconomical. However, the numerical result also shows that the most dangerous situation for the door hinges does not consisted with designer's imagine, which means the original hinge design may be unsafe. Following conclusions are obtained from the whole simulation: (1) traditional static or quasi-static analysis has some limits in these special structures; (2) dynamic FEA is a cheap and convenient method for these structures; (3) contact analysis is important for dynamic simulation...|$|R

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} lock {{was invented}} by Walter Schlage in 1923. The bored cylindrical lock arose from {{a need for a}} more cost-effective method of locking doors. The previous norm, the mortise lock, is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the mortise lock has a larger lock case, a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the mortise lock may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the mortise lock may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob. The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface <b>rabbet,</b> which simplified <b>door</b> preparation compared to a mortise lock.|$|R
50|$|Its {{principal}} (Russell Street) elevation is a symmetrical tripartite {{composition of}} dark red face brickwork dressed with contrasting painted cement Classical details. The central main entry is articulated with rendered architraves and flanking rusticated pilasters that extend the full {{height of the}} building to meet the parapet. The entry double door leaves have been replaced with modern glazed aluminium framed leaves. Above the main entry, a cantilevered concrete balcony with large decorative console brackets and a wrought iron balustrade doubles as an entry awning. Above the balcony, a glazed arch-headed aperture with rendered architrave extends to the underside of a rendered frieze below the parapet. Its detailed glazing pattern includes multi-paned margins (some panes fitted with coloured leadlights), three sashes and a <b>door</b> <b>leaf</b> (opening off the stair half landing within). The outer sections of the facade beyond the rusticated pilasters mirror each other. At ground level, walls are rendered and include a centrally placed single door and fanlight flanked by double hung sash windows. Above, smaller highlights align with {{the top of a}} heavy masonry transom. Physical evidence including decorative suspension rod brackets and cover flashings confirms the location of proposed awnings abutting these transoms. Window and fanlight sashes are original, but the door openings have been fitted with modern aluminium framed glazed leaves. Cantilevered balconies at first floor level are decorated to match the central balcony. Above the balconies, walls are finished in face brick with a rendered frieze decorated with widely spaced rosettes. French doors with fanlights are centrally placed and flanked by double hung sashes. Door leaves and upper sashes are multi paned. The elevation is crowned by a stepped rendered parapet decorated with cornices, consoles, and a central pediment.|$|R
