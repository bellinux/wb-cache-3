5|$|In February 1990, the Pittston Coal Company and the UMWA {{came to a}} settlement. The current miners of Pittston {{would receive}} health and <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> once again. Pittston Coal Company also had to pay around $10million for the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> plan for pre-1974 miners. In return Pittston was {{permitted}} to operate {{seven days a week}} {{as long as they were}} closed from 8am–4pm on Sundays. Miners were also put on a rotating schedule where every 28 days they would work one week for 4 days, 10 hours each day.|$|E

5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and coal production was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Commerce (MCOM) at Strathmore UniversityThe main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate determinants on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes in Kenya. The specific objectives were: to establish the effect of determinants on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes in Kenya and to investigate the perception of stakeholders regarding determinants on the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes in Kenya. This study used quantitative design to determine the financial performance relationship with determinants of performance. The population for this study were the 1262 <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes registered with the <b>Retirement</b> <b>Benefit</b> Authority, RBA by close of 2013. Simple random sampling was used and Fishers formula was used to come up with sample size of 48 private pension funds. The study used primary and secondary data. The secondary data is quantitative in nature and was collected from the annual financial statements of the pension funds. Primary data was both qualitative and quantitative in nature and was collected using questionnaires. The study findings revealed that age of contributors, leverage of fund, contributions received, fixed income investment, equity investment, offshore investment, fund liquidity does not have an influence on the financial performance of retirement schemes. The study recommended that future studies focus on corporate governance practices as determinants of the financial performance of <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> schemes in Kenya...|$|R
5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and <b>retirement</b> <b>benefits</b> for its workers.|$|E

Every employer in the United States who has the <b>retirement</b> <b>benefit</b> plan mandatorily follows the IRS rules and regulations while preparing the report. As a part of maintaining the rules and regulations the employer has to prepare the allocation report and fill up the form 5500. As TPA (Third Party Administrator) this company’s responsibility is to prepare the allocation Report and prepare the Allocation Letter on behalf of the client.
