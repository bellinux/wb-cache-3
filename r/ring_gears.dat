25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun gear which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is the ring gear or annulus.|$|E
500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central axle, the arms swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{considers}} geometrical {{parameters of}} a <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> for a wave gear with rolling elements. A coordinate system is selected. Parametric equations for the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> profile are deduced. An equation for rounded {{edges of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is developed to increase the transmission efficiency and shorten the <b>ring</b> <b>gear's</b> running-in period. An epicycloidal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> profile is plotted in AutoCad. A sample model produced from these calculations is shown. The product is intended {{for use in the}} design of a hand-held electric drill on the base of a commutator motor with useful capacity of 1 kW...|$|R
5000|$|This {{rotation}} of the planet gears can in turn drive the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (not depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has N teeth, then the ring will rotate by N/N turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} of the carrier of a spur gear differential is {{the average of the}} angular velocities of the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of a <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
30|$|The typical {{vibration}} modes also {{arise if}} the elastic components {{such as the}} thin <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are considered [11, 12]. Wu and Parker [11] examined the PGT with elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and identified the rigid-elastic vibration modes, and later Parker and Wu [12] proved the vibration modes of the PGT with unequally-spaced planets and elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Tanna and Lim [15, 16] examined the <b>ring</b> <b>gear’s</b> free vibration and proved the elastic vibration modes, including in-plane extensional, radial inextensional, out-of-plane bending, and torsional deformations. It seems that similar modes to those in Refs. [11, 12] can be found for the helical planetary <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> even when considering various deformations owing to the symmetries. However, {{it could be a}} challenge to develop an analytical model incorporating many deformations. Even so, the theoretical analysis is another difficulty to be overcome.|$|R

Invented by Snap-on Incorporated, composite <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has been already successfully applied to mechanical engineering area. More specifically Snap-on is producing a gear mechanical system commonly known as ratchet wrench handle, which incorporates Snap-on composite <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> as the key element of the system.|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, {{a special}} {{variation}} of epicyclic gearing {{was developed for}} portable radar gear, where a very high reduction ratio in a small package was needed. This had two outer <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> each half {{the thickness of the}} other gears. One of these two <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> was held fixed and had one tooth fewer than did the other. Therefore, several turns of the [...] "sun" [...] gear made the [...] "planet" [...] gears complete a single revolution, which in turn made the rotating ring gear rotate by a single tooth like a Cycloidal drive.|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the speed}} ratios {{available}} to a simple planetary gear train {{can be obtained by}} using band brakes to hold and release the carrier, sun or <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> as needed. This provides the basic structure for an automatic transmission.|$|E

5000|$|The {{combination}} of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a sun <b>gear</b> and a <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> {{is called a}} planetary gear train. [...] In this case, the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is usually fixed and the sun gear is driven.|$|R
40|$|The {{strain of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> can reflect the dynamic {{characteristics}} of planetary gearboxes directly, which makes it an ideal signal to monitor the health condition of the gearbox. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods, a new approach for the dynamic measurement of <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the installation of FBGs is determined according to the analysis for the strain distribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Secondly, {{the parameters of the}} FBG are determined in consideration of the accuracy and sensitivity of the measurement as well as the size of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The strain measured by the FBG is then simulated under non-uniform strain field conditions. Thirdly, a dynamic measurement system is built and tested. Finally, the strains of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are measured in a planetary gearbox under normal and faulty conditions. The experimental results showed good agreement with the theoretical results in values, trends, and the fault features {{can be seen from the}} time domain of the measured strain signal, which proves that the proposed method is feasible for the measurement of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains of planetary gearboxes...|$|R

50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R
40|$|A new rotary {{actuator}} is reported {{that consists of}} a motor functionally integrated with the transmission of a <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in a single element which {{is driven by the}} rotating magnetic vector in the stator. Because the number of teeth on the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is different from that on the fixed ground <b>gear,</b> the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> rotates at a fraction of a revolution and simultaneously rotates the output gear in one eccentric cycle in the opposite direction. The advantages of the design are that only two bearings are required on a low speed output shaft...|$|R

50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|E
50|$|The {{recirculating}} type {{of planetary}} roller screw {{is also known}} as a recycling roller screw. A recirculating roller screw can provide a very high degree of positional accuracy by using minimal thread leads. The rollers of a recirculating roller screw move axially within the nut until being reset after one orbit about the screw. Recirculating roller screws do not employ <b>ring</b> <b>gears.</b> Carl Bruno Strandgren was awarded a US Patent for the recirculating roller screw in 1965.|$|E
40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on the outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun <b>gear,</b> the outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> the speeder gear, and the inner <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R

50|$|The Ravigneaux {{improves}} upon earlier planetary automobile transmissions, {{such as the}} Simpson, {{which has}} two complete planetary gearsets. As originally invented, the Ravigneaux puts two planetary gear trains on a single planet carrier. It has two sun gears, two <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> and two sets of planet gears on a single carrier. Using a single carrier makes the Ravigneaux smaller, lighter, and less expensive to make, because the carrier is usually {{the largest and most}} expensive part of a planetary gearset.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{drawback}} to the Bendix drive {{is that it}} relies on {{a certain amount of}} [...] "clash" [...] between the teeth of the pinion and the <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> before they slip into place and mate completely; the teeth of the pinion are already spinning when they come into contact with the static ring gear, and unless they happen to align perfectly at the moment they engage, the pinion teeth will strike the teeth of the ring gear side-to-side rather than face-to-face, and continue to rotate until both align. This increases wear on both sets of teeth. For this reason the Bendix drive has been largely superseded in starter motor design by the pre-engagement system using a solenoid.|$|E
40|$|Phase-oriented gear {{systems are}} {{differential}} planetary transmissions {{in which each}} planet gear has two sets of unequal numbers of teeth indexed at prescribed relative angles (phases). The figure illustrates an application of the phase-oriented gearing concept to a relatively simple speed-reducing differential planetary transmission that includes a sun gear, an idler gear, three identical planet gears, a ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Typically, the ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> have different numbers of teeth, giving rise to a progressive and periodic phase shift between the corresponding pairs of teeth engaged by each successive planet gear. To accommodate this phase shift, {{it is necessary to}} introduce a compensating phase shift between the ground-gear-engaging and output-gearengaging sections of each planet gear. This is done by individually orienting each planet gea...|$|R

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R
