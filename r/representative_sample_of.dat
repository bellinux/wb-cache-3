5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the probability distribution in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

30|$|Representativeness of {{immigrant}} samples: despite their public availability, {{a good many}} survey data on immigrants have a significant flaw. As has become clear from the observations above, with few significant exceptions, most of these data come from surveys based on <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the general population. In addition to including comparatively few immigrants (and their children), these general population samples do not produce <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> the immigrant population in the respective countries.|$|R

The results indicated a shift in women’s perceptions about work–life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain balance due to the competing pressures at work and demands at home.|$|E

The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|Inventory flows can {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care {{has to be taken}} to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.|$|E
25|$|Most ETFs are {{index funds}} {{that attempt to}} {{replicate}} {{the performance of a}} specific index. Indexes may be based on stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. An index fund seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the securities in the index. As of June 2012, in the United States, about 1200 index ETFs exist, with about 50 actively managed ETFs. Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs. Some index ETFs, known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the daily performance of the index.|$|E

25|$|The affinities of the Pronophilina {{to other}} species {{groups within the}} specious Satyrinae suggest {{different}} interpretations about its origin. Viloria reviewed morphological characters and separated three groups that might have different phylogenetic and biogeographic affinities: a major group of 39 true Neotropical Pronophilina, including the genus Calisto with a Caribbean distribution, eight genera related to the Holarctic Erebiina, and 19 genera which he placed as Neotropical representatives of the otherwise Australasian Hypocystina. This grouping would suggest an amphi-Pacific distribution of the Hypocystina, and imply a Gondwanan origin according to a panbiogegraphic interpretations. This hypothesis was rebutted after a large phylogenetic analysis of the Satyrinae recovered a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> pronophiline genera as a monophyletic group, and suggested a completely Neotropical, or at least, a common origin for the group. However, the relationships of the group remain unresolved, as subsequent work has found {{that at least two}} genera – Eretris, and the Caribbean Calisto—might be closer related to Holarctic Satyrines, but larger taxonomic sampling and a better integration of molecular and morphological data is needed to rule out analytical artifacts.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a nationally <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E

500|$|Rare {{began work}} on Rare Replay in 2014 as a 30th anniversary celebration. The company wanted to do {{something}} unique for what they considered a rare milestone in the industry. Rare was also influenced by community requests to bring their classics to Xbox One, and by the Microsoft backward-compatibility team's progress on the feature. The compilation was one of several celebration ideas, but once it was chosen, the [...] "30 years" [...] theme led to the 30 game limit and [...] price point. As reflective of the company's character and celebratory theme, Rare chose a papercraft art style and theatrical stage setting for the compilation. Rare Replay became part of Rare's plan to simultaneously celebrate its past and introduce its future with a logo redesign, new website, and announcement of their upcoming game, Sea of Thieves. To select the final 30 games, Rare sorted through 120 games in their catalog. They rated each title for fitness and prioritized those that featured characters and environments original to the company, choosing to exclude those based on licensed intellectual properties. Secondarily, Rare considered whether licenses were available and whether a title remained fun and playable by modern standards. They wanted a wide and <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> [...] "popular games that would hit that nostalgic beat that everyone likes". Rare chose the Nintendo 64 Conker's Bad Fur Day over the Xbox version (Conker: Live & Reloaded) because they felt the latter had strayed too far from the original. While Rare Replay designers made the final call, other Rare employees and veterans gave input and recollected old game development stories.|$|E
500|$|The Hugo Award {{is highly}} {{regarded}} by observers. The Los Angeles Times has termed it [...] "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing", a claim echoed by Wired, {{who said that}} it was [...] "the premier award in the science fiction genre". Justine Larbalestier, in The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction (2002), referred to the awards as [...] "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards", and Jo Walton, writing for Tor.com, said it was [...] "undoubtedly science fiction's premier award". The Guardian similarly acknowledged it as [...] "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" [...] as well as [...] "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" [...] science fiction awards [...] "in existence". James Gunn, in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1988), echoed The Guardians statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that [...] "because of its broad electorate" [...] the Hugos were the awards most representative of [...] "reader popularity". Camille Bacon-Smith, in Science Fiction Culture (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as The Demolished Man or The Left Hand of Darkness. The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final ballot, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes. The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes.
