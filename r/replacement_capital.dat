40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to shed light}} on the “information technology productivity paradox”. Employing a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms we compute ICT marginal productivity across different cluster of firms and the impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on output growth. Following Yorukoglu’s (1998) vintage capital idea, in which ICT is associated with consistent learning-by-doing effect, we explore whether firm capital replacement/introduction behaviour and firm’s technological investment aptitude have any role in explaining ICT productivity. We find that low <b>capital</b> <b>replacement</b> (high <b>capital</b> introduction) yields to sensibly greater ICT marginal revenues compared to high <b>replacement</b> (low <b>capital</b> introduction). However, what really matters in explaining ICT productivity is the level of innovation the new capital embodies. In fact, for non-innovative firms the ICT paradox is far less consistent. This strongly suggests the existence of learning by doing effects. In terms of growth contribution we find that ICT have an impact disproportionately wide compared to the share in total investment they represent. growth, investment behaviour, information and communication technologies, productivity, replacement...|$|R

50|$|A very {{well-known}} {{theory that}} describes how fluctuating stock prices affect the aggregate economy is Tobin's q theory. Tobin’s q {{is defined as the}} total market value of firms divided by the <b>replacement</b> cost of <b>capital.</b> This means that if q > 1, the market price of the firm is higher than the <b>replacement</b> cost of <b>capital</b> and new plant equipment is cheap compared to the market value of firms. Under these circumstances, firms can issue stocks and get a high price for it, relatively to what it costs to buy the facilities and equipment that they need. As a result, investment spending will rise and firms buy this new equipment with only a small issue of stocks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which a good {{is made up of}} two parts, and each part asts one or two periods, with known probabilities. The analysis includes consumer decisions regarding part replacement, as well as profit maximization under monopoly and oligipoly. It is found that firms have incentives to supply all part for replacement, rather than force the consumer to replace the entire good when a single part is needed. In oligopoly, the non-collusive equilibrium when parts are not compatible acress brands involves pricing entire goods below marginal cost and individual parts above marginal cost. The paper also puts forward a testable hypothesis about the auto parts market, namely that the emergence of generic auto parts in the 1980 s and 1990 s may have not only driven down the prices of parts with which they competed, but also driven up the prices of other parts. <b>replacement</b> parts, <b>capital</b> <b>replacement,</b> aftermarkets, compatibility, antitrust. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} <b>capital</b> <b>replacement</b> under uncertainty of energy costs. Adjustment delays in the <b>replacement</b> of energy-intensive <b>capital</b> follow from two fundamentals in the problem: uncertainty and Ricardian rents in the existing cap-ital structure. They imply a simple dichotomy where short-run output contracts, but the long-run output recovers and increases above the initial output, despite the increasing energy costs. To provide a quantitative assessment of the consumer price increase needed for the replacement, adjustment delays, and policies expe-diting the change, the model is calibrated using electricity market data. We find that a market-driven large scale entry of green energy requires unprecedented en-ergy cost and consumer price increases mainly due to rents of the existing capital.
