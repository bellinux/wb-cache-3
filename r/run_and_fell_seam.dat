6000|$|The wretched man, already partly sobered, {{did as he}} was told, and in {{the same}} breath of time leaped to his feet. [...] "Down staysail!" [...] he trumpeted. The hands were thrilling for the order, and the great sail came with a <b>run,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> half {{overboard}} among the racing foam. [...] "Jib top-sail halyards! Let the stays'l be," [...] he said again.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{opens and}} closes with {{philosophical}} bookends, with the Gospel illuminating the center. The first atmospheric piano notes of [...] "All for Your Glory" [...] commence {{the tale of}} creation, the fall of man, and, ultimately, God's victory and our enduring purpose. Papa masterfully composes grand precepts in dramatic and emotional terms. [...] "We <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> into darkness / But all the rage of our sin could not frustrate / Your dream of grace." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, due to {{the album}} title track's quick release as a single (it debuted on the Hot 100 at #40 in the same week that [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" [...] hit number one), the duet had a {{relatively}} short chart <b>run</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> {{out of the top}} 40 just five weeks after topping the chart, spending a total of 11 weeks in the top 40. Billboard ranked it as #43 on the year-end Hot 100 chart for 1987.|$|R
60|$|The other soldier, {{when he saw}} his two comrades struck, {{fired his}} pistol also, and wounded some other person in the crowd. He then {{attempted}} to make his escape back towards the barracks, but he was tripped up violently as he attempted to <b>run,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> on his face on the pavement. The unfortunate trio were finally made prisoners of; they were disarmed, their hands bound together, and then left under a strong guard in the cow-house attached to the auberge.|$|R
50|$|MacKenzie {{enjoyed a}} superb {{run in the}} 2006 UK Championship with wins over Dene O'Kane and Tom Ford in the qualifiers which set up a last 48 meeting with Michael Holt whom he {{defeated}} 9-0. He then played reigning world champion Graeme Dott in his first appearance in a televised match. MacKenzie's journey ended there as Dott ran out a 9-2 winner. The remainder of the season was a disappointment, however, as {{he was unable to}} repeat that <b>run</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> three places in the rankings to world number 63.|$|R

5000|$|The miracle {{took place}} when Jesus {{went across the}} lake {{to the land of}} the Gerasenes (or Gadarenes), the modern Jerash in Jordan. There a man possessed by an evil spirit came from the caves to meet him. No one could bind this man anymore, not even with a chain, for no one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. When he saw Jesus from a distance, he <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> on his knees in front of him. He shouted at the top of his voice, [...] "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!" [...] For Jesus had said to him, [...] "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 2. As Jesus Christ hath his eye upon, so he hath {{his heart}} open to receive, the coming sinner. This is {{verified}} by the text: [...] "And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." [...] This is also discovered by his preparing of the way, in his making of it easy (as may be) to the coming sinner; which preparation is manifest by those blessed words, [...] "I will in no wise cast out;" [...] of which more {{when we come}} to the place. And while [...] "he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, and had compassion, <b>and</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> on his neck, and kissed him" [...] (Luke 15:20). All these expressions do strongly prove that the heart of Christ is open to receive the coming sinner.|$|R
60|$|For {{a single}} instant {{she turned her}} set face to the window with a sudden convulsive movement, as if she would have called him back, {{but at the same}} moment the {{opposite}} door creaked and her brother slipped into the room. Whether a quick memory of the deserter's entrance at that door a year ago had crossed her mind, whether there was some strange suggestion in his mud-stained garments and weak deprecating smile, or whether it was the outcome of some desperate struggle within her, there was that in her face that changed his smile into a frightened cry for pardon, as he <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> on his knees at her feet. But even as he did so her stern look vanished, and with her arm around him she bent over him and mingled her tears with his.|$|R
50|$|Anderson {{won four}} Chicago city volleyball titles at Morgan Park High School. She started running {{at the age}} of six in the streets against boys. She was {{recruited}} to <b>run</b> summer track <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> in love with the sport.|$|R

60|$|Whitney {{scrambled}} forward, {{and when}} he let go the halyard he dropped on hands and knees. The straining sail would not run down the wire to which it was fastened, and he must cross the narrow deck to free it. He {{did not want to}} go; for the Rowan buried her bows as she plunged, and the foam boiled over them a foot in depth; but the whitening of the sea to windward showed that a savage squall was on its way. He reached the inboard end of the bowsprit and held fast while a comber washed across the rail, and then, rising half upright, he seized the line that hung from the head of the sail. The loosened canvas thrashed him; he was swung to and fro, in danger of going overboard; but he held on until the sail came down with a <b>run</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> on to his knees.|$|R
60|$|Then, awkwardly, uncertainly, {{he began}} to <b>run.</b> He {{stumbled}} <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>and</b> rolled a short distance {{down the side of}} the hill. Desperately, he struggled to hold onto the ground. His hands dug wildly, futilely, into the soft soil, trying to keep the generator under his arm at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|On July 15, 2016, Taylor hit {{his first}} major league career home run, a grand slam, off of Silvino Bracho of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He also had a double, a triple, drove in six <b>runs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> just short of hitting for the cycle. He was the third Dodgers player in history to have his first career homer be a grand slam (Preston Ward in 1948 and Chico Fernández in 1956) and the third Dodgers second baseman {{to have at least}} six RBI in a game (Billy Herman in 1943 and Jackie Robinson in 1949). He played in 34 games for the Dodgers, hitting [...]207. Taylor did not make the club out of spring {{training}} and was assigned to Oklahoma City to begin the 2017 season.He was recalled to the Dodgers on April 19, 2017 [...] On July 6, 2017 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Taylor hit his first career walk-off hit, driving in Logan Forsythe to win the game 5-4.|$|R
6000|$|Presently a wild Arab {{in charge}} of a camel train {{recognized}} an old friend in Ferguson, <b>and</b> they <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> upon each other's necks and kissed each other's grimy, bearded faces upon both cheeks. It explained instantly a something which had always seemed to me only a farfetched Oriental figure of speech. I refer to the circumstance of Christ's rebuking a Pharisee, or some such character, and reminding him that from him he had received no [...] "kiss of welcome." [...] It did not seem reasonable to me that men should kiss each other, but I am aware, now, that they did. There was reason in it, too. The custom was natural and proper; because people must kiss, and a man would not be likely to kiss one of the women of this country of his own free will and accord. One must travel, to learn. Every day, now, old Scriptural phrases that never possessed any significance for me before, take to themselves a meaning.|$|R
60|$|Bang! went Shep's shotgun, and crack! {{came the}} sharp report of Whopper's rifle.

The {{tourists}} took a number of quick wickets early on the third day but a partnership of 95 for the last wicket in 50 minutes left them a target of 243.

Ajmer could never capitalise over the required <b>Run</b> Rate <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> short by 10 runs with help of a great all-around bowling performance from bowlers of Kota Chambal Tigers.

This sword, Hector's gift, Aias took, and went towards the hut of Ulysses, meaning to carve him limb from limb, for madness had come upon him in his great grief. Rushing through the night to slay Ulysses he fell upon the flock of sheep that the Greeks kept for their meat. And up and down among them he went, smiting blindly till the dawn came, and, lo! his senses returned to him, and he {{saw that he had}} not smitten Ulysses, but stood {{in a pool of blood}} among the sheep that he had slain. He could not endure the disgrace of his madness, and he fixed the sword, Hector's gift, with its hilt firmly in the ground, and went back a little way, <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> upon the sword, which pierced his heart, and so died the great Aias, choosing death before a dishonoured life.|$|R
