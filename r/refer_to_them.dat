5|$|The white-winged fairywren {{was often}} {{referred}} to as the blue-and-white wren, and early observers, such as Norman Favaloro of Victoria, <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> by this name. However, like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is unrelated to the true wren (family Troglodytidae). It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, and later as a member of the warbler family Sylviidae, before they were placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas {{was born}} in Seville in 1484, on 11 November. For centuries, Las Casas's birthdate was {{believed}} to be 1474; however, in the 1970s, scholars conducting archival work demonstrated this to be an error, after uncovering in the Archivo General de Indias records of a contemporary lawsuit that demonstrated he was born a decade later than had been supposed. Subsequent biographers and authors have generally accepted and reflected this revision. His father, Pedro de las Casas, a merchant, descended from one of the families that had migrated from France to found the town of Seville; his family also spelled the name Casaus. According to one biographer, his family were of converso heritage, although others <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as ancient Christians who migrated from France. Following the testimony of Las Casas's biographer Antonio de Remesal, tradition has it that Las Casas studied a licentiate at Salamanca, but this is never mentioned in Las Casas's own writings. As a young man, in 1507, he journeyed to Rome where he observed the Festival of Flutes.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{instrument}} of Cuman political success was military force, which dominated {{each of the}} warring Balkan factions. Groups of the Cumans settled and mingled with the local population in regions of the Balkans, and Cuman settlers founded three successive Bulgarian dynasties (Asenids, Terterids, and Shishmanids) and the Wallachian dynasty (Basarabids); however, {{in the cases of}} the Basarab and Asenid dynasties, medieval documents <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as Vlach dynasties.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth in}} foreign trade allowed for other transformations in society. In housing, new pieces of {{furniture}} were introduced and Portuguese words borrowed to <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> such as kadéra for chair from Portuguese cadeira, mejang for table from Portuguese mesa, and jandéla for window from Portuguese janela. The split bamboo floors of noble houses were increasingly replaced by wooden floors. Western games such as ombre and dice began to spread as well. New World crops such as maize, sweet potato, and tobacco were all successfully propagated, while upper-class women abandoned toplessness.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people are}} often nude {{in the privacy of}} their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists {{normally}} <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.|$|E
25|$|Balancing robots {{generally}} use a gyroscope {{to detect}} {{how much a}} robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum.

While the Segway is not commonly {{thought of as a}} robot, it {{can be thought of as}} a component of a robot, when used as such Segway <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform).

25|$|Repeated interviews, written tests, medical examinations, {{physical}} fitness tests, comprehensive background investigations, fingerprinting, drug testing, a police oral board interview, a polygraph examination and consultation with a psychologist are common practices used {{to review the}} suitability of candidates. Recruiting in most departments is competitive, with more suitable and desirable candidates accepted over lesser ones, and failure to meet some minimum standards disqualifying a candidate entirely. Police oral boards are the most subjective {{part of the process}} and often disqualifies the biggest portion of qualified candidates. Departments maintain records of past applicants under review, and <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in the case of either reapplication or requests between other agencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{high profile}} {{and demand for}} a {{high-quality}} local translation means that {{a great deal of}} care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained {{about the quality of the}} first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were quite well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. Golyshev was previously best known for having translated William Faulkner and George Orwell, and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as inferior literature. The Turkish translation of books two to five was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.|$|E
