6000|$|It {{is part of}} the sordid prose of the Mont Cenis road that, {{unlike those}} fine old {{unimproved}} passes, the Simplon, the Spl√ºgen and--yet awhile longer--the Saint-Gothard, it denies you a glimpse of that paradise adorned by the four lakes even as that of uncommented Scripture by the rivers of Eden. I made, however, an excursion to the Lake of Como, which, though brief, lasted long enough to suggest to me that I too was a hero of romance with leisure for a love-affair, and not a hurrying tourist with a Bradshaw in his pocket. The Lake of Como has figured largely in novels of [...] "immoral" [...] tendency--being commonly the spot to which inflamed young gentlemen invite the wives of other gentlemen to fly with them and ignore the restrictions of public opinion. But even the Lake of Como has been revised and improved; the fondest prejudices yield to time; it gives one somehow a sense of an aspiringly high tone. I should pay a poor compliment at least to the swarming inmates of the hotels which now alternate attractively by the water-side with villas old and new were I to read the appearances more cynically. But if it is lost to florid fiction it still presents its blue bosom to most other refined uses, and the unsophisticated tourist, the American at least, may do any amount of private romancing there. The pretty hotel at Cadenabbia offers him, for instance, in the most elegant and assured form, the so often precarious adventure of what he calls at home summer board. It is all so unreal, so fictitious, so elegant and idle, so framed to undermine a rigid sense of the chief end of man not being to float for ever in an ornamental boat, beneath an awning tasselled like a circus-horse, impelled by an affable Giovanni or Antonio from one stately stretch of lake-laved villa steps to another, that departure seems as harsh and unnatural as the dream-dispelling note of some punctual voice at your bedside on a dusky winter morning. Yet I wondered, for my own part, where I had seen it all before--the pink-walled villas gleaming through their shrubberies of orange and oleander, the mountains shimmering in the hazy light like so many breasts of doves, the constant presence of the melodious Italian voice. Where indeed but at the Opera when the manager has been more than usually regardless of expense? Here in the foreground was the palace of the nefarious barytone, with its banqueting-hall opening as freely on the stage as a <b>railway</b> <b>buffet</b> on the platform; beyond, the delightful back scene, with its operatic gamut of colouring; in the middle the scarlet-sashed barcaiuoli, grouped like a chorus, hat in hand, awaiting the conductor's signal. It was better even than being in a novel- -this being, this fairly wallowing, in a libretto.|$|E

In an introduction to the broadcast, John Tydeman, then head of Radio 4 drama, and the producer of 27 of Adrian's plays, paid tribute to the author [...] - [...] referring to him as [...] "one of the great unknown British playwrights ... very much a language man rather than a man who used whizzy, 'show-offy' radio." ...|$|E

It {{seemed to me that}} this was a scene in which I was not on. I sidled to the door, and slid forth. They didn't notice me. My experience is that nobody ever does--much.|$|R
50|$|The Class 101 {{was one of}} {{the largest}} classes of first-generation DMUs and, partly thanks to their {{relatively}} late withdrawal from revenue-earning service, numerous vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways, including the Great Central Railway and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. There are only two centre cars preserved: one at the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway and the other at the Mid-Norfolk <b>Railway.</b> One <b>buffet</b> car survived and is at the Great Central Railway. No Trailer Brake Seconds were saved.|$|R

By 1896, when the Trans-Siberian Railway had reached the same location, the area was known as Bolotnovskaya. A <b>railway</b> station with <b>buffet</b> service was established there and development of an accompanying settlement began in earnest. The name was later shortened to Bolotnoye. Bolotnoye was officially granted town status only in 1943.|$|R
