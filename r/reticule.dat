25|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as {{projectiles}} such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting <b>reticule</b> can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the <b>reticule</b> turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight.|$|E
25|$|A {{constellation}} in {{this area}} was introduced by Isaac Habrecht II in his celestial globe in 1621, who named it Rhombus. It was replaced with a somewhat different constellation by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the eighteenth century; during his stay at the Cape of Good Hope, he named the constellation le <b>Réticule</b> Rhomboide to commemorate the reticle in his telescope eyepiece. The name was later Latinized to Reticulum in his star catalogue Coelum Australe Stelliferum. In 1810, the stars of Reticulum were used by William Croswell to produce the constellation Marmor Sculptile, which represented the bust of Christopher Columbus, but this did not catch on among astronomers.|$|E
25|$|During boss battles {{the lions}} merge {{to form the}} Voltron robot. Gameplay during these {{sequences}} is turn-based and also relies on quick time events. When playing with two or more players control is shared; one player chooses the attack while all others attempt to move their <b>reticule</b> {{to the center of}} the targeted area. Regardless of the number of players a sequence begins by choosing one of four attacks, after which a quick time event occurs. During the enemy's turn players can defend by performing a similar quick time event. Once the enemy's health is depleted a final event occurs in which Voltron forms its Blazing Sword to dispatch of the villain.|$|E

25|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Daniel Lamb in third-person {{perspective}} while at some points they instead control the villain Leo Kasper. Although different in appearance and personality, both have similar controls. As with the original game, the primary gameplay mechanic is stealth execution, whereby the player character must approach an enemy from behind, undetected, and kill them. There are three 'levels' of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last; Level 1 (Hasty) executions are quick and not very bloody, Level 2 (Violent) are considerably more gory, and Level 3 (Gruesome) are over-the-top. The player is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on <b>reticule</b> changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). When playing on PC or Wii while doing the executions, there is a quick time event in which lists down certain moves that either the mouse or Wii Controller must move or by pressing a certain button at a specific time in order to finish the execution. If it does not finish in the specific time, it will stop the execution and skip the execution completely, although the player still kills the person.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} some criticism. Certain gameplay elements, {{such as the}} shooting mechanics, were called [...] "frustrating" [...] by Eurogamer, who claimed that [...] "more than half the time the targeting <b>reticule</b> refuses to acknowledge an oncoming enemy until they're virtually in front of you". GameSpot concurred, noting that the [...] "AI is much worse in the more action-oriented levels". 1UP.com said that one quickly became [...] "tired of [...] violence ... AI quirks [...] repetitive level design." ...|$|E

500|$|The PS2 and Wii {{versions}} of the game were developed by Krome Studios. [...] These versions feature a special cooperative mode, where the second player can [...] "man the guns", utilizing a floating shield and weapon system, which is called the [...] "Remote Weapons System" [...] and is controlled with an on-screen <b>reticule.</b> [...] Players work together to survive against waves of enemies. [...] Unlike the PS3 and Xbox 360 {{versions of}} the game, the PS2 and Wii versions feature only one campaign. [...] Players alternate between controlling various Autobots and Decepticons over the game's fifteen missions. [...] The Wii version of the game contains motion controls for combat and quick-time events. Each Transformer has a special move where the character transforms temporarily.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} carry out executions, players must {{approach}} a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of [...] "dark spots" [...] (shadows where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see into the shadows (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in the game is {{to hide in the}} shadows and tap a wall {{to attract the attention of}} a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can emerge from the shadows behind them, and execute them. The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: [...] "hasty" [...] executions are quick and not very bloody, [...] "violent" [...] are considerably more gory, and [...] "gruesome" [...] are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. Players are entirely in control of which level they use; once players have locked onto an enemy, the lock-on <b>reticule</b> changes color over time to indicate the three levels: white, yellow and red.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a [...]38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as {{projectiles}} such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting <b>reticule</b> appears on-screen. The longer the player is locked on, the smaller the <b>reticule</b> gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the <b>reticule</b> can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the <b>reticule</b> turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a knee shot, also stunning the target.|$|E

2500|$|During {{shooting}} missions, {{the game}} auto-targets the closest opponent. If the player wishes to switch target to another opponent, {{they must do}} so manually. When the player is in shooting mode, they can enter [...] "Precision Targeting" [...] at any time. At this point, the game switches to first-person, zooms in on the target, and goes into slow motion momentarily. While in Precision Targeting, if the targeting <b>reticule</b> turns blue, the player can hit the enemy with a neutralizing, non-lethal shot. If the player fires when the <b>reticule</b> is red, the enemy will be killed instantly. Players can also take cover during shootouts, firing from behind cover when the opportunity presents itself. Players are also free to pick up any weapons dropped by enemies.

25|$|<b>Reticules</b> held {{personal}} items, such as vinaigrettes. The form-fitting dresses or frocks {{of the day}} had no pockets, thus {{these small}} drawstring handbags were essential. These handbags were often called buskins or balantines. They were rectangular in shape and was worn suspended by a woven band from a belt placed around the figure above the waist.|$|R
5000|$|Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose: {{to carry}} coins. Purses {{were made of}} soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often as ladies; the Scottish sporran is a {{survival}} of this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very beautiful handbags. [...] By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape for these accessories, inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses {{that would not be}} bulky or untidy in appearance, so <b>reticules</b> were designed. <b>Reticules</b> were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, carried with wrist straps. First becoming popular in France, they crossed over into Britain, where they became known as [...] "indispensables." [...] Men, however, did not adopt the trend. They used purses and pockets, which became popular in men's trousers.|$|R

2500|$|Both games feature three 'levels' of execution, {{with each}} level {{progressively}} more violent and graphic than the last. Level 1 executions are quick {{and not very}} bloody, Level 2 are considerably more gory, and Level 3 are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. The player him/herself is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on <b>reticule</b> changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). As an example, in the first game, if using the plastic bag, a level 1 kill involves the player simply using the bag to suffocate the enemy. A level 2 kill involves him placing the bag over the enemy's head and kneeing them repeatedly in the face. A level 3 kill sees him strangle the enemy and turn them around to punch them in the face, whilst the enemy struggles to free himself and gasps for air. Eventually, he snaps the enemy's neck. For the sequel, although the basic gameplay remained the same, numerous changes {{were made to the}} mechanics. For example, players were given more choices in terms of executing enemies. As well as the three levels of execution per weapon, plays could now use firearms for executions. Two further additions to the execution system were [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the play could use elements of the game world (such as manhole covers, telephones, fuse boxes, toilets etc) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Justin Leeper {{scored the}} Xbox version 9.25 out of 10, calling it [...] "a {{tremendous}} game [...] the graphics are outstanding, and the seamless integration between real-time and FMV cutscenes {{will take your}} breath away." [...] GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald scored both the Xbox and the GameCube versions 8 out of 10, calling it [...] "a traditional hack-and-slash action game that features great gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and lots of extras." [...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein scored it 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "while The Two Towers is fun, it's not {{really one of the}} better action games around. It does nothing new {{and there are a lot}} of problems that detract from the experience." [...] He was critical of the targeting system, the camera, the rigid linearity of each level and the inability to issue commands to AI controlled allies. He also wrote [...] "the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2. There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2. That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5, writing [...] "with the PlayStation 2 being all [...] "inferior" [...] to the Xbox's presumed power, and the two months of extra development time, surely E.A. must have added an extra aiming <b>reticule</b> for the archery, increased the frame rate from 30, sculpted a few more polygons on the main heroes and adversaries, and added reflections to the underwater orcs and other badly realized reflections. Well, don't bet on it, Bilbo. There are absolutely no differences between this, the GameCube, and the PlayStation 2 versions." ...|$|E

60|$|The fog {{was worse}} than ever at Sloane Square station. Through the still, thick blur, men groped in and out; women, very few, grasped their <b>reticules</b> to their bosoms and {{handkerchiefs}} to their mouths; crowned with the weird excrescence of the driver, haloed by a vague glow of lamp-light that seemed to drown in vapour before it reached the pavement, cabs loomed dim-shaped ever and again, and discharged citizens, bolting like rabbits to their burrows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{is another}} of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar," [...] Stephen burst forth, as soon as Miss Torry had left the room,--"taking young ladies from {{the duties of the}} {{domestic}} hearth into scenes of dissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered <b>reticules!</b> I should like to know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out. If this goes on much longer, the bonds of society will be dissolved." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{addition}} is {{the lock}} on mechanic, which keeps the locked on character {{in front of the}} player. While it doesn't center the enemy in front of weapon firing <b>reticules,</b> it does keep the character on the screen until either the player unlocks them, kills or is killed by them, or the locked on character is out of line of sight. This mechanic helps alleviate the imprecision of analog sticks on the console, as opposed to using a mouse and keyboard on the PC platform, especially when circle strafing; and to make melee attacks easier to control.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to firearms, the player's SWAT officers {{are equipped with}} flashbang and tear gas grenades for disorienting and debilitating suspects, breaching explosives for opening locked doors, lightsticks for signalling and lighting, a Leatherman multitool and an 'Opti-Wand'; a camera on a telescoping wand used for safely looking around corners and through doorways - a high-tech equivalent of real-life mirror on a stick tools used for the same purposes. Officers wear body armor and enclosed helmets with inbuilt respirator equipment and a HUD projected inside the faceplate, used as an in-game explanation for the presentation of ammunition counts, targeting <b>reticules</b> and other information.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the [...] "lite" [...] tag, a {{fair amount}} of realism has been built in; 60s-style bombsights are {{simulated}} for the pre 1970's aircraft rather than modern computer-aided aiming <b>reticules.</b> Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions. Aircraft that come into service after 1970 have advanced Head-Up-Displays that allow the player to aim bombs with more accuracy than manual dive bombing techniques. The A and B versions of the AGM-65 Maverick, allowing much easier ground target destruction for the late 1970s aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{remarkable}} {{element is}} its excellent Mudéjar-Catholic Monarchs style roofs, constituted by three magnificent taujeles of Aragonese Mudéjar carpenters. These ceilings present geometric <b>reticules</b> of wood later carved, painted and gilded with gold leaf, whose moldings show the well-known heraldic motifs of the Catholic Monarchs: the yoke, the arrows and the Gordian knot united {{to the classic}} motto [...] "Tanto monta" [...] (both mounts to undo the Gordian knot), both mounts to cut it as to untie it, according to the well-known anecdote attributed to Alexander the Great), {{as well as a}} good number of leaflet florets finished with pendant (...) pineapples.|$|R
