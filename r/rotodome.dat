5|$|The {{unpressurized}} <b>rotodome</b> is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The <b>rotodome</b> uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
25|$|AN/APY-2's antenna and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mk XII system's antenna {{are housed}} in the <b>rotodome</b> back to back.|$|E
25|$|The AEW.7 version {{would have}} seen the ventral radome {{containing}} the AN/APS-20 radar removed and replaced with a dorsal rotating dome or 'rotodome', similar to that used on the US Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, carrying a newly developed FMICW radar system. To accommodate a new installation {{of the size of the}} <b>rotodome,</b> together with its position right at the rear of the aircraft, the intention was to rebuild the rear fuselage with the single tailfin being substituted by a twin tail arrangement, as well as the wingspan being increased to 60ft (18.3m). The <b>rotodome</b> was designed to be moveable on its installation, able to tip backwards to allow the radar beam to operate clear of interference from the Gannet's propellers, negating the need to replace the Double Mamba with a turbofan engine assembly. In the end, this proposal was not proceeded with.|$|E

5000|$|The Chinese AWACS has a {{phased array}} radar (PAR) {{carried in a}} round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their <b>rotodomes</b> to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a {{triangular}} configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The multi-function, three-dimensional pulse-Doppler radar was developed by NII (Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute), and is designed to detect and track airborne and surface targets. It operates in the frequency range of 1200-1400 MHz. The antenna system consists of three phased arrays, located in a disk with a diameter of 14 meters (near the Russian by an AWACS command and control and-50 cone diameter 9 meters, similar Indian system [...] "Falcon" [...] - 11 meter). Each phased array has a 120-degree field of view. Maximum range of detection of air targets is 470 km. A-50I of India made by Israel adopted its design and entered service later than KJ-2000(service 2004) in 2009.|$|R
50|$|In May 1997 Russia and Israel {{agreed to}} fulfill jointly {{an order from}} China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China {{reportedly}} ordered one Phalcon for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several PHALCON AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more possibly up to eight of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. Finally, in July 2000 the United States pressured Israel {{to back out of}} the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their <b>rotodomes</b> to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The installation of equipment at the IL-76 began in late 2002 aircraft by Xian aircraft industries (Xian Aircraft Industry Co.). The first flight of an airplane KJ-2000 made in November 2003. All four machines will be equipped with this type. The last to be introduced into service the Chinese AIR FORCE until the end of 2007.|$|R
25|$|The first E-767 {{made the}} first flight on October 4, 1994 at Paine Field, Washington. First flight with the <b>rotodome</b> {{installed}} occurred on August 9, 1996 and it was delivered to JASDF on March 11, 1998 along with the second E-767. Aircraft No. 3 and No. 4 were delivered on January 5, 1999. On May 10, 2000, all four E-767s were put into service with Airborne Early Warning Group (AEWG) 601st Squadron at JASDF Hamamatsu Air Base. (The airbase's runways needed to be reinforced to accommodate the E-767.) On March 31, 2005, the two squadrons were merged.|$|E
500|$|Modifications to the Boeing 707 for the E-3 Sentry {{included}} a rotating radar dome (<b>rotodome),</b> hydraulics were changed from 3500 to 5000 PSI {{to drive the}} <b>rotodome,</b> single-point ground refueling, air refueling, and a bail-out tunnel or chute. The original design had two (one forward, and one aft), but the aft bail-out chute was deleted to cut mounting costs. Engineering, test and evaluation began on the first E-3 Sentry in October 1975. Between [...] 1977 and 1992, a total of 68 E-3s were built.|$|E

A <b>rotodome</b> about 30 feet (9.14 m) in diameter and six feet (1.83 m) thick at the center is mounted above the aft fuselage on two struts. The <b>rotodome</b> rotates at about six rpm during operations and at 0.25 rpm to lubricate the rotation mechanisms even when the radar is not used.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of using}} a <b>rotodome,</b> a moving radar found on some AEW aircraft, the EL/W-2085 uses an active {{electronically}} scanned array (AESA) – an active phased array radar. This radar consists of an array of transmit/receive (T/R) modules that allow a beam to be electronically steered, making a physically rotating <b>rotodome</b> unnecessary. AESA radars operate on a pseudorandom set of frequencies and also have very short scanning rates, which makes them difficult to detect and jam. [...] Up to 100 targets can be tracked simultaneously to a range of 200 nmi (370km), while at the same time, over a dozen air-to-air interceptions or air-to-ground attacks can be guided. The radar equipment of the Israeli CAEW consists of each one L-band radar left and right sides on the fuselage and each one S-band antenna in nose and tail. The phased array allows positions of aircraft on operator screens to be updated every 2–4 seconds, rather than every 20–40 seconds as is the case on the <b>rotodome</b> AWACS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sequence}} of events during impact was also determined. The aircraft struck the ground nose first and slid {{to the top of}} a hill, where the empennage (tail section) broke off. [...] "As the [...] cleared the second hill, it rolled over. The fuselage broke up as the [...] rolled. The outboard right wing impacted on the left side of the wreckage, the right-hand wing broke off and the <b>rotodome</b> section impacted on its back, breaking up the rest of the aircraft." ...|$|E

50|$|The platform's antenna is {{a slotted}} wave guide planar array and {{features}} very low side lobe levels and a narrow beam width in azimuth. It handles high power (better than 3.3 Kilowatt average) and weighs just 160 kg.

50|$|The Royal Australian Air Force, Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force are {{deploying}} Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft. Unlike the E-2 and E-3, the Boeing 737 AEW&C {{does not}} use a rotating disk radome (<b>rotodome)</b> but instead has a large dorsal fin.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{layout and}} size of the final Yak-44E design was {{similar to that of the}} Grumman E-2C which {{operated}} in the same role from American aircraft carriers, being a twin-engined high-wing monoplane with a rotating radar dome (<b>rotodome)</b> above the aircraft's fuselage. The Yak-44 was designed to carry much more fuel, and was therefore far heavier. The engines were to be two Progress D-27 propfans rated at 14,000 ehp (10,290 kW) each, driving contra-rotating propellers. The crew of five were to be accommodated in a pressurized fuselage, while the aircraft's <b>rotodome,</b> carrying a NPO Vega pulse-doppler radar could be retracted to reduce the aircraft's height when stowed below decks in the carrier's hangar. The aircraft's wings also folded upwards, while a twin tail was fitted.|$|E
50|$|The mission {{personnel}} of the 15-man crew derive {{data from}} the large Liana surveillance radar with its antenna in an over-fuselage <b>rotodome,</b> which has a diameter of 29 ft 9 in (9.00 m). Detection range is 650 km for air targets and 300 km for ground targets.|$|E
5000|$|Israel has {{developed}} the IAI/Elta EL/M-2075 Phalcon system, which uses an AESA (active electronically scanned array) {{in lieu of}} a <b>rotodome</b> antenna.

50|$|System {{integration}} {{began in}} the late 1980s and by 1989 Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) had modified three HS 748 aeroplanes with pylons as well as an additional auxiliary power unit to power the <b>rotodome</b> hydraulics, computers, communications and the onboard experimental gear. Trials began in 1989 and the complete aircraft flew {{for the first time in}} November 1990.|$|E

50|$|The E-2 is a high-wing airplane, {{with one}} {{turboprop}} engine on each wing and retractable tricycle landing gear. As with most carrier-borne airplanes, the E-2 {{is equipped with}} a tail hook for recovery (landing), and the nose gear can attach to a shuttle of the aircraft carrier's catapults for launch (takeoff). A distinguishing feature of the Hawkeye is its 24-foot (7.3 m) diameter rotating radar dome (<b>rotodome)</b> that is mounted above its fuselage and wings. This carries the E-2's primary antennas for its long-range radar and IFF systems. No other carrier-borne aircraft possesses one of these. Land-based aircraft with rotodomes include the Boeing E-3 Sentry, a larger AWACS airplane operated by the U.S. Air Force and NATO air forces in large numbers. The similarly-placed stationary radome of the E-2's piston-engined predecessor, the E-1 Tracer, also mandated the E-2's adoption of a modern version of Grumman's long-patented Sto-Wing folding wing system, preventing the folded wing panels from making contact with the E-2's <b>rotodome.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1967 China {{attempted}} {{to develop its}} first airborne early warning aircraft, based on the Tu-4 airframe. The project was named KJ-1 and mounted a Type 843 <b>rotodome</b> {{on top of the}} aircraft. However, the radar and equipment was too heavy, and the KJ-1 did not meet PLAAF's requirements. The project was canceled in 1971. The single prototype aircraft is now on display at the PLAAF museum north of Beijing.|$|E
5000|$|The base {{airframe}} for E-767 {{is that of}} a 767-200ER, Boeing designation 767-27C. (The [...] "7C" [...] designation is the Boeing {{customer code}} for the JASDF).

5000|$|When {{found on}} {{fixed-wing}} aircraft with forward-looking radar (as {{are commonly used}} for object or weather detection), the nose cones often additionally serve as radomes. In case of advanced aircraft systems like AEW&C, a rotating radome often called 'rotodome' is mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage for 360 degree coverage. There are newer AEW&C configurations which instead of <b>rotodome</b> uses three antenna modules in triangular configuration inside radome (usually mounted on top of the fuselage) for 360 degree coverage such as Chinese and [...] Indian AEW&Cs.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem was}} not the {{availability}} of suitable aircraft {{but the lack of}} an effective airborne radar. An ad hoc team of specialists from DRDO's Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) began work on developing an airborne radar, allowing the programme to proceed. Studies and analysis began in July 1985 under the project name 'Guardian', later (possibly in 1987) renamed 'Airawat'. In the late 1980s an HS 748 aircraft was fitted with a 24 ft x 5 ft composite <b>rotodome.</b> The aircraft flew with the pylon, but not the dome, in May 1989 and with the <b>rotodome</b> in November 1990. The Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) was set up in February 1991, under Dr K. Ramchand to act as a systems house and integration agency using all the expertise and infrastructure available in India. At the peak of its operations, some 300 scientists and engineers were involved in the project. The aircraft was unveiled to the public during flight demonstrations at the inauguration ceremony of the first Aero India show held in Bangalore in December 1996. Two testbed aircraft transferred from the western command of the Indian Air Force, with tail numbers H-2175 and H-2176, were employed in the design program.|$|E
