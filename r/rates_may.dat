5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> be used to estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently {{been the subject of}} political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
50|$|A low {{turnover}} <b>rate</b> <b>may</b> {{point to}} overstocking, obsolescence, or {{deficiencies in the}} product line or marketing effort.

5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Nourishment is {{typically}} a repetitive process, since nourishment mitigates {{the effects of}} erosion, but does not remove the causes. A benign environment increases the interval between nourishment projects, reducing costs. Conversely, high erosion <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> render nourishment financially impractical.|$|E
25|$|Despite rising debt levels, {{interest}} costs have remained at approximately 2008 levels (around $450 billion in total) due to lower than {{long-term interest rates}} paid on government debt in recent years. However, interest <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> return to higher historical levels.|$|E

25|$|During stage four {{there are}} both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> drop to well below {{replacement}} level as {{has happened in}} countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan, leading to a shrinking population, a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high obesity and an aging population in developed countries. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.|$|E

25|$|Growth <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> also {{be faster}} than exponential. In {{the most extreme}} case, when growth {{increases}} without bound in finite time, it is called hyperbolic growth.

25|$|The term {{may be used}} in a moral sense—condemning, taking {{advantage}} of others' misfortunes—or in a legal sense where interest <b>rates</b> <b>may</b> be regulated by law.

40|$|We {{find that}} by endogenizing the {{population}} growth rate, a growth model under the productive consumption hypothesis is more tractable than models {{in previous studies}} and has interesting implications for population dynamics.

25|$|Chronic lung diseases, such as {{pneumoconiosis}} (black lung) {{were once}} common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy.
