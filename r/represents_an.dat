5|$|In {{contrast}} to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery, competence, and uprightness.

5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> exception.

5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin, the A4 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway's national significance is reflected in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E
5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> eclectic {{text in the}} New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E

In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O.nelsoni likely <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E

5|$|Other {{factors of}} concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, {{released}} pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or all-terrain vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming <b>represents</b> <b>an</b> uncharacterized future threat.|$|E
