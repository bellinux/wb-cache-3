40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} capital <b>replacement</b> models at Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited (MTRCL), Hong Kong. A particular characteristic of the <b>replacement</b> problems considered is that costs relating to existing equipment are generally constant or increasing only slowly. Consequently, <b>replacement</b> is often driven by technical obsolescence, but other criteria are used for informing decisions. The applicability of traditional OR models of <b>replacement</b> is then problematic. We recommend {{the use of a}} modified two-cycle <b>replacement</b> model and compare this model to existing capital <b>replacement</b> models. Issues relating to the estimation of delay costs and failure consequences and their influence on the <b>replacement</b> decision are also considered—this is done using a fixed horizon model, which is a special case of the modified two-cycle model. Track points and escalators are used as particular examples. In addition to modelling recommendations, we discuss the management of asset <b>replacement</b> with emphasis on the procedures necessary to ensure that asset <b>replacement</b> requirements are considered appropriately and effectively. The paper treats, in particular, the procedural issues of asset <b>replacement,</b> and the discussion of asset <b>replacement</b> system methodology reflects the current practise at MTRCL, Hong Kong, and developments within that organization through collaboration with academia. The modified two-cycle <b>replacement</b> model is recommended by us for general <b>replacement</b> applications. The asset <b>replacement</b> procedure is presented as an exemplar for business and industry...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveMany high-risk {{patients}} with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis are not referred for surgical aortic valve <b>replacement.</b> Although this patient population remains ill-defined, {{many of these}} patients are now being referred for percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement.</b> We sought to define the characteristics and outcomes of patients referred for percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement.</b> MethodsBetween February 2006 and March 2007, 92 patients were screened for percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement.</b> Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve <b>replacement,</b> percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement,</b> balloon aortic valvuloplasty, or no intervention were compared. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. ResultsNineteen patients underwent successful surgical aortic valve <b>replacement,</b> 18 patients underwent percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement,</b> and 36 patients had no intervention. Thirty patients underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty, and of these, 8 patients were bridged to percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> and 3 were bridged to surgical aortic valve <b>replacement.</b> Of the remaining 19 patients undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty, bridging to percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> could not be accomplished because of death (n = 9 [47 %) ], exclusion from the percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> protocol (n = 6 [32 %]), and some patients improved after balloon aortic valvuloplasty and declined percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> (n = 4 [21 %]). The most common reasons for no intervention included death while awaiting definitive treatment (n = 10 [28 %]), patient uninterested in percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> (n = 10 [28 %]), and questionable severity of symptoms or aortic stenosis (n = 9 [25 %]). Patients not undergoing aortic valve <b>replacement</b> had higher mortality compared with those undergoing aortic valve <b>replacement</b> (44 % vs 14 %) over a mean duration of 220 days. ConclusionSymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have high mortality if timely aortic valve <b>replacement</b> is not feasible. Twenty {{percent of the patients}} referred for percutaneous aortic valve <b>replacement</b> underwent surgical aortic valve <b>replacement</b> with good outcome. Patients undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty alone or no intervention had unfavorable outcomes...|$|R
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the <b>replacements</b> rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's <b>replacements</b> to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveSuccessful {{mitral valve}} <b>replacement</b> in young {{children}} {{is limited by the}} lack of small prosthetic valves. Supra-annular prosthesis implantation can facilitate mitral valve <b>replacement</b> with a larger prosthesis in children with a small annulus, but little is known about its effect on the outcomes of mitral valve <b>replacement</b> {{in young children}}. MethodsOne hundred eighteen children underwent mitral valve <b>replacement</b> at 5 years of age or younger from 1976 – 2006. Mitral valve <b>replacement</b> was supra-annular in 37 (32 %) patients. ResultsSurvival was 74 % ± 4 % at 1 year and 56 % ± 5 % at 10 years but improved over time (10 -year survival of 83 % ± 7 % from 1994 – 2006). Factors associated with worse survival included earlier mitral valve <b>replacement</b> date, age less than 1 year, complete atrioventricular canal, and additional procedures at mitral valve <b>replacement,</b> but not supra-annular mitral valve <b>replacement.</b> As survival improved during our more recent experience, the risks of supra-annular mitral valve <b>replacement</b> became apparent; survival was worse among patients with a supra-annular prosthesis after 1991. A pacemaker was placed in 18 (15 %) patients within 1 month of mitral valve <b>replacement</b> and was less likely in patients who had undergone supra-annular mitral valve <b>replacement.</b> Among early survivors, freedom from redo mitral valve <b>replacement</b> was 72 % ± 5 % at 5 years and 45 % ± 7 % at 10 years. Twenty-one patients with a supra-annular prosthesis underwent redo mitral valve <b>replacement.</b> The second prosthesis was annular in 15 of these patients and upsized in all but 1, but 5 required pacemaker placement for heart block. ConclusionsSupra-annular mitral valve <b>replacement</b> was associated with worse survival than annular mitral valve <b>replacement</b> in our recent experience. Patients with supra-annular mitral valve <b>replacement</b> were less likely to have operative complete heart block but remained at risk when the prosthesis was subsequently replaced...|$|R
