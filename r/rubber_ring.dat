25|$|Bel-Aqua Water Sports Company of Los Angeles (later Aquala Sports Manufacturing Company) marketed {{dry suits}} {{designed}} and manufactured by Bill Barada from 1954 or earlier. These were front entry one-piece or waist entry two piece suits with optional hood in 3-ply rubber, with optional integral hood, {{intended to be}} worn over insulating underwear suited to the water temperature. The front entry was sealed by binding the entry chute with a length of surgical rubber, and waist entry was sealed by rolling the overlap over a <b>rubber</b> <b>ring.</b> Boots, cuff and collar were moulded rubber. These were available in small, medium or large and were also available in kit form.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traction}} motors are 14-pole motors of type WB 372, which were later again used in class 111 and 151. [...] As {{was the case}} in all locomotives in the Einheitslokomotiven program, the <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> transmission system made by the Siemens-Schuckert-Werke/SSW was utilized, which had proven themselves above all expectations in the prototype E 10.0 units.|$|E
2500|$|Logistical {{support for}} all three towers was {{provided}} by the 4604th Support Squadron, [...] based out of Otis AFB and specifically constituted for this mission. They were originally equipped with H-21B helicopters, which were replaced with three Sikorsky SH-3 helicopters acquired in 1962. The [...] was used to supply the stations, with transfer being effected with a platform called the [...] "donut", consisting of an inflated <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> surmounted by a railing, which was lowered from the platform to the waiting ship's deck. These transfers could only take place at slack tide, when the ship could maintain position.|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} gives {{the results of}} tests which were made {{for the purpose of}} solving the problem of whether {{diagrams}} obtained from pressure tests could be conclusive for the determination of the safe impact coefficients. It is first established that the <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> adhere firmly to the compression surfaces during deformation. Suggestions are thus obtained for a constructive simplification of the <b>rubber</b> <b>rings.</b> The hysteresis phenomenon is ascribed to external and internal friction forces. A device for falling tests is then described with which the process of shock absorption with <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> was tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{responses of}} groups of 10 lambs were examined for 90 min following {{a range of}} commonly used husbandry procedures. The treatment groups were, control handling only (control); ear tagging (ET); tail docking by hot docking iron (HD); tail docking by <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> (RRT); castration by <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> (RRC); tail docking and castration by <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> (RRTRRC); HD plus Mulesing plus ET (HDMET); HD plus RRC plus Mulesing plus ET (HDRRCMET). ET produced no discernible changes in behavioural or postural indicators and HD showed small insignificant increases in active pain behaviours and abnormal postures. All treatments involving the use of tight <b>rubber</b> <b>rings</b> (RRT, RRC, RRTRRC, HDRRCMET) resulted in significant abnormal posture and active pain behaviour displays. HDMET produced few active pain behaviours but significantly increased the time spent in abnormal postures. An integrated score based upon the incidence of active pain behaviours and abnormal postures ranked the pain response of the treatments {{in the following order}} control=ET < HD < HDMET < RRT=HDRRCMET=RRC < RRTRRC.

2500|$|A pump is used {{to provide}} a flow of air into the chamber that the ball drops into. [...] The airflow pushes the ball along the chamber to <b>rubber</b> <b>ring,</b> or gasket, known as a [...] "{{restrictor}}". [...] The restrictor has a hole though it that is sightly smaller than the ball, which the ball presses up against. [...] This seals the hole, so air pressure builds up in the chamber. [...] When the pressure {{is so great that}} the restrictor can no longer hold it, the ball bursts though, out of {{the main body of the}} machine and into an external tube, which guides it upwards and releases it at the height of a bowler's arm.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was polygonal {{in cross}} section with deep, flat sides and plywood covered. [...] The pilot sat in an open cockpit immediately ahead of {{the leading edge of}} the wing, which was centrally supported on a raised upper fuselage which tapered gently to the tail. The vertical tail had a straight leading edge and tip but the balanced rudder had a trailing edge composed of three straight sections, almost appearing curved. The rudder was mounted on a short fin which was strengthened by wire bracing to the tailplane. In plan the latter was straight tapered and tipped, apart from a generous cut-out in the elevators to permit rudder movement. [...] All the rear surfaces were ply covered. The Vandor landed on a skid, attached to the fuselage bottom by two <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> springs, assisted by a short tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|Increases in bore {{and stroke}} gave the D.4 {{more than twice the}} swept volume of the C.4 and roughly doubled its power. The cast-steel cylinders, {{individually}} machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat-sided aluminium crankcase. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner crankshaft bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either pusher or tractor operation. A flywheel was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a <b>rubber</b> <b>ring,</b> located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel. [...] Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine-driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the radiator by another tube on the top left.|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of rubber}} pessaries for {{contraception}} likely {{arose from the}} 19th-century practice of correcting a prolapsed uterus with such a device; the condition {{seems to have been}} far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a pessary for birth control. As with the production of condoms for men, the development of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive. Other terms for the contraceptive diaphragm were [...] "female preventatives", [...] "female protectors", [...] "Victoria's protectors", and the [...] "French pessary" [...] ("F.P.") or pessaire preventif. This linguistic variety, some of it euphemistic, makes it difficult to distinguish in the literature among diaphragms, cervical caps, female condoms, and other pessaries; one form of [...] "womb veil" [...] is described in 1890 as [...] "like a ring pessary covered by a membraneous envelope." [...] Another source in 1895 describes it as [...] "a small soft rubber cup surrounded at the brim by a flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> about an inch or inch and a quarter in diameter." ...|$|E

And now, Mrs. Lecks," [...] she continued triumphantly, as she unscrewed the top, [...] "that <b>rubber</b> <b>ring</b> has kept 'em as dry as chips.
