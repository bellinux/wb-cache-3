40|$|Theproposed {{criteria}} {{system should}} be ableto describethe status <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> and biotope complexes as exact- ly as possible and it should provide useful guidelines for nature conservation. The given proposal includes two criteria to estimate the threat of biotopes: 1. threat by destruction (loss of area); 2. threat by qualitative changes (creeping of certain variants); supplemented by a third criterion: 3. assess- ment of regeneration ability. The categories and their definitions use basically the criteria system developed for the National Red Data Book of Species (Blab et 1984) but adjusted to the special needs <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> evaluation. The first steps to realise a National Red Data Book <b>of</b> <b>Biotopes</b> are described and the limitations in the use in nature conserva- tion are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{classification}} method for ascertaining characteristical spider communities <b>of</b> different <b>biotope</b> types is presented. Based on a current list <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> types all data available {{from a certain}} area about the spatial distribution of spiders were fed into a data bank an analysed. A largely standardized method has been developed which allows to classify the spider community <b>of</b> each <b>biotope</b> type. The classification {{is based on a}} presence/absence matrix and a comparison between the grades of presence in different biotope types...|$|R
40|$|Soil is a {{key part}} <b>of</b> a <b>biotope</b> and {{microorganisms}} are dominant components contributing to soil functions. Conversely, established methods for valuation <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> according to Natura 2000 rely predominantly on the communities living on the surface. Here, we aimed to assess soil microbial biomass and community structure on five localities with range <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> values by means of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. PLFA figures were affected both by sampling season (spring vs. autumn) and locality. In spring, the living microbial biomass (estimated by PLFAtot) exhibited poor correlation to biotope values. These were, on the contrary, correlated to trans/cis PLFA, an indicator of microbial stress, (i. e., lower stress in higher-rated biotopes), and fungal/bacterial PLFA (i. e., higher-rated biotopes contained more fungi). The attempt to model biotope values from microbial characteristics explained a maximum of ~ 50 % of the variability; the best predictors were the trans/cis stress indicator, percentage of actinobacterial PLFA, and ratio of PLFA of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. These results show that soil microbial characteristics present partly new information and indicate the need to amend the procedures <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> assessment. Soil PLFA profiling could serve as suitable methods for this purpose...|$|R

50|$|The federal nature {{protection}} law (Bundesnaturschutzgesetz, since 1976) requires that wild {{animals and plants}} and their community should be protected {{as part of the}} ecosystem in the specific diversity that has grown naturally and historically, and their biotope and other living conditions should be protected, preserved, developed, and restored. (Number 9, Clause 1, Article 2). The law also requires that some kinds <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> that are full of a specific variety should not be harmed by development. So there is a law that mandates the protection <b>of</b> <b>biotopes.</b> There is also a provincial law corresponding to the federal one. Such developments were uncommon in those times.|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} investigates {{the role of}} social-psychological {{variables}} in the general public's intention to support conservation <b>of</b> five local <b>biotopes.</b> A questionnaire survey of 245 people {{was carried out in}} Kristianstad Municipality, Sweden. In hierarchical regression analyses, public intention to support conservation was partly predicted by attitude toward biodiversity conservation and by personal norm. The relationship between these variables and intention differed depending on the ecological content <b>of</b> the <b>biotope.</b> It is concluded that when communicating the importance <b>of</b> conserving <b>biotopes</b> to the public, the message should be tailored according to the ecological content <b>of</b> the <b>biotope</b> as well as with regard to public attitudes and personal norms...|$|R

50|$|On the Comoros {{there are}} {{numerous}} tropical ecosystems that are primarily dependent on the altitude. There you can find many kinds of tropical plants, large numbers of which are endemic. Like most islands, {{the diversity of the}} local flora suffers from two pressures, on the one hand the reduction of available space caused by the reduction <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> due to the invasion of humans {{in what used to be}} the wildest areas and on the other hand the invasion of exotic plant species such as guava trees. The flora has only been poorly studied, France has however been made attempts on Mayotte to fill in the gaps. Efforts to preserve species are still not enough to save the richest zones, and disturbances <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> are expected to take place for many years to come.|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} remote video {{survey of}} soft-bottom epibenthos {{was carried out}} at 34 transects in Lyme Bay, U K. A im o f the survey was to detect spatial patterns in epibenthic assemblages to allow {{the assessment of the}} suitability of an existing sidescan sonar and Smith-Mclntyre grab data-derived biotope map for achieving biotope representation in a marine spatial plan. It was shown that both video survey and Smith- Mclntyre grab data exhibited negative spatial autocorrelation, allowing the creation <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> map polygons through spatial agglomeration of point data. However, a greater number <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> could be identified using the epibenthos (video) than the infauna (grab) data, demonstrating that the use <b>of</b> the existing <b>biotope</b> map {{as the basis for the}} design of a marine protected area would have led to an underrepresentation <b>of</b> epibenthic <b>biotopes.</b> It is suggested that the failure of the infaunal (grab) data to detect these biotopes was a result of the sacrifice of fine-scale replication for the sake of the large coverage required for management-scale biotope surveys and it is demonstrated that the remote-video survey method is a highly suitable method for mapping benthic biotopes on management-scale, allowing large spatial coverage without sacrificing fine scale replication.
