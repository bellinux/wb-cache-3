40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{trials in}} the general {{practice}} setting are important for providing evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different agents under various conditions. In conducting these trials, the participation of physicians and patient recruitment are important issues. Various investigations in the literature have reported views and attitudes of physicians on various types of clinical trials. Nevertheless, there is still little information concerning physicians participating in a clinical trial and among them, {{those who could not}} recruit any patients (unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters).</b> Methods In 2003, we collaborated in a large-scale multicenter study of Japanese hypertensive patients (COPE Trial). In Tokushima University Hospital and 18 other medical institutions, we investigated the views and attitudes of unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters</b> in comparison with successful physician <b>recruiters,</b> using a questionnaire. Results The questionnaire was provided by mail to 47 physicians and 27 (57 %) responded. The response rate was 79 % for successful physician <b>recruiters</b> compared to 43 % (P = 0. 014) for unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters.</b> More successful physician <b>recruiters</b> (73 %) than unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters</b> (42 %) stated they had participated and enrolled patients in previous multicenter clinical trials. A significantly higher number of successful physician <b>recruiters</b> than unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters</b> (42 %; P = 0. 040) considered the presence of a support system with clinical research coordinators (CRC) as the reason for participation (80 %). A large number of unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters</b> experienced difficulty in obtaining informed consent (67 %), whereas a significantly smaller number of successful physician <b>recruiters</b> experienced such difficulty (20 %; P = 0. 014). The difficulties experienced by unsuccessful physician <b>recruiters</b> in the trial were as follows: inability to find possible participants (100 %), difficulty in obtaining informed consent (58 %), cumbersome procedures (58 %), difficulty in long-term follow up (33 %), and insufficient tools for explanation and obtaining informed consent (8 %). Conclusion This survey showed that successful physician <b>recruiters</b> consider a support system with CRC of value, and that they are skillful in obtaining informed consent. These views and attitudes may have originated from past experience involving clinical trials. In this regard, we need to develop an infrastructure to enlighten physicians on this support system for the promotion of clinical trials. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recruiters</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenological {{perceptions}} of the content domains that biographical data (biodata) reflect were examined along with <b>recruiters</b> 2 ̆ 7 use of biodata for making applicant screening decisions. Based on existing research, {{it is suggested that}} abilities are an important perceived component of biodata used in personnel selection. Three field experiments with different samples and methodologies were conducted to examine this premise. A total of 344 <b>recruiters</b> and line managers from 28 companies participated. ^ Study 1 asked <b>recruiters</b> to make judgments about the underlying ability attributes (language, math, physical) and nonability attributes (motivation, leadership, interpersonal) of biodata items frequently encountered in the applicant screening process. Biodata items were perceived to reflect both ability and nonability attributes, and were judged to be useful for screening applicants. The more items were perceived to reflect the attributes, the more those items were judged useful. Further, attributes were reliably judged across <b>recruiters,</b> and nonability attributes of biodata items were as reliably judged as ability attributes. However, high levels of biodata items were judged more reliably than low levels of biodata items across ability and nonability attributes. ^ Study 2 examined <b>recruiters</b> 2 ̆ 7 use of abilities biodata for making applicant screening decisions. <b>Recruiters</b> rated an array of hypothetical resumes which varied on levels of abilities based on study 1 results. These resumes were assessed for two jobs, sales representative and cost accountant, chosen to represent differing ability requirements. Results indicated that <b>recruiters</b> rated resumes as more acceptable to the degree that biodata items reflected higher levels of abilities important for the jobs. ^ Study 3 consisted of protocol analysis to provide a qualitative understanding of <b>recruiters</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of}} biodata content. <b>Recruiters</b> 2 ̆ 7 comments were sorted into content categories. Results showed that <b>recruiters</b> mentioned most of the ability and nonability attributes with substantial frequency, and two new categories emerged (well-roundedness and intelligence). Results also showed that math attributes were mentioned significantly more frequently for the cost accountant job and interpersonal attributes significantly more often for the sales representative job. It is concluded that <b>recruiters</b> reliably judge ability and nonability attributes of biodata and use this information to make applicant screening decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the United States Army Recruiting Command incentive system used to motivate <b>recruiters</b> to meet and/or exceed mission box. In 1998, {{for the first}} time in decades, the Army missed its annual recruiting mission. The Army expects to miss it again in 1999.

Recommendations to improve the incentive system include implementation of more intrinsically motivating incentives. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examines the knowledge, views, {{and experiences of}} Navy <b>recruiters</b> and recruiting supervisors regarding the Navy Recruiting Simulation Tool (NRST). Also known as SIMmersion, NRST is an interactive, role-playing program designed to boost a <b>recruiter's</b> confidence and skills by providing supplementary sales training beyond the classroom. The primary source of information is an online survey distributed in January 2010 to 5, 139 Navy <b>recruiters</b> and recruiting supervisors. A total of 1, 058 persons (21 percent) responded to the survey. The results of the survey show that 58 percent of Navy <b>recruiters</b> never use NRST; further, four out five feel that NRST has no positive impact on their confidence, sales skills, productivity, or time management. Additionally, fewer than one in four Navy <b>recruiters</b> rated NRST favorably on its usability. The responses of recruiting supervisors were {{very similar to those}} of Navy <b>recruiters.</b> These results suggest that NRST has not been adequately presented to Navy <b>recruiters</b> and recruiting supervisors, who are generally unfamiliar with its potential benefits. Negative views on usability are influenced largely by the program's lack of compatibility with existing platforms. Recommendations are offered to increase the awareness, understanding, and use of NRST. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
