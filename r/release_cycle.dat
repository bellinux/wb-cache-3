5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{development}} process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; the development community has switched to a monthly <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases. By that plan, bugfix point releases will follow the stable releases every three months.|$|E
5|$|A {{fund-raising}} experiment, Dunc-Tank, {{was created}} to solve the <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> problem and release managers were paid to work full-time; in response, unpaid developers slowed down their work and the release was delayed. Debian 4.0 (Etch) was released in April 2007, featuring the x86-64 port and a graphical installer. Debian 5.0 (Lenny) was released in February 2009, supporting Marvell's Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC. The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer, a developer {{who died in a}} car crash.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K is {{a series}} that has more than 20 {{professional}} wrestling video games that are currently developed by Visual Concepts and Yuke's, and it was originated from THQ but later published by 2K Sports. These series of games {{are based on the}} professional wrestling promotion WWE, which features the professional wrestling match types, storylines, and playable characters based on WWE programming. The series was originally named SmackDown!, after WWE's own SmackDown television program. The first release in the series was WWF SmackDown! in March 2000, which along with these subsequent titles, remained exclusive to Sony's PlayStation consoles. After the brand extension, the series was retitled SmackDown! vs. Raw in 2004, to indicate the Raw brand was also featured. Within a few years!, the series had expanded to a yearly <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> for various seventh-generation consoles as well as mobile devices. Yuke's had also released the games in Japan under the name of Exciting Pro Wrestling. However, after SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the Japanese releases adopted the western name. The series was later renamed as just simply WWE, starting from 2011 and 2012.|$|E

25|$|On May 6, 2014 {{at their}} yearly Fanfest convention, CCP {{announced}} {{the move from}} the current development cycle of two expansions per year, to ten feature-releases per year on a rapid <b>release</b> <b>cycle.</b> Senior Producer of EVE Online Andie Nordgren (CCP Seagull) stated that the move was to necessary for future developments {{to have a more}} flexible <b>release</b> <b>cycle,</b> rather than the deadline imposed on the previous system, allowing smaller patches and changes to be deployed more rapidly and large projects not having to be rushed due to the expansion deadline.|$|E
25|$|Build is ever increasing. For a <b>release</b> <b>cycle,</b> e.g. 42.0, {{there are}} several builds in the Canary and Developer period. The last build number from Developer is kept {{throughout}} Beta and Stable and is locked with the major.minor for that release.|$|E
25|$|New web browsers {{have been}} built around WebKit such as the S60 browser on Symbian mobile phones, BlackBerry Browser (ver 6.0+), Midori, Chrome browser, the Android Web browser before version 4.4 KitKat, and the browser used in PlayStation 3 system {{software}} from version 4.10. KDE's Rekonq web browser and Plasma Workspaces also use it as the native web rendering engine. WebKit has been adopted as the rendering engine in OmniWeb, iCab and Web (formerly named Epiphany) and Sleipnir, replacing their original rendering engines. GNOME's Web supported both Gecko and WebKit for some time, but the team decided that Gecko's <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> and future development plans would make it too cumbersome to continue supporting it. webOS uses WebKit {{as the basis of}} its application runtime. The latest interface update for Valve's Steam employs WebKit to render its interface and built-in browser. WebKit is used to render HTML and run JavaScript in the Adobe Integrated Runtime application platform. In Adobe Creative Suite CS5, WebKit is used to render some parts of the user interface. As {{of the first half of}} 2010, an analyst estimated the cumulative number of mobile handsets shipped with a WebKit-based browser at 350 million. By mid April 2015, WebKit browser market share was 50.3%.|$|E

500|$|Though Iones {{described}} Anniversarys one-year {{development cycle}} as a [...] "very smooth ride", some production {{issues that were}} not discovered until late in development contributed to bugs and other problems. Saber relied on a partially automated tool to render the game's cinematics, but did not do a thorough vetting of the results until after the game had reached the alpha stage of its <b>release</b> <b>cycle.</b> As a result, the developers realized that their addition of motion capture animation and lip-syncing had caused serious audio syncing issues and animation bugs.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} for The Hunting Party {{features}} a 3D modeled artwork by Brandon Parvini, {{who had previously}} designed the artworks for Living Things and the band's singles during the album's <b>release</b> <b>cycle.</b> The artwork was based off an original drawing, entitled [...] "Archer", by visual artist James Jean that was created for the album. It {{is one of many}} artworks by Jean {{to be used in the}} packaging of the album, which also features, in deluxe editions of the album, a lithograph, T-shirt and a 36-page art book by him. Jean's traditional style, notably different to the artwork created for The Hunting Party had been previously described by Dana Jennings of The New York Times as [...] "suffused with a dreamy romanticism and lyricism worthy of Maxfield Parrish, even as Mr. Jean subverts those and other isms." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter {{gave the}} album a mostly {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "hazardous waste". He {{also noted that}} Spears's voice was [...] "reedy, cold and mechanical" [...] when stripped from the original mixes. However, he highlighted two tracks, saying: [...] "Spears comes closest to achieving dance-diva status on the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime", while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic." [...] Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] the best track of the album, but said it [...] "has {{the feel of a}} hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing-related thought behind it except to fulfill the once-every-two-years <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> that's been established for Britney material." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes [...] "amps already-aggressive singles like [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to brain-popping levels of synth spiraling", and transforms [...] "sad-eyed slow jams like [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] into Hi-NRG bursts.

500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album <b>release</b> <b>cycle.</b> Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and high art at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in September 2015, Nordgren {{announced}} that CCP, while continuing with a five-week <b>release</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{would return to}} intermittently releasing large scale expansions for EVE. [...] She described the new <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> as a [...] "hybrid form", where expansions would be [...] "a set of big, connected features" [...] with no fixed number per year, while the feature-releases would continue to bring [...] "quality of life changes, ship balance changes, visual upgrades" [...] and other smaller additions. [...] The first new expansion, announced at EVE Vegas 2015, will introduce a new modular starbase called a Citadel, and will overhaul capital-class ships. Its release date is set for spring of 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Opera Software uses a <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> {{consisting}} of three [...] "streams" [...] (which correspond to phases of development) {{that can be}} downloaded and installed independently of each other: [...] "developer", [...] "beta" [...] and [...] "stable". New features are first introduced in the developer build, then, depending on user feedback, it progress to the beta version and eventually released.|$|E
50|$|An Extended Support Release {{includes}} {{continuity of}} support through 9 normal Firefox rapid <b>release</b> <b>cycles</b> (54 weeks), {{with the final}} 2 cycles overlapping the next version. ESR versions will jump from 10 to 17, then to 24 etc.|$|R

2500|$|Each channel {{has its own}} <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> and {{stability}} level. [...] The Stable channel updated roughly quarterly, with features and fixes that passed [...] "thorough" [...] testing in the Beta channel. Beta updated roughly monthly, with [...] "stable and complete" [...] features migrated from the Developer channel. The Developer channel updated once or twice per week and was where ideas and features were first publicly exposed [...] "(and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times".|$|E
2500|$|On July 22, 2010, Google {{announced}} it would ramp up {{the speed at which}} it releases new stable versions; the release cycles were shortened from quarterly to six weeks for major Stable updates. Beta channel releases now come roughly {{at the same rate as}} Stable releases, though approximately one month in advance, while Dev channel releases appear roughly once or twice weekly, allowing time for basic release-critical testing. This faster <b>release</b> <b>cycle</b> also brought a fourth channel: the [...] "Canary" [...] channel, updated daily from a build produced at 09:00 UTC from the most stable of the last 40 revisions. The name refers to the practice of using canaries in coal mines, so if a change [...] "kills" [...] Chrome Canary, it will be blocked from migrating down to the Developer channel, at least until fixed in a subsequent Canary build. Canary is [...] "the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds". Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences. This ensures that fallback functionality remains even when some Canary update may contain release-breaking bugs. It does not natively include the option to be the default browser, although on OS X it can be set through System Preferences. Canary was Windows-only at first; an OS X version was released on May 3, 2011.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} lightly {{promoted}} by the band and label Cooking Vinyl in the lead-up to its release, with {{the launch of the}} album being accompanied by a limited theatrical run of the band's live film [...] Magnetic North.
