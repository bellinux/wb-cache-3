50|$|Route 23 of the National Cycle Network {{follows a}} traffic-free <b>routing</b> through the <b>centre</b> of Green Park, {{on its way}} from Reading to Basingstoke.|$|R
50|$|The Goulburn Valley Highway was {{originally}} <b>routed</b> through the <b>centre</b> of Nagambie, bringing often {{large volumes of}} through traffic from Melbourne and Seymour en route to Shepparton and southern New South Wales.|$|R
5000|$|Montrose then {{ordered an}} {{infantry}} attack up the <b>centre,</b> <b>routing</b> the Covenanters who started fleeing {{back towards the}} town. Lord Burleigh's 2,500 defenders were soon overwhelmed - 160 men were killed. The Irish and Highland troops then looted the town and neighbouring villages.|$|R
50|$|Hector {{began his}} career in the youth ranks of W Connection before making his {{professional}} debut with the senior squad in 2008. Since then he {{has been one of the}} top midfielders in Trinidad and Tobago. While with Connection he has helped the club in capturing two domestic cups and the 2009 CFU Club Championship. During Connection's title run in the 2009 CFU Club Championship Hector recorded a hat-trick in a 5-0 <b>rout</b> over <b>Centre</b> Bath Estate. He ended as the competitions second leading scorer with 5 goals. On July 30, 2009 he scored the equalizing goal for Connection in a 2-2 draw with New York Red Bulls in a 2009-10 CONCACAF Champions League match.|$|R
2500|$|For {{commercial}} and operational reasons, the airlines had their flights <b>routed</b> through the <b>centre</b> corridor whenever possible {{as this was}} the shortest of the three air corridors, thereby minimising the time aircraft spent cruising at [...] At such a low altitude, modern jet aircraft could not attain an efficient cruising speed. This extended flight times and increased fuel consumption. Therefore, use of the centre air corridor was the least uneconomical option.|$|R
30|$|Although Recursive-based topologies {{provide a}} {{substantial}} remedy {{to the problems}} of the Tree-based topologies, they still have their own shortcomings. DCell is built based on low-level links thus it may cause a bottleneck. BCube is considered a topology with high wiring complexity. FiConn suffers from deficiencies in fault tolerance, network capacity, and long path traffic. FlatNet and SprintNet have low scalability compared to other topologies. The improved version of DPillar topology [111, 134] has the remedy for these problems by providing highly scalable network topology, good fault tolerance, improved bottleneck throughput and latency, and shortest path <b>routing</b> within data <b>centre</b> network.|$|R
5000|$|Ernst Casimir - {{commanding}} the Edmonds ( [...] Scottish [...] ) and the Van der Noot ( [...] Dutch [...] ) regiments, together with four cornets of cavalry and two guns - {{was ordered to}} seize the Leffinghen bridge but, as he arrived, he found the enemy already in its possession; Ernst deployed his force behind a ditch, hoping to fight a delaying action, but the Spaniards were already in great strength across the bridge and charged right home, piercing his <b>centre</b> <b>routing</b> the infantry at once while his cavalry fled in panic: the Scots were killed almost to a man, with the Dutch faring only slightly better, taking refuge in Ostend: for all purposes, Ernst's command had ceased to exist.|$|R
50|$|One of York's advisers, Sir Richard Croft, a local lord from Croft Castle, {{recommended}} positioning archers at {{the crossroads}} (now the A4110 and B4362 junction) in order to halt the Lancastrian advance. Pembroke's army was about a thousand men smaller than York's, and, being untried in battle at that point, may not have originally planned to fight, but by midday, {{it was clear that}} they would have to in order to cross the Lugg. The Lancastrians commenced the attack - Butler's ‘battle’ (division) led the first assault, forcing Edward’s right wing to retreat across the road, where this flank dissolved. Pembroke faced Edward’s centre division and was held off, but most decisively, Owen Tudor attempted an encirclement of the Yorkist left wing; his ‘battle’ was defeated and a <b>rout</b> commenced. Pembroke's <b>centre</b> then also broke and the battle was won. Owen Tudor’s men were now in full flight: some of them were followed as far as Hereford, approximately seventeen miles, and where Owen was himself captured and beheaded.|$|R
50|$|An 18 km {{railway link}} between New Plymouth and Waitara was {{completed}} in 1875; this later became the Waitara Branch. The next year, work began on a line south to Stratford, which was reached in 1879, followed by Hawera in 1881. This line, known as the Marton - New Plymouth Line, was completed on 23 March 1885, and when the Wellington - Manawatu Line of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company was opened on 3 November 1886, a direct railway link was established to Wellington. The original <b>routing</b> through the <b>centre</b> of the town was replaced in 1907 by an alignment along the foreshore, which remains today. The New Plymouth Express passenger train began operating on this route in December 1886. In 1926, it was augmented by the Taranaki Flyer for the run between New Plymouth and Wanganui, A direct railway route to Auckland was not established until 1932, when the Stratford - Okahukura Line was completed; the next year, when the line was handed over from the Public Works Department to the New Zealand Railways Department, the New Plymouth Night Express began operating to Auckland. All carriage trains were replaced by RM class Standard and 88 seater railcars by 1956. The Wanganui service ceased in 1959; the Auckland service was truncated to terminate in Taumarunui from 1971; and the Wellington service was cancelled on 30 July 1977. On 11 February 1978, the Taumarunui railcar {{was replaced by a}} passenger train, but it was ultimately cancelled on 21 January 1983. Since this date, the only passenger trains to operate to New Plymouth have been infrequent excursions operated by railway preservation societies.|$|R
