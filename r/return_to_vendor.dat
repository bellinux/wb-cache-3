40|$|Due {{to heavy}} {{transportation}} for single-setup multidelivery (SSMD) policy in supply chain management, this model assumes carbon emission cost {{to obtain a}} realistic behavior for world environment. The transportation for buyer and vendor is considered along with setup cost reduction by using an investment function. It is assumed that the shipment lot size of each delivery is unequal and variable. The buyer inspects all received products and <b>returns</b> defective items <b>to</b> <b>vendor</b> for reworking process. Because of this policy, end customers will only obtain nondefective items. The analytical optimization is considered to obtain the optimum solution of the model. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to reduce the total cost by considering carbon emission during the transportation. A numerical example, graphical representation, and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the model...|$|R
5000|$|In 1871, however, Edmunds began obtaining {{chocolate}} creams {{from the}} local confectioner, John Maynard. She took them home, laced them with strychnine, and <b>returned</b> them <b>to</b> the <b>vendor.</b> Maynard then sold them to the public, not knowing {{that they had been}} poisoned. Initially, Edmunds was obtaining the strychnine from a local chemist, Isaac Garrett, on the pretence that she needed it to poison stray cats. In an attempt to cover her tracks, she began paying young boys to purchase them for her. By this time several people in Brighton had become ill after eating the chocolates, but no one had connected the illnesses with the chocolates. However, in June 1871, 4-year-old Sidney Albert Barker, on holiday with his family, {{died as a result of}} eating chocolates from a shop called Maynard's. The Brighton coroner, David Black, ruled the death accidental. It was later confirmed that this was the only death from the poisoning.|$|R
