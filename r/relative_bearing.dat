25|$|The {{replacement}} of ground-based BTDF {{systems in the}} aviation role was due primarily to two factors. One was the move to ever-shorter wavelengths, which so shortened the required antennae that RDF could be carried out on a small aircraft receiver a few centimetres in length. Rotating loops were practical at these frequencies, and most aircraft used one. The second advance was {{the introduction of the}} automatic direction finder (ADF), which completely automated the RDF procedure. Once an ADF system was tuned to a station, either an airway beacon or an AM radio station, they continually moved a pointer to indicate the <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> with no further operator involvement.|$|E

50|$|In {{appearance}} and use, a pelorus resembles a compass or compass repeater, with sighting vanes or a sighting telescope attached, {{but it has}} no directive properties. That is, it remains at any relative direction {{to which it is}} set. It is generally used by setting 000° at the lubber's line. <b>Relative</b> <b>bearings</b> are then observed. They can be converted to bearings true, magnetic, grid, etc., by adding the appropriate heading. The direct use of <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> is sometimes of value. A pelorus is useful, for instance, in determining the moment at which an aid to navigation is broad on the beam. It is also useful in measuring pairs of <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> which can be used to determine distance off and distance abeam of a navigational aid.|$|R

60|$|It {{is hardly}} {{possible}} to conceive a language more perfect than the Greek. If you {{compare it with}} the modern European tongues, in the points of the position and <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> of the vowels and consonants on each other, and {{of the variety of}} terminations, it is incalculably before all in the former particulars, and only equalled in the last by German. But it is in variety of termination alone that the German surpasses the other modern languages as to sound; for, as to position, Nature seems to have dropped an acid into the language, when a-forming, which curdled the vowels, and made all the consonants flow together. The Spanish is excellent for variety of termination; the Italian, in this particular, the most deficient. Italian prose is excessively monotonous.|$|E
50|$|Absolute bearing {{refers to}} the angle between the {{magnetic}} North (magnetic bearing) or true North (true bearing) and an object. For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees. <b>Relative</b> <b>bearing</b> {{refers to the}} angle between the craft's forward direction, {{and the location of}} another object. For example, an object <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> of 0 degrees would be dead ahead; an object <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> 180 degrees would be behind. Bearings can be measured in mils or degrees.|$|E
50|$|An {{informal}} {{method of}} measuring a <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{by using the}} 'clock method'. In this method, the direction a vessel, aircraft or object is measured as if a clock face is laid over the vessel or aircraft, with the number twelve pointing forward. Something straight ahead is at 'twelve o'clock', while something directly {{off to the right}} is at 'three o'clock'. This method is only used for a <b>relative</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{groups of}} Clark 2 ̆ 7 s nutcrackers {{were trained to}} find buried seeds whose {{location}} was defined by a constant angle from two landmarks whose interlandmark distance and position in the room varied across trials. The first group had a landmark array that was always placed in the same orientation {{with respect to the}} walls, allowing the animals to use both <b>relative</b> and absolute <b>bearings.</b> The second group had a landmark array that rotated across trials so that only <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> could be used to locate the seeds. The birds in each group learned the task and transferred to new interlandmark distances both within and beyond the range of training distances.

50|$|Another {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{arises from the}} distinction between <b>relative</b> <b>bearing</b> and absolute bearing. One might think that another vessel {{which seems to be}} progressing from, perhaps, dead ahead to apparent movement down one's starboard side cannot result in a collision. This is not quite true. Because a vessel afloat can change its true heading (relative to north) without obvious detection (unless there are landmarks in sight) two vessels may collide even if one presents a substantially changing <b>relative</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> of fixed landmarks and other navigational aids {{is useful for}} the navigator because this information {{can be used on}} the nautical chart together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel and/or its speed, course, etc.|$|R

40|$|Matched Field Processing (MFP) is a {{beamforming}} technique {{which allows}} for the detection and localization of an acoustic source in range and depth using passive sonar. The performance of MFP in shallow water environments using a short aperture horizontal line array is investigated. Shallow water test cases are utilized to evaluate the effects of frequency, bottom type, <b>relative</b> target <b>bearing,</b> and sound speed profile on MFP performance. Data from RANGEX 1 - 92 is also utilized to test {{the performance of the}} eight nearest neighbor peak picker (ENNPP) and M of N tracker for a horizontal line array in a real ocean environment. It is shown that MFP performance is significantly better for higher frequencies, for more reflective, bottom types, and for <b>relative</b> target <b>bearings</b> away from the broadside beams. lt is also shown that the performance of plane wave beamformers is severely degraded in shallow water for <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> away from the broadside beams, particularly at higher frequencies.

In order to analyze bearing-constrained formations, we first present a bearing rigidity theory that is applicable to arbitrary dimensions.

In the first, each agent can measure the <b>relative</b> <b>bearings</b> to their neighbors in a global reference frame, while in the second problem, each agent can only measure the <b>bearings</b> and <b>relative</b> orientations of their neighbors in their local frames. For the two problems, we propose distributed bearing-only control laws and prove almost global stability for infinitesimally bearing rigid formations...|$|R

50|$|In {{aircraft}} navigation, {{an angle}} is normally measured from the aircraft's track or heading, in a clockwise direction.

50|$|A bearing can {{be taken}} on another vessel to aid piloting.

5000|$|In marine navigation, {{starboard}} bearings are 'green' {{and port}} bearings are 'red'. Thus, in ship navigation, a target directly off {{the starboard side}} would be 'Green090' or 'G090'. [...] This method is only used for a <b>relative</b> <b>bearing.</b> A navigator on watch does not always have a corrected compass available with which to give an accurate bearing. If available, the bearing might not be numerate. Therefore, every forty-five degrees of direction from north on the compass was divided into four 'points'. Thus, 32 points of 11.25° each makes a circle of 360°. An object at 022.5° relative would be 'two points off the starboard bow', an object at 101.25° relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.75° relative would be 'three points on the port quarter'.
