It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

[...] Sampson noted that the book included [...] "several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories". The reviewer for The Economist enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories [...] "make good reading... they are not new". For The New York Times, John Barkham thought that Fleming's foray into non-fiction produced [...] "mixed results". Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a [...] "choppy book" [...] that was [...] "no more than an interim report".|$|E

2500|$|At Marquette University, {{philosophy}} department chairman James South ordered {{graduate student}} Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed Dave Barry {{quote from the}} door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive.

I refer, of course, to the federal government.") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down.

2500|$|As President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: [...] "We all {{admit that}} the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that {{consequently}} {{there can be no}} real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. [...] The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. [...] But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. [...] For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, we must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{prototype}} appeared {{early in}} 1918, {{but it was}} overweight and handled poorly. It was quickly rebuilt with much larger two-bay wings, which improved the handling, but the prototype's performance remained disappointing, not even matching that of the aircraft {{it was intended to}} replace. The poor performance was in part due to the Clerget engine's failure to provide the expected power, producing only 200hp (149kW) instead of the expected 260hp (194kW). [...] The second prototype was fitted with a 360hp (267kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine, becoming the Bulldog Mk.II, with the first prototype becoming the Bulldog Mk.I. [...] However, although the Dragonfly gave much more power than the Clerget, it was hopelessly unreliable, with one test pilot stating that [...] "...

2500|$|The {{second part}} is finding e, the {{additional}} offset days {{that must be}} added to the date offset d to make it arrive at a Sunday. Since the week has 7 days, the offset must be in the range 0 to 6 and determined by modulo 7 arithmetic. e is determined by calculating [...] These constants may seem strange at first, but are quite easily explainable if we <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> operate under mod 7 arithmetic. To begin with, [...] ensures that we take care of the fact that weekdays slide for each year. A normal year has 365 days, but , so 52 full weeks make up one day too little. Hence, each consecutive year, the weekday [...] "slides one day forward", meaning if May 6 was a Wednesday one year, it is a Thursday the following year (disregarding leap years). Both b and c increases by one for an advancement of one year (disregarding modulo effects). The expression [...] thus increases by 6—but remember that this is the same as subtracting 1 mod 7. And to subtract by 1 is exactly what is required for a normal year – since the weekday slips one day forward we should compensate one day less to arrive at the correct weekday (i.e. Sunday). For a leap year, b becomes 0 and 2b thus is 0 instead of 8—which under mod 7, is another subtraction by 1—i.e., a total subtraction by 2, as the weekdays after the leap day that year slides forward by two days.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to think that he has invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are struggling up a hill.|$|E
