5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions.

Siregar notes that such a <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Reading and how reading defines {{characters}} is a focus within many {{plays and}} in Fielding's later works. In Love in Several Masques, the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society.

5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The <b>reading</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by visual aids {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E
30|$|The raw <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> {{filtered}} {{to generate}} clean reads by removal of adaptors, ambiguous reads with unknown nucleotides larger than 10 %, and low-quality reads {{where more than}} half of the bases’ qualities were less than five (Quality score[*]<[*] 5). The clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) Sequence Database with accession number SRR 6147052. Subsequently, the clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> de novo assembled by Trinity program (Grabherr et al. 2011) to generate non-redundant unigenes. In brief, all the clean <b>reads</b> <b>were</b> assembled into contigs with different k-mer values to assess optimal assembly range. The assembled transcripts were as reference sequences for transcript annotation and re-validated by aligning clean reads back to transcripts (Miller et al. 2012). Each of clean <b>reads</b> <b>was</b> re-mapped to reference sequences using Bowtie (Langmead 2010) with default parameters. The longest transcripts within each operationally assembled contig were defined as unigenes.|$|R

5|$|Local {{government}} for the town of <b>Reading</b> <b>is</b> principally provided by Reading Borough Council, a single level unitary authority without civil parishes. However some of the town's outer suburbs are in West Berkshire and Wokingham unitary authorities. These outer suburbs belong to civil parishes, in some cases with their own town status. Reading has elected at least one Member of Parliament to every Parliament since 1295. Historically, Reading was represented by the members for the Parliamentary Borough of Reading, and the parliamentary constituencies of Reading, Reading North, and Reading South. Since the 2010 general election, Reading and its surrounding area has been divided between the parliamentary constituencies of Reading East and Reading West. The whole of the town is within the multi-member South East England European constituency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reading</b> <b>is</b> a major {{junction}} {{point of the}} National Rail system, and hence Reading station is a major transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped {{at a cost of}} £850m, with grade separation of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station. Railway lines link Reading to both Paddington and Waterloo stations in London. Other stations in the Reading area are Reading West, Tilehurst and Earley. Green Park railway station is planned on the Reading to Basingstoke Line to serve Green Park Business Park.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reading</b> <b>is</b> {{the home}} of Reading Football Club, an {{association}} football club nicknamed The Royals, formed in 1871.

After winning the 2005–06 Football League Championship {{with a record of}} 106 points, Reading F.C. spent two seasons in the Premier League before being relegated to The Championship.
