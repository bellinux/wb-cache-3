Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the <b>room</b> <b>will</b> change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E

25|$|Dungeons maps {{consist of}} {{connecting}} rooms and corridors. As the player explores the map, the player will encounter chests or other devices which will, if opened or activated, summon monsters {{that must be}} defeated in order to progress in the dungeon path. At {{the end of each}} dungeon, there is a large room, which will usually have the boss enemy of the dungeon (sometimes escorted by a number of other enemies). Once the boss and its minions are defeated, a treasure room is opened, with the rewards for clearing the dungeon. The number of treasure chests inside the treasure <b>room</b> <b>will</b> be equal to the number of characters in the dungeon (at the time of dungeon creation). Players can thus explore the dungeons in teams. Some dungeons have special items called passes which allow harder (and sometimes easier) versions to be done. Some passes require a specific number of players to form the team.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{theorized that}} the {{application}} of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted [...] "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," [...] wiring {{the walls of a}} schoolroom and, [...] "saturating [...] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole <b>room</b> <b>will</b> thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'" [...] The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Silent Hill 4 {{follows the}} pattern {{set by the}} other games with a few key differences. The player has access {{to a variety of}} melee weapons but only two firearms. Certain melee weapons are breakable. Items which can be {{equipped}} such as talismans (which protect the player from damage from the hauntings in Henry's <b>room)</b> <b>will</b> eventually break after a short period of use. Another key difference in the combat system is that melee attacks may be [...] "charged" [...] before they are used, inflicting a greater amount of damage to an opponent than a quick attack.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult.

Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state of}} delicious near-panic as you wait to see what vicious demands the next <b>room</b> <b>will</b> place on your platforming skills."

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on {{the windows of the}} home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, [...] "This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to grapple with the terrible reality of a too common incident in daily life." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: [...] "It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output." [...] The review found the acting to be good, but found fault {{in the shadows of the}} actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: [...] "The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar <b>Room</b> <b>will</b> not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment." [...] Bowers states that the paper [...] "was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason to mention it now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Semmelweis's {{views were}} much more favorably {{received}} in the United Kingdom than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood.

[...] One {{of the first to}} respond to Semmelweis's 1848 communications was James Young Simpson, who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis would have known that the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.|$|E
2500|$|The Hall {{has seen}} a {{noticeable}} decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown {{and its relation to}} the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about [...] away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,Prior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that <b>room</b> <b>will</b> be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once.
