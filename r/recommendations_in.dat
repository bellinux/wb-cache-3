5|$|Both the Sui and Tang Dynasties {{had turned}} away from the more feudal culture of the {{preceding}} Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or <b>recommendations.</b> <b>In</b> the Tang period, Daoism and Buddhism reigned as core ideologies as well, and played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E

Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to be set up, with members from all groups involved in {{child protection}}. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners {{ultimately}} accepted {{all but one}} of {{the task}} force's <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> 1979. The group recommended maintaining the school's then-141-year-old tradition of all-male education. Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which had not yet been resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, the school board voted to make City a coeducational school. The board's action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and Galatea from the <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> his post-battle report. Captain Losack was {{particularly}} offended as Schomberg had implied that Galateas distress signal was an overreaction {{in the face}} of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear any suggestion of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims that opinion within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called for the {{establishment}} of a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
40|$|Photo <b>recommendation</b> <b>in</b> photo-sharing social {{networks}} like Flickr {{is an important}} problem.

Specifically we propose a model using the temporal dynamic user &# 039;favor&# 039; information to infer photo importance on Flickr. It is further combined with local community user ratings to improve the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) framework for photo recommendation.

5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted <b>recommendations</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy, more training was given to ship's crews in aircraft recognition; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes. Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft's bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.|$|E
