50|$|Pierre Robin {{syndrome}} (abbreviated to PRS, {{and also}} known as Pierre Robin sequence, Pierre Robin malformation, Pierre Robin anomaly or Pierre <b>Robin</b> <b>anomalad)</b> is a congenital condition of facial abnormalities in humans. PRS is a sequence, i.e. a chain of certain developmental malformations, one entailing the next. The three main features are cleft palate, retrognathia (abnormal positioning of the jaw or mandible) and glossoptosis (airway obstruction caused by backwards displacement of the tongue base). A genetic cause to PRS was recently identified. Pierre Robin sequence {{may be caused by}} genetic anomalies at chromosomes 2, 11, or 17.|$|E
40|$|We have {{presented}} {{a family in}} which three children (1 male and 2 females) who had two different fathers were affected with the Pierre <b>Robin</b> <b>anomalad.</b> The mother exhibits some of the characteristic stigmata of this syndrome which strongly suggests that an autosomal dominant from of the Pierre <b>Robin</b> <b>anomalad</b> exists with variable expressivity...|$|E
40|$|During a 10 -year period 55 {{patients}} with the <b>Robin</b> <b>anomalad</b> were admitted to the Liverpool Regional Cleft Palate Units. Fourteen (25 %) children died. All deaths were within 3 months of birth. Congenital abnormalities other than mandibular retrognathia and cleft palate were present in 14 (26 %) children. Peripheral limb defects were particularly common. Thirty children were recalled and reviewed to assess speech, hearing, growth, and educational achievement. There was a clear association between severe nasal escape of air in speech and atypical articulatory patterns. Almost half the children tested had abnormal articulation. Only 4 (13 %) of 30 children showed delayed language development. Half the children tested audiometrically showed a binaural handicap but in only one patient was this sufficiently severe to warrant amplification. There was no trend towards abnormalities of growth and only 2 children could be firmly classified as educationally subnormal...|$|E
