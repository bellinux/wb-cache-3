25|$|Yesterday your Ambassador petitioned my Ministers to memorialise me <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> {{trade with}} China, but his {{proposal}} {{is not consistent}} with our dynastic usage and cannot be entertained. Hitherto, all European nations, including your own country's barbarian merchants, have carried on their trade with our Celestial Empire at Canton. Such has been the procedure for many years, although our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its own borders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Regarding</b> <b>your</b> nation's {{worship of}} the Lord of Heaven, {{it is the same}} {{religion}} as that of other European nations. Ever since the beginning of history, sage Emperors and wise rulers have bestowed on China a moral system and inculcated a code, which from time immemorial has been religiously observed by the myriads of my subjects. There has been no hankering after heterodox doctrines. Even the European (missionary) officials in my capital are forbidden to hold intercourse with Chinese subjects...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, as <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> {{system of}} professors--" [...] began the {{chancellor}} slowly. He was never destined {{to get beyond}} such beginning.|$|R
6000|$|I {{hope you}} will receive this tribute from one who <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> [...] private {{friendship}} {{as one of the}} great privileges of his life.|$|R
60|$|As {{a brother}} I feel deeply; and <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> life as most {{valuable}} to the community, I the more rejoice in {{the prospect of}} your life being prolonged.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had much}} and of {{importance}} to say, which I do not care to write down on paper <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> affairs. May they mend! May my cursed fortunes, too, better themselves, is the prayer of-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Wix," [...] {{said that}} young lady, [...] "has some undiscoverable reason for <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> mother's hold on you as {{strengthened}} {{by the fact that}} she's about to marry. I wonder then--on that system--what our visitor will say to your father's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I am {{surprised}} {{to see you in}} the very last place where you ought to be, if you <b>regard</b> <b>your</b> safety,' observed Glossin, coolly.|$|R
60|$|Of course I <b>regard</b> <b>your</b> time as valuable, and {{consider}} it so when I {{ask you if}} you could devote any of it to this purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] Wingate replied---"but I {{should think}} it probable, {{if the truth}} dawns upon our friends--that no brake will be necessary.--As <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> own affairs, Harrison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Might I not say {{the same}} to you <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> friend, the old Frenchman?" [...] {{returned}} Renshaw. [...] "What if I were to confess to you that I lately suspected him of knowing the secret, and of trying to gain your assistance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--is not a fit {{companion}} for Mrs. Osborne and her son," [...] Dobbin went on: [...] "and I may {{add that}} there are people here who know you, and who profess to know that <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> conduct about which I don't even wish to speak before--before Mrs. Osborne." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{respect to}} what you {{communicate}} <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> not having received an answer to your friendly epistle, I became perfectly astonished, as a reply was written from Mohadree. It may be owing to {{the danger of the}} road that it never arrived,--not to the smallest neglect on my side [or of mine].|$|E
60|$|Don Jer. Then, pray sir, in future, let <b>your</b> <b>regard</b> for <b>your</b> father {{make you}} hold your tongue.|$|R
6000|$|... "And as <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> brother, have a care, young lady," [...] Lassen growled. [...] "If any one's in danger, it's he. He'll {{be lucky}} if he saves his own skin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{so far as}} <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> {{associations}} with Sir Timothy," [...] was the deprecating reply. [...] "If you will excuse me, sir, this is where I should like to descend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If," [...] said Mr. Windibrook, with {{a sickly}} smile, [...] "you are {{questioned}} <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> father's affairs, {{you may remember}} his peculiar and utterly unsolicited gift of a certain sum towards a new organ, to which I alluded to-day. You can say that he always expressed great liberality towards the church, {{and it was no}} surprise to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is hardly}} fair," [...] Neal finally said. [...] "All {{the time we}} have been telling you of our adventures, and not one word have we heard <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> movements. I would like to know where the three boats we out-sailed went to on the night after leaving the yacht, and where this {{schooner}} was found?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You might assert," [...] he said, [...] "that {{your father}} had taken service with some rajah on the plain, {{and that you}} had there learned to speak the language. In this way, you would avoid having to answer any {{difficult}} questions <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> native place; but as to that, you can get up something of the geography before you leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens! Mr. Bullen, {{you have}} given me quite a turn! We had all <b>regarded</b> <b>your</b> death as certain; and your name {{appeared}} {{in the list of}} casualties, five months ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Sir James, if I seem to <b>regard</b> <b>your</b> kind {{proposals}} with indifference. Indeed, I am sincerely grateful, {{especially for}} the motive that actuates you--I mean regard for my dear father's memory--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will soon}} be {{accustomed}} to it," [...] Gervaise said, with a smile, [...] "and then you will look upon your captivity as a dream, just as you then <b>regarded</b> <b>your</b> past life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{not afraid}} to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln, you had better come. If you want {{information}} <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> uncle Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You must come alone. Bring this with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a week he}} awaited an answer, waited anxiously, {{though he}} kept reassuring himself that old Pilkings had promised to keep the job open for him. He {{received}} a reply. But it was from Pilkings's son. It informed him that Pilkings, père, was rather ill, with grippe, and that until he recovered [...] "no action can be taken <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> valued proposition in letter of recent date." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{lie down}} and take your rest, giving no heed to {{anything}} you may hear in the night. Regardless of what takes place, hold your peace, and I'll answer for it {{that no one will}} suspect there are any hiding here. When the day comes I shall strive to learn what I may <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> comrade, and meet you again at the first opportunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{have found}} it so,’ {{returned}} the Prince, ‘with every class of my acquaintance. But, madam, I pray you to be seated. My business is of a delicate order, and <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> daughter.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have an {{excellent}} agent," [...] said Dan; [...] "retain her services {{as long as you}} can. She possesses the great advantage of having no conscience, as <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> affairs. Women never have where they--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} it so," [...] {{returned}} the prince, [...] "with every class of my acquaintance. But, madam, I pray you to be seated. My business is of a delicate order, and <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Bly," [...] {{she said}} deliberately, [...] "Ellen has {{just told me}} that your voice has been heard in {{conversation}} with some one in this room late last night. Up to this moment I have foolishly allowed my daughter to persuade me that certain infamous scandals <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> conduct here were false. I must ask you as a gentleman to let me pass now and satisfy myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And such {{proved to}} be the case. All, as you see, sir, is now well. After your {{departure}} on the bicycle, the various estranged parties agreed so heartily in their abuse of you that the ice, if I may use the expression, was broken, and it was not long before Mr. Glossop was walking beneath the trees with Miss Angela, telling her anecdotes of your career at the university in exchange for hers <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> childhood; while Mr. Fink-Nottle, leaning against the sundial, held Miss Bassett enthralled with stories of your schooldays. Mrs. Travers, meanwhile, was telling Monsieur Anatole----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought it}} best to see you <b>regarding</b> <b>your</b> {{confirmation}} yesterday; and my reason for taking a more active step with you than I should otherwise have done is that I have some interest in you through having known your father when we were undergraduates. His rooms {{were on the same}} staircase with mine at All Angels, and we were friendly till time and affairs separated us even more completely than usually happens. However, about your presenting yourself for confirmation.' (The Bishop's voice grew stern.) 'If I had known yesterday morning what I knew twelve hours later, I wouldn't have confirmed you at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I meant a {{different}} kind of love from that. Do you feel that <b>your</b> <b>regard</b> for <b>your</b> niece is sufficient to fill your heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{any length}} of time which your ladyship may please to command," [...] said Mr. Cargill, [...] "provided the subject <b>regard</b> <b>your</b> ladyship's own affairs or mine,--could I suppose these last for a moment likely to {{interest}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Jarvis, rather humbly, [...] "I am sensible, Mr Moseley, I {{was very}} wrong as <b>regards</b> <b>your</b> sister; but don't {{you think it}} a little odd in a soldier not to fight when {{properly}} called upon?" ...|$|R
