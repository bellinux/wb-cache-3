2500|$|The Flatiron Building {{has become}} an icon of New York City, and the public {{response}} to it was enthusiastic, but the critical response to {{it at the time}} was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. Montgomery Schuyler, editor of Architectural Record, said that its [...] "awkwardness [...] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation." [...] He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: [...] " [...] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one <b>roll</b> <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> without overlapping the windows, with light close {{in front of him and}} close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Prismatic Fountain, Denver, Colorado - May 30, 1908 [...] "Mayor Robert W. Speer and F.W. Darlington, an {{engineer}} with the Denver Interurban Railway, dedicate the new marvel in City Park Lake--The Prismatic Electric Fountain. The Fountain features electric lighting effects {{that have not}} been seen before by the public. Eleven columns of brightly coloured light stream through the dramatic changing patterns of water. High in the north tower of the City Park Pavilion, an operator sits at a <b>roll</b> <b>top</b> <b>desk,</b> moving levers to undulate the twelve sets of water features and make the columns of light change color to the sounds of the Denver Municipal Band." ...|$|E
50|$|II Akt: The {{second act}} shows {{more of the}} general life of the city, {{beginning}} {{with the opening of}} gates, shutters, windows, doors, people busy cleaning, fruit carts, children going to school. Mailmen start their day, shops open. Different classes of people are seen, some mounting buses and streetcars, while wealthy men enter chauffeured private cars. The city is bustling with activity. Office workers prepare to start their day, as <b>roll</b> <b>top</b> <b>desks</b> open, people set out their pens, paper, open books, remove the cases from typewriters, and a bank of typists quickly erupt into activity. Keys on keyboards spiral around one another, and a montage of a spinning hypnotist's wheel, monkeys biting one another, telephone operators, machinery, and dogs fighting is mixed into the general busy work of the office, building quickly to a crescendo... phone receivers hang up. End of the second act.|$|R

Following his decision to join active politics in 2011, Bawa resigned his positions in all the businesses.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{round the}} house, Poirot {{is pleased with}} the dead man's order and method, except for one particular: {{the key to a}} <b>roll</b> <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> has been affixed, not to a neat label, but instead to a dirty envelope. After a long search, Poirot {{declares}} himself beaten and is about to return to London when he remembers the visit to the tradesmen. He rushes back to the house and holds up the opened envelope to the fire. Faint writing in invisible ink appears, which is a will dated after the one in Violet's possession and leaving everything to her. The two wills signed by the Bakers were a ruse. The tradesmen in town must have signed the true last will, which Marsh turned into an envelope attached to a key. This was left as a deliberate clue. According to Poirot, Miss Marsh proved her superior intelligence by employing Poirot to solve the case.|$|E

50|$|In 1893, Cutter {{submitted}} {{a letter to}} the trustees that he would not seek to renew his contract {{at the end of the}} year. Fortunately for him, there was an opportunity in Northampton, Massachusetts. Judge Charles E. Forbes left a considerable amount of money to the town to start a library. This was Cutter’s chance to institute his ideas from the ground up. He developed a cataloging system called the expansive classification system. It was to have seven levels of classification, each with increasing specificity. Thus small libraries who did not like having to deal with unnecessarily long classification numbers could use lower levels and still be specific enough for their purpose. Larger libraries could use the more specific tables since they needed to be more specific to keep subjects separate. Unfortunately, he died in 1903 before he could finish. At Forbes, Cutter set up the art and music department and encouraged children of nearby schools to exhibit their art. He also established branch libraries and instituted a traveling library system much like the bookmobile. Today, Charles Ammi Cutter might be surprised to see his own portrait hanging over the reference librarians' desk in the Forbes Library in Northampton. His <b>roll</b> <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> is also in the office currently occupied by the recently elected director of the library.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some places}} the slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> {{is known as}} a [...] "bureau" [...] desk, and in others it goes under the name of slope-front desk. In the United States, the slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> is {{sometimes}} called a Governor Winthrop desk, in memory of John Winthrop, the 17th century governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As Winthrop died in 1647, he had no actual connection to this style of desk, which originated in the 18th century and is especially associated with Chippendale. The name [...] "Winthrop" [...] was attached to this kind of desk by the Winthrop Furniture Co. of Boston, Massachusetts, who offered their [...] "Gov. Winthrop" [...] desk in 1924, during the colonial revival period.|$|R

50|$|The slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> is {{a direct}} {{morphological}} descendant. In a sense the Spanish Bargueño (or Vargueño) desk is a distant cousin of the two piece version, since the Bargueño is also {{made up of a}} portable desk and a stand constructed specially for it, using the same materials and style.|$|R
50|$|The slant-top desk {{has also}} been mass-produced in a great {{quantity}} of sub-forms and materials. For instance, some slant <b>top</b> <b>desks</b> have very crude chains or levers to hold the desktop in an open working position, while others have elegant sliders ("lopers") which are manually or automatically extended to give support.|$|R

[...] He slid back the <b>roll</b> <b>top,</b> and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers.

50|$|Unlike the rolltop desk, the tambour desk uses straight, {{perfectly}} vertical rows of shutters, and {{the work}} surface rests on a few drawers, which in turn are supported by short legs instead of pedestals. In addition, half of the desktop folds back on itself when not in use. The desktop is supported by sliders, like a secretary desk or a slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> when it is unfolded.|$|R
5000|$|The slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> can be {{considered}} in some ways as the ancestor or the little brother of the secretary desk for it is, for all practical purposes, a secretary desk without the massive bookcase on top of it. It can also {{be considered}} as the descendant, in form, of the desk on a frame, which was a form of portable desk in earlier eras.|$|R

50|$|When closed, the {{secretary}} desk {{looks like a}} cross between a commode-dresser, a slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> and a book case. The secretary {{is one of the most}} common antique desk forms and has been endlessly reproduced and copied for home use in the last hundred years. Among home desk forms, it is the tallest, biggest and heaviest, excluding wall units and modular desks which typically can be disassembled for moving, or some of the biggest of the armoire desks, which are usually delivered unassembled.|$|R
5000|$|Other armoire desks have {{an easily}} movable, often hinged, work surface {{which must be}} cleared of {{documents}} and other items in order to close the doors. This kind of armoire desk is a morphological descendant of the famous Wooton desk by its size and by the necessity to constantly store papers to shut it. There is also the alternative of always leaving it open, given the trouble involved. The fall front desk or [...] "secrétaire à abattant", and the slant <b>top</b> <b>desk</b> are also related.|$|R

50|$|Like the slant <b>top</b> <b>desk,</b> {{the main}} work surface is a hinged {{piece of wood}} which is flat when open and oblique when raised to enclose {{secondary}} work surfaces such as small shelves, small drawers and nooks stacked {{in front of the}} user. Thus, like the Wooton desk, the fall front desk and others with a hinged desktop, and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like the rolltop desk or the cylinder desk all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface before closing up.|$|R
