25|$|From 1979, a new Conservative {{government}} took a strongly sceptical policy to {{all forms of}} labour law and regulation. During the 1980s ten major Acts gradually reduced the autonomy of trade unions and the legality of industrial action. Reforms to the internal structure of unions mandated that representatives be elected and a ballot is taken before a strike, that no worker could strike in sympathetic secondary action with workers with a different employer, and that employers could not run a closed shop system of requiring all workers to join the <b>recognised</b> <b>union.</b> The wage councils were dismantled. A public campaign against the merits of unions paralleled the decline of membership and collective agreement coverage to under 40 per cent. In addition, the government opted out of the EU Social Chapter in the Maastricht Treaty. In 1997 the new Labour government brought the UK into the EU's Social Chapter, which {{has served as the}} source for most reform in UK law since that time. Domestic led reform was minimal. The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 established a country-wide minimum wage, but did not attempt to reinvigorate the Wage Board system. The Employment Relations Act 1999 introduced a 60-page procedure requiring employers to compulsorily recognise and bargain with a union holding support among workers, though union membership remained at a level steadily declining below 30 per cent.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, if workers organise a union, {{their last}} resort {{to get an}} {{employer}} {{to the bargaining table}} was to threaten collective action, including exercising their right to strike. In addition, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 Schedule A1 contains a statutory procedure for workers to become recognised for collective bargaining. To use this procedure, first, a trade union must be certified as independent and the workplace must have a minimum of 21 workers. Second, there must not already be a recognised trade union. This caused particular problems in R (National Union of Journalists) v Central Arbitration Committee as the Court of Appeal held that a <b>recognised</b> <b>union</b> which lacked any significant support could block the bargaining claim of a union with support. Third, the union must identify an appropriate [...] "bargaining unit" [...] for a collective agreement, which a government body named the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) can verify and approve. On the union's proposal, the CAC must take into account whether the proposed bargaining unit is [...] "compatible with effective management", as well as the employer's views and the characteristics of the workers. The CAC has broad discretion, and may only be challenged by an employer under the general principles of natural justice in administrative law. In R (Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd) v CAC the Court of Appeal found that the CAC's determination that the appropriate bargaining unit was all of Kwik Fit's workers within the M25 London ring road. The union's recommendation is the starting point and the CAC is entitled to prefer this over an employer's alternative, especially since the employer will often attempt to define a larger [...] "unit" [...] so as to limit the likelihood of union members holding greater majority support. Fourth, once the bargaining unit is defined, the CAC may be satisfied that there is majority support for the union to represent the workforce and will make a recognition declaration. Alternatively, fifth, it may determine that the position is less clear and that a secret ballot is in the interests of good industrial relations. Sixth, if a ballot takes place both the union and the employer should have access to employees, and be able to distribute their arguments, and threats, bribes or undue influence are forbidden. Seventh, when a vote takes place the union must have at least 10 per cent membership, and win 50 per cent of the vote, or least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote. If the union wins a majority, the eighth and final step is that if the parties do not reach an agreement the CAC will regulate the collective agreement for the parties and the result will be legally binding. This contrasts to the basic position, under TULRCA 1992 section 179, which presumes that collective agreements are not intended to create legal relations. The long, problematic procedure, was partly based on the model of the US National Labor Relations Act 1935, but because of its cumbersome nature it strongly encourages the parties to seek voluntary agreement in the spirit of cooperation and good faith.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between unions and earnings dispersion using data from 1980, 1984 and 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys. The initial focus is on the cross-section relationship using the 1990 data unionised establishments are seen to have lower earnings dispersion for skilled and semi-skilled workers. Second, within-establishment earnings dispersion is lower in 1990 amongst plants with <b>recognised</b> <b>unions.</b> We then use all three surveys to see to what extent the changing nature of union structure in the UK economy has contributed to the rise in earnings in inequality for semi-skilled workers. Our findings point to an important increase in the gap between dispersion in union and non-union plants between 1980 and 1990. For semi-skilled workers, the decline in the share of plants with <b>recognised</b> <b>unions</b> can account for almost 20 per cent of the coincident rise in earnings inequality. The bulk of the overall rise in earnings inequality is, however, down to a large increase in earnings dispersion across non-union establishments...|$|R

According to Walmart, workers could either opt into the new schedule or keep their original shifts, but {{pointed out that the}} new scheduling, which Wal-Mart claim most workers they had contacted supported, allowed employees to work more shifts if they choose. Chinese Walmart staff accused the country’s only officially <b>recognised</b> <b>union,</b> the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), as being apathetic to their cause and unreceptive to workers’ opinions. The ACFTU had previously signed an agreement with the company in 2006 that allowed Walmart to set up management-controlled unions instead. The union asked for the workers to return to their jobs. Reuters reported that by July 8, 2016, the striking workers returned to work when management agreed to consider their protests. Later it was reported that OUR Walmart provided strategic advice to the Wal-Mart Chinese Workers Association (WCWA) prior to the strikes in China.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 1998 (WERS 98) is the fourth {{in a series of}} surveys which began in 1980 (previously known as the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, or WIRS - the name was changed in 1998 to better reflect the content of the present survey). Its primary aim is to provide statistically reliable, nationally representative data on the current state of workplace relations and employment practices in Britain. The WERS 98 Data Dissemination Service was established in October 1999 at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The Service was funded for a two year period by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), and closed in January 2002. All major activity has now ceased, but the web site will continue to remain live for the benefit of WERS 98 users and those interested in WERS 98. Users may also be interested in WERS 2004 : the WERS 2004 study is held at the UKDA under SN 5294, and a similar analysis and dissemination service, the WERS 2004 Information and Advice Service (WIAS) has also been established. For the seventh edition (October 2007), a file containing updated Travel-to-Work Area (TTWA) variables was deposited, with accompanying documentation, to replace the previous file 'local 98 '. See documentation for further details. Main Topics : The WERS 98 cross-section survey contains data from interviews held with managers and worker representatives, as well as information from a self-completion questionnaire which employees in the selected workplace were invited to complete. The sample covered British workplaces with at least 10 employees. Managers participating in the survey were usually the most senior manager at the workplace with responsibility for employment relations. They were asked mainly factual questions covering {{a wide range of issues}} that deal with the employment relationship. Some examples include: recruitment and training; consultation and communication; worker representation; payment systems; equal opportunities; health and safety; flexibility and performance; change; and attitudes to work. The cross-sectional management questionnaire for this survey also comprises Wave 1 of the Workplace Employee Relations Survey, 2004 : Panel Survey, 1998 - 2004 (WERS 2004). Wave 2 of the 1998 - 2004 panel is held with the rest of the WERS 2004 data under SN 5294. Worker representatives were interviewed where there was a lay representative of a <b>recognised</b> <b>union</b> at the workplace or, if there was no <b>recognised</b> <b>union,</b> with the senior employee representative of any joint consultative committee operating at the workplace. An interview was only conducted with the permission of management. Representatives were asked about the duties they performed when dealing with management and employees. Employees were randomly selected by the interviewer from a list of all employees provided by the management respondent. A maximum of 25 employees were selected, however, in workplaces with fewer than 25 employees, all were asked to complete the questionnaire. Questions asked were predominantly concerned with the employees attitudes and impressions of work covering issues such as satisfaction and commitment.
