5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> solar radiation and the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.|$|E
5|$|Aaliyah is an R and neo soul {{record with}} music drawing from funk, hip hop, {{alternative}} rock, and electronica, among other styles.
