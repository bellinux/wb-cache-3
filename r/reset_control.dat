40|$|It is well-appreciated that Bode 2 ̆ 7 s gain-phase {{relationship}} {{places a}} hard limitation on performance tradeoffs in linear, time-invariant feedback control systems, Specifically, {{the need to}} minimize the open-loop high-frequency gain often competes with low-frequency loop gain and phase margin constraints. Our focus on <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems is motivated by recent work that showed its potential to improve this situation. ^ The basic concept in <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> is to reset the state of a linear controller to zero whenever its input meets a threshold. Typical reset controllers include the so-called Clegg integrator and the first-order reset element. The Clegg integrator has a describing function similar to the frequency response of a linear integrator but with only 38. 1 ° phase lag. This was the original motivation. ^ <b>Reset</b> <b>control</b> is a hybrid control scheme. It resembles a number of popular non-linear control strategies including relay control, sliding-mode control and switching control. A common feature to these {{is the use of}} a switching surface to trigger change in control signal. Distinctively, <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> employs the same (linear) control law {{on both sides of the}} switching surface. Resetting occurs when the system trajectory impacts this surface. The reset action renders a discontinuity (a jump) in the system trajectory. This behavior is not invertible. The reset action can be alternatively viewed as the injection of judiciously-timed impulses of state-dependent magnitude into an otherwise linear, time-invariant feedback system. ^ In this dissertation we analyze stability and steady-state performance of <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems. First, we provide an example of <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> overcoming a limitation of linear feedback. Secondly, we present our main stability results: a necessary and sufficient condition for quadratic stability that under a certain assumption on reset controller dynamics implies uniform bounded-input bounded-state stability. We show that this condition is satisfied for a large and important class of <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> systems. We also introduce a passivity-based approach to stability. Next, we give our steady-state performance results. In doing this, we establish internal model and superposition principles, existence and local stability of periodic solutions due to sinusoidal sensor noise excitation.

40|$|In {{high-tech}} industry (sub) nanometre precision motion control is essential. For example wafer scanners, used for production of integrated circuits, {{have to provide}} (sub) nanometre precision positioning whilst satisfying challenging requirements on speed at the same time. It is in demanding cases like this that different requirements begin to conflict with each other. A fundamental trade-off between robustness and performance exists as an inevitable result of the waterbed effect in linear control. PID controllers, which have been an industry-standard for many years, do not satisfy the ever increasing demands. In this MSc thesis a novel <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> synthesis method is proposed: CRONE <b>reset</b> <b>control,</b> which combines a robust fractional CRONE controller (Commande Robuste d’Ordre Non-Entier) with non-linear <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> to overcome waterbed effect. In CRONE control, robustness is achieved against gain deviations by creation of constant phase behaviour around bandwidth {{with the use of}} fractional operators. The use of fractional operators also introduces more freedom in shaping the open- loop frequency response, allowing fractional factors in Bode’s gain-phase relation. However, waterbed effect remains, which motivates introduction of non-linear <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> in the CRONE design. In <b>reset</b> <b>control,</b> controller states are reset when the error between output- and reference- signal is zero. In frequency domain, using describing function analysis it is predicted that reset filters generate less phase lag for similar gain behaviour. For instance, a reset integrator gives a phase lag of about 38 degrees, which is 52 degrees less compared to the linear integrator. This allows for relief from Bode’s gain-phase relation, breaking aforementioned trade-offs. In the new controller design, reset phase advantage is approximated using describing function analysis and used to achieve better open-loop shape. New design rules for CRONE <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> have been developed in this thesis. Three different <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> strategies have been investigated: integrator reset, lag reset and lead- lag/lag-lead reset. For these controllers, a two-degree-of-freedom non-linearity tuning CRONE <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> structure has been developed. This control structure has been implemented digitally within a MATLAB/Simulink environment on a Lorentz-actuated (dual) precision stage via a real-time dSPACE DS 1103 controller interface. For the implemented controllers sufficient quadratic stability has been shown using the Hβ-condition. It has been shown that simulated frequency responses using describing function correspond well to experimental identified frequency responses. Moreover, frequency domain measurements have shown that better performance for CRONE <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> can be achieved for same phase margin compared to linear CRONE. Relief from both waterbed effect and Bode’s gain-phase relation has been accomplished. Furthermore, for the same bandwidth, average noise reduction between 1. 79 dB and 3. 93 dB has been attained at a number of distinct frequencies above bandwidth. In the fine stage separately and also in dual stage configuration, tracking of a fourth-order input-shaped reference signal (with second-order- and fourth-order feedforward respectively) showed improvement in CRONE <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> compared to linear CRONE. In the dual stage configuration, after decoupling fine stage and coarse stage, tracking performance of a linear CRONE controller has been compared to a CRONE reset controller. In both cases the same linear CRONE- 2 controller with a bandwidth of 80 Hz and phase margin of 50 ° was applied to the coarse stage. On the fine stage a CRONE- 1 lag-lead controller was applied with a bandwidth of 150 Hz and a phase margin of 55 °. RMS error for a triangular scanning wave with maximal acceleration of 0. 25 m/s 2 and maximal velocity of 75 mm/s over a stroke of 2 cm, was reduced from 929. 8 nm to 443. 7 nm.

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades, linear time-invariant (LTI) control design {{techniques}} have been developed which can achieve stringent performance specifications {{in the presence of}} process uncertainties. However, all such LTI techniques are limited by the Bode gain-phase relation. Specifically, an LTI controller 2 ̆ 7 s high-frequency magnitude can not be designed arbitrarily but depends on the low-frequency specifications and stability constraints. Qualitatively speaking, 2 ̆ 2 large 2 ̆ 2 low-frequency magnitudes have to go with 2 ̆ 2 large 2 ̆ 2 high-frequency magnitudes, which make the closed-loop system more sensitive to sensor noise and high-frequency modeling errors. This phenomenon is called 2 ̆ 2 cost of feedback 2 ̆ 2, for which LTI control theory can not offer a remedy. ^ In this dissertation, a <b>reset</b> <b>control</b> design method is studied, which is based on ideas originated in the 19502 ̆ 7 s. The nonlinear controller is composed of a reset network, whose states are reset to zero when its input crosses zero, cascaded with a linear network. Using describing function analysis, the low-frequency performance of this nonlinear system {{is similar to that of}} a linear system where the resetting mechanism is not used. However, the control bandwidth is reduced, thereby reducing the 2 ̆ 2 cost of feedback 2 ̆ 2 beyond the limitation imposed by the LTI system 2 ̆ 7 s gain-phase relation.
