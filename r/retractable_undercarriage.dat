5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} aluminium alloys. High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage</b> has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage.</b> The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E

50|$|The Standard Class was {{introduced}} in the late fifties {{as an alternative to the}} increasingly heavy, difficult to fly and costly Open Class ships of that time. Striving for affordability and simplicity, the original standard class rules restricted the span to 15 metres and ruled out <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> flight-disposable ballast, radios and lift-enhancing devices such as flaps. The archetypal embodiment of these rules is the Ka 6.|$|R

50|$|A {{radius rod}} (also called a radius arm or a torque arm) is a {{suspension}} link intended to control wheel {{motion in the}} longitudinal (fore-aft) direction. The link is connected (with a rubber or solid bushing) on {{one end to the}} wheel carrier or axle, on the other to the chassis or unibody of the vehicle. Radius rods are also sometimes used in aircraft with fixed (non <b>retractable)</b> <b>undercarriages.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Grumman F2F was a single-engine, biplane fighter {{aircraft}} with <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage,</b> {{serving as}} the standard fighter for the United States Navy between 1936 and 1940. It was designed for both carrier- and land-based operations.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan 7W Executive was an Executive class cabin {{monoplane}} aircraft {{produced by}} the Spartan Aircraft Company during the late 1930s and early 1940s.

25|$|The Tudor was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with four}} engines, a single fin and rudder and a <b>retractable</b> tailwheel <b>undercarriage</b> (in its original configurations).|$|R
50|$|The Golden Arrow was {{intended}} to be of conventional monoplane configuration, with <b>retractable</b> tricycle <b>undercarriage</b> and a T-tail. It was largely of composite construction.|$|R
50|$|For aircraft, {{the landing}} gear {{supports}} the craft {{when it is not}} flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage. Wheels are typically used but skids, skis, floats or a combination of these and other elements can be deployed depending both on the surface and on whether the craft only operates vertically (VTOL) or is able to taxi along the surface. Faster aircraft usually have <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> which folds away during flight to reduce air resistance or drag.|$|R
25|$|When the USAAC {{announced}} a competition {{for a new}} single-seat fighter in 1935, Seversky sent the SEV-2XP, confident it would win despite being a two-seater. However, the aircraft was damaged on 18 June 1935 during its transit to the fly-offs at Wright Field. To compete with the Curtiss Model 75, a single-seat aircraft with <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage,</b> Seversky rebuilt the aircraft into the single seat SEV-1XP, replacing the SEV-2XP's fixed landing gear with a <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage</b> where the mainwheels retracted backwards into the wing, and an 850hp (634kW) R-1820-G5 replacing the -F3 of the SEV-2XP. The SEV-1XP was delivered to Wright Field on 15 August for evaluation, which was generally successful, although the Cyclone failed to deliver its rated power and the SEV-1XP only reached 289mph (465km/h) rather that the 300mph (483km/h) predicted by Seversky.|$|E
25|$|The Yokosuka MXY-5 was a Japanese {{military}} glider {{produced for}} the Imperial Japanese Navy during the World War II. The glider consisted of fabric-wrapped plywood covering a tubular steel frame. The design also featured a <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage</b> {{as well as}} an emergency skid. The design was flight tested in 1942. Only 12 were produced and none were used operationally.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries of {{the aging}} design {{eventually}} began in April 1935, continuing until March 1937, {{with a total of}} 138 being built. An improved version, the Amiot 144 was built to meet 1933 requirement for a Multiplace de Combat, combining the same fuselage and a similar wing with a <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriage.</b> First flying on 18 January 1936, only one was built.|$|E
25|$|The AIR-12 {{was fitted}} with a <b>retractable</b> {{tail-wheel}} <b>undercarriage</b> with the main-wheels retracting inwards, operated by cables, torque shaft and hand crank in the pilots cockpit.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of monocoque construction and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as <b>retractable</b> <b>undercarriages,</b> fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|R
25|$|The Percival Merganser was a light, civil {{transport}} {{of the late}} 1940s. It was a twin-engine, high-wing monoplane of all-metal, stressed skin construction with <b>retractable</b> tricycle <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|R
