500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] is a pretty sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{have always}} the {{alternative}} of marrying somebody else, you know, Mr. Payne," [...] {{she said with}} her most provoking and bewitching smile; [...] "but if you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to marry me, you know the conditions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fergus {{is really}} an {{excellent}} little boy, and Gillian---poor Gillian- --I think she <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> more experience, and was only too innocent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{she will}} act as she chooses; but I think she <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to see what amount of opposition--- No, not that, but of estrangement it would cause.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't want me!" [...] she cried. [...] "You don't want {{me because}} I'm not a boy! I might have {{expected}} it. Nobody ever <b>did</b> <b>want</b> me. I might have known {{it was all too}} beautiful to last. I might have known nobody <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> me. Oh, what shall I do? I'm going to burst into tears!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, Dicky. If we {{win this}} {{campaign}} I will certainly ask {{for you as}} adjutant. I shall be awfully {{glad to have you}} with me, and I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> an adjutant for each battalion.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please, aunt," [...] she had begged, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{to stay at}} {{home this}} evening;" [...] and Lady Thurwell {{had not been able to}} {{withstand}} her niece's imploring tone, so she had gone alone.|$|E
6000|$|... “Millicent {{asked me}} to get {{her a couple of}} {{decanters}} if there were any going really cheap,” she explained on the way, “and I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a salad bowl. I can come back to the napkins later on.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{felt the}} {{question}} was a mistake as he was uttering it. Your really injured innocent would have called all the elements to witness {{that he was a}} millionaire. But {{it was too late to}} try that now. And, besides, he <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to know how Mr Thompson had got to hear of this skeleton in his cupboard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel was}} a {{moderate}} success and received critical praise. The San Francisco Chronicle {{called it a}} [...] "darkly eerie and winning new novel", and The New York Times wrote that the novel [...] "provides gratifyingly exact and telling portraits of the kids themselves. Solid plotting guarantees that the reader <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to learn who wins when the ballots are finally counted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly. [...] "Well, I'm real {{thankful to}} hear it. Sometimes I've {{wondered}} if she <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> me around at all--she never let me think so. You must have thawed her out more than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you. Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl! I never see Dick Moore but I want to run a knife clean through him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At the Plaza! Oh, Ginger, you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{somebody}} {{to look after}} you. Squandering your pennies like that... Well, don't talk any more now. It's so late and I'm so tired. I'll come and see you to-morrow. Good night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First and {{foremost}} commenced," [...] Mr. Clodd, as he laid aside his hat, [...] "it is quite understood that you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{to get rid}} of him? What's that?" [...] demanded Mr. Clodd, a heavy thud upon the floor above having caused him to start out of his chair.|$|E
6000|$|Self-sacrificing as {{her mood}} might be, Tess could not well go further and cry, [...] "Marry one of them, if you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a dairywoman {{and not a}} lady; and don't think of marrying me!" [...] She {{followed}} Dairyman Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind.|$|E
2500|$|At Desi's lake house, Amy {{sees the}} TV {{interview}} and {{is convinced that}} Nick <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> her back. She murders Desi after seducing him and returns to her husband, who is out on bond. [...] Upon her return, she fabricates a story {{that she had been}} kidnapped and imprisoned by Desi. Although Nick knows she's lying, he has no proof and is forced to return to married life with Amy as the media storm dies down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word until then," [...] Seaman whispered back. [...] "I {{must not}} seem to be hanging after you too much--I <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to come--but the matter is urgent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to see him,--at least, not just yet. I came to this door because I wanted a little talk with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Eleanor," [...] {{said her}} aunt, [...] "if you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> unsophisticated {{subjects}} to practise on, I {{can put you}} in the way of it. I can show you more than one family to whom you might seem {{to be a very good}} fairy, and where such gifts as you could give with all ease would seem like a magic dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} {{blame you for}} {{watching}} them, Rover. After {{what happened to you}} and your Cousin Fred, it is no more than right that you should be on your guard. Yet, I trust that you will give Brown and Martell a chance to prove themselves, provided they <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to turn over a new leaf and make amends for what has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{really do}} not want to be forced into all this {{criticism}} and analysis of life. I <b>really</b> <b>DO</b> <b>want</b> to see things in their entirety, with their beauty left to them, and their wholeness, their natural holiness. Don't you feel it, don't you feel you CAN'T be tortured into any more knowledge?' said Hermione, stopping in front of Ursula, and turning to her with clenched fists thrust downwards.|$|E
50|$|Timmy apologizes, {{saying that}} he <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> a fairy god brother or sister, but he was sick of Cosmo's vomiting. Jorgen then dispatches all of the fairies to search for Cosmo, as he turns the {{bathroom}} into a military-coordination room. Despite everyone's determined efforts, searching all over the Earth turns up nothing, but Wanda says {{that there are other}} worlds they can check. Wanda suggests Anti-Fairy and Pixie World, and Timmy claims that the Anti-Fairies kidnapped Cosmo and that they need to go get him.|$|R
5000|$|The show soon {{planned a}} {{break-up}} {{for the two}} characters. They played Zack being unfaithful with family friend Joanne Cardsley (Rachel Leskovac) and Theresa catches them together. Boachie branded his character [...] "devastated" [...] to have been caught with Joanne. Zack had {{never wanted to be}} the type of man who cheated on their partner. So [...] "he <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to make it work with her, but his apologies get him no where." [...] Theresa then threatens to tell everyone that he has slept with Joanne.|$|R
50|$|Gardo Versoza as Nanding - a half-aswang {{and half}} human. He <b>really</b> <b>does</b> not <b>want</b> {{to kill people}} but he just need {{something}} fed his family, and his {{only way to do}} this was to kill.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You horrid creature, Ethel! I'll {{never say}} you aren't a bother again. You <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> {{me to go}} and tell Charles Cheviot that he was quite right, and Mary that I'm ready to be trampled on by all my brothers-in-law in a row! Well, there won't be any more. You'll never give me one--that's one comfort!' said Gertrude, wriggling herself up, and flinging an arm round Ethel's neck. 'As long as you don't do that, I'll do {{anything}} for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Julia Thurnbrein!" [...] Elisabeth exclaimed. [...] "Yes, I {{have read}} them. If only I {{had known that}} that was she! I should have liked so much to have talked to her. Do you think that she would come and see me, or let me come and see her? We <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to {{understand}} these things, {{and it seems to}} me, somehow, that people like Julia Thurnbrein, and all those who really understand, keep away from us wilfully. They won't exchange thoughts. They believe that we are their natural enemies. And we aren't, you know. There isn't any one I'd like to meet and talk with so much as Julia Thurnbrein." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have none}} of us the least idea what will be required," [...] she said. [...] "It will be far better to pay {{somewhat}} higher prices for what we <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> out there than to cumber ourselves {{with all sorts of}} things that may be useless to us. We have already a considerable amount of baggage. There are our clothes, linen, and books, your father's two double-barrelled guns, which, by the way, I do not think he has ever used since we have been married. The only thing we had better get, as far as I see, will be four rifles, which no doubt we can buy cheap second-hand, and four revolvers.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose {{there is}} a god who is {{watching}} us and choosing which souls of the deceased to bring to heaven, and this god <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> only the morally good to populate heaven. He will probably select from only those who made a significant and responsible effort to discover the truth[...] [...]Therefore, only such people can be sufficiently moral and trustworthy to deserve a place in heaven — unless God wishes to fill heaven with the morally lazy, irresponsible, or untrustworthy.

60|$|George was for {{stopping}} at another boot shop and trying the experiment afresh; {{he said he}} <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> a pair of bedroom slippers. But we persuaded him to postpone their purchase until our arrival in some foreign city, where the tradespeople are no doubt more inured {{to this sort of}} talk, or else more naturally amiable. On the subject of the hat, however, he was adamant. He maintained that without that he could not travel, and, accordingly, we pulled up at a small shop in the Blackfriars Road.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2008, Yon {{published}} his second book, Moment of Truth in Iraq, through Richard Vigilante Books. The book describes how U.S. counterinsurgency methods are creating what Yon {{sees as a}} foundation of success in Iraq. Within two weeks of its release date, Moment of Truth entered into Amazon.com's list of Top 10 bestsellers. Yon was quoted by fellow blogger Glenn Reynolds as saying, [...] "That's just wild. Folks <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> that book after all. I was wondering how many people even cared. It's great to know {{that people want to}} really know what's going on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For this once," [...] she entreated. [...] "You must {{remember}} that mamma often {{looked at me with}} hatred, and said I was the cause of all her woe; but sometimes in her last months she would give me such sad looks that I trembled, and I felt that she was picturing me growing into the kind of woman she wished so much she had not become herself, and that she longed to save me. That is why I have told her that a good man loves me. She is so glad, my poor dear mamma, that I tell her again and again, and she loves to hear it as much as I to tell it. What she loves to hear most is that you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to marry me. She is so fond of hearing that because it is what my father would never say to her." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us ask {{ourselves}} first what we <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want,</b> not what recent legal decisions {{have told us}} to want, or recent logical philosophies proved that we must want, or recent social prophecies predicted that we shall some day want. If {{there must be a}} British Empire, let it be British, and not, in mere panic, American or Prussian. If there ought to be female suffrage, let it be female, and not a mere imitation as coarse as the male blackguard or as dull as the male clerk. If there is to be Socialism, let it be social; that is, as different as possible from all the big commercial departments of to-day. The really good journeyman tailor does not cut his coat according to his cloth; he asks for more cloth. The really practical statesman does not fit himself to existing conditions, he denounces the conditions as unfit. History is like some deeply planted tree which, though gigantic in girth, tapers away at last into tiny twigs; and we are in the topmost branches. Each of us is trying to bend the tree by a twig: to alter England through a distant colony, or to capture the State through a small State department, or to destroy all voting through a vote. In all such bewilderment he is wise who resists this temptation of trivial triumph or surrender, and happy (in an echo of the Roman poet) who remembers the roots of things.|$|E
6000|$|Will you {{pardon me}} if I {{pause for a}} moment to put what I fear you may think an impertinent question? I never can go on with an address unless I feel, or know, that my {{audience}} are either with me or against me: I do not much care which, in beginning; but I must know where they are; and I would fain find out, at this instant, whether you think I am putting the motives of popular action too low. I am resolved, to-night, to state them low enough to be admitted as probable; for whenever, in my writings on Political Economy, I assume that a little honesty, or generosity,--or {{what used to be called}} [...] "virtue,"--may be calculated upon as a human motive of action, people always answer me, saying, [...] "You must not calculate on that: that is not in human nature: you must not assume anything to be common to men but acquisitiveness and jealousy; no other feeling ever has influence on them, except accidentally, and in matters out of the way of business." [...] I begin, accordingly, tonight low in the scale of motives; but I must know if you think me right in doing so. Therefore, let me ask those who admit the love of praise to be usually the strongest motive in men's minds in seeking advancement, and the honest desire of doing any kind of duty to be an entirely secondary one, to hold up their hands. (About a dozen hands held up--the audience, partly, not being sure the lecturer is serious, and, partly, shy of expressing opinion.) I am quite serious--I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to know what you think; however, I can judge by putting the reverse question. Will those who think that duty is generally the first, and love of praise the second, motive, hold up their hands? (One hand reported to have been held up behind the lecturer.) Very good: I see you are with me, and that you think I have not begun too near the ground. Now, without teasing you by putting farther question, I venture to assume that you will admit duty as at least a secondary or tertiary motive. You think that the desire of doing something useful, or obtaining some real good, is indeed an existent collateral idea, though a secondary one, in most men's desire of advancement. You will grant that moderately honest men desire place and office, at least in some measure for the sake of beneficent power; and would wish to associate rather with sensible and well-informed persons than with fools and ignorant persons, whether they are seen in the company of the sensible ones or not. And finally, without being troubled by repetition of any common truisms about the preciousness of friends, and the influence of companions, you will admit, doubtless, that according to the sincerity of our desire that our friends may be true, and our companions wise,--and in proportion to the earnestness and discretion with which we choose both,--will be the general chances of our happiness and usefulness.|$|E
6000|$|The Mistress of the House gave {{a little}} sigh of relief. [...] "I am so glad he did," [...] said she; [...] "I was {{actually}} beginning to be afraid. I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to be present when she first sees him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to come.

50|$|Jack {{ended up}} finding the missing key and helping Steve find Kayla, {{who had been}} kidnapped by Victor Kiriakis (who also wanted the key, since he had been searching for it for years). This finally brought Jack {{together}} with Steve, and although {{his relationship with his}} family was still on shaky legs, Jack was asked to be Steve's best man at his remarriage to Kayla, who was also struggling to accept the reformed Jack. During the Key incident, Jack had tried hard to persuade Kayla not to leave Steve, and Kayla had finally realized that Jack <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to help bring Steve and Kayla together.|$|R
