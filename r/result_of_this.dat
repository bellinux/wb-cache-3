5|$|The route {{remained}} unchanged {{until the early}} 1960s, when several highways were renumbered. Highway19 between Woodstock and Shakespeare was redesignated as Highway59, while Highway 100 between Thamesford and St. Marys was redesignated as Highway19. The concurrencies with Highway2 and Highway7 were relocated as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> renumbering; Highway19 became concurrent with Highway2 between Ingersoll and Thamesford, and with Highway7 between St. Marys and Stratford. While {{the length of the}} route was reduced insignificantly as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> renumbering, it became more direct.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north of Center Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 concurrency in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road to County Road 605. As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> move, SR 605 took on the routing that it does today.|$|E

As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> a concurrency with Highway2 was created between Ingersoll and Woodstock.

5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E

5|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{and similar}} controversies, Alf Dubs {{introduced}} a private member's bill named the Solicitors (Independent Complaints Procedure) Bill on 12 February 1985, which would move {{the responsibility of}} regulating the solicitors profession to a body outside the Law Society. Professional opinion was split on this – the National Consumer Council, Legal Action Group {{and many of the}} smaller law societies supported the proposal, while larger law societies and the Law Society of England and Wales opposed it.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun {{was erected}} on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, {{but it never}} saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside}} world and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> discovery, the {{condition}} {{became known as}} trisomy21. Even before the discovery of its cause, {{the presence of the}} syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Medical texts had assumed it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified. Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth.|$|E

5|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{influence}} plus {{their academic}} training from Rimsky-Korsakov, {{especially in the}} cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E

The prize money for this match was £100 to the winner (Steinitz) and £20 for the loser (Anderssen).

5|$|As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> turmoil, {{specific}} {{regions in}} mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge}} of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
