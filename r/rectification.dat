5|$|The 5th National Congress again {{amended the}} party constitution, adding {{a chapter on}} control {{commissions}} and their aims but devoting little attention to their operations. Partly because of this, the control commissions actively participated in several party <b>rectification</b> campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s. At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles, most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 8 December 1943 and began sea trials, which revealed many problems that required <b>rectification</b> and delayed her formal completion until 3 May 1944. While Indefatigable was still conducting builder's trials, a de Havilland Mosquito landed aboard on 25 March, piloted by Lieutenant Eric Brown. This {{was the first}} landing by a twin-engined aeroplane on a carrier. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Home Fleet and was working up {{over the next several months}} while the Fairey Fireflies of 1770 Squadron flew aboard on 18 May. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 826 Squadron in June.|$|E
5|$|Wadhurst Tunnel {{collapsed}} in 1862 {{and it was}} discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too. <b>Rectification</b> cost £10,231. By 1877, only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time. The tunnel was partly widened in 1934–35. In November 1949, serious defects were discovered in the tunnel. Single-line working {{was put in place}} on 19November, but the tunnel had to be closed completely a week later. The tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments. It reopened to traffic on 5June 1950. Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938–39, remaining open with single-line working in operation. It partially collapsed on 17November 1974, resulting in single-line working until 31January 1975. The line was then closed until 17March whilst the track was singled through the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of <b>rectification,</b> in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|Implacable {{was laid}} down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. at their {{shipyard}} in Clydeside on 21 February 1939, as Yard Number 672. Her construction was temporarily suspended in 1940–41, in favour of higher-priority ships needed {{to fight in the}} Battle of the Atlantic, before she was launched on 10 December 1942 by Queen Elizabeth. Captain Lachlan Mackintosh was appointed to command the ship in November 1943. She was commissioned on 22 May 1944, and began sea trials which revealed a significant number of problems that required <b>rectification,</b> so the ship was not formally completed until 28 August. Implacable was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up {{over the next several months}} while the Fairey Fireflies of 1771 Squadron flew aboard on 10 September. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 828 and 841 Squadrons that made up No. 2 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing later that month.|$|E

25|$|The {{next most}} regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, {{which is a}} <b>rectification</b> of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a <b>rectification</b> of the dodecahedron and the {{icosahedron}} (the <b>rectification</b> of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both quasi-regular, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rectification</b> {{action is}} due to a thin coating of {{aluminum}} hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating. The <b>rectification</b> process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86°F (30°C). There is also a breakdown voltage where the coating is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited. Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the <b>rectification</b> processes.|$|E
