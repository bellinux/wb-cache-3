It was expressed in mammalian cells in serum-free medium containing von Willebrand factor and purified by a one-step immunopurification. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>VIII</b> was characterized as a single active peak when subjected to f. p. l. c., in contrast with the plasma-derived molecule.

This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 316 patients with severe hemophilia A born between 1990 and 2000. The outcome was clinically relevant inhibitor development, defined as the occurrence of at least 2 positive inhibitor titers with decreased recovery. The risk of inhibitor development was not clearly lower in plasma-derived compared with <b>recombinant</b> <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> products (relative risk [RR], 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 5 - 1. 3). Among high-titer inhibitors, the possible reduction in risk was even less pronounced (RR, 0. 9; CI, 0. 5 - 1. 5).

Cleavage at R 372 H by thrombin occurred with an approximately 80 -fold decreased rate compared with wild type.

The role of glycosylation on the activity, stability, protein–lipid interaction, and immunogenicity of FVIII is not known. In order to investigate the role of glycosylation, a deglycosylated form of FVIII was generated by enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate chains. The biochemical properties of fully glycosylated and completely deglycosylated forms of rFVIII (degly rFVIII) were compared using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, size exclusion chromatography, and clotting activity studies. The biological activity of degly FVIII decreased in comparison to the fully glycosylated protein. The ability of degly rFVIII to interact with phosphatidylserine containing membranes was partly impaired. Data suggested that glycosylation significantly influences the stability and the biologically relevant macromolecular interactions of FVIII.

The induction of a tolerogenic response by rFVIIIFc was associated with higher percentage of regulatory T-cells, a lower percentage of pro-inflammatory splenic T-cells, and up-regulation of tolerogenic cytokines and markers. Disruption of Fc interactions with either FcRn or Fcγ receptors diminished tolerance induction, suggesting the involvement of these pathways.

40|$|A 32 -year-old primigravid woman {{developed}} acquired <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> inhibitor after delivery. She {{presented with}} postpartum hemorrhage and large hematoma in episiotomy site. Laboratory examinations showed markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, {{low levels of}} <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> (8 %), and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> inhibitor (2 Bethesda units). The bleeding was controlled successfully using combined treatment with <b>factor</b> <b>VIII,</b> intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and <b>recombinant</b> <b>factor</b> VIIa. Six months after delivery, <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> inhibitor was not present and <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> concentration increased to normal range. Acquired hemophilia is a life-threatening disorder. Precise screening of coagulation factors is essential for diagnosis of persisting postpartum hemorrhage...|$|R
40|$|Production of <b>recombinant</b> B-domain–deleted canine <b>factor</b> <b>VIII</b> (cFVIII-BDD) {{unexpectedly}} revealed superior protein yields with 3 -fold increased {{specific activity}} relative to human FVIII-BDD (hFVIII-BDD). We also determined that activated cFVIII-BDD is {{more stable than}} activated hFVIII-BDD. Furthermore, cFVIII-BDD is efficient at inducing hemostasis in human plasma containing FVIII inhibitors. Infusion of cFVIII-BDD in hemophilia A dogs resulted in correction of the disease phenotype with a pharmacokinetic profile similar to clinical experience with hFVIII-BDD. Notably, immune tolerance challenges with cFVIII-BDD in young and adult hemophilia A dogs did not induce the formation of neutralizing or nonneutralizing antibodies to cFVIII. These data establish the framework to quantitatively investigate the efficacy and safety in preclinical studies of novel therapies for hemophilia A...|$|R
