40|$|Privatization is {{the public}} sector {{analogue}} of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>runaway</b> <b>shop.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In the private sector, the increasing mobility of capital has spawned unprecedented forms of labor discipline by allowing firms to transfer operations between states and even to foreign countries. Privatization- diverting work from the public {{to the private sector}} serves a similar purpose. Both privatization and capital flight enable employers to continue providing services or producing products while shedding a web of existing obligations to their employees. In the public sector, however, the rights of labor are coextensive with legislative and constitutional guarantees of fair, open, and vigorous government. The trend toward privatization amounts to a deliberate effort to evade the rules and procedures intrinsic to democratic government...|$|E
50|$|The ILGWU was unable, on {{the other}} hand, to prevent the flight of {{formerly}} unionized shops {{to other parts of}} the US or abroad, where unions were nonexistent and wages far lower, though there were exceptions, for example, the successful unionization of <b>runaway</b> <b>shops</b> by organizer Min Matheson in northeastern Pennsylvania in the 1950s. The garment industry is an exceptionally mobile one, requiring little capital, using easily carried equipment, and able to relocate its operations with little or no advance warning. The union lost nearly 300,000 members over twenty years to overseas manufacturing and <b>runaway</b> <b>shops</b> in the south.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Today, however, most {{union leaders}} are hardly {{sanguine}} about the future. Companies are escalating their anti-union offensive. Technological change, {{growth in the}} service sectors and high tech sectors of the economy, overseas investment, plant shutdowns, and <b>runaway</b> <b>shops</b> dilute labor 2 ̆ 7 s strength. Without massive new organization, the labor movement will be pushed to {{the fringes of the}} economy and the government...|$|R
25|$|The {{industry}} changed {{greatly in}} the years after World War II; while it had once been concentrated in New York City and other eastern and Midwestern cities, with smaller outposts on the West Coast, the work done by formerly unionized shops fled {{to other parts of the}} US or abroad, where unions were nonexistent and wages far lower. The ILGWU was unable to prevent these <b>runaway</b> <b>shops</b> or to organize workers at the new locations.|$|R

The two were ordered simply [...] "to {{clean up the mess}} down there" [...] amid strife among garment workers and a strong {{presence}} of organized crime. <b>Runaway</b> <b>shops</b> began to take hold of northeastern Pennsylvania due to the declining economic landscape of the area and due to the close proximity to New York.|$|R
40|$|The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia {{has held}} that the NLRB cannot force an {{employer}} who has relocated his plant in order to escape a union to bargain with that union at the new location where the union had not secured a majority position.

40|$|Excerpt] In the United States, where {{news about}} Mexico is {{sporadic}} {{at best and}} usually rife with stereotypes, Mexican workers are largely invisible, portrayed mainly as competitors for U. S. jobs — whether as undocumented immigrants or as laborers in international <b>runaway</b> <b>shops.</b> Women workers are doubly invisible, discounted as a marginal element of the paid workforce. Yet it is women who are taking the most initiative {{to break through the}} barriers of silence and invisibility, seeking friends and allies {{on the other side of}} the border and drawing support from church, community, labor and women 2 ̆ 7 s groups in the United States. Such efforts, while still in their infancy, could play a major role in strengthening the hand of the labor movement against transnational corporations and in building coalitions among these groups...|$|R
50|$|<b>Runaway</b> Bay <b>Shopping</b> Village is {{the main}} {{shopping}} centre in the suburb. Harbour Town Shopping Centre is located nearby in Biggera Waters. Runaway Bay also contains a public library branch, next to the community centre. Natural amenities include Pine Ridge Conservation Park and various parklands along the western shore of the Broadwater. The Runaway Bay Marina, along with the resident Yacht Squadron, is located {{just north of the}} suburb, in Hollywell. Like in many other Gold Coast suburbs, many homes in Runaway Bay are situated along artificial canals.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : A Rube-Goldberg contraption that {{demonstrates}} many challenging multibody contact sounds. A noisy block feeder (Left) with flexible tubes ejects marbles into a double helix of plastic chutes (Middle), which causes a cup to fill up, lifting a lever that drops a bunny into a <b>runaway</b> <b>shopping</b> cart (Right) producing familiar clattering and clanging sounds due to deformable micro-collisions. Our approach can accurately resolve modal vibrations and contact sounds using an asynchronous, adaptive, frictional contact solver. Contact sound models based on linear modal analysis {{are commonly used}} with rigid body dynamics. Unfortunately, treating vibrating objects as “rigid ” during collision and contact processing fundamentally limits the range of sounds that can be computed, and contact solvers for rigid body animation can be ill-suited for modal contact sound synthesis, producing various sound artifacts. In this paper, we resolve modal vibrations in both collision and frictional contact processing stages, thereby enabling non-rigid sound phenomena such as micro-collisions, vibrational energy exchange, and chattering. We propose a frictional multibody contact formulation and modified Staggered Projections solver which is well-suited to sound rendering and avoids noise artifacts associated with spatial and temporal contact-force fluctuations which plague prior methods. To enable practical animation and sound synthesis of numerous bodies with many coupled modes, we propose a novel asynchronous integrator with model-level adaptivity built into the frictional contact solver. Vibrational contact damping is modeled to approximate contact-dependent sound dissipation. Results are provided that demonstrate high-quality contact resolution with sound...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Although it {{has taken}} almost a decade to gain formal recognition, it has finally happened. In February, 1985 the AFL-CIO {{announced}} its endorsement of corporate campaigns, and encouraged affiliates to consider their use more aggressively and more often. The endorsement appeared in The Changing Situation of Workers and Their Unions, a report prepared by AFL-CIO Committee on the Evolution of Work. While it is encouraging that the AFL-CIO has endorsed the concept, it also sends off alarms {{for those who have}} been involved in campaigns. The alarm sounds for the issue of 2 ̆ 2 timeliness 2 ̆ 2 in initiating corporate campaigns, and for the understanding of the time, commitment and resources necessary to assess, develop and implement them. Most campaigns have been initiated as a form of strike assistance or in response to a crisis, such as plant closures, <b>runaway</b> <b>shops</b> or union-busting. While corporate campaigns can be useful in these situations, their potential is maximized when used to bolster organizing drives or the collective bargaining process. The arguments for initiating a campaign prior to a strike or crisis are logical. A corporate campaign gives unions the power to put a company on the defensive by isolating it from the rest of its business, political and social communities. The sooner this process is set in motion, the greater the potential for averting the crisis or minimizing the damage. Early intervention of a campaign also provides a greater opportunity to build a firm foundation for the union 2 ̆ 7 s future. Timing the initiation of a campaign involves more than assessing the potential for a crisis. It also requires an understanding of the time unions need to prepare a campaign that can place the union on the offensive. It takes time to identify the targets and tactics that can accomplish this goal. Thousands of pages of company and government records must be analyzed. The company 2 ̆ 7 s community image must be assessed. The local media 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the union and company must be evaluated. The potential for coalition-building must be determined. And hours upon hours of discussion must take place with workers who know best the working conditions, attitudes and practices of the company. It is extremely difficult to accomplish these tasks while responding to the immediate needs of a strike, an impasse in negotiations or a plant closure...|$|R
50|$|When {{approval}} {{for construction of}} the centre was requested by Westfield, {{it was suggested that}} the Helensvale location was too close to existing centres at Southport (Australia Fair) and Runaway Bay (<b>Runaway</b> Bay <b>Shopping</b> Village). The Gold Coast City Council argued that the planned Coomera Town Centre (about 5 km up the M1) would cater for the catchment. Westfield Helensvale was built mainly because Coomera Town Centre, which is planned to be the true heart of the region, was hitting obstacles in the ways of planning. Part of the outcome of that debate was that part of the Westfield Centre was meant to have the appearance of an outdoor shopping street connecting the train station through to the older Helensvale shops nearby. However, since the older shops are located across a major road they have been refurbished for local shopping. The Westfield Helensvale shopping centre has predominately mall enclosed shopping and only a few shops open to outside traffic. Many other Westfield shopping centres conversely are often fully enclosed malls, however the company is redeveloping a number of sites (such as Garden City) to include outdoor, piazza style areas.|$|R
