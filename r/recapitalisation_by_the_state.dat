50|$|As {{other major}} {{commercial}} state banks, Vietinbank was pressurised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government to continue lending to unprofitable state companies. It {{was subject to}} a 1 trillion VND <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government in December 2002, effectively doubling the bank's charter capital (from 1.045 trillion in 2001). It was the only of <b>the</b> four major <b>state</b> banks {{not part of the}} second stage of recapitalisation in 2003.|$|R
2500|$|At 01:20am, on 23 December 2016, {{the midnight}} after the failed recapitalisation, BMPS {{requested}} a precautionary <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Italian Government {{in order to}} bail out <b>the</b> bank <b>by</b> excising Article 32(4) of EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (The EU-wide banking resolution law, which restricted state aid to a means of last resort). On 20 December the Italian Government had already raised €20 billion {{to set up a}} save-saving (...) fund in order to subscribe a possible recapitalisation of UniCredit, BMPS, Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and Banca Carige, as well as banks that need recapitalisation in the near future.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the German government quickly backtracked on the commitment about direct bank <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ESM. In September 2012, it was joined on this stance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> governments of Finland and the Netherlands. Eventually, such conditions {{were put on}} the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument that, as of September 2014, {{it has never been}} activated. However, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism proceeded apace. Furthermore, in December 2012 the European Council announced the creation of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Europe's banking union has been identified by many analysts and policymakers as a major structural policy initiative that has {{played a significant role in}} addressing the Eurozone crisis.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{moment of}} {{decision}} was a summit of euro area {{heads of state}} and government on 28-29 June 2012. The summit's brief statement, published early on 29 June, began with a declaration of intent, [...] "We affirm that {{it is imperative to}} break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns," [...] which was later repeated in numerous successive communications of the European Council. It followed by announcing two major policy initiatives: first, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism under the European Central Bank's authority, using Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; and second, [...] "when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established," [...] the possibility of direct bank <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Stability Mechanism, possibly with retroactive effect in the case of Spain and Ireland.|$|R
40|$|New {{obstacles}} to the European banking union have emerged {{over the last}} year, but a successful transition remains both necessary and possible. The key next step {{will be in the}} second half of 2014, when the European Central Bank (ECB) will gain supervisory authority over most of Europe’s banking system. This needs to be preceded by a rigorous balance sheet assessment that is likely to trigger signifi-cant bank restructuring, for which preparation has barely started. It will be much more significant than current discussions about a bank resolution directive and bank <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Stability Mechanism (ESM). • The 2014 handover, and a subsequent change in the European treaties that will establish the robust legal basis needed for a sustainable banking union, together define the policy sequence as a bridge that can allow Europe to cross the choppy waters that separate it from a steady-state banking policy framework...|$|R
50|$|It is {{appropriate}} for me to step down today given last evening's announcement {{in relation to the}} resignation of Seán FitzPatrick and given the strong statement of support for the Bank and its <b>recapitalisation</b> programme <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Minister for Finance. Good progress is being made on the recapitalisation. It is undoubtedly {{in the best interests of}} Anglo that a new Chief Executive is appointed to lead the Bank through its next phase of development. The appointment of Donal O'Connor as Chairman together with a new Chief Executive augurs well for the Bank and for all its stakeholders. It gives the Bank fresh impetus and an upward trajectory. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their intense commitment and honest endeavour and for their friendship over the last 15 years.|$|R

40|$|The SME access-to-finance {{problem is}} not {{universal}} in the European Union and there are reasons for the fall in credit aggregates and higher SME lending rates in southern Europe. Possible market failures, high unemployment and externalities justify making greater and easier access to finance for SMEs a top priority. Previous European initiatives were able to support {{only a tiny fraction}} of Europe’s SMEs; merely stepping-up these programmes is unlikely to result in a break-through. Without repairing bank balance sheets and resuming economic growth, initiatives to help SMEs get access to finance will have limited success. The European Central Bank can foster bank <b>recapitalisation</b> <b>by</b> performing in <b>the</b> toughest possible way the asset quality review before it takes over the single supervisory role. Of the pos-sible initiatives for fostering SME access to finance, a properly designed scheme for targeted central bank lending seems to be the best complement to the banking clean-up, but other options, such as increased European Investment Bank lending and the promotion of securitisation of SME loans, should also be explored.
