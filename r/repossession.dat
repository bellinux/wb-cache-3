The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore Naval Base {{suffered}} little {{damage in}} the fighting and became the Imperial Japanese Navy's most important facility outside of the Japanese home islands. The 15-inch guns were sabotaged by the British before the fall of Singapore, and four of them were deemed beyond repair and scrapped by the Japanese. The floating dry dock was scuttled by the British, but raised by the Japanese. It was damaged beyond repair by a raid by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in February 1945, and ultimately towed out to sea and dumped in 1946. The Royal Navy took <b>repossession</b> of the Singapore base in 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Renaissance was {{inspired}} by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{micro-data}} in the public domain, new aggregate models for the UK’s mortgage <b>repossessions</b> and arrears are estimated using quarterly data over 1983 – 2014, motivated by a conceptual double trigger frame framework for foreclosures and payment delinquencies. An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders’ forbearance policy, by common latent variables {{in a system of}} equations for arrears and <b>repossessions.</b> We introduce, {{for the first time in}} the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate <b>repossessions</b> and arrears. This is based on an average debt–equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt–equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the ‘months-in-arrears’ measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Highly signifi- cant effects on aggregate rates of <b>repossessions</b> and arrears are found for the aggregate debt–service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. For macroeconomics, our model traces an important part of the financial accelerator: the feedback from the housing market to bad loans and hence banks’ ability to extend credit. </p...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data for}} 1991 to 1997 from the British Household Panel Survey we {{investigate}} {{the incidence of}} housing finance problems, evictions and <b>repossessions.</b> Previous research on <b>repossessions</b> and problematic housing debt has focused on cross-sectional data. This paper contributes uniquely to the literature by examining the sequence of household and individual events associated with housing arrears and evictions. Our results show that previous experience of financial problems have a significant and positive association with the current financial situation, and that negative financial surprises are the main route into financial difficulties, controlling for other changes such as divorce or loss of employment. We also confirm the importance of structural, financial and personal factors in determining housing payment problems. Families with higher income, where the head or his/her spouse is in work, and those with greater assets have a lower risk of experiencing problems meeting their housing costs. ...|$|R
