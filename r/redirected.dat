5000|$|<b>Redirects</b> {{have been}} used to {{manipulate}} search engines with unethical intentions, e.g. sneaky <b>redirects</b> or URL hijacking. The goal of misleading <b>redirects</b> is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky <b>redirects</b> to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain <b>redirect</b> technique that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary <b>redirects.</b> If a temporary <b>redirect</b> is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the <b>redirect</b> or to the <b>redirect</b> target URL. The URL that initiates the <b>redirect</b> may be kept to show up in search results, as the <b>redirect</b> indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary <b>redirects</b> to well ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the <b>redirect,</b> therefore [...] "stealing" [...] the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky <b>redirects</b> to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kind of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.|$|R

50|$|<b>Redirects</b> can be {{effectively}} used for targeting purposes like device targeting or geotargeting. Device targeting {{has become increasingly}} important {{with the rise of}} mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website responsive or <b>redirect</b> to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client side <b>redirects</b> or non-cacheable server side <b>redirects</b> are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server side <b>redirects</b> are used for Geotargeting but client side <b>redirects</b> might be an option as well, depending on requirements.|$|R

50|$|In the HTTP {{protocol}} {{used by the}} World Wide Web, a <b>redirect</b> is {{a response}} with a status code beginning with 3 that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a <b>redirect,</b> it needs to make a number of decisions {{how to handle the}} <b>redirect.</b> Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the <b>redirect,</b> how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.|$|R
30|$|Many {{variants}} {{of the same}} folk protocol exist where one or more Web sites use another site as a cookie manager (CM): to set a cookie the Web sites <b>redirect</b> the browser to the manager passing the necessary data as a request parameter; the manager sets the cookie when <b>redirecting</b> back to the requesting page. (At this point the browser associates the cookie with the cookie manager’s host or domain.) To receive a cookie, they do a <b>redirect</b> to the CM who receives the cookie from the browser and performs another <b>redirect</b> (back) passing the data, also as a request parameter. While this is a working solution, it requires multiple <b>redirects</b> (two per request) increasing communication overhead and design complexity. Our proposal, on the other hand, introduces native support for cross-domain cookies in HTTP and, thus, {{eliminates the need for}} <b>redirects.</b>|$|R
