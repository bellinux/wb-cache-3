50|$|TCAs {{were the}} first {{medications}} that had dual mechanism of action. The mechanism of action of tricyclic secondary amine antidepressants is only partly understood. TCAs have dual inhibition effects on norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters</b> and serotonin <b>reuptake</b> transporters.Increased norepinephrine and serotonin concentrations are obtained by inhibiting both of these transporter proteins. TCAs have substantially more affinity for norepinephrine reuptake proteins than the SSRIs. This is because of a formation of secondary amine TCA metabolites.|$|R
2500|$|Dopaminergic {{antipsychotics}} affect dopamine neurons by binding to postsynaptic dopamine receptors, {{where they}} function as receptor antagonists; in contrast, ADHD stimulants are indirect agonists of postsynaptic dopamine receptors; in other words, these stimulants increase levels of synaptic dopamine which then binds to postsynaptic receptors. [...] Stimulants increase {{the concentration of}} synaptic dopamine by activating certain presynaptic receptors (i.e., TAAR1) or by blocking or altering the function of <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters</b> (e.g., DAT, VMAT2) in the presynaptic neuron.|$|R
50|$|Methylphenidate, a stimulant, {{with short}} and long-acting formulations, {{is often the}} {{first-line}} therapy and appears effective. In the short term, methylphenidate is well tolerated. However, long term studies have not been conducted in adults and concerns about increases in blood pressure have not been established. Methylphenidate increases concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, promoting increased neurotransmission. It acts to block the dopamine and norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters,</b> thus slowing the removal at which these neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapses.|$|R

2500|$|Duloxetine {{inhibits}} the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) in {{the central}} nervous system. Duloxetine increases dopamine (DA) specifically in the prefrontal cortex, where there are few DA reuptake pumps, via the inhibition of NE reuptake pumps (NET) which is believed to mediate reuptake of DA and NE. [...] However, duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters</b> and can therefore {{be considered to be}} a selective reuptake inhibitor at the 5-HT and NE transporters.

40|$|Antidepressants have {{different}} receptor binding profiles, which {{are related to}} therapeutic action and adverse drug reactions. We constructed a model to classify antidepressants {{on the basis of}} their binding properties of most common transporter- and receptor sites. Receptor binding was quantified by calculating receptor occupancy for the 5 -HT (serotonin) <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter,</b> norepinephrinic <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter,</b> 5 -HT 2 C-receptor, M 3 -receptor, H 1 -receptor and 1 - receptor. To identify groups of antidepressants that show similar patterns of receptor occupancy for different receptors, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principle component analysis (PCA) were used. In addition, to visualize (a) symmetry between binding profiles of antidepressants, radar plots were constructed. On the basis of both analyses, four clusters of antidepressants which exert similar pharmacological properties were identified. Potentially, this model could be a helpful tool in medical practice and may be used as a prediction model for adverse effects of drugs entering the market...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that pharmacological norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (NET) inhibition delays the onset of head-up tilt-induced presyncope in healthy subjects. BackgroundTreatment of neurally mediated syncope is unsatisfactory. In a previous study in {{a small number of}} healthy subjects, pharmacologic NET inhibition delayed the onset of head-up tilt-induced pre-syncope. MethodsWe combined data sets from 3 substudies comprising 51 healthy subjects without a history of syncope. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over fashion, subjects underwent 2 head-up tilt tests, once with placebo and once with a NET inhibitor (sibutramine or reboxetine). Tilt testing was prematurely ended when pre-syncopal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, or visual disturbances occurred together with a decrease in blood pressure and/or heart rate. ResultsThe mean tolerated tilt test duration was 29 ± 2 min with placebo and 35 ± 1 min with NET inhibition (p = 0. 001). The odds ratio for premature abortion of head-up tilt testing was 0. 22 (95 % confidence interval 0. 09 to 0. 55, p < 0. 001) in favor of NET inhibition. Norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> inhibition elicited a pressor response and increased upright heart rate. ConclusionsIn healthy subjects, NET inhibition prevents tilt-induced neurally mediated (pre) syncope. Therefore, NET inhibition may be a worthwhile target of drug intervention for larger trials in highly symptomatic patients with neurally mediated syncope...|$|E
50|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of the sympathomimetic appetite suppressants {{in the treatment of}} obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Amphetamine and related sympathomimetic medications (such as benzphetamine) are thought to stimulate the release of norepinephrine and/or dopamine from storage sites in nerve terminals of the lateral hypothalamic feeding center, thereby producing a decrease in appetite. This release is mediated through the binding of benzphetamine to VMAT2 and inhibiting its function, causing a release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through their <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters.</b> Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class.|$|R
40|$|Prevention {{of muscle}} fiber {{degeneration}} {{is a key}} issue {{in the treatment of}} muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is widely postulated that existing pharmaceutical compounds might potentially be beneficial to DMD patients, but tools to identify them are lacking. Here, by using a Caenorhabditis elegans model of dystrophin-dependent muscular dystrophy, we show that the neurohormone serotonin and some of its agonists are potent suppressors of muscle degeneration. Inhibitors of serotonin <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters,</b> which prolong the action of endogenous serotonin, have a similar effect. Moreover, reduction of serotonin levels leads to degeneration of non-dystrophic muscles. Our results demonstrate that serotonin is critical to C. elegans striated muscles.

40|$|Increasingly {{invertebrates}} {{are being}} used to investigate the molecular and cellular effects of drugs of abuse to explore basic mechanisms of addiction. However, in mammals the principle factors contributing to addiction are long-term adaptive responses to repeated drug use. Here we examined whether adaptive responses to cocaine are also seen in invertebrates using the honey bee model system. Repeated topical treatment with a low dose of cocaine rendered bees resistant to the deleterious motor effects of a higher cocaine dose, indicating the development of physiological tolerance to cocaine in bees. Cocaine inhibits biogenic amine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters,</b> but neither acute nor repeated cocaine treatments caused measurable changes in levels of biogenic amines measured in whole bee brains. Our data show clear short and long-term behavioural responses of bees to cocaine administration, but caution that, despite the small size of the bee brain, measures of biogenic amines conducted at the whole-brain level may not reveal neurochemical effects of the drug. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Clinical outcome {{following}} 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intake {{ranges from}} mild entactogenic effects to a life-threatening intoxication. Despite ongoing research, the clinically most relevant mechanisms causing acute MDMA-induced adverse effects remain largely unclear. This complicates the triage {{and treatment of}} MDMA users needing medical care. The user's genetic profile and interactions resulting from polydrug use are key factors that modulate the individual response to MDMA and influence MDMA pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and thus clinical outcome. Polymorphisms in CYP 2 D 6, resulting in poor metabolism status, as well as co-exposure of MDMA with specific substances (e. g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) can increase MDMA plasma levels, but can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites and subsequent cellular damage. While pre-exposure to e. g. SSRIs can increase MDMA plasma levels, clinical effects (e. g. blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) can be reduced, possibly due to a pharmacodynamic interaction at the serotonin <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (SERT). Pretreatment with inhibitors of the dopamine or norepinephrine <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (DAT or NET), 5 -HT(2 A) or α-β adrenergic receptor antagonists or antipsychotics prior to MDMA exposure can also decrease one or more MDMA-induced physiological and/or subjective effects. Carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol can reduce multiple MDMA-induced clinical and neurotoxic effects. Thus besides supportive care, i. e. sedation using benzodiazepines, intravenous hydration, aggressive cooling and correction of electrolytes, it is worthwhile to investigate the usefulness of carvedilol, ketanserin and haloperidol {{in the treatment of}} MDMA-intoxicated patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{noradrenaline}} <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> {{is located}} on the pre-synaptic membrane of noradrenic neurons. Its main function is to terminate the action of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline by reuptake back into the nerve terminal. Changes in the function and density of the noradrenaline <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> have been implicated in neurological disorders such as clinical depression and Alzheimer’s disease. In vivo imaging of the noradrenaline transporter using single photon emission computed tomography has been hampered by the lack of a suitable imaging agent. The information from imaging studies could lead {{to a better understanding of}} transporter function and the development of more efficient and faster acting drugs to treat the diseases associated it. For the first time, all four stereoisomers of an iodinated analogue of reboxetine were stereoselectively synthesised and biologically evaluated in an effort to understand the relationship between stereochemistry and potency. All four compounds were found to have nanomolar affinity for the noradrenaline transporter. Of most interest was the (2 R, 3 S) -stereoisomer, which was identified as being as potent as the more studied (2 S, 3 S) -stereoisomer. Therefore, a new series of iodoanalogues based on the (2 R, 3 S) -stereochemical scaffold were synthesised and tested for their affinity with the noradrenaline transporter. This study revealed the derivative with ortho substitution on the phenoxy ring to be a potential lead for the development of a novel imaging agent for the noradrenaline transporter.

40|$|Sulforaphane is {{a potent}} phase II enzyme inducer and {{well-known}} dietary chemopreventive agent. A proteomic study on colon adenocarcinoma Caco- 2 cells was performed to detect differentially-expressed proteins following exposure to sulforaphane. Results showed that sulforaphane down-regulated the expression of serotonin receptors, decreased serotonin <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporter</b> (SERT) and upregulated nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), promoting signals for serotonin release. The neurotransmitter serotonin induces cellular responses by mediating G-proteins, and activating specific receptors which are important in the proliferation of colon cancer cells.

40|$|Serotonin is a modulatory {{neurotransmitter}} in {{the human}} brain that regulates mood, anger, reward, aggression, and appetite and plays {{a central role in}} brain development. These effects are mediated through the interaction of serotonin with at least 15 different receptor molecules. Through the development and careful characterization of novel radiotracers, {{we have been able to}} visualize and quantify in vivo many of the key molecular sites—including serotonin receptors, <b>reuptake</b> <b>transporters,</b> and enzymes—responsible for serotonin metabolism. The clin-ical goals of serotonin imaging are to aid in determining the pathophysiology of brain disorders, to determine novel thera-peutic strategies, to predict treatment, to estimate risk, and to determine individualized dosing strategies. Despite the contra-dictory results of early studies, the field as a whole has made significant progress on nearly all of these fronts, and advances in methodology suggest paths toward coherence.
