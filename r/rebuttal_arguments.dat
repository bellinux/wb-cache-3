5000|$|Turning to Heinz's rebuttal, {{which led}} the {{district}} court {{to conclude that the}} merger would not harm competition, the appellate court found that {{the district court}} committed legal errors. It wrongly insisted that the FTC show that prices to consumers would rise, which no court has ever held and which is contrary to precedent. The district court also concluded that [...] "the anticompetitive effects of the merger will be offset by efficiencies resulting from the union of the two companies, efficiencies which they assert will be used to compete more effectively against Gerber." [...] This can be a defense, the court said, but [...] "the high market concentration levels present in this case require, in rebuttal, proof of extraordinary efficiencies, which the appellees failed to supply." [...] Moreover, the district court credited speculative and questionable claims about post-merger efficiencies. The district court also found that [...] "without the merger the two firms are unable to launch new products to compete with Gerber because they lack a sufficient shelf presence," [...] and that this defense helped rebut the prima facie case. The appellate court found this kind of defense speculative and not supported by probative evidence. In summary: [...] "Because the district court incorrectly assessed the merits of the appellees' <b>rebuttal</b> <b>arguments,</b> it improperly discounted the FTC's showing of likelihood of success." ...|$|E
40|$|This 3 -year {{project was}} {{terminated}} {{at the end}} of Year 1 because the DOE Geothermal project-evaluation committee decided one Milestone was not met and also concluded that our technology would not be successful. The Review Panel recommended a ?no-go? decision be implemented by DOE. The Principal Investigator and his research team disagreed with the conclusions reached by the DOE evaluation committee and wrote a scientifically based rebuttal to the erroneous claims made by the evaluators. We were not told if our arguments were presented to the people who evaluated our work and made the ?no-go? decision. Whatever the case regarding the information we supplied in rebuttal, we received an official letter from Laura Merrick, Contracting Officer at the Golden Field Office, dated June 11, 2013 in which we were informed that project funding would cease and instructed us to prepare a final report before September 5, 2013. In spite of the <b>rebuttal</b> <b>arguments</b> we presented to DOE, this official letter repeated the conclusions of the Review Panel that we had already proven to be incorrect. This is the final report that we are expected to deliver. The theme of this report will be another rebuttal of the technical deficiencies claimed by the DOE Geothermal Review Panel about the value and accomplishments of the work we did in Phase 1 of the project. The material in this report will present images made from direct-S modes produced by vertical-force sources using the software and research findings we developed in Phase 1 that the DOE Review Panel said would not be successful. We made these images in great haste when we were informed that DOE Geothermal rejected our <b>rebuttal</b> <b>arguments</b> and still regarded our technical work to be substandard. We thought it was more important to respond quickly rather than to take additional time to create better quality images than what we present in this Final Report...|$|E

Each debate involves four two-person teams. Two teams (“proposition” or “government”) support the resolution (the topic) and two teams (“opposition”) oppose. BP debate is about using good speaking skills to present logical arguments, and teams are encouraged to incorporate philosophical arguments into the debate. The first six speeches in the debate (known as a 2 ̆ 2 round 2 ̆ 2) feature a mix of constructive arguments (new arguments for one’s side) and <b>rebuttal</b> <b>arguments</b> (refutation of the arguments presented by one’s opponents). A BP debate round concludes with two “whip” speeches, where each side summarizes the significant arguments presented throughout the round and presents reasons why their team should win the debate.

40|$|The {{separation}} of ownership and control {{is said to}} have exploded the atom of prop-erty in the modern corporation. This article suggests that if the atom ever did split, it may have recently been “fused ” by a combination of shareholder activism and concentration in ownership representation. After outlining Berle and Means’s seminal thesis and several <b>rebuttal</b> <b>arguments,</b> the article recounts the forces that have led to the reconcentration of ownership and control in shareholders ’ hands. This consolidation’s impact on shareholder property rights is then examined, lead-ing to the conclusion that Berle and Means’s explosion thesis no longer holds [...] where industrial property is aggregated under the corporate system, the atom of property splits. The power goes in one direction, centripetally, and concentrates {{in the hands of the}} corporate management and the corpo-rate “control. ” The assumed beneficial ownership is dispersed, centrifug-ally, among many thousand of small security owners. This dispersed resi-due of beneficial ownership represented by corporate securities is “passive” property [...] The profit motive can not stimulate the owner of passive prop-erty to do anything except speculate. —Berle (1932, p. 1370 n. 10) The vivid image of the exploding atom of property is one of the endur-ing legacies of Berle and Means’s (1932 / 1991) seminal work on the advent of the modern corporation. Their more general concept of the sepa-ration of ownership and control has spawned thousands of works in the economic, legal, finance, and management literatures during the past 68 years.

At trial, Cone's attorney argued that he was {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, and several experts testified that Cone suffered from a long history of drug abuse and post traumatic stress disorder resulting from his military service during the Vietnam War. According to one expert, Cone's long-term drug abuse caused hallucinations and paranoia that [...] "affected respondent's mental capacity and ability to obey the law." [...] The jury rejected Cone's insanity defense and found him guilty on all counts. At a sentencing hearing, Cone's attorney did not present evidence of Cone's drug use as mitigating evidence.

2500|$|Throughout the trial, Cherry's defense attorney, Mickey Johnson, {{repeatedly}} {{observed that}} many of the prosecution's witnesses were either circumstantial or [...] "inherently unreliable". Many of the same audio tapes presented in Blanton's trial were also introduced into evidence in the trial of Bobby Cherry. A key point contested as to the validity of the audio tapes being introduced into evidence, outside the hearing of the jury, was the fact that Cherry had no grounds to contest the introduction of the tapes into evidence, as, under the Fourth Amendment, neither his home or property had been subject to discreet recording by the FBI. This was disputed by Don Cochran, who argued that Alabama law allows conspiracies to conceal evidence to be proven by both inference and circumstantial evidence. In spite of a <b>rebuttal</b> <b>argument</b> by the defense, Judge Garrett ruled that some sections were too prejudicial, but also that portions of some audio recordings could be introduced as evidence. Through these rulings, Mitchell Burns was also called to testify on behalf of the prosecution, although his testimony was restricted to the areas of the recordings permitted into evidence.|$|R

Next, the other side is permitted to give its first four-minute constructive speech in which not only arguments may be presented, but <b>rebuttals</b> to <b>arguments</b> from the first speech as well.
