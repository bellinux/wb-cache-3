40|$|The {{market for}} {{information}} {{has changed dramatically}} {{in the past decade}} with the popularization of the Internet, the exponential growth in number and variety of speakers, and the increased democratization of speech. These shifts have made digital media particularly vulnerable to harm from information pollution; the information market is not as capable as it once was of ensuring that the truth prevails. Anecdotal evidence suggests that information consumers are not looking for the truth, but rather, for information that confirms their own pre-existing biases. Moreover, there is significant evidence that people are resistant to changing their minds from what they had previously believed, even if it is later proven to be false. Combined, market failures in disseminating information and personal heuristics in interpreting information suggest that the remedy of more speech to combat false or defamatory speech is not as effective as once thought. Instead, First Amendment jurisprudence should be rebalanced to allow for a general <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> for digital speech...|$|E

40|$|This Note {{considers}} the conflicting interests of prisoners, in not {{being subjected to}} cross-gender pat searches, and corrections officers, in not being discriminated against in employment opportunities. Ultimately, this Note argues that an inmate’s rights, including Constitutional rights under the Fourth and Eighth Amendments, take precedence, and therefore, cross-gender pat searches should only be performed during emergencies. There are solutions, however, that respect inmate rights while preserving employment opportunities for {{both male and female}} correctional staff. To the extent possible, these solutions must be pursued prior to implementation of a bona fide occupational qualification, thereby preserving the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> both prisoners and corrections officers. In Part I, this Note discusses various prisoners’ rights implicated by the use of cross-gender pat searches. In Part II, this Note turns to the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>corrections</b> officers in light of Title VII. Part III examines the conflicting rights and reaches the conclusion that inmate rights take precedence, and therefore, non-emergency cross-gender pat searches should be prohibited. Finally, Part IV analyzes the viability of prior solutions and briefly suggests various policies that may be implemented, given a prohibition on non-emergency cross-gender pat searches, to protect employment opportunities...|$|R

In this study there were two issues discussed the implementation of training {{for terrorism}} prisoners as well as the factors driving and inhibiting formation for terrorism prisoners. This type of research is empirical legal research. The research is descriptive. Primary data sourced from observation and interviews while secondary data sourced from literatures and electronic articles. Secondary data was collected through library research. Data is collected, processed and presented qualitative descriptive analysis. Coaching for terrorism inmates in prisons have not been implemented optimally. It {{can be seen from the}} formation of the terrorist network that carried out in prisons. Former inmates also returned to terrorism after being released from prison. The driving factor for the development of terrorist prisoners is because terrorism is a crime that should ditanggulagi. Guidance is also the mandate of Act Number 12 of 1995 Concerning Correctional Institution and the Indonesian Government Regulation Number 99 of 2012 concerning the Second Amendment to Government Regulation No. 32 of 1999 on Terms and Procedures for Implementation <b>of</b> the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Corrections</b> Inmates and the vision and mission of the institution. Coaching effort is one of community protection movement. Coaching is a limiting factor in terms of the legal structure and legal culture. Prison staff lack the ability to Islam, a lack of awareness of officers, there is no coaching format for terrorism prisoners, the view that training for terrorism prisoners are tightening and the lack of specialized staff in fostering terrorism inmates. Legal culture includes cultural terrorist prisoners law does not regret his actions and legal culture society reject terrorism inmates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} RCMS, {{a method}} for integrating differential equations of the form y′=[λA+A 1 (t) ]y with highly oscillatory solution. It is shown analytically and numerically that RCMS can accurately integrate problems using stepsizes determined only by the characteristic scales of A 1 (t), typically {{much larger than the}} solution “wavelength”. In fact, for a given t grid the error decays with, or is independent of, increasing solution oscillation. RCMS consists of two basic steps, a transformation which we call the <b>right</b> <b>correction</b> and solution <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>correction</b> equation using a Magnus series. With suitable methods of approximating the highly oscillatory integrals appearing therein, RCMS has high order of accuracy with little computational work. Moreover, RCMS respects evolution on a Lie group. We illustrate with application to the 1 D Schrödinger equation and to Frenet–Serret equations. The concept <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>correction</b> integral series schemes is suggested and right correction Neumann schemes are discussed. Asymptotic analysis for a large class of ODEs is included which gives certain numerical integrators converging to exact asymptotic behaviour...|$|R
