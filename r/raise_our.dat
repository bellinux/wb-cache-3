Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him [...] "one of the main case {{histories}} [...] of the gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills". Paul Kocher identifies Saruman's use of a palantír, a seeing-stone, as the immediate cause of his downfall, but also suggests that through his study of [...] "the arts of the enemy", Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron. According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks, Saruman succumbs to the lust for power, while Shippey identifies Saruman's devotion to goals of knowledge, organization and control as his weakness. Tolkien writes that the Istari's chief temptation (and that to which Saruman fell) is impatience, leading to a desire to force others to do good, and then to a simple desire for power.|$|E

On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

2500|$|His nationalistic {{temperament}} came {{to light}} when he was expelled for assaulting Professor Oaten(who had manhandled some Indian students) for the latter's anti-India comments. He was expelled although he appealed that he only witnessed the assault and did not actually participate in it. [...] He later joined the Scottish Church College at the University of Calcutta and passed his B.A. in 1918 in philosophy. Bose left India in 1919 for England with a promise to his father that he would appear in the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination. He went to study in Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge and matriculated on 19 November 1919. He came fourth in the ICS examination and was selected, {{but he did not}} want to work under an alien government which would mean serving the British.

2500|$|When the Wu generals {{wanted to}} respond to the enemy's taunts, Lu Xun said, [...] "This must be a trick. We should observe first." [...] Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, [...] "Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's {{difficult}} for us to attack them. Even if we manage to win, we can't completely defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should <b>raise</b> <b>our</b> troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs." [...] The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} resistance to adopting a westernized, mainstream feminist approach to Indigenous rights and self-determination. The most significant criticism of mainstream feminism {{has been its}} marginalization of minorities and lack of racial diversity. White feminists [...] "are extraordinarily reluctant to see themselves in the situation of being oppressors, as they feel {{that this will be}} at the expense of concentrating upon being oppressed." [...] The priority of white women's needs before those of Indigenous women have a historical root, and therefore make Indigenous feminists weary of homogenizing the rights of [...] "women". While Indigenous women may acknowledge that there is overlap in the goals of Indigenous feminists and mainstream feminists, many, like Celeste Liddle (Arrernte) [...] "strongly believe that as Aboriginal women, whilst our fights are related to ongoing feminist struggles within other racially marginalised groups, they are not the same." [...] An argument made by Minnie Grey in her essay, From the Tundra to the Boardroom to Everywhere in Between, about feminism is how it often fails to look beyond female oppression at other issues, such as class, education, and the effects of oppression has on men. [...] "We, as Inuit women, have been striving for such things as equal pay for equal work, equal share of roles {{for the good of the}} family, equal rights to participate in the decision-making processes of our governments, equal rights for the hiring of women at all levels of commerce and science, equal rights in education, and most importantly, equal rights to <b>raise</b> <b>our</b> children in safe, healthy, and positive conditions. This means, among other things, above the poverty line. I look at these aspirations not as women's liberation, but as people's liberation. In fact, we need and love our men, and similarly, we need to liberate them from the concepts that bind them to unbreakable traditional roles that, in turn, keep the status quo intact in many regions of the world."One such example of the need to incorporate uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the second wave's struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, the second wave's fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|E
