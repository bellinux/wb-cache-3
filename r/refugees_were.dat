5|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> motivated by economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E
40|$|This study exemplifies, {{analyses}} and discusses the conceptual metaphors <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> water and <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> animals in British media discourse. In {{order to do}} this, examples of linguistic tokens of the metaphors were collected from four of the biggest newspapers in Britain; Daily Mail, The Sun, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. Linguistic tokens of the metaphors were found {{in all of the}} newspapers. The tokens of <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> animals often appeared within quotation marks, whereas the <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> water tokens appeared mostly unmarked, implying that <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> water is more conventionalized than <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> animals. The analysis of the tokens showed how different aspects of <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> either highlighted or hidden when it is conceptualized in terms of water or animals. In the process of highlighting/hiding certain aspects of <b>refugees,</b> the <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> dehumanized. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{architect}} of La Pausa, Robert Streitz, {{was a member}} of the French Resistance during the German occupation of France in the Second World War. Streitz hid in La Pausa's cellars from where he transmitted covert messages. Jewish <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> also able to use La Pausa, using its gardens as a staging post in their escape from France to the Italian border. During the German occupation of France, Chanel made several visits to La Pausa with her lover, the German spy Baron von Dincklage.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} line was nonetheless still {{fairly easy to}} cross. Local inhabitants were able to maintain fields on the other side, or even to live {{on one side and}} work on the other. <b>Refugees</b> <b>were</b> able to sneak across or bribe the guards, and the smuggling of goods in both directions was rife. The flow of emigrants remained large despite the increase in East German security measures: 675,000people fled to West Germany between 1949 and 1952.|$|E

5|$|A report {{into the}} {{experience}} of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007. The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{visit was}} a highmark in {{relations}} between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, {{who began to}} criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By {{the time of his}} assassination, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam and opposition to the Vietnam War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> killed by the shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah {{would be allowed to}} continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|The Holocaust in Albania {{consisted}} of murders, deportations and {{crimes against humanity}} committed against Jews, Slavs, Roma and other minorities in Greater Albania by German, Italian and Albanian collaborationist forces while the country was under Italian and German occupation during the Second World War. Throughout the war, nearly 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Albania-proper. Most of these Jewish <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> treated well by the local Albanian population, {{despite the fact that}} the country was occupied first by Fascist Italy, and then by Nazi Germany. Albanians, following a traditional custom of hospitality known as , often sheltered Jewish refugees in mountain villages, and transported them to Adriatic ports from where they fled to Italy. Other Jews joined resistance movements throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity.

30|$|Overall, these {{institutional}} details {{suggest that}} (1) the Syrian <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> forced to enter Turkey {{and the pace}} of inflow is high; (2) the <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> clustered into certain regions due to reasons that are not fully determined by their own locational preferences. The camps and accompanying public services as well as proximity to home have been the main determinants; and (3) the demographic and educational composition of the <b>refugees</b> <b>is</b> {{comparable to that of}} the natives living in the hosting regions suggesting that the potential for substitutability in the workforce is high. This setting suggests that both the decision to migrate and the location choice of the <b>refugees</b> <b>are</b> not entirely controlled by them; thus, there is a good opportunity to setup a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal impact of Syrian refugees on natives’ labor market outcomes.|$|R
5|$|The {{refugees}} needed buildings such as schools, hospitals, warehouses, {{places of}} worship were built for them. As part of the second phase, temporary villages were built and by mid-1955, most of the one million <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> living in rows of temporary housing settlements, mostly near highways leading out of Saigon, in provinces adjacent to the capital. The largest concentration of housing in this second stage was located {{to the north of}} the capital. Only a minority could be sent to the fertile Mekong Delta, as the area was already overcrowded. It was also restive due to the presence of militant religious sects, so the most of the military evacuees were sent there.|$|E
5|$|The role of UNTAG was {{to assist}} the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Martti Ahtisaari, in {{overseeing}} {{free and fair elections}} in Namibia for a Constituent Assembly. The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control, and this Assembly would then draw up a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG in ensuring that all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; Namibian <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.|$|E
5|$|The siege {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 194 Croatian military personnel, as well as 82–88 Croatian civilians. The JNA suffered 165 fatalities. The entire region was recaptured by the HV in Operation Tiger and the Battle of Konavle by the end of 1992. The offensive {{resulted in}} the displacement of 15,000 people, mainly from Konavle, who fled to Dubrovnik. Approximately 16,000 <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> evacuated from Dubrovnik by sea, and the city was resupplied by blockade-evading runabouts and a convoy of civilian vessels. More than 11,000 buildings were damaged and numerous homes, businesses, and public buildings were looted or torched.|$|E
5000|$|While the U.S. {{portrayed the}} refugee {{movement}} as people [...] "fleeing communism", U.S. Department of Defense {{studies showed that}} the most important cause of <b>refugees</b> <b>was</b> U.S. and South Vietnamese [...] "bombing and artillery fire, in conjunction with ground operations." [...] The response of the governments of South Vietnam and the U.S. {{to meet the needs of}} the <b>refugees</b> <b>was</b> inadequate. The <b>refugee</b> camps themselves <b>were</b> often hotbeds of discontent and Viet Cong activity. Some <b>refugee</b> camps <b>were</b> considered unsafe for South Vietnamese government officials to visit without military escorts.|$|R

5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, and <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The {{detachment}} in Florida, {{which had}} grown to about 400 men, was paid off and disbanded when the British post was evacuated {{at the end of}} the war. A small number of men went to Bermuda with the British as part of a refugee group, rejoining the main body of Colonial Marines. Others from the Florida unit remained in settlements around the wooden stockade, which had become a symbol of slave insurrection. Andrew Jackson opposed the presence of a group of armed fugitive slaves (although they were in a sparsely-populated area of Spanish Florida); this led to the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816 and the beginning of the First Seminole War. For their involvement in the conflict, two former auxiliary officers of the corps were executed in 1818 in what became known as the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. It is believed that former Colonial Marine <b>refugees</b> <b>were</b> among a group that escaped to the Bahamas in 1822 and founded, on the west coast of the island of Andros, a community that retains its identity to the present day.|$|E
