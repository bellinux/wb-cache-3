5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} of war with PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 <b>Richard</b> <b>and</b> Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the king was ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with <b>Richard</b> <b>and</b> PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E

25|$|On November 13, 1905, <b>Richards</b> <b>and</b> Comstock were {{sentence}}d to the custody of a United States Marshal for six hours and a fine of $300 and half of court costs. The modest sentence may have reflected a finding {{that they did not}} intimidate settlers and that their employees were at work removing the fences. Controversially, newspaper accounts charged that <b>Richards</b> <b>and</b> Comstock took part in a victory celebration instead of serving time. The Secretary of the Interior was upset about the news and fired District Attorney Baxter and Marshal Thomas L. Mathews, the officer in charge of <b>Richards</b> <b>and</b> Comstock's six-hour sentence. In reality, during their sentence, <b>Richards</b> <b>and</b> Comstock returned to the hotel to pack, write letters, shop, eat dinner, and arrive at the train station for the 11 p.m. train to Ellsworth.|$|R
