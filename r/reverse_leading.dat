5000|$|The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Watts & Ryan in 1976 [...] {{allows for the}} recovery of the basement subsidence and uplift history in the absence of sediment and water loading and, therefore isolate the contribution from the tectonic forces responsible for the formation of a rift basin. [...] It is a method by which successive layers of basin fill sediment are [...] "stripped off" [...] the total stratigraphy during analysis of that basin's history. In a typical scenario, a sedimentary basin deepens away from a marginal flexure, and the accompanying isochronous strata typically thicken basinward. By isolating the isochronous packages one-by-one, these can be [...] "peeled off" [...] or backstripped - and the lower bounding surface rotated upward to a datum. By successively backstripping isochrons, the basin's deepening history can be plotted in <b>reverse,</b> <b>leading</b> to clues as to its tectonic or isostatic origin. A more complete analysis uses decompaction of the remaining sequence following each stage of the back-stripping. This takes into account the amount of compaction caused by the loading of the later layers and allows a better estimation of the depositional thickness of the remaining layers and the variation of water depth with time.|$|E
40|$|The {{generally}} accepted {{view of the}} meridional circulation in the tropical east Pacific {{is that of a}} single deep overturning cell driven by deep convective heating in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), similar to the zonal mean Hadley circulation. However, recent observations of the atmosphere from the tropical eastern Pacific have called this view into question. In several independent datasets, significant meridional return flows out of the ITCZ region were observed, not only at high altitudes, but also at low altitudes, just above the atmospheric boundary layer. This paper presents a theory and idealized simulations to understand the causes and dynamics of this shallow meridional circulation (SMC). Fundamentally, the SMC {{can be seen as a}} large-scale sea-breeze circulation driven by sea surface tem-perature gradients when deep convection is absent in the ITCZ region. A simple model of this circulation is presented. Using observed values, the sea-breeze model shows that the pressure gradient above the boundary can indeed <b>reverse,</b> <b>leading</b> to the pressure force that drives the shallow return flow out of the ITCZ.

The 11 month mean freshwater transport (FWT), relative to a salinity of 34. 8, was 65 [*]±[*] 11 mSv to the south. Approximately 70 % of this {{was associated with the}} shelfbreak EGC and the remaining 30 % with the separated EGC. Very large southward FWT ranging from 160 mSv to 120 mSv was observed from September to mid-October 2011 and was foremost due to anomalously low upper-layer salinities. The FWT may, however, be underestimated by approximately 5 mSv due to sampling biases in the upper ocean. The FWT on the Greenland shelf was estimated using additional inshore moorings deployed from 2012 to 2014. While the annual mean ranged from nearly zero during the first year to 18 mSv to the south during the second year, synoptically the FWT on the shelf can be significant. Furthermore, an anomalous event in autumn 2011 caused the shelfbreak EGC to <b>reverse,</b> <b>leading</b> to a large reduction in FWT. This reversed circulation was due to the passage of a large, 100 km wide anticyclone originating upstream from the shelfbreak. The late summer FWT of − 131 mSv is 150 % larger than earlier estimates based on sections in the late- 1990 s and early- 2000 s.

40|$|ABSTRACT-In the era {{of water}} shortage, drip {{irrigation}} is commonly used now-a-day. Water used in these cases are obtained from various sources and contains dirt and impurities. Filters are usually mounted in the master pipe thereby used to prevent clogging as the outlet of drip irrigation and sprinklers are very small. Manual cleaning of filters are done periodically to avoid clogging[6]. Though the problem seems to be simple the outcome turns out worse. If cleaning is not done periodically, pressure of the water flow gets <b>reversed</b> <b>leading</b> to collapse of the entire irrigation system. This paper provides automatic drip filter cleaning mechanism. This system uses pressure indicator and four solenoid valves controlled by a microcontroller to implement this design. When the pressure in the main pipe system exceeds the threshold, the microcontroller activates the solenoid value to direct the water flow in opposite direction thereby cleaning the clog. This system provides zero maintenance scheme for the drip system users...|$|R

Presently, a situation is considered in which as a box of turbulence rotates, strain axes rotate with it. This is to be contrasted with the elliptic streamline flow in which the strain axes are fixed in an inertial frame. The elliptic flow is known to exhibit (inviscid) growth of turbulent energy and one might expect even more rapid growth with the strain-axes following the box. Instead, {{it is found that}} the sign of the Reynolds shear stress is <b>reversed</b> <b>leading</b> to a negative production term for turbulent energy. Partial understanding of the phenomenon is obtained from a consideration of the rotation of inertial waves relative to the strain axes as well as the "pressure-less" RDT argument put forward by Cambon etal.

40|$|Two {{models of}} how people predict the next outcome in a {{sequence}} of binary events were developed and compared {{on the basis of}} gambling data from a lab experiment using hierarchical Bayesian techniques. The results from a student sample (N = 39) indicated that a model that considers run length (“drift model”) —that is, how often the same event has previously occurred in a row—provided a better description of the data than did a stationary model taking only the immediately prior event into account. Both, expectation of negative and of positive recency was observed, and these tendencies mostly grew stronger with run length. For some individuals, however, the relationship was <b>reversed,</b> <b>leading</b> to a qualitative shift from expecting positive recency for short runs to expecting negative recency for long runs.

40|$|Growth yields, enzyme activities, {{cytochrome}} concentrations and {{the rates}} of product formation were determined in Propionibacteriurn shermanii cultures grown in a chemostat with lactate as the energy source at various concentrations of oxygen. Oxygen was toxic when its partial pressure in the inflowing gas was just sufficient to give measurable dissolved oxygen concentration in the culture, when it inhibited lactate oxidation and NADH oxidase activity. Below this oxygen concentration, P. shermanii behaved as a facultative anaerobe. The adaptation from anaerobic metabolism to aerobic metabolism, however, was complex. Low partial pressures of oxygen led to decreased cytochrome and membrane-bound de-hydrogenase activities and molar growth yield. Above an oxygen partial pressure of 42 mmHg in the inflowing gas stream, these changes were <b>reversed,</b> <b>leading</b> to an aerobic type of metabolism. At the highest subtoxic concentration of oxygen used (330 mmHg in the input gas), lactate was oxidized mainly to acetate and carbon dioxide {{and the rate of}} propionate formation was very low.

However, among higher birth weight infants, the pattern <b>reverses,</b> <b>leading</b> to a riddle of crossing birth weight-specific mortality curves. The riddle {{has been considered}} from different perspectives, including relative z scores, directed acyclic graphs, and, most recently, simulated mathematical models of underlying causal factors that produce the observed curves; similarly paradoxical gestational age-specific mortality curves uncross when calculations include all fetuses-at-risk rather than just infants delivered at a particular gestational age. However, researchers have generally focused on birth weight rather than gestational age, likely because birth weight is accurately measured and, if one assumes that birth weight is an intermediate variable between the underlying causal factors and mortality, is easier to model. Within the framework of existing analytical approaches, adding the complexity of a direct relation between gestational age and mortality, and possibly more complex relations among the casual factors, may be difficult. Nevertheless, duration of pregnancy seems a better proxy for the true construct of interest, whether the baby is mature enough to survive, so shifting attention to understanding the riddle of gestational age-specific mortality is encouraged...|$|R

As primary producers in many food chains, diatoms are sensitive to an array of environmental factors and in particular change such as nutrient levels like phosphorus. During this study, high spatial resolution diatom samples were collected during late winter and summer from the Taw catchment and two of its sub-catchments; the Little Dart and Lapford Yeo. Samples were collected in triplicate from five sites along each catchment yielding a total of forty-five samples per season. Field Preparation, production of slides and microscope analysis were carried out following the standard Environment Agency protocols (Kelly et al, 2001) permitting comparisons within comparisons within and between the Taw and its sub-catchments to be made as well as seasonal comparisons. Through taking replicate samples, the uncertainty on individual scores could be assessed. The Trophic diatom Index (TDI) data suggest that phosphorus levels in the upper reaches of the Taw were low but downstream the composition of phosphorus tolerant versus phosphorus intolerant species was <b>reversed</b> <b>leading</b> to higher TDI values. However, when looking at the TDI values in the two sub-catchments, the transition of phosphorus tolerant vs. phosphorus intolerant was not as distinguished from the upper reaches and downstream.

It is proposed that the amelioration of both problems may be solved through a common process. This is the production of sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide, which is the main pollutant of smelter effluent gases. The conversion process is cheap and easy, and the sulfuric acid could then be added to irrigation waters to increase the solubility of CA carbonate in the soil, thereby decreasing alkalinity. Lower alkalinity results in increased soil permeability and increased water use efficiency by plants. The potential market for sulfuric acid in irrigation was calculated, {{on the basis of}} neutralizing 90 % of the bicarbonate ion concentration in Colorado River water and Arizona well water, to be about 1. 6 million tons annually, representing about 1 / 3 of the sulfur now dissipated by smelters as air pollution.
