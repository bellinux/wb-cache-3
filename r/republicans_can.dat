2500|$|After the 2010 {{elections}} and the announcement from Rep. Mike Pence that he was stepping away from his leadership position in the House, Bachmann announced on her Facebook page her intention to seek the position of House Republican Conference Chair. As Bachmann {{is the founder of}} the House's Tea Party Caucus, her announcement caused some to see the leadership election as [...] "an early test of how GOP leaders will treat the antiestablishment movement's winners". Many among the House's Republican leadership, including Eric Cantor and the retiring Mike Pence, were quick to endorse Rep. Jeb Hensarling for the position; Speaker-to-be John Boehner remained neutral on the issue. Supporters of Bachmann's run include Reps. Steve King, John Kline, Louie Gohmert, Chip Cravaack, Erik Paulsen, as well as media personality and political commentator Glenn Beck. Listing her qualifications for the position Bachmann noted [...] "I've done an effective job speaking out at a national and local level, motivating people with our message, calling attention to deficits in Obama's policy. I was instrumental in bringing {{tens of thousands of people}} to the U.S. capitol to rally against Obama care and to attend our press conference." [...] She noted her work to keep the Tea Party within the GOP rather than having it become a third party thereby helping the party capture the House, stating [...] "I have been able to bring a voice and motivate people to, in effect, put that gavel in John Boehner's hands, so that <b>Republicans</b> <b>can</b> lead going forward. …It's important that leadership represents the choice of the people coming into our caucus….I think I have motivated a high number of people to get involved in this cycle who may have sat it out and that have made a difference on a number of these races. I gave a large amount of money to NRCC and individual candidates and started Michele PAC, which raised $650,000 for members since July, so I was able to financially help about 50 people out." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{begin with}} Utah. If it {{prove to be}} true, as is probable, {{that the people of}} Utah are in open {{rebellion}} to the United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes. I say, too, if they are in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the Judge's mode of coercing them is not as good as any. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>can</b> fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said. To be sure, it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted doctrine of self-government for the Territories; but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery. Those who could not see that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors, and secretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories without their choice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from the dead.|$|E

60|$|It {{certainly}} {{was a very}} bold and almost desperate measure, and the reader, whether Monarchist or <b>Republican,</b> <b>can</b> hardly help wishing the young adventurer success. The romantic enterprise was, however, destined to fail. The people of England were not yet prepared to return to royalty. Some few of the ancient noble families and country gentlemen adhered to the king's cause, but they came in to join his ranks very slowly. Those who {{were in favor of}} the king were called Cavaliers. The other party were called Roundheads. Queen Henrietta Maria had given them the name, on account of their manner of wearing their hair, cut short and close to their heads all around, while the gay Cavaliers cultivated their locks, which hung in long curls down upon their shoulders. The Cavaliers, it turned out, were few, while the Roundheads filled the land.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reversal}} {{was used}} by the Democrats seeking their party's nomination, but it was first widely used by Pat Buchanan during his primary election battle against Bush. Buchanan stated that Bush's reversal was one of his main reasons for opposing Bush. On the day he entered the race, he said it was [...] "because we <b>Republicans,</b> <b>can</b> no longer say it is all the liberals' fault. It was not some liberal Democrat who said 'Read my lips: no new taxes,' then broke his word to cut a seedy backroom budget deal with the big spenders on Capitol Hill." [...] Buchanan subsequently made extensive use of the 1988 quotation in his New Hampshire campaign, repeating it constantly in both television and radio commercials. Buchanan won a surprising 40% of the vote in New Hampshire, a major rebuff to the President.|$|E

Editor-at-large at right-wing website Breitbart.com John Nolte was more positive in his review, stating that the performance was [...] "funnier, fresher, edgier, and braver than anything those comedy cowards Chris Rock, Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert have done in 15 years". Bill Maher sidetracked to point out the hypocrisy of Eastwood's presence at the convention, stating that he has [...] "seven children with five different women" [...] (actually a conservative estimate). However, Maher praised Eastwood's performance and his decision to go off-script during a heavily scripted affair: [...] "As a performer, as a stand-up comedian for 30 years who knows {{how hard it is to}} get laughs ... he went up there ... without a net, on a tightrope. There was no teleprompter. He did a bit with just an empty chair and killed." [...] Mark Steyn spoke particularly favorably of Eastwood's closing statement, referring to it as [...] "some of the hardest lines of the convention". Jon Stewart commented on the August 31 episode of The Daily Show that Eastwood's performance could be understood as a metaphor for the existence of [...] "a President Obama that only <b>Republicans</b> <b>can</b> see", who bears [...] "so little resemblance to the world and the President that I experience." ...|$|E

60|$|But it {{reflects}} {{not at all}} upon the high intelligence, the unobtrusive but sterling moral qualities, the tact, dignity, and personal charm of the central figure in their pageantries, a charm the pathetic circumstances of his unseasonable illness very greatly enhanced, if the New Republican fails to consider these ceremonials of primary importance, if he declines {{to see them as}} of any necessary importance at all, until it has been conclusively shown that they do minister to the bettering of births and of the lives intervening between birth and birth. On the surface they do not do that. Unless they can be shown to do that they are dissipations of energy, they are irrelevant and wrong, from the New Republican point of view.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} identifying the perspective from which a document was written. By perspective we mean a point of view, for example, {{from the perspective of}} Democrats or <b>Republicans.</b> <b>Can</b> computers learn to identify the perspective of a document? Furthermore, can computers identify which sentences in a document strongly convey a particular perspective? We develop statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed models on a collection of articles on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The results show that the statistical models can successfully learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage and identify the perspective of a document with very high accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} most {{well thought out}} {{contemporary}} conception of republican liberty put forward by Philip Pettit and Quentin Skinner. I demonstrate that it is incoherent: at least insofar as it seeks to pick out a form of unfreedom not captured by the negative conception of liberty. This incoherence arises because Pettit and Skinner cannot both hold that republican unfreedom is defined by one agent’s mere capacity to interfere arbitrarily with another agent and, at the same time, claim that <b>republican</b> freedom <b>can</b> be promoted by deterrence mechanisms. My contribution to contemporary republican theory is {{to suggest that a}} coherent <b>republican</b> conception <b>can</b> be achieved, however, through an important revision. This is to replace Pettit and Skinner’s antonym of republican liberty—the power to interfere arbitrarily—with a higher order power—the power to determine arbitrarily rules with respect to interference. This revised conception does pick out a genuinely distinct extension of unfreedom from the negative liberty conception. I believe it also reflects an important intuitive sense in which we may understand ourselves to be unfree, that is, to live under the rule of another...|$|R
