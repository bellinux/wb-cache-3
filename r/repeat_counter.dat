50|$|When {{a packet}} (or byte, on {{telephone}} switches) {{comes to the}} input, the switch stores the data in RAM in one sequence, and reads {{it out in a}} different sequence. Switch designs vary, but typically, a <b>repeating</b> <b>counter</b> is incremented with an internal clock. It typically wraps-around to zero. The RAM location chosen for the incoming data is taken from a small memory indexed by the counter. It is usually a location for the desired output time-slot. The current value of the counter also selects the RAM data to forward in the current output time slot. Then the counter is incremented to the next value. The switch repeats the algorithm, eventually sending data from any input time-slot to any output time-slot.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the predictive value of landing stability and technique to gain insight into risk factors for ankle and knee injuries in indoor team sport players. Seventy-five male and female basketball, volleyball or korfball players were screened by measuring landing stability after a single-leg jump landing and landing technique during a <b>repeated</b> <b>counter</b> movement jump by detailed 3 -dimensional kinematics and kinetics. During the season 11 acute ankle injuries were reported along with 6 acute and 7 overuse knee injuries by the teams' physical therapist. Logistic regression analysis showed less landing stability in the forward and diagonal jump direction (OR 1. 01 - 1. 10, p 0. 05) in players who sustained an acute ankle injury. Furthermore landing technique with a greater ankle dorsiflexion moment increased the risk for acute ankle injury (OR 2. 16, p 0. 05). A smaller knee flexion moment and greater vertical ground reaction force increased the risk of an overuse knee injury (OR 0. 29 and 1. 13 respectively, p 0. 05). Less one-legged landing stability and suboptimal landing technique were shown in players sustaining an acute ankle and overuse knee injury compared to healthy players. Determining both landing stability and technique may further guide injury prevention programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} and analysis of telemetry data from users' devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for <b>repeated</b> collection of <b>counter</b> data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards <b>repeated</b> collection of <b>counter</b> data, with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by Microsoft to collect telemetry across millions of devices.

40|$|Problem Statement and Background: As {{artificial}} turfs (AT) {{become more}} commonplace, {{the number of}} recreational athletes playing on them increases. Some aspects of performance such as speed appear to be better on AT; yet higher rates of injury have been reported. Despite this information, there are still few published studies on outcomes of athletic playing surfaces on athlete performance. Further, there is no research that compares individual performance on AT, hard surfaces and different composite natural surfaces. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare athlete performance on AT against two different natural turf bases and a hard surface. ^ Methods: Forty-three subjects, twenty-one males (age: 20 ± 1. 82 yrs.; height: 177. 53 ± 5. 87 cm; weight: 78. 44 ± 11. 59 kg; body fat: 11. 17 ± 4. 45 percent) and twenty-two females (age: 22 ± 1. 32 yrs.; height: 161. 37 ± 6. 47 cm; weight: 60. 94 ± 10. 24 kg; body fat: 27. 16 ± 7. 08 percent) were randomized and performed a single countermovement jump (SCMJ), repeated countermovement jumps (RCMJ), and single depth jump (SDJ) on four different playing turf surface bases; [(peat soil composition turf (NT 1), sandy loam composition turf (NT 2), one AT, and one hard surface (HS) ]. Surface test order was randomized and maximum force (N), power (W) and jump height (cm) was recorded for each jump. Repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferonni post-hoc was used to determine SCMJ, RCMJ and SDJ differences in performance on playing surfaces. Statistical significance was set at p≤ 0. 05. ^ Results: There were no significant differences in maximum force or jump height on different surfaces. Males had significantly higher force, power and jump height on all surfaces compared to females. Single counter movement jump power was lower on the peat/soil structure (NT 1) compared to all other surfaces [(NT 1 : 1530 ± 389 W) vs. (NT 2 : 2369 ± 866 W), (AT: 2312 ± 945 W), HS: 2245 ± 796 W) ]. <b>Repeated</b> <b>counter</b> jump power force and power was not significantly different across surfaces. ^ Conclusions: Differences in performance between genders were observed. The only significant difference in performance on different turfs was lower power during SCMJ on NT 1. Greater eccentric loading prior to the concentric portion of jumping enhances power production through the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). The difference in power between surfaces was not observed when RCMJ and SDJ were performed, and may be due to the increased reactiveness of the SSC in repeated jumps and depth jump overcoming the reported decreased density of the peat soil composition of NT 1. Due to marginal differences between athletic performance and playing surface type, future research comparing playing surface type and rate of injury should be considered. ...|$|R

The final article is available, upon publication, at: [URL] Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach {{based on the premise}} that when faced with adversity irrational beliefs determine unhealthy negative emotions and maladaptive behaviors, whereas rational beliefs lead to healthy and adaptive alternatives. The detrimental effects of irrational beliefs on psychological health are established, however less is known about the deleterious effects on human behavior and performance. In the present study we examined the effects of irrational and rational self-statements on motor-skill performance (Experiment 1), performance effectiveness, and efficiency during a modified hazard perception task, and task persistence during a breath-holding task (Experiment 2). Using a <b>repeated</b> measures <b>counter</b> balanced design, two cohorts of 35 undergraduate university students were recruited for Experiment 1 and 2, each participating in no self-statement, irrational, and rational self-statement conditions. Data indicated no differences in motor-skill and task performance, performance efficiency, task persistence, mental effort, and pre-performance anxiety between irrational and rational self-statement conditions. In contrast to previous research the findings provide insight into a juxtaposition that irrational beliefs hinder psychological health, yet may help performance, highlighting important distinctions in factual and practical rationality that have been overlooked within the extant literature. The findings have important practical implications for practitioners that may look to REBT to enhance the psychological health and performance for individuals who operate in high performance contexts. Further, the short and long-term effects of irrational and rational beliefs on performance and psychological health warrants greater investigation...|$|R
40|$|Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are {{a central}} {{algorithm}} deployed {{in virtually every}} security protocol in common usage. The integrity and authenticity of messages relies entirely on {{the security of the}} MAC; we examine cases in which this security is lost. In this paper, we examine the notion of “reforgeability ” for MACs. We first give a definition for this new notion, then examine some of the most widely-used and well-known MACs under our definition. We show that for each of these MACs there exists an attack that allows efficient forgeries after the first one is obtained, and we show that simply making these schemes stateful is usually insufficient. For those schemes where adding state is effective, we go one step further to examine how counter misuse affects the security of the MAC, finding, in many cases, simply <b>repeating</b> a single <b>counter</b> value yields complete insecurity. These issues motivated the design of a new scheme, WMAC, which has a number of desirable properties. It is as efficient as the fastest MACs, resists counter misuse, and has tags which may be truncated to the desired length without affecting security (currently, the fastest MACs do not have this property), making it resistant to reforging attacks and arguably the best MAC for constraine...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this project was to {{investigate}} the long time effectiveness of different radon remedial methods. The ten years project started 1991. From start the investigation comprised of 105 dwellings (91 single-family houses and 14 flats in multi-family buildings). In all of the dwellings remedial measures were carried out in the eighties. Before and immediately after the reduction the local measured the radon concentrations. New measurements of the radon concentrations have been made every third year; in 1991, 1994, 1997 and in 2000. Twelve different radon remedial methods and method combinations were used. The radon sources were building materials as well as sub-soils. In all of the dwellings the radon concentrations were measured by nuclear track films during 3 months (January-March) measurements and in half of them the air change rates by passive tracer gas methods. The results of the 2000 and the 1991 (within brackets) studies showed that the radon concentration was up to 200 Bq/m sup 3 in 54 (54) single-family houses and 7 (7) flats, between 210 Bq/m sup 3 and 400 Bq/m sup 3 in 23 (18) single-family houses and 5 (6) flats, and higher than 400 Bq/m sup 3 in 12 (18) single-family houses and 2 (1) flats. The study 1991 showed also that in about 40 % of the cases the radon concentration had increased by more than 30 % only a few years after reduction actions had been taken. In 19 dwellings the radon concentration was at least doubled. In no fewer than 38 dwellings the radon level has been over 400 Bq/m sup 3 in {{at least one of the}} four measuring occasions. The change in radon concentrations was not specific to any given method but seemed to be evenly distributed over all of them.

40|$|A {{series of}} four {{experiments}} are presented which contrast {{the hypothesis that}} synonymy is semantically represented with the hypothesis that synonymy is lexically represented. They also {{stress the importance of}} task focal information in the interpretation of experimental results. Current mental models appear to operate with the implicit assumption that synonymy is represented semantically. The findings of Biggs and Marmurek (1983, 1990), that synonymous word-picture prime-target presentations produced greater naming facilitation than their <b>repeated</b> counterparts, run <b>counter</b> to the semantic representation hypothesis. The current investigations manipulated the type and degree of processing overlap between prime and target items by using specific tasks for primes and targets. In Experiment 1 primes were named and targets were categorized. This removed lexical overlap, present in Biggs and Marmurek, and made task focal information different for primes and targets. The results showed greater facilitation in the repeated word-picture condition than in the corresponding synonymous condition. In Experiment 2 primes were categorized and targets were named. This manipulation re-instated lexical processing overlap in the word-picture conditions, while maintaining differences in focal information. The results showed statistically significant and equivalent facilitation for word-picture presentations in repeated and synonymous conditions. In Experiment 3 primes and targets were independently categorized. This manipulation removed lexical processing overlap, and made prime and target focal information similar. The results for repeated and synonymous word-picture presentations replicated those in Experiment 2. Experiment 4 required subjects to respond 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 about category inclusiveness to pairs of sequentially presented items. The results indicated that response latencies for synonymous word-picture pairs were significantly faster than for those pairs in the repeated condition and that those conditions were faster than the related condition. Errors in the repeated and synonymous conditions were approximately equal and much lower than in the related condition. Combined error and response latency patterns suggested focal information was lexically based. These results favour the lexical hypothesis of synonym representation. Further discussion focuses on the implications of focal information monitoring for the interpretation of experimental outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>repeated</b> evolution runs <b>counter</b> to {{expectations about the}} role of contingency in adaptation. However, many examples of independently acquired similar traits show that evolution sometimes does follow the same path. Factors influencing the probability of such an event include selection, trait complexity and relatedness. Previous investigations of repeated adaptation have primarily focused on low-complexity traits subject to strong selection. Studies of systems with varying levels of trait complexity, selection, and relatedness are needed to evaluate the relative contributions of these factors. The series of studies reported here 1) establishes a system for inquiry into the role of parallel adaptation among hosts and parasites and 2) provides an assessment of the role of parallel genetic change in the evolution of a complex trait. In Chapter 2, I show that all-female broods in a line of Drosophila borealis are caused by infection with a male-killing strain of Wolbachia that is very closely-related to another male-killing strain infecting a geographically and evolutionarily distant species of Drosophila. This host-parasite system, together with two other known male-killing Wolbachia strains infecting Drosophila provides a framework for investigating the role of parallel evolution in the independent acquisition of the male-killing trait among Wolbachia, {{as well as in the}} adaptation of divergent hosts to similar male-killing parasites. In Chapters 3 - 5, I investigate the role of parallel genetic change in a complex trait in two species of Drosophila by searching for evidence of adaptation in the Drosophila americana homologs of genes thought to underlie adaptation to climate in Drosophila melanogaster. In Chapter 3, I investigate the D. americana homolog of Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). In contrast with D. melanogaster, which segregates functionally distinct variants in Adh that represent local adaptation to climate, D. americana segregates little variation. This is surprising, especially because Adh of D. americana is found near a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement that does segregate geographically-structured alleles across the species 2 ̆ 7 range. In Chapter 4, I report similarities at the Phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) locus in the two species, including a shared excess of nonsynonymous variants and the presence of clinal alleles. However, while variation at Pgm of D. melanogaster is proposed to underlie local adaptation, variation at Pgm of D. americana appears to be predominantly neutral. In Chapter 5, I investigate the role of positive selection in sequence evolution in the D. americana homologs of a group of genes thought to underlie local adaptation to climate in D. melanogaster. The two species share a large geographic range and exhibit levels of sequence variation that indicate a similar effective population size, but D. melanogaster appears to undergo more frequent fixation of advantageous alleles. Approximately half of all amino acid divergence in D. melanogaster is attributable to positive selection, but I find no signs of positive selection in the investigated genes in D. americana. Overall, the results reveal little or no parallel evolution at the single genes analyzed. This lack of parallel evolution is likely a result of the high complexity of adaptation to climate as well as contingency...|$|R
