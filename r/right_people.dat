However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

Phillips as Apollo program director in OMSF. Webb agreed, and so did AFSC chief General Bernard Schriever. Phillips in turn agreed and brought with him 42 mid-grade officers and eventually 124 more junior officers. Ultimately, over 400 experienced military officers worked on Apollo and other NASA programs during the 1960s.|$|E

These systems measure constrained and unconstrained demand along with pace to gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival. Yield management teams in the hotel industry have evolved tremendously over the last 10 years and in this global economy targeting the right distribution channels, controlling costs, and having the right market mix {{plays an important role}} in yield management.

25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to the <b>right</b> <b>people</b> at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

[...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the <b>right</b> <b>people</b> to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together."

500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman?

When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record.

[...] By 1514, she noted that the Pope was running low on funds, but continued to act in her family's interest.

[...] The Medicis began to have public disputes about which of the family members and clients should get the most powerful and influential positions. [...] Alfonsina was working so that her son would have sole authority in Florence, while others, led by Lucrezia, wanted a more distributed government.

500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding the <b>right</b> <b>people</b> and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go. ... I think the energy has to come on the set at the very last minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E

Lin revealed that they are looking for a diverse cast. In April 2017, Will Smith entered talks to play the Genie. The following month, Jade Thirlwall entered talks to portray the role of Jasmine. Alan Menken said filming is slated to begin August 2017. Production had originally been scheduled to begin in July, but was delayed due to Disney having trouble finding the <b>right</b> <b>people</b> to play Aladdin and Jasmine. British actress Naomi Scott and Indian actress Tara Sutaria were being considered to play Jasmine. For the role of Aladdin, British actors Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel were initially considered, but it was later decided that a newcomer should be cast in the role. In July 2017, it was announced that Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud has been cast as Aladdin, Naomi Scott has been cast as Jasmine, and Will Smith has been cast as the Genie. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Alan Menken announced that he would be co-writing new songs for the film with Academy Award winners [...] Pasek and Paul (La La Land) while Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones) would re-write the script. In August 2017, Marwan Kenzari, Nasim Pedrad, and Numan Acar joined the cast as Jafar, Dalia, and Hakim, respectively.
