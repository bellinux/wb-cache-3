40|$|Three studies {{demonstrate}} that the framing of redemption windows as expansive or restrictive, while keeping the actual length of the window constant, influences consumers ’ evaluations of sales promotions. When feasibility concerns are highlighted (e. g., in an implemental mindset), consumers prefer the expansive “anytime ” (vs. the restrictive “only”) frame. However, consumers in a deliberative mindset prefer the restrictive “only ” (vs. the expansive “anytime”) frame. Study 1 reveals that while the former attend more {{to their ability to}} <b>redeem</b> <b>the</b> <b>offer,</b> the latter are influenced more by the precision of the offer. Study 2 highlights the mediating role of these inferences on consumers ’ likelihood of availing the offer. Study 3 demonstrates the impact of these frames on real-world coupon redemption. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope of this framing effect, the implications of the findings, and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Berufliche Orientierungen von Pilotinnen weckt große Erwartungen, die leider nur teilweise eingelöst werden. Es ermöglicht Einsichten in die Berufsbiographien von Pilotinnen und in das „Gendering“ des Berufsfelds, gibt aber auf zentrale Fragen, u. a. nach den Barrieren, die Frauen den Weg an die Spitze versperren, keine befriedigenden Antworten. So bleibt auch offen, warum Fliegen glücklich macht. Berufliche Orientierungen von Pilotinnen (Occupational Orientation of Female Pilots) awakens great {{expectations}} that are unfortunately only partially <b>redeemed.</b> <b>The</b> text <b>offers</b> greater {{insight into the}} career biographies of female pilots and into the “gendering” of the occupational field. It does not give satisfying answers to central questions, among these as to the barriers that bar women’s way to the top. Thus, why flying makes people happy remains an open question...|$|R
