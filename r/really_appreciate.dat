25|$|From 1864 to 1871, Lewis {{was written}} about or interviewed by Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Peabody, Anna Quincy Waterston, and Laura Curtis Bullard. These were all {{important}} women in Boston and New York abolitionist circles. Because of these women, articles about Lewis appeared in important abolitionist journals including Broken Fetter, the Christian Register, and the Independent, {{as well as}} many others. Lewis was perceptive to her reception in Boston. She was not opposed to the coverage she received in the abolitionist press, and she was not known to deny monetary aid, but she could not tolerate the false praise. She knew that some did not <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> her art, but saw her as an opportunity to express and show their support for human rights.|$|E

500|$|In the off-season, the Islanders {{selected}} goaltender Rick DiPietro {{with the}} first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying, [...] "I didn't expect it at all. One day they're telling me I'm the goalie of the future, {{and the next day}} I'm gone.

500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored".

[...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album.

500|$|The Italian critic Franco Moretti {{argued that}} Austen's novels {{articulated}} {{a new form}} of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an [...] "eternal England", whose [...] "unpolitical" [...] works unlike the [...] "political" [...] novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of [...] "modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> Austen, writing [...] "Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the feel of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards [...] "an evolving national democracy", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and [...] "nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as {{different from the rest of}} Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of [...] "Anglo-Saxon civilisations", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its [...] "clear" [...] style and [...] "unpolitical" [...] way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and [...] "political" [...] way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.|$|E
