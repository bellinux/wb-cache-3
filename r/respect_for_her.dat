5|$|Queen Gertrude showed blatant favoritism {{towards her}} German {{relatives}} and courtiers, causing widespread discontent among the native lords. Taking {{advantage of her}} husband's campaign in the distant Principality of Halych, a group of aggrieved noblemen seized and murdered her in the forests of the Pilis Hills on 28 September 1213. King Andrew only punished one of the conspirators, a certain Count Peter, after his return from Halych. Although Béla was a child when his mother was assassinated, he never forgot her and declared his deep <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in many of his royal charters. In his correspondence with his sister, the noted Franciscan saint, Elizabeth of Hungary, he was often counseled to restrain his anger at the nobles {{for the death of}} their mother.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 year-end {{retrospective}} of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser {{was focused on}} Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what {{the impact of the}} tour would be, but looked optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave much credit to Liliuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> performance as temporary Regent. Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention. He was praised for his personal qualities of leadership and personality, as well as for his positive interaction with global leaders.

25|$|Fukuda's grandfather, Fukuda Hachinosuke, {{had been}} a samurai and master of Tenjin Shinyō-ryū jujutsu, and he had taught that art to Kanō Jigorō, founder of judo {{and head of the}} Kodokan. Kanō had studied under three jujutsu masters before {{founding}} judo, and Fukuda's grandfather had been the first of these men. Kanō had taught female students as early as 1893 (Sueko Ashiya), and had formally opened the joshi-bu (women's section) of the Kodokan in 1926. He personally invited the young Fukuda to study judo—an unusual gesture for that time—as a mark of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> grandfather. She began training in judo in 1935, as one of only 24 women training at the Kodokan. Apart from instruction by judo's founder, Fukuda also learned from Kyuzo Mifune.|$|E
25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. He kissed her hand and showed <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is about}} {{survival}} at all costs against a seemingly invincible foe. Shade's increasing lack of humanity is a constant threat to the reader and characters in the book. Ninde and Gold-Eye's growing relationship throughout the story is a touching account of love against adversity. In contrast to this, Drum and Ella are more serious about the situation they are in. However, they are constantly supporting each other and provide comfort {{at the end of}} the novel. Ella is a strong leader, yet her <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> teammates, especially Ninde, grows considerably during the book's events. One interesting literary device are the interludes between the chapters. They add to the book's depth, provide the readers with extra information and sometimes reveal events elsewhere. For instance, when the Sub is attacked by creatures, the interlude is part of the training session for creature attacks. All interludes are taken from Shade's computer archive.|$|E

25|$|Though showing {{herself a}} capable writer and poet, Táhirih {{was forced to}} comply with family {{pressure}} and {{at the age of}} fourteen she was married to her cousin Muhammad Baraghani the son of her uncle. The marriage resulted in three children, two sons: Ibrahim and Isma’il and one daughter. The marriage however, was an unhappy one from the start and Muhammad Baraghani seemed to have been reluctant to allow his wife to further her literary pursuits. In Qazvin Táhirih reportedly won renown for her beauty and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> knowledge, however the latter was a quality regarded as undesirable in a daughter and wife. Her husband eventually became the leader of the Friday prayers. Her two sons fled from their father after their mother's death to Najaf and Tehran whilst the daughter died shortly after her mother's passing. It was in the home of her cousin that Táhirih first became acquainted with and started correspondence with leaders of the Shaykhi movement, including Kazim Rashti, which flourished in the Shi'i shrine cities in Iraq.|$|E

500|$|Miss Rosa is {{a complex}} {{character}} and as she is developed she became more humanized. Though suffering from cancer, she does not let this define her or limit what she can do. Rosenblat said that she styled Miss Rosa to be a self-absorbed woman who had {{spent a long time}} incarcerated in Litchfield prison. The character's fellow inmates have much <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> While the actress also wanted to play her as [...] "classy and centered". She is an adrenaline junkie with attitude but also has a good heart.|$|E
500|$|During {{the season}} Miss Rosa has several {{encounters}} with the show's villain Yvonne [...] "Vee" [...] Parker (Lorraine Toussaint). Rosenblat told Taylor Cole Miller of The Huffington Post that she recalled thinking that the storyline {{would not have a}} happy ending and felt that there was a bigger story to come from it. Another storyline sees the character attending chemotherapy sessions at a hospital.

500|$|Howard Gordon, the {{executive}} producer of 24, said that, during character development, they [...] "wanted an actress that had the strength and intelligence to be a first lady, yet have the unpredictability of never knowing when she might snap." [...] Jean Smart was their first choice. [...] Smart later told The New York Times that she decided she was eager to play the role after reading the character's introductory scene, and commented that in her almost 30years of acting she had come across few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did: a character that is sexy, mysterious, and powerful, yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband.|$|E

500|$|Thematically, {{the novel}} portrays Alabama's {{struggle}} (and hence Zelda's as well) {{to rise above}} being [...] "a back-seat driver about life" [...] and to earn <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> own accomplishments—to establish herself independently of her husband. Zelda's writing style was quite different from Scott's. The language used in Save Me the Waltz is filled with verbal flourishes and complex metaphors. The novel is also deeply sensual; as literary scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote in 1979, [...] "The sensuality arises from Alabama's awareness of the life surge within her, {{the consciousness of the}} body, the natural imagery through which not only emotions but simple facts are expressed, the overwhelming presence of the senses, in particular touch and smell, in every description." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the fight between Don and Megan, Weiner {{commented on the}} violence and passion, noting that [...] "what you get is that Don loves this woman" [...] and that Megan is [...] "everything that's good to him". [...] Jessica Pare commented on Don's lack of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> work, and Jon Hamm judged Don's actions as [...] "immature". However, Hamm regarded Don's fear as [...] "genuine" [...] when he is unsure of Megan's whereabouts. The flashback scene between Don and Megan in the car was actually shot for the fourth season finale, [...] "Tomorrowland", {{written and directed by}} Weiner, but was cut. Weiner decided to reinsert this scene into the episode as a flashback.|$|E

The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan commended her [...] "craft, empathy and respect" [...] and compared {{her to the}} character of Diana, writing that Kusama [...] "is her protagonist's double in terms of drive, commitment and ability". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although the plot was clichéd and unrealistic at times, Kusama's direction showed [...] "a clear, personal filmmaking style ... and a <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> characters' weaknesses as well as their moments of athletic beauty". James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it [...] "a well crafted and emotionally satisfying debut" [...] and applauding Kusama's [...] "single-minded determination and a passion for the project".|$|E

In addition, three albums were also {{released}} to accommodate {{the success of the}} three singles, including a tribute to songwriter Dallas Frazier named If It Ain't Love and Other Great Dallas Frazier Songs.

500|$|R. Kelly {{would have}} other {{allegations}} made about him regarding underage {{girls in the}} years following her death and his marriage to Aaliyah was used to evidence his involvement with them. He refused to discuss his relationship with her, citing that she was dead. [...] "Out of <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and her mom and her dad, I will not discuss Aaliyah.

[...] Aaliyah's mother Diane Haughton reflected that everything [...] "that went wrong in her life" [...] began with her relationship with R. Kelly. The allegations have been said to have done [...] "little to taint Aaliyah's image or prevent her from becoming a reliable '90s hitmaker with viable sidelines in movies and modeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Schur, co-creator of Parks and Recreation, {{said the}} episode {{included}} development {{of several of}} the protagonist characters, including Ben Wyatt, Ann Perkins, and Ron Swanson. One of the major story arcs of the season entails Ben, who had never had a firm sense of home, gradually falling in love with the town of Pawnee due to the optimism and enthusiasm Leslie Knope shows for the town and her job. Commentators suggested this transition appeared to begin in [...] "Flu Season", when Ben is visibly, extremely impressed by Leslie's perfect deliverance of a public presentation despite her illness. Steve Kandell of New York magazine wrote: [...] "This is obviously the moment when Ben’s begrudging <b>respect</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> becomes something else", and The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow wrote: [...] "Parks and Recreation has allowed Ben to develop in the background so far, but his affection for Pawnee is clearly growing." ...|$|E
