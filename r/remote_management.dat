2500|$|Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, {{implements}} out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, <b>remote</b> <b>management,</b> {{and remote}} control of PCs with no {{involvement of the}} host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have [...] "the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMaritime data communications are expensive and of limited capacity. Currently {{there is no}} established infrastructure to support Internet connectivity for sea-going vessels. The SeaNet program is investigating maritime networking solutions. One aspect of the SeaNet program is promoting <b>remote</b> network <b>management.</b> <b>Remote</b> network <b>management</b> will provide the maritime research community with a flexible and cost-effective tool for monitoring sea based assets. The objective of this thesis is to investigate <b>remote</b> network <b>management</b> over a satellite connection {{in support of the}} SeaNet programs goals. To research the potential for <b>remote</b> network <b>management,</b> the Naval Postgraduate School has developed its own SeaNet laboratory. This laboratory simulates both the shipboard and shore-based infrastructure of the SeaNet program and conducts <b>remote</b> network <b>management</b> on these components. This thesis discusses the SeaNet program, network management concepts, the NPS SeaNet laboratory, research findings and recommendations for fliture research. <b>Remote</b> Network <b>Management</b> of the SeaNet Control Node system is possible, however, continued research in this area is needed[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
