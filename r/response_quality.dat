The Norwegian authorities emphasize that simplification of public forms is important to improve communication between the users and the public sector. The idea is expressed like this in the preface of the guidelines: [...] "The proceeding transition to electronic reporting may be an important simplification measure for the respondents, but only if the Internet-based solutions are felt to be more user friendly than the old paper versions. By applying good pedagogical principles, electronic forms may also ensure {{a better understanding of the}} task, better validation of the data before submission, and by that even better <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> and more efficient processing by the relevant authority." ...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare subjects with bipolar disorders (BPD) to non-bipolar subjects in terms of <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> to the NEO-FFI. Using data from the population-based cohort study PsyCoLaus, subjects were compared in terms of responses to the NEO-FFI, and indices of <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> were calculated. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed and controlled for sociodemographic factors, depressive episodes, dysthymia, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Consistent with the literature, subjects with BPD had higher scores in neuroticism and openness, and lower scores in conscientiousness. However, significant differences were measured for response reliability and validity. In particular, the indices of <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> including response reliability were lower in subjects with BPD suggesting that bipolar subjects might have more difficulty in providing consistent answers throughout questionnaires. However, regression models resulted in small associations between mania/hypomania and <b>response</b> <b>quality,</b> and showed that differences in <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> were mainly attributable to correlates of BPD instead of the presence of mania/hypomania itself.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scheduling {{model for a}} class of interactive services in which requests are time bounded and lower result quality can be traded for shorter execution time. These applications include web search engines, finance servers, and other interactive, on-line services. We develop an efficient scheduling algorithm, Zeta, that allocates processor time among service requests to maximize the quality and minimize the variance of the response. Zeta exploits the concavity of the request quality profile to distribute processing time among outstanding requests. By executing some requests partially (and obtaining much or most benefit of a full execution), Zeta frees resources for other requests, which might have timed out and produced no results. Compared to scheduling algorithms that consider only deadline or quality profile information, Zeta improves overall <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> and reduces <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> variance, yielding significant improvement in the high-percentile <b>response</b> <b>quality.</b> We implemented and deployed Zeta in the Microsoft Bing web search engine and evaluated its performance in a production environment with realistic workloads. Measurements show {{that at the same}} <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> and latency as the production system, Zeta increases system capacity by 29 % by improving both average and high percentile <b>response</b> <b>quality.</b> We also implemented Zeta in a finance server that computes option prices. In this application, Zeta improves average <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> by 28 % and the 99 -percentile quality by 80 %. Using a simulation, we also compared Zeta to the offline optimal schedule and other scheduling algorithms. Although Zeta is only close to optimal, it provides better performance than prior algorithms under a wide variety of operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|Web surveys can be {{programmed}} to capture a variety of paradata regarding how respondents answer questions. These paradata provide great opportunities for researchers to assess <b>response</b> <b>quality,</b> specifically whether respondents engage in satisficing - not spending enough effort to provide accurate responses. In particular, speeding (i. e., giving answers very quickly) has increasingly been used as an indicator for satisficing and low <b>response</b> <b>quality.</b> However, {{few studies have examined}} whether speeding actually leads to compromised <b>response</b> <b>quality.</b> To address this gap in the literature, the current study investigates speeding behaviors among Web respondents from a probability-based panel. We first identify and characterize respondents who speed more frequently than others over the entire questionnaire. To explore the impact of speeding on <b>response</b> <b>quality,</b> we then examine whether respondents who speed more frequently also straightline in more grid questions. The results show that the tendency to speed is related to several respondent characteristics, particularly age (younger respondents are more likely to speed). This study also reveals that more speeding seems to be universally related to more straightlining, and this relationship is particularly strong among the less educated respondents.

In addition, it addresses the extent to which motivation may affect the <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> of resident foreigners. We analyzed data from two large-scale surveys conducted in Switzerland, a country with three national languages and a burgeoning foreign population, employing a set of dependent measures of <b>response</b> <b>quality,</b> including don't know responses, extreme responding, mid- 5 responding, recency effects, and straight-lining. Results show overall poorer <b>response</b> <b>quality</b> among foreigners, and indicate that both reduced language mastery and motivation among foreigners are relevant factors. This is especially true for foreign groups from countries that do not share a common language with those spoken in Switzerland. A general conclusion is that the more distant respondents are culturally and linguistically from the majority mainstream within a country, the more their data may be negatively affected.
