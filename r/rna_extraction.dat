25|$|All transcriptomic methods require RNA {{to first}} be {{isolated}} from the experimental organism before transcripts can be recorded. Although biological systems are incredibly diverse, <b>RNA</b> <b>extraction</b> techniques are broadly similar and involve: mechanical disruption of cells or tissues, disruption of RNase with chaotropic salts, disruption of macromolecules and nucleotide complexes, separation of RNA from undesired biomolecules including DNA, and concentration of the RNA via precipitation from solution or elution from a solid matrix.

Study design: 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1 - 3 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied.

Results: Of 50 NPA specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness, 11 (22 %) were positive in our first generation RT-PCR assay.

The integrity of RNA was evaluated with the intactness of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA by electrophoresis and by the length of individual gene transcripts using RT-PCR. The various fixatives were methacarn (a combination of methanol, chloroform, and acetic acid) and several concentrations of ethanol and isopropanol. Methacarn was the optimal fixative for RNA preservation in paraffin-embedded tissues, which included liver, lung, kidney, muscle, and limb. Based on RT-PCR analysis, methacarn fixed samples exhibited the expected RNA sizes for individual genes such as glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and bone-related genes (e. g., alkaline phosphatase and osteonectin). The laser microdissection technique with methacarn fixation was then applied to analyze the differential gene expression between hypertrophic and proliferative chondrocytes in the growth plate of long bone. The expression of type X collagen, a specific gene for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was only observed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, while type II collagen was observed more broadly in the growth plate as anticipated.
