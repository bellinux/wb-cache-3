40|$|Breakthroughs {{have been}} made in natural gas {{exploration}} in Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> in the Tongwan Palaeo-uplift, Sichuan Basin, recently. However, there are disputes with regard to the genetic mechanisms of natural gas <b>reservoirs.</b> The development law of asphalts in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> may play an extremely important role {{in the study of the}} relationships between palaeo oil and gas <b>reservoirs.</b> Accordingly, researches were conducted on the features and development patterns of asphalts in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> in this area. The following research results were obtained. (1) Asphalts in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> were developed after the important hydrothermal event in the Sichuan Basin, namely the well-known Emei Taphrogeny in the mid-late Permian Period. (2) Distribution of asphalts is related to palaeo oil <b>reservoirs</b> under the control of palaeo-structures of Indosinian-Yanshanian Period, when the palaeo-structures contained high content of asphalts in the high positions of the palaeo-uplift. (3) Large-scale oil and gas accumulations in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> occurred in the Indosinian-Yanshanian Period to generate the Leshan-Ziyang and Gaoshiti-Moxi-Guang'an palaeo oil <b>reservoirs.</b> Cracking of crude oil in the major parts of these palaeo oil <b>reservoirs</b> controlled the development of the present natural gas <b>reservoirs.</b> (4) The development of asphalts in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> indicates that hydrocarbons in the Dengying Formation originated from Cambrian source rocks and natural gas accumulated in the Sinian <b>reservoirs</b> are products of late-stage cracking of the Sinian <b>reservoirs.</b> (5) The Sinian palaeo-structures of Indosinian-Yanshanian Period in the Sichuan Basin are favorable regions for the development of the Sinian <b>reservoirs,</b> where discoveries and exploration practices will play an important role in the era of Sinian natural gas development in China...|$|R

30|$|Material balance {{analysis}} {{is considered a}} powerful engineering tool when dealing with oil and gas <b>reservoirs.</b> In gas <b>reservoirs</b> which can be represented by simple volumetric tanks, a straight line relationship between (P/Z) and cumulative gas production exists.

Therefore, several modifications have been presented to handle commingled gas <b>reservoirs</b> (Fetkovich et al. 1990; El-Banbi and Wattenbarger 1996, 1997; Juell and Whitson 2011) and compartmentalized gas <b>reservoirs</b> (Hower and Collins 1989; Lord and Collins 1989, 1992; Payne 1996; Hagoort and Hoogstra 1997; Sallam 2016).

On 19 October 1950, large formations of Chinese troops, dubbed the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), secretly crossed the border and into North Korea. One of the first Chinese units to reach the Chosin <b>Reservoir</b> area was the PVA 42nd Corps, and it was tasked with stopping the eastern UN advances. On 25 October, the advancing ROK I Corps made contact with the Chinese and halted at Funchilin Pass, south of the Chosin <b>Reservoir.</b> After the landing at Wonsan, the US 1st Marine Division of the X Corps engaged the defending PVA 124th Division on 2 November, and the ensuing battle caused heavy casualties among the Chinese.

30|$|Therefore, {{conventional}} tight <b>reservoirs</b> {{are characterized}} by: distribution in structurally high areas; partial enrichment in zones of relatively high porosity and permeability; no direct connection between sources and reservoirs; overlaying cap rocks that {{play a significant}} role in sealing processes; a uniform gas–water interface; higher inner pressure than hydrostatic pressure under a stable state; continuously high pressure; and relatively small distribution areas and reserve scales. By trap type, conventional tight <b>reservoirs</b> can be subdivided into anticlinal tight gas <b>reservoirs,</b> fault block tight gas <b>reservoirs,</b> lithological tight gas <b>reservoirs,</b> and stratigraphic tight gas <b>reservoirs</b> (Pang et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to continuous accumulations, quasi-continuous accumulations {{are controlled by}} some traps to a certain degree, but the traps are mainly non-anticlinal (especially stratigraphic) rather than anticlinal. Tight <b>reservoirs</b> are generally thin and small {{in terms of the}} scale of single <b>reservoirs,</b> and their rock properties vary greatly relative to conventional <b>reservoirs.</b> In such cases, most tight <b>reservoirs</b> can easily be charged sufficiently such that the hydrocarbon accumulations could surpass the boundary of an anticlinal trap, if any, because the base of anticlinal traps is open. On the other hand, stratigraphic traps are generally well developed and therefore are dominant for hydrocarbon accumulations in tight <b>reservoirs,</b> because tight <b>reservoirs</b> commonly have stronger heterogeneities and larger lateral variation of lithologies and rock properties compared to conventional <b>reservoirs.</b>|$|R
