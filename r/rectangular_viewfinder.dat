But each time a zoom-in operation takes place, the context from which it came is visually lost. Sequential applications of the zoomin and zoom-out operations may become tedious. This paper proposes an alternative technique, the macroscope, based on zooming and panning in multiple translucent layers. A macroscope display should comfortably permit browsing continuously on a single image, or set of images in multiple resolutions, {{on a scale of}} at least 1 to 10, 000. POWERS OF TEN THOUSAND The book and film Powers of Ten [4] try to instill an appreciation of the scale of the physical world by a succession of images each on a scale differing from the next by factors of ten, from atomic to galactic perspectives. Each image shows the scale of the next smaller image by a <b>rectangular</b> <b>viewfinder</b> placed at its center. The power of Powers of Ten is that it brings together in a single work phenomena that occur over a wide range of spatial scales, and forces us to think about the relationships between them. Can we use the computer's interactivity to provide a dynamic version that goes beyond the book's stati...|$|E
40|$|Framing and spacing are {{pictorial}} conventions {{that create}} intervals, often inadvertently forming {{part of the}} dialogue between the viewer {{and the work of}} art. This collaboration between five artists asks what happens when the cuts of image and spacing become the focus of attention, when compositional decisions expand into the space, activating responses to both imagery and context. Interval reflects on the momentary encounter, caught within or cut by the limit of <b>rectangular</b> support, <b>viewfinder,</b> picture space or film reel. The five artists will work collaboratively in the space, presenting works to be seen as components and supports for each other, negotiating how one work frames or cuts across another. As the collective installation for Interval takes shape, the set-up process will be documented as part of a live event and played back into the space. What constitutes the work, how to assess the arena of influence of one element to another will be approached as an open question, attention shifting between image, apparatus, space and medium. The edits, interruptions and inter-dependencies between frame and interval, between set-up and viewpoint become evident, offering a basis for discussion and comment between artists and audience...|$|R
