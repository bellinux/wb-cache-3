40|$|IntroductionAcute {{arterial}} thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction due to decreased {{nitric oxide}} bioactivity. Increased arginase activity may modulate intracellular L-arginine levels, the substrate for nitric oxide. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify the role of arginase in endothelial dysfunction in cell culture and in the vasomotor response of arteries exposed to thrombus. MethodsRat aortic endothelial cells were exposed to thrombin at different time points. The cell extract was analyzed by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adult male rats underwent infrarenal aortic thrombosis by clip ligature for 1 hour. Infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> were harvested and placed in physiologic buffer baths, and a force transducer was used to measure endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) and endothelial-independent relaxation (EIR). Arginase blockade was performed by incubating infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> with arginase inhibitors for 1 hour before measuring EDR. Whole tissue extracts also underwent immunoblot analysis. The EDR and EIR curves were compared with analyses of variance. ResultsA 6. 76 ± 1. 4 -fold induction in arginase I message levels (P =. 001) was found in rat aortic endothelial cells exposed to thrombin (30 U/mL), and arginase I protein levels increased 2. 1 times. The eight infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> exposed to thrombosis for 1 hour had diminished EDR curves compared with 14 nonthrombosed normal segments (controls). The maximum (± SEM) EDR (acetylcholine 10 − 5 M dose) in control infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> was 108 % ± 4. 3 % compared with 63 % ± 6. 2 % for thrombosed infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> (P <. 001). Exposure to arterial thrombosis resulted in a 3. 8 -times increase in arginase I protein levels in infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments.</b> Preincubation of nine infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> with the nonspecific (difluoromethylornithine) and six with specific ([S]-[2 -boronoethyl]-L-Cysteine-HCl [BEC]) arginase inhibitor for 1 hour significantly increased the maximum EDR compared with untreated thrombosed segments (104 ± 5. 2, 108 ± 7. 6 vs 63 % ± 6. 2, P <. 001). EDR curves for difluoromethylornithine- and BEC-treated infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> were superimposed on control EDR curves. The EIR and the vasoconstriction with norepinephrine for all groups were similar. ConclusionEndothelial cells exposed to thrombin have increased arginase I messenger RNA and protein levels. Arterial thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction without affecting smooth muscle responsiveness. Arginase blockade can lead to normalization of arterial vasomotor function. Clinical relevanceAcute arterial thrombosis may lead to endothelial dysfunction, manifested clinically by vasospasm and rethrombosis after initially successful thrombectomy or thrombolysis. We have identified that the key enzyme, arginase, which modulates levels of the nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, is increased in arterial thrombosis. Thrombin, a component of thrombus, increases arginase levels, which may lead to decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. These studies indicate that arginase blockade restores endothelial function in arteries exposed to thrombosis. This work may lead to therapeutic alternatives including L-arginine supplementation or arginase blockade for patients with acute ischemia...|$|R
