5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the <b>root</b> <b>tip.</b> By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{basidiomycete}} {{that forms}} symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections {{have been made}} under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only {{within the range of}} Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, {{it is one of the}} few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather. It has also been identified in the southeastern Sierra Nevada and on Santa Cruz Island.|$|E

40|$|Seedlings {{of alcohol}} {{dehydrogenase}} 1 null mutants (Adh 1 -) of Zea mays L., which fail to synthesize alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH 1) isozymes, were hypoxically acclimated by 18 h {{of exposure to}} an atmosphere of 4 % (v/v) O 2 in N 2 at 25 [deg]C. Their ability to tolerate subsequent anoxia by exposure to anaerobic (O 2 -free) conditions was {{compared with that of}} unacclimated seedlings that were transferred immediately from an atmosphere of 40 % (v/v) O 2 to anaerobic conditions. Only 10 % of the <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> of unacclimated seminal roots survived 6 h of anoxia, whereas 70 % of the hypoxically acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> were viable at 24 h. During anoxia, acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> had enhanced ADH activity compared with unacclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips,</b> through induction of Adh 2. Despite this, enzyme activity was still only about 5 % that of acclimated, wild-type <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> and about half that of unacclimated, wild-type <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> During anoxia, acclimated Adh 1 - <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> showed a higher rate of anaerobic respiration and ethanol production, greater concentrations of ATP and total adenylates, and a greater adenylate energy charge compared with unacclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> These results suggest that although enhanced ADH activity may have raised fermentation rates in acclimated Adh 1 - tissues and thereby contributed to energy metabolism and viability, the high levels of ADH activity inducible in acclimated, wild-type maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> appear to be in excess of that required to increase rates of fermentation...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} (J. -H. Xia and P. H. Saglio [1992] Plant Physiol 100 : 40 - 46) that the enhanced ability of maize (Zea mays) <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> to survive anoxia, elicited by a 4 -h exposure to 3 % O 2 ("acclimation"), {{is due to}} less cytoplasmic acidosis early in anoxia. Cytoplasmic pH and fermentation reactions were monitored in excised and intact (attached) maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> by simultaneous in vivo 13 C- and 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that both excised and intact acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> have significantly higher cytoplasmic pH values under anoxia. This reduction in cytoplasmic acidosis is greater in intact <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> Remarkably, cytoplasmic pH does not change when <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> are transferred from 3 % O 2 to anoxia. The earlier observation of considerable lactate efflux and lowered intracellular lactate in excised, acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> (ibid.) was extended to intact seedlings. The predominant fermentation end product retained in the cells of acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> is alanine.

25|$|As {{suggested}} by the name, much of the biomass of the mycosymbiont lies exterior to the plant root. The fungal structure is composed primarily of three parts: 1) the intraradical hyphae making up the Hartig net, 2) the mantle that forms a sheath surrounding the <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> and 3) the extraradical hyphae and related structures that spread throughout the soil matrix.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> interface, {{researchers}} have observed a homologue for a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd) gene that is consistently upregulated {{compared to the}} extraradical mycelium. This could allow for new membranes to form at the symbiotic interface, which, in turn, could help explain the development of various permeases that occur in these locations. These new membranes could be largely responsible for nutrient transport from the fungal mycelium to the plant host.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts are {{a special}} {{type of a}} plant cell {{organelle}} called a plastid, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are many other types of plastids, which carry out various functions. All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote, or fertilized egg. Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's apical meristems. Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> meristemsâ€”instead, the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common.|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that ATP levels and energy charge determine the resistance of maize (Zea mays) <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> to anoxia. We focused on <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> of whole maize seedlings that had been acclimated to low O 2 by exposure to an atmosphere of 3 % (v/v) O 2 in N 2. Acclimated anoxic <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> characteristically have higher ATP levels and energy charge and survive longer under anoxia than nonacclimated tips. We poisoned intact, acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> with either fluoride or mannose, causing decreases in ATP and energy charge to values similar to or, in most cases, below those found in nonacclimated anoxic tips. With {{the exception of the}} highest fluoride concentration used, the poisoned, acclimated tips remained much more tolerant of anoxia than nonacclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> We conclude that high ATP and energy charge are not components critical for the survival of acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> during anoxia. The reduced nucleotide status in poisoned, acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> had little effect on cytoplasmic pH regulation during anoxia. This result indicates that in anoxic, acclimated <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> either cytoplasmic pH regulation is not dominated by ATP-dependent processes or these processes can continue in vivo largely independently of any changes in ATP levels in the physiological range. The role of glycolytic flux in survival under anoxia is discussed...|$|R

40|$|We present {{two pieces}} of {{evidence}} that regulation of cytoplasmic pH near neutrality {{is a prerequisite for}} survival of <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> during hypoxia. First, blackeye peas and navy beans show earlier cytoplasmic acidosis under hypoxia than soybeans or pumpkin or maize, and die earlier. Second, when cytoplasmic acidosis in maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> is greatly retarded by treatment with 25 millimolar Ca(NO 3) 2, they remain viable under hypoxia for a much longer period of time than untreated hypoxic <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> We also show that viability of maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> is unaffected by the supply of exogenous sugar (and so on the rate of ethanolic fermentation) for at least 16 hours of hypoxia...|$|R
25|$|Early root {{growth is}} one of the {{functions}} of the apical meristem located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less continuously divide, producing more meristem, root cap cells (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> forward in the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into specialized cells of the root tissues.|$|E
500|$|A genet is a {{group of}} genetically {{identical}} individuals that have grown in a given location, all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility (a method fungi use to distinguish self from non-self by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species) or various molecular techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S.pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying {{only a small fraction of}} the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina. Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S.pungens genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an S.pungens genet with an area of approximately [...] and a span greater than [...] across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large S.pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the metabolism and survival of hypoxic maize (Zea mays L.) <b>root</b> <b>tips.</b> The dependence of the rate of ethanolic fermentation, cytoplasmic pH, and viability on the activity of ADH in maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> during extreme hypoxia was determined. Maize lines with ADH activities differing over about a 200 -fold range were studied. Effects of genetic background were controlled by comparing pairs of F 4 progeny of crosses between mutant (low ADH activity) and reference inbred lines. The capacity of hypoxic <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> to perform ethanolic fermentation exhibited a dependence on ADH activity only at activities found in Adh 1 nulls. The ability of maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> to withstand prolonged and extreme hypoxia was like-wise independent of ADH activity, except at the lowest activities. <b>Root</b> <b>tips</b> that exhibited lower tolerance of hypoxia had more acidic cytoplasm during extreme hypoxia. We conclude that the activity of ADH in normal maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> does not limit the capacity for energy production via fermentation, and does not determine viability under extreme hypoxia. The significance of the induction of ADH activity in plants by hypoxia is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that cytoplasmic acidosis {{is a cause}} of meristematic death in hypoxic <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> of maize and pea seedlings. Usually, leakage of acid from the vacuole is responsible for cytoplasmic acidosis. Leakage of acid, which occurs earlier during hypoxia in pea <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> than in maize <b>root</b> <b>tips,</b> appears {{to account for the}} lower tolerance of peas for hypoxia. Cytoplasmic acidosis is accelerated in maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> that are either (i) deficient in alcohol dehydrogenase, so that lactic acid production continues throughout hypoxia, or (ii) exposed to external CO 2 during hypoxia, or (iii) perfused slowly so that escape of CO 2 produced during ethanolic fermentation is retarded. All three conditions decrease the length of time maize <b>root</b> <b>tips</b> can tolerate hypoxia; more rapid cytoplasmic acidosis is associated with more rapid death under hypoxia. Possible mechanisms by which cytoplasmic acidosis leads to death are suggested; the mechanism does not involve inhibition of glycolysis by low pH...|$|R

2500|$|Roots, in particular, display {{observable}} swarm behavior, {{growing in}} patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and {{indicate the presence}} of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, {{and it is this}} purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes. The transition zone of a <b>root</b> <b>tip</b> is largely responsible for monitoring for the presence of soil-borne hormones, signaling responsive growth patterns as appropriate. Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex. These forces act to inform any number of growing [...] "main" [...] roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to stolon growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.|$|E
