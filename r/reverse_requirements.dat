40|$|Recovering {{users and}} systems {{requirements}} from existing information {{systems can be}} valuable in legacy systems reengineering. AMBOLS, a semiotic approach to requirements reengineering, considers recovering the requirements of an existing (legacy) system under the restriction that only the operational system and its current stakeholders are accessible, while the original system documentation may be inaccurate or unavailable. The AMBOLS approach is adopted which consists of investigative activities at three major stages {{with a set of}} techniques for analysis and representation. The techniques consider a legacy system from the perspectives of different stakeholders, from its interaction with the users in the business context, and from information content and processes of system operations. The results of analysis from these perspectives are synthesised for derivation of the requirements. A case study of a university library system is used to provide examples. Conclusions are drawn on the need and effectiveness of such an approach to <b>reverse</b> <b>requirements</b> engineering, and further work is suggested...|$|E
30|$|Kano model, {{developed}} by Professor Noriaki Kano, identifies and categorizes customer requirements or attributes as must-be, one-dimensional, attractive, indifferent and <b>reverse</b> <b>requirements</b> (or features). An {{understanding of these}} product quality attributes is beneficial to {{improving the quality of}} products and in the developments of products (Zhu et al. 2010). For example, Lee et al. (2015) discovered that Web portal preferences were driven by attractive, must-be, and one-dimensional qualities and Hussain et al. (2015) found that the requirements for an e-Ebola awareness Web portal are of attractive and one-dimensional types. This knowledge serves as a precursor to the design and development of quality products (Hussain et al. 2015). Requirements engineers need feedback from users on planned system features (Proynova and Paech 2013). These feedbacks are captured in a Kano survey (Hussain et al. 2015). The feedbacks are obtained before users have experience with the software product (Proynova and Paech 2013). Many researchers have applied Kano model to identify customer needs and how product attributes or features affects customer satisfaction (Gupta and Srivastava 2011). Kano model helps in identifying and distinguishing product requirements or features that have great influence on the satisfaction of customers. Classifying product requirements into must-be, attractive, one-dimensional, indifferent and reverse can be employed to focus on priorities for product development; for instance, it is not very useful to invest in improving must-be requirements that are already at the level of satisfaction, however, it is better to improve attractive and/or one-dimensional requirements, since they have a greater influence or impact on the perceived product quality and resultantly on the customers’ satisfaction level (Gupta and Srivastava 2011). However, Kano model’s classification of requirements is qualitative in nature and has little or no use in quantitative evaluation (Hussain et al. 2015).|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 35 - 39). A magnetorheological (MR) damper exhibits a variable damping coefficient depending on the strength of an accompanying magnetic field. A high magnetic field creates a nearly unyielding damper filled with a semi-solid fluid while no magnetic field produces an ordinary viscous damper. Presently, these dampers are being used {{in a variety of ways}} by supplying power to an electromagnet that causes stiffening of the damper. <b>Reversing</b> these power <b>requirements</b> allows development of new and innovative applications for MR dampers. For example, ephemeral deformation of critical truss members may be controlled through a reverse MR damper. The goal is to provide protection to truss structures during severe loading events. Implementation of a reverse damper for an application such as this presents two major tasks: (1) development of a control algorithm and (2) design of an MR damper with <b>reverse</b> power <b>requirements.</b> A control algorithm for dynamic response that uses fuzzy logic and neural networks is presented. A potential design for a reverse MR damper utilizing a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets is also presented.

40|$|Biological {{control systems}} {{regulate}} {{the behavior of}} biological systems in a constantly changing environment. Homeostasis is the most widely studied outcome of biological control systems. Homeostatic systems maintain the system in its desired state despite variations in system parameters or the externally-determined input rates of their constituents, i. e. they have zero or near zero steady state error. On the other hand, allostatic systems are not resistant against environmental changes and the steady state level of their controlled variables responds positively to the changes in their input rates. Little is known, however, on the existence and frequency of reverse allostatic systems, where the steady state value of the controlled variable correlates negatively with the input rate of that variable. In the present study, we derive the minimal conditions for the existence and local stability of reverse allostatic systems, and demonstrate in examples of metabolic, pharmacological, pathophysiological and ecological systems that the <b>reverse</b> allostasis <b>requirements</b> are relatively non-stringent and may be satisfied in biological systems more commonly than usually thought.

The implication of these requirements with regard to allowable metallic contamination levels is investigated with a one-dimensional model based on Shockley-Read-Hall generation-recombination. The model was developed to predict leakage-current in carrier-depleted regions {{as a function of}} basic process and metallic contaminant parameters. As device dimensions are reduced, transition metal homogeneous contamination in process chemicals can be an important source of generation-recombination centers that result in the dominant generation-current in the space-charge region. The model allows an estimation of an upper bound for transition metal contamination in advanced processes and is applied for DRAM leakage predictions. Using the model, it is demonstrated that the trend toward lower leakage-current density <b>requirements</b> <b>reverses</b> after the 64 -Mbit generation DRAM as a result of memory-cell architecture trends which significantly reduce the space-charge volume...|$|R
40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Refinery Yield Model {{has been}} used to study the {{refining}} cost, investment, and operating impacts of specifications for reformulated diesel fuel (RFD) produced in refineries of the U. S. Midwest in summer of year 2010. The study evaluates different diesel fuel reformulation investment pathways. The study also determines whether there are refinery economic benefits for producing an emissions reduction RFD (with flexibility for individual property values) compared to a vehicle performance RFD (with inflexible recipe values for individual properties). Results show that refining costs are lower with early notice of requirements for RFD. While advanced desulfurization technologies (with low hydrogen consumption and little effect on cetane quality and aromatics content) reduce the cost of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, these technologies contribute to the increased costs of a delayed notice investment pathway compared to an early notice investment pathway for diesel fuel reformulation. With challenging RFD specifications, there is little refining benefit from producing emissions reduction RFD compared to vehicle performance RFD. As specifications become tighter, processing becomes more difficult, blendstock choices become more limited, and refinery benefits vanish for emissions reduction relative to vehicle performance specifications. Conversely, the emissions reduction specifications show increasing refinery benefits over vehicle performance specifications as specifications are relaxed, and alternative processing routes and blendstocks become available. In sensitivity cases, the refinery model is also used to examine the impact of RFD specifications on the economics of using Canadian synthetic crude oil. There is a sizeable increase in synthetic crude demand as ultra low sulfur diesel fuel displaces low sulfur diesel fuel, but this demand increase would be <b>reversed</b> by <b>requirements</b> for diesel fuel reformulation...|$|R
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might <b>reverse</b> this energy <b>requirement</b> and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|R

40|$|Photoperiodic {{flowering}} {{has been}} extensively studied in the annual short-day and long-day plants rice and Arabidopsis while less {{is known about the}} control of flowering in perennials. In the perennial wild strawberry, Fragaria vesca L. (Rosaceae), short-day and perpetual flowering long-day accessions occur. Genetic analyses showed that differences in their flowering responses are caused by a single gene, the SEASONAL FLOWERING LOCUS which may encode the F. vesca homolog of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (FvTFL 1). We show through high-resolution mapping and transgenic approaches that FvTFL 1 is the basis of this change in flowering behavior and demonstrate that FvTFL 1 acts as a photoperiodically regulated repressor. In short-day F. vesca, long photoperiods activate FvTFL 1 mRNA expression and short days suppress it, promoting flower induction. These seasonal cycles in FvTFL 1 mRNA level confer seasonal cycling of vegetative and reproductive development. Mutations in FvTFL 1 prevent LD suppression of flowering, and the early flowering that then occurs under LD is dependent on the F. vesca homolog of FLOWERING LOCUS T. This photoperiodic response mechanism differs from those described in model annual plants. We suggest that this mechanism controls flowering within the perennial growth cycle in F. vesca, and demonstrate that a change in a single gene <b>reverses</b> the photoperiodic <b>requirements</b> for flowering...|$|R
40|$|Two new {{mutations}} {{are described}} which, together, eliminate essentially all the aminotransferase activity required for de novo biosynthesis of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and aspartic acid in a K- 12 strain of Escherichia coli. One mutation, designated tyrB, lies at about 80 min on the E. coli map and inactivates the "tyrosine-repressible" tyrosine/phenylalanine aminotransferase. The second mutation, aspC, maps at about 20 min and inactivates a nonrespressible aspartate aminotransferase that also has {{activity on the}} aromatic amino acids. In ilvE- strains, which lack the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, the presence of either the tyrosine-repressible aminotransferase or the aspartate aminotransferase is sufficient for growth {{in the absence of}} exogenous tyrosine, phenylalanine, or aspartate; the tyrosine-repressible enzyme is also active in leucine biosynthesis. The ilvE gene product alone can <b>reverse</b> a phenylalanine <b>requirement.</b> Biochemical studies on extracts of strains carrying combinations of these aminotransferase mutations confirm the existence of two distinct enzymes with overlapping specificities for the alpha-keto acid analogues of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and aspartate. These enzymes can be distinguished by electrophoretic mobilities, by kinetic parameters using various substrates, and by a difference in tyrosine repressibility.

40|$|Requirements tracing {{is crucial}} for {{software}} engineering practices including change analysis, regression testing, and <b>reverse</b> engineering. The <b>requirements</b> tracing process produces a requirements traceability matrix(TM) which links high- and low-level document elements. Manually generating a TM is laborious, time consuming, and error-prone. Due to these challenges TMs are often neglected. Automated information retrieval(IR) techniques are used with some efficiency. However, in mission- or safety-critical systems a human analyst is required to vet the candidate TM. This introduces semi-automated requirements tracing, where IR methods present a candidate TM and a human analyst validates it, producing a final TM. In semi-automated tracing the focus becomes {{the quality of the}} final TM. This thesis expands upon the research of Cuddeback et al. by examining how human analysts interact with candidate TMs. We conduct two experiments, one using an automated tracing tool and the other using manual validation. We conduct formal statistical analysis to determine the key factors impacting the analyst’s tracing performance. Additionally, we conduct a pilot study investigating how analysts interact with TMs generated by automated IR methods. Our research statistically confirms the finding of Cuddeback et al. that the strongest impact on analyst performance is the initial TM quality. Finally we show evidence that applying local filters to IR results produce the best candidate TMs...|$|R

The amino acid sequences of the human and S. pombe proteins deduced from cloned cDNAs were compared {{to those of the}} known S. cerevisiae protein. All are predicted to encode C-terminal membrane-spanning proteins of approximately 50 kDa with similar hydropathy profiles. Extensive sequence conservation exists in regions of the enzyme proposed to interact with its prenyl substrates (i. e., two farnesyl diphosphate molecules). Many of the highly conserved regions are also present in phytoene and prephytoene diphosphate synthetases, enzymes which catalyze prenyl substrate condensation reactions analogous to that of squalene synthetase.

Reverse genetics systems for these orbiviruses with their ten-segmented genome of double stranded RNA have been developed. Initially, two subsequent transfections of in vitro synthesized capped run-off RNA transcripts resulted in the recovery of BTV. Reverse genetics has been improved by transfection of expression plasmids followed by transfection of ten RNA transcripts. Recovery of AHSV was further improved by use of expression plasmids containing optimized open reading frames. Results: Plasmids containing full length cDNA of the 10 genome segments for T 7 promoter-driven production of full length run-off RNA transcripts and expression plasmids with optimized open reading frames (ORFs) were used. BTV and AHSV were rescued using <b>reverse</b> genetics. The <b>requirement</b> of each expression plasmid and capping of RNA transcripts for reverse genetics were studied and compared for BTV and AHSV. BTV was recovered by transfection of VP 1 and NS 2 expression plasmids followed by transfection {{of a set of}} ten capped RNAs. VP 3 expression plasmid was also required if uncapped RNAs were transfected. Recovery of AHSV required transfection of VP 1, VP 3 and NS 2 expression plasmids followed by transfection of capped RNA transcripts. Plasmid-driven expression of VP 4, 6 and 7 was also needed when uncapped RNA transcripts were used. Irrespective of capping of RNA transcripts, NS 1 expression plasmid was not needed for recovery, although NS 1 protein is essential for virus propagation. Improvement of reverse genetics for AHSV was clearly demonstrated by rescue of several mutants and reassortants that were not rescued with previous methods. Conclusions: A limited number of expression plasmids is required for rescue of BTV or AHSV using reverse genetics, making the system much more versatile and generally applicable. Optimization of reverse genetics enlarge the possibilities to rescue virus mutants and reassortants, and will greatly benefit the control of these important diseases of livestock and companion animals. </p...|$|R

This can be achieved through cost savings by developing Route-to-Consumer strategies with a Cost-to-Serve analysis study; altering the secondary distribution system by applying the correct customer channel/segment service packages. The topic entails producing a conceptual model to service IMPERIAL Distribution’s (ID) client’s customers in order to achieve cuts in redundant logistic expenditures whilst improving service levels. Initiating, then working on, and for ID to possibly implement preliminary stages of this conceptual model will happen within the final year project timeframe. Considerations include customer service <b>requirements,</b> <b>reverse</b> logistics, product characteristics, vehicle configuration and region disposition. The project outcomes should be aligned with sales and commercial models and therefore not seen in isolation, but as a holistic supply chain solution. The venture will seek to perfectly balance logistic operating constraints and customer service levels. In essence the intended project solution will be done within the Industrial Engineering Departments’ capacity and the possible structure implementation through ID. The project will mainly focus on outbound logistics, including activities and cost associated with primary and secondary distribution. The best initial approach to take when looking at Route-to-Consumer initiatives is to explore the logistic base costs found in an organisations’ income statements and balance sheets discussed under the Cost-to-Serve section. It is required to observe the cost allocations of secondary distribution (various customer channels) to critically analyse where possible areas for improvements might be. Customizing Route-to-Consumer Strategies to Cost Effectively Improve Service Levels to Various Customer Channels Until recently the pressure on management existed to concentrate on total cost reductions without thinking it might influence areas that does not need savings; Cost-to-Serve (CTS) modelling identifies the improvement opportunities related to logistic service costs. A Cost-to-Serve (CTS) modelling analysis regarding Route-to-Consumer (RTC) strategies will form the base to determine the business case for potential change. Taking the current operations of the client into account; the Route-to-Consumer strategy will be formulated based on the agreed service requirements by each of these channels. The Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry partner being studied deals with both national manufacturing and international imports of product. IMPERIAL Distribution has the responsibility of providing logistic services on behalf of the client and further implementing improvement Route-to-Consumer strategies. The question is what kind of service package along with the type of distribution system should be dedicated to a specific customer channel and region in order for the client and the Logistic Service Provider (LSP) to be more profitable or gain equal benefit? Cost-to-Serve modelling indicates which customers are beneath a profitable margin and should be altered in order to elevate said customer to a more favourable position. Thesis (B Eng.
