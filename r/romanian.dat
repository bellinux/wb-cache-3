5|$|The {{offensive}} against the Third <b>Romanian</b> Army began at 08:50, {{led by the}} 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the 5th Tank Army. The first two assaults were repulsed by the <b>Romanian</b> defenders, {{and the effects of}} the heavy artillery bombardment had actually made it more difficult for Soviet armor to navigate through the minefields and terrain. However, the lack of heavy anti-tank artillery caused the <b>Romanian</b> defense to collapse; a breakthrough by the 4th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps was established by noon. Soon after, the 5th Tank Army was able to gain a breakthrough against the Second <b>Romanian</b> Corps, followed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet armor navigated through the thick fog by compass, overrunning <b>Romanian</b> and German artillery positions, three <b>Romanian</b> infantry divisions began to fall back in disarray; the Third <b>Romanian</b> Army had been outflanked to the West and East. After receiving the news of the Soviet attack, Sixth Army headquarters failed to order the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions, hitherto engaged in Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to bolster the <b>Romanian</b> defenses; instead the task was given to the seriously understrength and poorly equipped 48th Panzer Corps.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} <b>Romanian</b> units left the UNR {{and headed for}} Kishinev, where a Romanian-friendly Moldavian Democratic Republic was vying for power with the local Bolsheviks. Their action was likely coordinated with the <b>Romanian</b> High Command, {{which at the time}} had began an attack against the western Bessarabian town of Ungheni. The volunteers had dressed as Russian {{soldiers}} during their passage to Iași, but were recognized as <b>Romanian</b> units by the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops garrisoned in Kishinev City Station, where their train stopped on January 6. A skirmish followed, with the Moldavians and Bolsheviks either disarming, or killing or kidnapping Corps soldiers. The survivors were held captive in the same place as Moldavian Army founder Gherman Pântea, and were released later that day, allegedly by Republican troops. Years later, suspicion arose that Pântea had in fact helped the Bolsheviks, as an alleged enemy of <b>Romanian</b> interests in Bessarabia.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some <b>Romanian</b> volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of <b>Romanian</b> prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the <b>Romanian</b> consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the <b>Romanian</b> Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{conquest of}} Dacia {{stands at the}} base of the origin of <b>Romanians.</b> Several {{competing}} theories have been introduced to explain the origin of modern <b>Romanians.</b> Linguistic and geo-historical analyses tend to indicate that <b>Romanians</b> have coalesced as a major ethnic group both South and North of the Danube. For further discussion, see Origin of <b>Romanians</b> and Vlachs.|$|R

5|$|After World War I, Transylvania proclaimed {{union with}} the Kingdom of Romania. As a result, in April 1919, the newly {{established}} Hungarian Soviet Republic vowed to retake the region by force, and Hungarian troops attacked <b>Romanian</b> formations in Transylvania. The <b>Romanian</b> Army defeated the Hungarians and conquered Budapest in August 1919.|$|E
5|$|Ajtony's {{ethnicity}} is debated. Historian Paul Stephenson {{described him}} as a Magyar chieftain; according to historian László Makkai, he was of Kabar origin and his Turkic name may imply {{that he was a}} Pecheneg. In <b>Romanian</b> historiography, Ajtony has been considered the last member of a <b>Romanian</b> dynasty descended from Glad; historian Alexandru Madgearu wrote that the Latin name of Ajtony's seat (urbs Morisena) preserved a <b>Romanian</b> form.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale created Mitică at a {{time when}} the <b>Romanian</b> culture as {{developed}} in the Old Kingdom was the recipient of French influence, and the <b>Romanian</b> language was open to Francization. The character himself partakes in the process, and is shown to have adopted several of the manners and pastimes associated with the French Third Republic.|$|E
50|$|In December 2013, Cristian David, the {{government}} minister for the Department of <b>Romanians</b> Everywhere, declared {{that a new}} reality illustrates that between 6-8 million <b>Romanians</b> live outside Romania's borders. This includes 2-3 million indigenous <b>Romanians</b> living in neighbouring states such as Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, the Balkans and especially the Republic of Moldova. The number also includes circa 2.7-3.5 million <b>Romanians</b> in Western Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{major change}} {{occurred}} {{about the relationship}} of the <b>Romanians</b> with the West. Before the war, the national mythology considered <b>Romanians</b> [...] "An island of Latinity in a Slavic sea". Roller's history emphasized the cohabitation of <b>Romanians</b> and Slavs in the Middle Ages and discussed the connections between the Slavs and <b>Romanians,</b> ending with the [...] "liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet army".|$|R

5|$|Heliade Rădulescu is {{considered}} one of the foremost champions of <b>Romanian</b> culture from the first half of the 19th century, having first risen to prominence through his association with Gheorghe Lazăr and his support of Lazăr's drive for discontinuing education in Greek. Over the following decades, he had a major role in shaping the modern <b>Romanian</b> language, but caused controversy when he advocated the massive introduction of Italian neologisms into the <b>Romanian</b> lexis. A Romantic nationalist landowner siding with moderate liberals, Heliade was among the leaders of the 1848 Wallachian revolution, after which he was forced to spend several years in exile. Adopting an original form of conservatism, which emphasized the role of the aristocratic boyars in <b>Romanian</b> history, he was rewarded for supporting the Ottoman Empire and clashed with the radical wing of the 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on <b>Romanian</b> grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor of introducing Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to <b>Romanian</b> spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the varieties of <b>Romanian</b> and create a standard <b>Romanian</b> lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was to be employed in creating the <b>Romanian</b> Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in Muntenia, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve as the standard language.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} on the year of Ajtony's defeat; it may have occurred in 1002, 1008 or between 1027 and 1030. His ethnicity is also a subject of historical debate; {{he may have been}} Hungarian, Kabar, Pecheneg or <b>Romanian.</b> In <b>Romanian</b> historiography Ajtony is viewed as the last member of a <b>Romanian</b> ruling family founded by Glad, lord of Banat around 900 according to the Gesta Hungarorum.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} of Romania {{led to a}} complete reorganisation of the <b>Romanian</b> Land Forces {{under the supervision of}} the Red Army. At the onset, pro-German elements were purged from the <b>Romanian</b> armed forces. In 1944–45, two divisions were formed out of <b>Romanian</b> volunteers—ex-prisoners of war, trained and indoctrinated in the Soviet Union during the war, but also of many Communist activists. One was the Tudor Vladimirescu First Volunteer Division, under the command of Colonel Nicolae Cambrea, and the other the Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, under the command of General Mihail Lascăr (who later served as Minister of Defence from 1946 to 1947). These two units formed the nucleus of the new <b>Romanian</b> Land Forces under Soviet control. The postwar reorganisation of the Land Forces included cavalry but the arm disappeared from the force with the disbandment in November 1954 of the 59th Cavalry Division at Oradea.|$|E
5|$|The current <b>Romanian</b> Land Forces {{were formed}} in 1859, {{immediately}} after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Domnitor of Romania until his abdication in 1866.
