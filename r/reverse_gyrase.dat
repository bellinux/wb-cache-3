The mechanistic {{basis of}} dione activity vis-à-vis quinolones is not understood. We present evidence for Streptococcus pneumoniae gyrase and topo IV that PD 0305970 and quinolones interact differently with the enzyme breakage-reunion and Toprim domains, DNA, and Mg 2 +-four components that are juxtaposed in the topoisomerase cleavage complex to effect DNA scission. First, PD 0305970 targets primarily gyrase in Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, unlike quinolones, which select predominantly for gyrA (or topo IV parC) mutations in the breakage-reunion domain, unusually the dione selected for novel mutants with alterations that map to {{a region of}} the Toprim domain of GyrB (R 456 H and E 474 A or E 474 D) or ParE (D 435 H and E 475 A). This “dione resistance-determining region” overlaps the GyrB quinolone resistance-determining region and the region that binds essential Mg 2 + ions, each function involving conserved EGDSA and PLRGK motifs. Second, dione-resistant gyrase and topo IV were inhibited by ciprofloxacin, whereas quinolone-resistant enzymes (GyrA S 81 F and ParC S 79 F) remained susceptible to PD 0305970. Third, dione-promoted DNA cleavage by gyrase occurred at a distinct repertoire of sites, implying that structural differences with quinolones are sensed at the DNA level. Fourth, unlike the situation with quinolones, the Mg 2 + chelator EDTA did not <b>reverse</b> dione-induced <b>gyrase</b> cleavage nor did the dione promote Mg 2 +-dependent DNA unwinding. It appears that PD 0305970 interacts uniquely to stabilize the cleavage complex of gyrase/topo IV perhaps via an altered orientation directed by the bidentate 3 -amino- 2, 4 -dione moiety...|$|R

However, a majority of proteins involved in heme production were found to be intact in Thermoplasma volcanium. Similarly, most hyperthermophilic archaea utilize <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and topoisomerase VI for modifying the superhelicity of their DNA, but Thermoplasma volcanium's genome substitutes these with gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I for the same purposes.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase,</b> {{an enzyme}} of {{uncertain}} funtion, {{is present in}} all hyperthermophilic archaea and bacteria. Previous phylogenetic {{studies have suggested that}} the gene for <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> has an archaeal origin and was transferred laterally (LGT) to the ancestors of the two bacterial hyperthermophilic phyla, Thermotogales and Aquificales. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the evolutionary history of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> in light of genomic progress. We found genes coding for <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> in the genomes of several thermophilic bacteria that belong to phyla other than Aquificales and Thermotogales. Several of these bacteria are not, strictly speaking, hyperthermophiles because their reported optimal growth temperatures are below 80 °C. Furthermore, we detected a <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> gene in the sequence of the large plasmid of Thermus thermophilus strain HB 8, suggesting a possible mechanism of transfer to the T. thermophilus strain HB 8 involving plasmids and transposases. The archaeal part of the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> tree is congruent with recent phylogenies of the archaeal domain based on ribosomal proteins or RNA polymerase subunits. Although poorly resolved, the complete <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> phylogeny suggests an ancient acquisition of the gene by bacteria via one or two LGT events, followed by its secondary distribution by LGT within bacteria. Finally, several genes of archaeal origin located in proximity to the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> gene in bacterial genomes have bacterial homologues mostly in thermophiles or hyperthermophiles, raising the possibility that they were co-transferred with the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> gene. Our new analysis of the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> history strengthens the hypothesis that the acquisition of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> may have been a crucial evolutionary step in the adaptation of bacteria to high-temperature environments.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is {{a unique}} hyperthermophile-specific DNA topoisomerase that induces {{positive}} supercoiling. It is a modular enzyme composed of a topoisomerase IA and a helicase domain, which cooperate in the ATP-dependent positive supercoiling reaction. Although its physiological function has not been determined, it can be hypothesized that, like the topoisomerase–helicase complexes found in every organism, <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> might participate in different DNA transactions mediated by multiprotein complexes. Here, we show that <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> activity is stimulated by the single-strand binding protein (SSB) from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. Using a combination of in vitro assays we analysed {{each step of the}} complex <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> reaction. SSB stimulates all the steps of the reaction: binding to DNA, DNA cleavage, strand passage and ligation. By co-immunoprecipitation of cell extracts we show that <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and SSB assemble a complex in the presence of DNA, but do not make stable protein–protein interactions. In addition, SSB stimulates <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> positive supercoiling activity on DNA templates associated with the chromatin protein Sul 7 d. Furthermore, SSB enhances binding and cleavage of UV-irradiated substrates by <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase.</b> The results shown here suggest that these functional interactions may have biological relevance and that the interplay of different DNA binding proteins might modulate <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> activity in DNA metabolic pathways...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is {{a unique}} DNA topoisomerase endowed with ATP-dependent {{positive}} supercoiling activity.

We have identified the translesion DNA polymerase SsoPolY/Dpo 4 as one partner of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. We show here that in cell extracts, PolY and <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> co-immunoprecipitate {{with each other and with}} the single strand binding protein, SSB. The interaction is confirmed in vitro by far-western and Surface Plasmon Resonance. In functional assays, <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> inhibits PolY, but not the S. solfataricus B-family DNA polymerase PolB 1. Mutational analysis shows that inhibition of PolY activity depends on both ATPase and topoisomerase activities of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase,</b> suggesting that the intact positive supercoiling activity is required for PolY inhibition. In vivo, <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and PolY are degraded after induction of DNA damage. Inhibition by <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and degradation might act as a double mechanism to control PolY and prevent its potentially mutagenic activity when undesired.

40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is a {{peculiar}} DNA topoisomerase, specific of hyperthermophilic Archaea and Bacteria, {{which has the}} unique ability of introducing positive supercoiling into DNA molecules. Although {{the function of the}} enzyme has not been established directly, it has been suggested to be involved in DNA protection and repair. We show here that the enzyme is degraded after treatment of Sulfolobus solfataricus cells with the alkylating agent MMS. MMS-induced <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> degradation is highly specific, since (i) neither hydroxyurea (HU) nor puromycin have a similar effect, and (ii) topoisomerase VI and two chromatin components are not degraded. <b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> degradation does not depend on protein synthesis. Experiments in vitro show that direct exposure of cell extracts to MMS does not induce <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> degradation; instead, extracts from MMS-treated cells contain some factor(s) able to degrade the enzyme in extracts from control cells. In vitro, degradation is blocked by incubation with divalent metal chelators, suggesting that <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is selectively degraded by a metal-dependent protease in MMS-treated cells. In addition, we find a striking concurrence of extensive genomic DNA degradation and <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> loss in MMS-treated cells.

The P. furiosus <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is a monomeric protein, containing a helicase-like module and a type I topoisomerase module, which resembles the enzyme from S. acidocaldarius more than that from M. kandleri, a heterodimeric protein encoded by two separate genes. The control region of the P. furiosus rgy gene contains a typical archaeal putative box A promoter element which is located at position - 26 from the transcription start identified by primer extension experiments. The initiating ATG codon is preceded by a possible prokaryote-type ribosome-binding site.

40|$|Reverse gyrases are topoisomerases that {{catalyze}} ATP-dependent positive supercoiling of circular covalently closed DNA. They {{consist of}} an N-terminal helicase-like domain, fused to a C-terminal topoisomerase I-like domain.

To identify general and individual properties of reverse gyrases, {{we set out to}} characterize the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> from a hyperthermophilic eubacterium. Thermotoga maritima <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of ADP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP-analog ADPNP. Nucleotide binding is necessary, but not sufficient for the relaxation reaction. In the presence of ATP, positive supercoils are introduced at temperatures above 50 degrees C. However, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by DNA already at 37 degrees C, suggesting that <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is not frozen at this temperature, but capable of undergoing inter-domain communication. Positive supercoiling by <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is strictly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. At the physiological temperature of 75 degrees C, <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> binds and hydrolyzes ATPgammaS. Surprisingly, ATPgammaS hydrolysis is stimulated by DNA, and efficiently promotes positive DNA supercoiling, demonstrating that inter-domain communication during positive supercoiling is fully functional with both ATP and ATPgammaS. These findings support a model for communication between helicase-like and topoisomerase domains in <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase,</b> in which an ATP and DNA-induced closure of the cleft in the helicase-like domain initiates a cycle of conformational changes that leads to positive DNA supercoiling...|$|E

Here, the characterization of the isolated helicase-like domain from Thermotoga maritima <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is presented. We show that the helicase-like domain contains all determinants for nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis. Its intrinsic ATP hydrolysis is significantly stimulated by ssDNA, dsDNA and plasmid DNA. During the nucleotide cycle, the helicase-like domain switches between high- and low-affinity states for dsDNA, while its affinity for ssDNA in the ATP and ADP states is similar. In the context of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase,</b> the differences in DNA affinities of the nucleotide states are smaller, and the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity is strongly reduced.

40|$|The hyperthermophilic {{bacterium}} Thermotoga maritima MSB 8 {{possesses a}} <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> whose enzymatic properties {{are very similar}} to those of archaeal reverse gyrases. It catalyzes the positive supercoiling of the DNA in an Mg 2 +- and ATP-dependent process. Its optimal temperature of activity is around 90 °C, and it is highly thermostable. We have cloned and DNA sequenced the corresponding gene (T. maritima topR). This is the first report describing the analysis of a gene encoding a <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> in bacteria. The T. maritima topR gene codes for a protein of 1, 104 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 128, 259, a value in agreement with that estimated from the denaturing gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme. Like its archaeal homologs, the T. maritima <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> exhibits helicase and topoisomerase domains, and its sequence matches very well the consensus sequence for six reverse gyrases now available. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all reverse gyrases, including the T. maritima enzyme, form a very homogeneous group, distinct from the type I 5 ′ topoisomerases of the TopA subfamily, for which we have previously isolated a representative gene in T. maritima (topA). The coexistence of these two distinct genes, coding for a <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and an ω-like topoisomerase, respectively, together with the recent description of a gyrase in T. maritima (O. Guipaud, E. Marguet, K. M. Noll, C. Bouthier de la Tour, and P. Forterre, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 : 10606 – 10611, 1977) addresses the question of the control of the supercoiling in this organism...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> is {{a unique}} type IA topoisomerase that is able to {{introduce}} positive supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent process. ATP is bound to the helicase-like domain of the enzyme that contains most of the conserved motifs found in helicases of the SF 1 and SF 2 superfamilies. In this paper, we have investigated {{the role of the}} conserved helicase motifs I, II, V, VI, and Q by generating mutants of the Thermotoga maritima <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase.</b> We show that mutations in motifs I, II, V and VI completely eliminate the supercoiling activity of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> and that a mutation in the Q motif significantly reduces this activity. Further analysis revealed that for most mutants, the DNA binding and cleavage properties are not significantly changed compared to the wild type enzyme, whereas their ATPase activity is impaired. These results clearly show that the helicase motifs are tightly involved in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to the topoisomerase activity. The zinc finger motif located at the N-terminal end of reverse gyrases was also mutated. Our results indicate that this motif {{plays an important role in}} DNA binding...|$|E
40|$|We cloned and sequenced a DNA {{fragment}} {{from the}} thermophilic archaeal strain Sulfolobus shibatae B 12 {{that includes the}} gene topR encoding the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase.</b> The RNA of the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> gene was characterized indicating that the topR gene is fully functional in vivo. We showed by primer extension analysis that transcription of topR initiates 28 bp downstream from a consensus A-box promoter. In order to understand how this particular type I DNA topoisomerase introduces positive superturns into the DNA, we compared the amino acid sequence of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> from S. shibatae with the two other known reverse gyrases. This comparison indicates a common organization of these proteins: the carboxy-terminal domain {{is related to the}} type I- 5 ' topoisomerase family while the amino-terminal domain possesses some motifs of proteins described as RNA or DNA helicases. By using local alignments, we showed that (i) reverse gyrases constitute a new and rather homogenous group within the type I- 5 ' DNA topoisomerase family; (ii) a careful sequence analysis of the amino-terminal domain allows us to relate the presence of some motifs with an ATP binding and hydrolysis reaction coupled to a DNA binding and unwinding activity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> {{introduces}} positive supercoils to circular DNA and is {{implicated in}} genome stability maintenance in thermophiles. The extremely thermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus encodes two <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> proteins, TopR 1 (topoisomerase <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> 1) and TopR 2, whose functions in thermophilic life {{remain to be}} demonstrated. Here, we investigated the roles of TopR 1 in genome stability maintenance in S. islandicus {{in response to the}} treatment of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a DNA alkylation agent. Lethal MMS treatment induced two successive events: massive chromosomal DNA backbone breakage and subsequent DNA degradation. The former occurred immediately after drug treatment, leading to chromosomal DNA degradation that concurred with TopR 1 degradation, followed by chromatin protein degradation and DNA-less cell formation. To gain a further insight into TopR 1 function, the expression of the enzyme was reduced in S. islandicus cells using a CRISPR-mediated mRNA interference approach (CRISPRi) in which topR 1 mRNAs were targeted for degradation by endogenous III-B CRISPR-Cas systems. We found that the TopR 1 level was reduced in the S. islandicus CRISPRi cells and that the cells underwent accelerated genomic DNA degradation during MMS treatment, accompanied by a higher rate of cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that TopR 1 probably facilitates genome integrity maintenance by protecting DNA breaks from thermo-degradation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Reverse gyrases are {{the only}} topoisomerases capable of {{introducing}} positive supercoils into circular DNA. Their exclusive presence in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms indicates a DNA thermoprotective role in vivo. In spite of the efforts to improve our knowledge of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase,</b> modest {{progress has been made}} since its discovery. Currently, only one crystal structure of the enzyme is available, and the most widely accepted reaction mechanism is a hypothetical one, mostly derived from the functions of enzymes related to <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> domains. In the present work we address mechanistic aspects of the reaction by exploiting the capabilities {{of a wide range of}} techniques, to elucidate the role of one module of T. maritima <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase.</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> consists of an N-terminal helicase-like domain, fused to a C-terminal topoisomerase domain. We selected the helicase-like domain as a model of study due to its capacity to couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to DNA processing. Exploiting of these features by <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> turns this region into a key player at virtually every step of DNA supercoiling. Steady-state ATPase assays and equilibrium binding titrations with the helicase-like domain and the full-length enzyme, enabled us to prove for the first time a harnessing effect of the topoisomerase over the helicase-like domain. We showed that properties intrinsic to the helicase-like domain, like DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide-dependent affinity switch for DNA, and thermodynamic coupling between DNA binding and ATP binding and hydrolysis, are strongly reduced in the context of <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase.</b> At that time apparent contradictions arose, from reports stating that the isolated helicase-like domain is less active than within the context of the full-length enzyme. We reconciled these differences by demonstrating that the presence of the putative N-terminal Zn-finger in the helicase-like domain construct is the cause for the decreased activity. Furthermore, we have elucidated the thermodynamic and conformational cycle of the helicase-like domain, and predicted the stages fulfilling the requirements for interdomain communication, local duplex DNA unwinding, and the stages where DNA is in a suitable state to support the supercoiling reaction. Finally, besides the use of smFRET as a tool to investigate conformational changes in solution, we have also provided high-resolution snapshots of the helicase-like domain via X-ray crystallography. We have provided the most detailed structures of this region to this date, in the apo and ADP-bound forms. They also revealed high flexibility of the linker joining the RecA domains with relative orientations far from random, and local differences in secondary structure motifs that discard the assumption of all reverse gyrases having a “monolithic” build-up. We also created a deletion mutant of the latch, region with a sui generis location, perfectly suited for interdomain communication. Previous reports stated that its deletion from <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> abolishes positive supercoiling. We demonstrated its strong involvement in DNA binding, DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and thermodynamic coupling between these processes in the isolated helicase-like domain. We also revealed its role in presenting the ssDNA to the topoisomerase domain and in guiding the strand passage and resealing, ensuring the directionality leading to the introduction of positive supercoils. Additionally, we also elucidated the nucleotide cycle and conformational transitions for this helicase-like domain mutant, which gave the first indications of why no positive supercoiling can be performed by the full-length <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> lacking the latch, and only DNA relaxation is allowed. Finally, our pre steady-state kinetic studies allowed us to fully describe the unstimulated ATPase activity of the isolated helicase-like domain. We also demonstrated for the first time its DNA unwinding activity, shedding light on the rarely documented local B-DNA duplex destabilization of helicase-like modules, appended to bigger enzymes. Additionally, the sequence of ssDNA strand release, and identification of secondary structure motifs involved in ssDNA binding at different stages were determined. Together with the finding of new conformational states via smFRET, and “targeted” supercoiling assays with the full-length enzyme, we end up proposing a detailed catalytic mechanism, similar to the one derived from the <b>reverse</b> <b>gyrase</b> structure, only this time based on and supported by a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural data...|$|E
