5000|$|Persians faced {{battles in}} Bashli, Dubek, Tabasaran, Kaitag and Djengutai.

Nevertheless, Persians overcame the defences of highlanders. By August 1741 Surkhay-khan I <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> his fortress in Gazi-Kumukh but surrendered in a week.

5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move {{downwards}} faster than upwards.

5|$|Confusion among Jordanians was as {{important}} as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. Indeed, the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured.

5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the east, {{along their}} own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and {{in communication with}} him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E
5|$|Half of the regiment's {{strength}} {{was ordered to}} retreat from its position before the North Korean force was encountered, leaving the flank open for the remaining force, 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek. The battalion encountered North Korean forces the morning of July 6, and after a brief fight, was unable to repel them effectively. The battalion then mounted a disorganized <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Cheonan several miles away, having failed to significantly delay the North Korean forces in their movement south.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

5|$|In late July, Danzig was re-inforced by a Dutch garrison, and a {{combined}} Danish and Dutch fleet broke the naval blockage imposed on Danzig by Charles X Gustav.

5|$|Plutarch {{makes no}} further mention of events until the initial {{confrontation}} between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus {{in the spring}} of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could be inferred that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the Presidio La Bahía fortress, and <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders.

5|$|The {{northern}} attack force moved south towards Østerport {{where the}} fortification Kastellet laid.

Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the outskirts of the city, back to the starting position.|$|E

5000|$|One {{of the few}} rebel's successes was besieged [...] joining to the rebellion. From Drutsk Shemyatich's and Glinski's forces, as well as Shchenya's troops, <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> Orsha.

Both armies stood opposite each other from 13 to 22 July, but did not dare to start the battle. After removing the siege of Orsha Moscow troops moved to Mstsislaw, ravaged the neighborhood and then <b>retreated</b> <b>to</b> Vyazma.
