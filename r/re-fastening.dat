40|$|Fatigue {{strength}} of a pre-strained bolt steel, SCM 3, has been investigated {{in relation to the}} effects of the amount of pre-strain and the additional straining of the pre-strained specimen {{in the course of the}} fatigue process and the influence of the time when the secondary strain was applied. This simulated <b>re-fastening</b> the relaxed bolts commonly encountered in service. Furthermore, differing from the current investigations, where average diametral strain is used, actual surface strain which was obtained by FEM analysis was employed considering the fact that the fatigue damage is concentrated on the specimen surface...|$|E
40|$|It {{has often}} occured that bolts have broken at the <b>re-fastening</b> under employment. In this paper, the basic {{aspect of this}} {{phenomenon}} is studied by following experimental procedure using the notched specimen with circumferential half circular groove, and a criterion on the combined damage of fatigue pre-strain is proposed. The notch specimen is pulled to logarithmic plastic strain, εp= 1. 3 %, then is applied by direct stress σ= 11. 0 kg/mm 2 for several ratios of repetitions, n 1 /N 1, in which N 1 is fatigue 1 ife and n 1 is number of repetitions at σ= 11. 0 kg/mm 2. After this procedure, this specimen is pulled again to εp= 1. 3 % and is applied by σ= 11. 0 kg/mm 2. In {{the case of the}} second experiment, stress level is different the first stage from the second stage of above mentioned procedure, that is, the first applied stress is σ 1 = 9. 5 kg/mm 2 and the second is σ 2 = 11. 0 kg/mm 2. According to the results of these experiments, {{in the case of the}} small ratio of repetitions the specimen is strengthened, but in other cases are weakened, compared with the fatigue life of the pre-strained materials of εp= 2. 6 %, which is the same total plastic strain of the specimen, 1. 3 % plus 1. 3 %. This phenomenon is complicated by multiple plastic strains and stress repetitions and by characteristics of materials on work hardening and fatigue. Therefore, the author wil 1 propose that we use the two S-N curves, εp= 1. 3 % and εp= 2. 6 %, and apply the Miner's damage rule. By this criterion, the strength of bolt at the <b>re-fastening</b> shall be clear...|$|E
60|$|But no animal being decoyed {{by these}} blandishments, the girl slowly closed the door, and <b>re-fastened</b> it; leaving Mr. Pickwick drawn up {{straight}} against the wall.|$|R
60|$|So {{she gave}} him the gem, or rather let him take it from the silk, which he <b>re-fastened</b> very neatly for one who seemed to be almost blind, and strode off swiftly towards the town.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Suhaili {{went to the}} National Maritime Museum at Greenwich as an exhibit, but the {{controlled}} atmosphere began to shrink her planking, and, unwilling to see her die this way, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston removed her in 2002 and re-fitted her again. She still belongs to RKJ and is currently being slowly <b>re-fastened</b> at the Elephant Boatyard at Burseldon, Near Southampton, UK {{with the objective of}} getting her back into commission.|$|R
50|$|The {{next day}} a bagful of money reached the Inspector. The {{authorities}} shook their {{hands off the}} matter. And the mosque committee discovered that their agitation was about to fizzle out since their community had suffered no loss of life or property. Meanwhile, the temple committee arranged to guard the tree lest someone tried to destroy it. In spite of that one night, some men wearing caps managed to tear off the red ribbons hung from its branches. Coming to know of this Araj Ali rushed there and <b>re-fastened</b> the red ribbons, two village communities.|$|R

Then Dick retreated back into his berth, and snored again, while Caldigate dressed himself. When that operation was completed,--which, including his lavations, occupied about five minutes,--he went up on the deck with the books for Mrs. Smith in his hand, and with Thomson's 'Seasons' in his pocket. So the poor girl had absolutely stolen down-stairs {{in the middle of}} the cold night, and had opened the case and <b>re-fastened</b> it, in order that he, when in strange lands, might find himself in possession of something that had been hers! ...|$|R
60|$|His {{right hand}} being still helpless, this {{he did with}} his left, and so awkwardly that the small doubloon he took hold of slipped from his fingers and fell on to the floor. Forgetting {{that he had not}} <b>re-fastened</b> the belt, he bent down to pick it up, whereon a number of gold pieces of various sorts, perhaps twenty of them, fell out and rolled hither and thither on the ground. Peter, watching, saw the {{landlord}} and the other men in the room exchange a quick and significant glance. They rose, however, and assisted to find the money, which the host returned to Castell, remarking with an unpleasant smile, that if he had known that his guests were so rich he would have charged them more for their accommodation.|$|R
60|$|I repented having {{tried this}} second entrance, and was almost {{inclined}} {{to slip away}} before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and <b>re-fastened</b> the door. There was a great fire, {{and that was all}} the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him again.|$|R
60|$|One day, {{while he}} was sitting in a very disconsolate mood, the Indian woman entered with his usual dinner,--a plate of thick soup and a coarse cake. Barney smiled upon her as usual, and then letting his eyes fall on the ground, sighed deeply,--for his heart was heavier than usual that day. As the woman was about to go, he looked earnestly and gravely in her face, and putting his large hand gently on her head, patted her grey hairs. This tender action seemed to affect the old woman more than usual. She laid her hand on Barney's arm, and looked as if she wished to speak. Then turning {{suddenly}} from him, she drew a small knife from her girdle and dropped it on the ground, as if accidentally, while she left the hut and <b>re-fastened</b> the door. Barney's heart leaped. He seized the knife and concealed it hastily in his bosom, and then ate his dinner with more than ordinary zest; for now he possessed the means of cutting the strong rope that bound him.|$|R
6000|$|With the able {{assistance}} of Baldwin and Maxwell and Ram-stam, he drew out, uncoiled, rubbed, examined inch by inch, and re-coiled the life-line and the air-tube; unscrewed the various pieces--glasses, nuts, and valves--of the helmet, carefully examined them, oiled them, and <b>re-fastened</b> them, {{much to the}} interest and curiosity of [...] "the natives." [...] The helmet itself he polished up till it shone like a great globe of silver, to the intense admiration of [...] "the natives." [...] The pump he took to pieces elaborately, much to the anxiety of [...] "the natives," [...] who evidently thought he had wantonly destroyed it, but who soon saw it gradually put together again, much to their satisfaction, and brought into good working order. Rooney even went the length of horrifying {{one or two of}} [...] "the natives" [...] by letting one of the heavy shoulder-weights fall on their naked toes. This had the effect of making them jump and howl, while it threw the others into ecstasies of delight, which they expressed by throwing back their heads, shutting their eyes, opening their mouths, and chuckling heartily.|$|R
5000|$|Penobscot is a 37-foot (11m)R-class sloop, {{designed}} by Charles Mower and custom built in 1923 by Hodgdon Brothers of Boothbay, Maine. Her construction is carvel mahogany planking, bronze-screw fastened to oak frames with oak backbone, oak deadwood and oak floor timbers with teak decks, mahogany trim, Sitka spruce spars, and bronze hardware. Her rig is a fractional Marconi sloop. She was originally built for New York Yacht Club member Frederic Hitz of Deer Isle, sold to William Whipple of Camden, Maine in 1944, to Robert Hills of Owls Head in 1948, to Anne and Maynard Bray then of Noank, Connecticut, in 1958, to Vernon Baker of Tenants Harbor, Maine, and Scotch Plains, New Jersey, in 1967, again to Anne and Maynard Bray, then of Brooklin, Maine, in 1984, to Robert Burke then of Islesboro, Maine, (later of Middletown, RI) in 1986 and to Hortensia Sampedro, of Key Biscayne, Fl, in 2000. She {{is listed in}} [...] "The Register of Wooden Boats". She underwent a restoration in the late 80s that included {{the addition of a}} diesel engine. After two years [...] "on the hard" [...] she was re-launched and new rigging was installed in 2001 together with new sails. In 2009 her deck and cockpit was <b>re-fastened</b> and re-caulked, and in 2010 her hull was re-caulked and a new engine installed. Penobscot was campaigned on Biscayne Bay, under the Biscayne Bay Yacht Racing Association; some honors include 2001, Hughes Cup, second place, 2001 WYRA Coral Cup, Gold Fleet, third place, 2001 BBYRA Fall Series, third place, 2001 Annual, PHRF 4, fifth place; most recently winning second in class at the 2010 44th Annual Ed Willman 'Round the Island Race. [...] While in Florida, Penobscot was harbored at Key Biscayne Yacht Club, Miami, Florida. Penobscot was recently purchased by Lindsay G. Merrithew a member of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, Toronto, Canada (RCYC) and is currently undergoing a restoration at D. N. Hylan and Associates in Brooklin, Maine. She was scheduled to be relaunched on her 90th Birthday.|$|R
