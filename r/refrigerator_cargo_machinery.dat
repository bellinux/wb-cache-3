Moreover, {{there is a tendency}} of twisting due to the great stretch of wire ropes and also become comparatively weak when lateral compression occurs. Consequently there should be caution in its use. The authors of this paper systematically investigated and analyzed an accident of wire rope which occured in Aza port, Naha City. The investigation included the investigation of operation of maintenance of wire rope and the visual identification of the damaged part (pile driver engine, anvil, knob of pile driver engine, pully, damaged wires). Through a close examination the main factors of the probable cause of the accident were as follows. 1) The wire rope did not travel on its normal functional path but instead deviated and became caught on a knob of the engine. 2) There were scars on the knob caused by the wire rope during its movement on its deviated path. 3) The scars on the knob were obserbed as definite singular cuts caused by the wire rope each time it contacted the knob (on its deviated path). 4) The cause of the accident as determined by the authors, coincide with the testimony given by the workers who were present {{at the site of the}} accident. 5) The result of experiments with wire rope passed through a path with one axle having shapes other than a normal pully, the strength of the rope diminished by about 40 %.

40|$|Epithelial {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by a polarized organization of their plasma membrane which is divided into apical and basolateral domains. This architecture is maintained by highly specific <b>cargo</b> sorting <b>machinery</b> that efficiently delivers newly synthesized polypeptides to their correct target membrane. After TGN exit apical cargo is segregated by at least two distinct sorting mechanisms into lipid-raft-dependent or lipid-raft-independent apical pathways in MDCK cells. The {{aim of this study}} was the identification of proteins which are essential for the transport of apically sorted proteins. In {{the first part of the}} current study, a member of kinesin- 1 group, KIF 5 C, was identified as a kinesin motor for apical trafficking of sucrase-isomaltase, the marker for the raft-associated pathway, and of non-raft-associated p 75. KIF 5 C was found by mass spectrometry in vesicle enriched fractions and on immunoisolated post-Golgi vesicles carrying apical cargo. KIF 5 C associates with vesicles of both raft-dependent and raft-independent pathways directly after TGN exit. The specific knockdown of KIF 5 C interfered the apical trafficking of both raft-associated and non-raft associated marker proteins significantly (Astanina and Jacob, 2010). In the second part, annexin XIIIb was identified in raft-independent apical trafficking by mass spectrometry, immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. Annexin XIIIb accumulated in endosomal compartments that are traversed by raft-dependent and raft-independent apical cargo after TGN release. Finally, a specific reduction of annexin XIIIb expression by RNA interference resulted in a significant decrease in the apical delivery of the raft- as well as non-raft apical markers (Astanina et al., 2010). Taken together, both proteins – KIF 5 C and annexin XIIIb – act as endosomal organizers of apical protein trafficking in polarized epithelial cells. Based on the confocal microscopy studies and TGN release experiments we came to the conclusion that both proteins function on the first transport steps after TGN exit and accomplish trafficking of raft-associated, as well as non-raft-associated apical cargo...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The p 24 {{family is}} thought to be somehow {{involved}} in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -to-Golgi protein transport. A subset of the p 24 proteins (p 24 alpha(3), -beta(1), -gamma(3) and -delta(2)) is upregulated when Xenopus laevis intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells are physiologically activated to produce vast amounts of their major secretory cargo, the prohormone proopiomelanocortin (POMC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we find that transgene expression of p 24 alpha(3) or p 24 delta(2) specifically in the Xenopus melanotrope cells in both cases causes an effective displacement of the endogenous p 24 proteins, resulting in severely distorted p 24 systems and disparate melanotrope cell phenotypes. Transgene expression of p 24 alpha(3) greatly reduces POMC transport and leads to accumulation of the prohormone in large, ER-localized electron-dense structures, whereas p 24 delta(2) -transgenesis does not influence the overall ultrastructure of the cells nor POMC transport and cleavage, but affects the Golgi-based processes of POMC glycomaturation and sulfation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Transgenic expression of two distinct p 24 family members has disparate effects on secretory pathway functioning, illustrating the specificity and non-redundancy of our transgenic approach.

This thesis traces back the common law origins of the exclusion, identifies the motivations behind the exclusion and submits that the risk of delay and some types of losses arising therefrom were not always excluded under the common law. By introducing distinctions among the types of delay, the work argues that the judgments in favour of the exclusion of delay losses shall be interpreted according to the type of delay and shall not be authority for all types of delay. The findings of the work accordingly clarify and considerably restrict the scope of the exclusion. The thesis also tackles the MIA provisions pertaining to the impact of delay on voyage policies. It argues that the relevant provisions are not clear and do not entirely reflect their common law background. On the ground that they have not been litigated since the enactment of the MIA, the research assesses whether they are obsolete and proposes that the provisions should be retained subject to reforms...|$|R
40|$|Importin-αs are {{essential}} adapter proteins that recruit cytoplasmic proteins destined for active nuclear import {{to the nuclear}} transport <b>machinery.</b> <b>Cargo</b> proteins interact with the importin-α armadillo repeat domain via nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), short amino acids motifs enriched in Lys and Arg residues. Plant genomes typically encode several importin-α paralogs that can have both specific and partially redundant functions. Although some cargos are preferentially imported by a distinct importin-α it remains unknown how this specificity is generated {{and to what extent}} cargos compete for binding to nuclear transport receptors. Here we report that the effector protein HaRxL 106 from the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis co-opts the host cell's nuclear import machinery. We use HaRxL 106 as a probe to determine redundant and specific functions of importin-α paralogs from Arabidopsis thaliana. A crystal structure of the importin-α 3 /MOS 6 armadillo repeat domain suggests that five of the six Arabidopsis importin-αs expressed in rosette leaves have an almost identical NLS-binding site. Comparison of the importin-α binding affinities of HaRxL 106 and other cargos in vitro and in plant cells suggests that relatively small affinity differences in vitro affect the rate of transport complex formation in vivo. Our results suggest that cargo affinity for importin-α, sequence variation at the importin-α NLS-binding sites and tissue-specific expression levels of importin-αs determine formation of cargo/importin-α transport complexes in plant cells...|$|R

We show that Sec 16 defines the tER, whereas Sec 23 -Sec 24 and Sec 13 -Sec 31 define later structures that precede but are distinct from the intermediate compartment. Steady-state localisation of Sec 16 is independent of the localisation of downstream COPII components Sec 23 -Sec 24 and Sec 13 -Sec 31.
