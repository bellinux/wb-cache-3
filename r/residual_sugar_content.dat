To estimate the levels of sotolon [3 -hydroxy 4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 (5 H) -furanone] and their behavior over time, 86 aged Madeira wines samples (1 - 25 years old), with different sugar concentrations, respectively, 90 g L- 1 for Boal, 110 g L- 1 for Malvazia, 25 g L - 1 for Sercial, and 65 g L- 1 for Verdelho varieties, were analyzed. Isolation was performed by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane followed by chromatographic analysis by GC-MS. The reproducibility of the method was found to be 4. 9 %. The detection and quantification limits were 1. 2 and 2. 0 µgL- 1, respectively. The levels of sotolon found ranged from not detected to 2000 µgL- 1 for wines between 1 and 25 years old. It was observed that during aging, the concentration of sotolon increased with time in a linear fashion (r) 0. 917). The highest concentration of sotolon was found in wines with the highest <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>contents,</b> considering the same time of storage. The results show that there is a strong correlation between sotolon and sugar derivatives: furfural, 5 -methylfurfural, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, and 5 -ethoxymethylfurfural. These compounds are also well correlated with wine aging. These findings indicate that the kinetics of sotolon formation is closely related with <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>contents,</b> suggesting that this molecule may come from a component like sugar...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In Brazil {{part of the}} {{production}} of ginger is of inadequate quality for export. The production of spirit from felt-over rhizomes is an alternative {{of great interest to}} producers of these rhizomes. Aim: Aiming to increase the value of felt-over rhizomes, this work aimed to study the use of ginger as a raw material for alcoholic beverage production. It was evaluated the effect of fermentation conditions on the components of fermented alcoholic, as well as, the quality of alcoholic distilled beverage of ginger. Methods: Dehydrated ginger passed by enzymatic hydrolysis-saccharification processes. The hydrolysate obtained was analyzed for sugar profile in HPLC. The alcoholic fermentation process followed the central composite rotational design for three factors: fermentation temperature (23 to 37 ºC), time of fermentation (17 to 33 h) and concentration of inoculum (0. 22 to 3. 00 %). The fermented alcoholic obtained was analyzed in HPLC for the contents of ethanol, methanol, glycerol and <b>residual</b> <b>sugars.</b> The distillated alcoholic beverage of ginger was analyzed for ethanol, methanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate and higher alcohols in the gas chromatography (GC). In addition, copper content and acidity were analyzed Results: Sugar profile of the ginger hydrolysate revealed the presence of 77. 8 % of glucose. Data analysis of fermentation process showed influence of temperature on ethanol and methanol content of the fermented alcoholic of ginger. Time of fermentation had effect on glycerol content. All parameters of process had influence on <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>contents.</b> The HPLC analysis has shown presence of methanol, ethyl acetate, aldehyde, acids, higher alcohols and esters in distilled alcoholic beverage of ginger. Conclusion: Fermented alcoholic of ginger with higher levels of ethanol can be obtained under the conditions of 1. 5 % w/w of inoculum, 30 °C of temperature and 24 hours of fermentation time.

40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the potential as silage additive of a bacteriocin produced by Pediococcus acidilactici Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL) B- 5627 (pediocin SA- 1). Maize was inoculated either with a bacterial starter alone (I) {{or in combination}} with the bacteriocin (IP), and untreated silage served as control. We monitored the products of fermentation (ethanol, and lactic and acetic acids), the microbial population, and the presence of the indicator strain Listeria monocytogenes Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo (CECT) 4032 (1 × 105 cfu/g) after 1, 2, 5, 8, 16, and 30 d of ensiling. Our results indicated antilisterial activity of the bacteriocin, anticipating the disappearance of L. monocytogenes in IP compared with I and control silages. The PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the addition of the bacteriocin did not affect the bacterial communities of the spontaneous fermentation, and the inoculant-containing bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Enterococcus faecium) were found in addition to the bacterial communities of untreated maize silages in I and IP silages. Both treatments increased the concentration of antimicrobial compounds (acetic acid, ethanol, and 1, 2 -propanodiol) and led to lower <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> compared with the control, which would provide enhanced aerobic stability. The fact that the identified species L. plantarum, L. buchneri, and E. faecium produce some of these inhibitory compounds, together with their persistence throughout the 30 d of fermentation, suggest these bacteria could actively participate in the ensiling process. According to these results, pediocin SA- 1 could be used as an additive to control the presence of L. monocytogenes in maize silages selectively, while improving their fermentative quality and eventually their aerobic stability.

40|$|The in-bottle {{fermentation}} of sparkling wines {{is currently}} triggered by few commercialized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. This lack {{of diversity in}} tirage yeast cultures leads to a prevalent uniformity in sensory profiles of the end products. The {{aim of this study}} has been to exploit the natural multiplicity of yeast populations in order to introduce variability in sparkling wines throughout the re-fermentation step. A collection of 133 S. cerevisiae strains were screened on the basis of technological criteria (fermenting power and vigor, SO 2 tolerance, alcohol tolerance, flocculence) and qualitative features (acetic acid, glycerol and H 2 S productions). These activities allowed the selection of yeasts capable of dominating the in-bottle fermentation in actual cellar conditions: in particular, the performances of FX and FY strains (isolated in Franciacorta area), and OX and OY strains (isolated in Oltrepò Pavese area), were compared to those of habitually used starter cultures (IOC 18 - 2007, EC 1118, Lalvin DV 10), by involving nine wineries belonging to the two Consortia of Appellation of Origin. The microbiological analyses of samples have revealed that the indigenous strains showed an increased latency period and a higher cultivability along the aging time than the commercial starter cultures do. Results of chemical analyses and sensory evaluation of the samples after 18 months sur lies have shown that significant differences (p < 0. 05) were present among the strains for alcoholic strength, carbon dioxide overpressure and pleasantness, whereas they were not observed for <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>content,</b> titratable acidity or volatile acidity.

The ANOVA has also proven that the base wine formulation is a key factor, by significantly affecting (p < 0. 01) some oenological parameters of wine, like alcoholic strength, volatile acidity, carbon dioxide overpressure, titratable acidity and dry extract. The use of native yeast strains for the re-fermentation step can be considered a convenient way for introducing differentiation to the final product without modifying the traditional technology.

30|$|The {{role of the}} {{bacterium}} L. fermentum, in a scenario in which fermentation {{was carried out by}} an industrial strain like PE- 2 whilst being contaminated by a rough yeast strain, was not to potentiate the harmful effects of the contamination by the wild yeast strain regardless of the feedstock. There is no doubt that this result is very interesting in the context of Brazilian industrial fermentation. However, even considering that the ethanol yield was re-established with the inoculation of L. fermentum, there are numbers that should not be despised: decreases of approximately 5.7 % in ethanol yield and 1.2 % in ethanol productivity, and increase in 122 % in the <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> in sugarcane juice, in the fermentation contaminated with both rough yeast and L. fermentum compared to the fermentation without contamination; for molasses, the numbers are 2.4, 13.7 and 140 %, respectively.

For bacterial contamination, the acid treatment of the cells between the fermentative cycles is able to decrease the number of viable cells and an alternative treatment based on the addition of ethanol to the acid solution has been successfully proposed (Costa et al. 2017).|$|E

30|$|A {{particular}} biotype of S. cerevisiae that {{is frequently}} found in ethanolic fermentation processes displays cells arranged in clusters and forms rough colonies on solid medium. Reduced fermentation rates and high <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> {{are associated with}} the presence of these contaminating yeast strains in the fermentation medium (Reis et al. 2013). In spite of being S. cerevisiae strains, these yeasts are classified as contaminants because of the operational problems that arise due to their specific characteristics such as formation of scum, cell flotation or sedimentation, and reduced efficiency of cell separation (using centrifugation) from the fermentation medium. Yeasts with such features—rough colonies and pseudohyphal growth—are capable of dominating the fermentation process and replacing the starter yeast strain (Basso et al. 2008). These yeasts display a high degree of cell sedimentation that results in problems that are similar to those observed with flocculent yeasts. On a cautionary note, cell aggregation that originates from pseudohyphae {{should not be confused with}} those that results from flocculation. The formation of cell chains results from the failure of the young bud to separate from the mother cell (Soares 2010) which leads to the daughter cell remaining attached to the parent after mitosis. These yeasts are also referred to by the term ‘snowflake yeasts’. As cell chains continue to elongate with each subsequent cell division, the tension between the cells rises till the tension force exceeds the cell–cell adhesion resulting in the release of multicellular propagules (Ratcliff et al. 2015).|$|E

The published article can be found at: [URL] valid quantitative method {{for the analysis of}} chiral monoterpenes in white wine using head-space solid phase micro-extraction-MDGC-MS (HS-SPME-MDGC-MS) with stable isotope dilution analysis was established. Fifteen compounds: (S) -(−) -limonene, (R) -(+) -limonene, (+) -(2 R, 4 S) -cis-rose oxide, (−) -(2 S, 4 R) -cis-rose oxide, (−) -(2 R, 4 R) -trans-rose oxide, (+) -(2 S, 4 S) -cis-rose oxide, furanoid (+) -trans-linalool oxide, furanoid (−) -cis-linalool oxide, furanoid (−) -trans-linalool oxide, furanoid (+) -cis-linalool oxide, (−) -linalool, (+) -linalool, (−) -α-terpineol, (+) -α-terpineol and (R) -(+) -β-citronellol were quantified. Two calibration curves were plotted for different wine bases, with varying <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>content,</b> and three calibration curves for each wine base were investigated during a single fiber’s lifetime. This was needed as both sugar content and fiber life impacted the quantification of the chiral terpenes. The chiral monoterpene content of six Pinot Gris wines and six Riesling wines was then analyzed using the verified method. ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons showed significant differences for each of the detected chiral compounds in all 12 wines. PCA score plots showed a clear separation between the Riesling and Pinot Gris wines. Riesling wines had greater number of chiral terpenes in comparison to Pinot Gris wines. Beyond total terpene content {{it is possible that the}} differences in chiral terpene content may be driving the aromatic differences in white wines...|$|E
2500|$|Almost all {{wines are}} white, except those {{made from the}} Pinot noir grape which are pale red, often rosé, rarely red (e.g. [...] ). Sparkling wines known as Crémant d'Alsace are also made. Much of the white wines of Alsace are made from {{aromatic}} grape varieties, so many characteristic Alsace wines are aromatic, floral and spicy. Since they very seldom have any oak barrel aromas {{they tend to be}} very varietally pure in their character. Traditionally all Alsace wines were dry (which once set them apart from German wines with which they share many grape varieties), but an ambition to produce wines with more intense and fruity character has led some producers to produce wines which contain some <b>residual</b> <b>sugar.</b> Since there is no official labeling that differentiates completely dry from off-dry (or even semi-sweet) wines, this has occasionally led to some confusion among consumers. It is more common to find <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> in Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, which reach a higher natural <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> on ripeness, than in Riesling, Muscat or Sylvaner. Usually there is a [...] "house style" [...] as to <b>residual</b> <b>sugar,</b> i.e., some producers only produce totally dry wines, except for their dessert style wines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{density of}} the wort depends on the <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> in the wort, the more sugar the higher the density. The {{fermented}} beer will have some <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> which will raise the SG, the alcohol content will lower the SG. The difference between the SG of the wort before fermentation and the SG of the beer after fermentation gives {{an indication of how}} much sugar was converted to alcohol by the yeast. A basic formula to calculate beer strength based on the difference between the original and final SG is: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Loire valley wines, the {{designation}} SGN usually denotes wines that are extra sweet, and produced {{by one of the}} region's so-called [...] "sugar hunters". Often, the same producer will have another wine from the same appellation with less <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> without the SGN designation. The SGN designation can be used in the appellations Coteaux du Layon and Coteaux de l'Aubance and in both cases this requires the grape must used for the wine to have a minimum <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> of 294 grams per liter rather than the basic level of 221 or 230 grams per liter respectively.|$|R
