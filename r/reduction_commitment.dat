50|$|The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (the CRC, {{formerly}} the Carbon <b>Reduction</b> <b>Commitment)</b> is a mandatory {{carbon emissions reduction}} scheme in the United Kingdom that applies to large non-energy-intensive organisations in {{the public and private}} sectors. It has been estimated that the scheme will reduce carbon emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020. In an effort to avoid dangerous climate change, the British Government first committed to cutting UK carbon emissions by 60% by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), and in October 2008 increased this commitment to 80%. The scheme has also been credited with driving up demand for energy-efficient goods and services.|$|E

50|$|An {{emission}} <b>reduction</b> <b>commitment,</b> {{sometimes called}} an emission target, is a quantity-based commitment. It differs from a cap because a country can emit more provided it buys carbon permits {{from another country}} (that over-satisfies its commitment). Also, such commitments need {{not lead to a}} price on carbon, but can be met by non-price policies. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I countries made emission reduction commitments. These commitments did not specify which policy would be used to achieve them, but the EU among others hoped that a set of linked national cap-and-trade markets would develop and that carbon pricing {{would be one of the}} most significant policies in achieving emission reductions. In reality, the EU ETS and its carbon price did play an important role as did the more ambiguous pricing of the Clean Development Mechanism and its permits, Certified Emission Reduction Units (CERs). However, renewables subsidies undermined the carbon price significantly as well as the efficiency of the emission reduction process.|$|E
50|$|The UK's primary {{policy for}} non {{domestic}} energy use is the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (the CRC, formerly the Carbon <b>Reduction</b> <b>Commitment).</b> It is a mandatory {{cap and trade}} scheme in the United Kingdom that applies to large non-energy-intensive organisations in {{the public and private}} sectors. It use 3 main policy tools to achieve this: A league table ranking all the participants performance; a reporting regime forcing participants to keep accurate measurements of their energy consumption; and an allowance trading scheme. It has been estimated that the scheme will reduce carbon emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020 and significantly reduce electricity demand. Toward avoiding dangerous climate change, the British Government first committed to cutting UK carbon emissions by 60% by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels),3 and in October 2008 upped the 2050 commitment to 80%. The scheme has also been credited with driving up demand for energy efficient goods and services particularly amongst British SMEs and in October 2008 upped the 2050 commitment to 80%.

40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{actively}} campaigning {{for the global}} regulation of carbon emissions generated by maritime bunker fuels because these emissions are presently barely regulated and are projected to increase significantly in the coming decades. However, since a global regulation has not been reached yet, the EU is seeking ways to include the shipping sector in its greenhouse gas <b>reduction</b> <b>commitment</b> for 2020. In this paper, {{we look at the}} effect of including the shipping sector’s emissions in the EU <b>reduction</b> <b>commitment</b> that is based on the nationality of a ship. Emissions that are generated by ships owned, operated or flagged by the 27 EU countries are allocated to the EU total GHG emissions. We first analyse the effects on the <b>reduction</b> <b>commitment</b> caused by the three allocations. We then use marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) in order to determine how much the shipping sector of the 27 EU countries, defined by the three allocations, could contribute efficiently to a total given emission reduction target for all sectors in the EU. Moreover, we use MACCs in order to determine if some country fleets could reduce emissions in the shipping sector relatively more efficiently than other countries under a given emission reduction target for all sectors. Our findings indicate that the shipping sector could contribute efficiently to the EU’s emission reductions by up to 8. 5 %. Since the composition of the individual country fleets and applied measures are similar across countries, their individual reductions relative to their fleet-specific business-as-usual (BAU) emissions are on average the same...|$|E

40|$|Integrating reduced {{emissions}} from deforestation and degradation (REDD) into a post-Kyoto intergovernmental carbon market could significantly decrease global carbon {{prices and the}} costs of mitigating climate change. We investigate this impact by simulating the impact of the supply of REDD units on the international carbon market in 2020 under unlimited and restricted exchange conditions. We find restricting supply or demand of REDD credits reduces such price impacts, but comes at the cost of economic efficiency. The introduction of deeper Annex I emissions <b>reduction</b> <b>commitments</b> reduces the impact on global carbon prices, but entails substantial compliance costs and wealth transfers. While REDD provides large economic benefits for tropical rainforest regions, any REDD fungibility scenario which results in a reduction in the international price of carbon also reduces transfers to the CDM host countries. Our modelling indicates unrestricted exchange of REDD units reduces the international carbon price by half and cuts Annex I compliance costs by roughly one third if projected emissions <b>reduction</b> <b>commitments</b> are unchanged. Alternatively, Annex I <b>reduction</b> <b>commitments</b> could be increased by around 60 percent at constant carbon prices. The findings of this research have relevance for policy makers and academics seeking to understand carbon market implications of supply variability and policymakers considering the introduction of REDD market mechanisms...|$|R
