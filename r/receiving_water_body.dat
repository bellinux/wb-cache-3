This paper {{is aimed at}} reviewing the environmental and health impacts of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater effluents. The quality of wastewater effluents {{is responsible for the}} degradation of the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> This is because untreated or inadequately treated wastewater effluent may lead to eutrophication in <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and also create environmental conditions that favour proliferation of waterborne pathogens of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. In extension, recreational water users and anyone else coming into contact with the infected water is at risk. Although various microorganisms play many beneficial roles in wastewater systems, a great number of them are considered to be critical factors in contributing to numerous waterborne outbreaks. Also, wastewater effluents have been shown to contain a variety of anthropogenic compounds, many of which have endocrine-disrupting properties. Since large amounts of wastewater effluents are passed through sewage treatment systems on a daily basis, {{there is a need to}} remedy and diminish the overall impacts of these effluents in <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> In order to comply with wastewater legislations and guidelines, there is a need for adequate treatment before discharge. This can be achieved through the application of appropriate treatment processes, which will help to minimize the risks to public health and the environment.

Samples from <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> had higher total concentrations of suspended sediment (323 μl/l and 319 μl/l, respectively) relative to urban sites (205 μl/l), which contained approximately 35 % less total sediment.

The Clean Water Act relies on a permit system, known as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to regulate water discharges. Facilities may be assigned a specific mercury discharge limit, or may only be required to monitor their discharge for mercury. Facilities report actual discharge levels in Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), which {{serve as the basis for}} determining compliance.. Pretreatment standards regulate industries that discharge into a publicly owned treatment plant (POTW) instead of discharging directly into a <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body.</b> Regulations list industrial categories subject to national categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing facilities that discharge into treatment plants. POTWs with approved pretreatment programs may set permit limits and conduct inspections of industrial users. Facilities that do not have specific pretreatment standards for mercury (or other hazardous substances), are supposed to notify the POTW of any hazardous waste discharge that exceeds 100 kg per month. Wastestreams from certain manufacturing processes that may involve mercury, such as fluorescent lamps and switchgear, are excluded from categorical pretreatment standards because they are considered dilute.|$|E

The study revealed that although the average free chlorine residual concentration of the treated effluents was ≤ 0. 32 mg L - 1, somatic and F-RNA coliphages were still found in the treated effluents. Viral quality of the treated effluent samples collected from Alice, Fort Beaufort, Dimbaza and East London wastewater treatment plants was very poor and did not complied with the recommended limits set by the official guidelines in South Africa in terms of coliphages, which are 0 - 1 pfu/ 100 mL for negligible risk for domestic water use and 0 - 20 pfu/ 100 mL for recreational water use. There were generally higher somatic coliphage counts (average ranges: 4. 67 log 10 to 6. 39 log 10 pfu/ 100 mL) than F-RNA coliphage counts (average ranges: 3. 37 log 10 to 5. 26 log 10 pfu/ 100 mL) in the treated effluents.

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve a better {{environmental}} performance through optimal waste-load allocation among different outlets, the natural assimilative capacities of the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> near each outlet {{should be taken into}} consideration.

For formulating the optimization model, a concept of environmental performance index (EPI) was defined to reflect combined effects of the waste load level from each outlet and the assimilative capacity of the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> near the outlet. Its magnitude represents the relative importance of each outlet in improving water quality with its discharge load being optimally allocated.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{treatment}} efficiency conformity of Wastewater Treatment Plants to the Estonian and European Union requirements in the area of Estonian nitrate vulnerable zone as well as evaluate the existing national wastewater monitoring programme and the efficiency of the self-monitoring programme. Monitoring the results and total pollution load of effluent discharged to the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> from 2007 to 2008 are used to assess the treatment level of WWTPs and the need to establish higher treatment requirements. Estonian national standards, due to the fact that Estonian water bodies are small and vulnerable to pollution, are stricter than the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) requirements. If the requirements given in UWWTD are not sufficient to achieve a good status for water bodies, it is proven that wastewater discharge adversely affects the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and this discharge is one of the important point-pollution sources for water bodies, additional stricter wastewater treatment requirements are needed. WWTPs with a more than a 2, 000 population equivalent (p. e.) should be regulated vigorously to guarantee their compliance with the requirements, because WWTPs with more than 2, 000 p. e. count for 80 % of the total pollution load. A pollution load from WWTPs of less than 2, 000 p. e. on the receiving water bodies is marginal; however, the extent of the impact of each individual WWTP depends on, among other things, the characteristics of the wastewater, the turbulence of the <b>receiving</b> <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and the area’s sensitivity as well as other pressure sources...|$|E
