5|$|Tree shaping {{has been}} practised {{for at least}} several hundred years, the oldest known {{examples}} being the living root bridges built and maintained by the Khasi people of Meghalaya, India using the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rubber tree (Ficus elastica).|$|E
5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Many {{trees have}} flowers rich in nectar which are {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas {{of the developing world}} where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied. Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E

5|$|The main {{damage done}} by mole crickets is {{as a result of}} their {{burrowing}} activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf- and pasture-grasses as they feed on the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grasses, leaving the plants prone to drying-out and damage by use.|$|E
5|$|To {{advertise}} the game, Konami {{released a}} series of screenshots and viral videos prior to release. The screenshots depicted {{different areas of the}} asylum and victims in their traps. The videos demonstrated the first hour or so of the game and included certain gameplay elements. While a few of the videos are inaccurate due to the developer making dramatic changes to the environment and gameplay, they still maintained the general <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game and the storyline.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E

50|$|All nodes push a {{route to}} {{themselves}} to <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. A node wanting a connection can therefore push {{a request to}} <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, and always find a route.|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5000|$|Common jazz parlance {{refers to}} upper {{structures}} by way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval between <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom chord and <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triad juxtaposed above it. For instance, in example one above (C79) <b>the</b> triad <b>of</b> E major is a (compound) minor 3rd away from C (<b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottom chord). Thus, this upper structure {{can be called}} upper structure flat three, or USIII for short.|$|R

5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Welsh <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college come to {{the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil in Natal Dunes State Park {{in the northeastern}} Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte in 2008. The fruit bodies {{were associated with the}} <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native tree species Eugenia brasiliensis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this disjunct distribution: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been introduced to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a cryptic species complex—appearing morphologically similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.|$|E
