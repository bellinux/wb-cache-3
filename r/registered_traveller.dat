5000|$|In late January 2016, the British {{government}} announced that holders of HKSAR passports {{are eligible to}} register for the <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> service (RTS) which enables them to clear UK immigration using EU/EEA citizen lanes or ePassport gates. The service is not yet available to BN(O) passport holders, and a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said that “the majority of BN(O) passport holders are also holders of a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport which {{would enable them to}} apply for the <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> Service if they are in one of the eligible categories.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Francie {{looked at}} this letter and tossed it away without reading it. Delia picked it up, read it to her father, who didn't {{understand}} it, and kept it in her possession, poring over it as Mr. Flack had seen her pore over the cards that were left while she was out or over the <b>registers</b> of American <b>travellers.</b> They knew of Gaston's arrival by his telegraphing from Havre (he came back by the French line) and he mentioned the hour--"about dinner-time"--at which he should reach Paris. Delia, after dinner, made her father {{take her to the}} circus so that Francie should be left alone to receive her intended, who would be sure to hurry round {{in the course of the}} evening. The girl herself expressed no preference whatever on this point, and the idea was one of Delia's masterly ones, her flashes of inspiration. There was never any difficulty about imposing such conceptions on poppa. But at half-past ten, when they returned, the young man had not appeared, and Francie remained only long enough to say [...] "I told you so!" [...] with a white face and march off to her room with her candle. She locked herself in and her sister couldn't get at her that night. It was another of Delia's inspirations not to try, after she had felt that the door was fast. She forbore, in the exercise of a great discretion, but she herself for the ensuing hours slept no wink. Nevertheless the next morning, as early as ten o'clock, she had the energy to drag her father out to the banker's and to keep him out two hours. It would be inconceivable now that Gaston shouldn't turn up before dejeuner. He did turn up; about eleven o'clock he came in and found Francie alone. She noticed, for strangeness, that he was very pale at the same time that he was sunburnt; also that he didn't for an instant smile at her. It was very certain there was no bright flicker in her own face, and they had the most singular, the most unnatural meeting. He only said as he arrived: [...] "I couldn't come last evening; they made it impossible; they were all there and we were up till three o'clock this morning." [...] He looked as if he had been through terrible things, and it wasn't simply the strain of his attention to so much business in America. What passed next she couldn't remember afterwards; it seemed but a few seconds before he said to her slowly, holding her hand--before this he had pressed his lips to hers silently--"Is it true, Francie, what they say (and they swear to it!) that YOU told that blackguard those horrors; that that infamous letter's only a report of YOUR talk?" ...|$|R
50|$|The EU {{plans to}} {{establish}} a <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> Programme that would allow pre-screened travellers easier access. In 2013, the EU also adopted a proposal for establishment of an Entry/Exit System {{that would make it}} possible to identify overstayers.|$|E
50|$|At present, British {{citizens}}, European Economic Area {{citizens and}} citizens of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States who {{are enrolled in}} the <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> Service, can use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult and holding valid biometric passports.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the technical feasibility and financial soundness of the Commission legislative proposals {{to establish a}} EU Entry/Exit System (EES) and EU <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> Programme (RTP) for the external borders of the Union. It puts the impact assessment documents accompanying the proposals in comparative perspectives with likeminded initiatives in third countries (USVIST), {{at the national level}} in the EU (UK border checks and e-Borders), and with past European initiatives (SIS II, VIS). It finds that it is not reasonable to consider that the measures envisaged in the smart borders package are technically feasible and financially sounds, and formulates recommendations to the LIBE Committee and the European Parliament in this regard...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe European Union (EU) policy puts {{a strong}} {{emphasis}} on the fight against irregular immigration, which might occur either through fraudulent entry or through illegal overstay of a regular visitor. The surveillance of its external borders, and especially that of the Schengen space where internal borders checks have been abolished, has thus been the objective of several enacted legislative provisions and implementation programmes. Confronted to the paradox of realizing its political will to increase the efficiency of its border control process {{while at the same time}} comply with the fundamental right of EU citizens to their free movement in the European space, the EU has decided to rely as much as possible on the use of information and communication technologies to implement its border control policies. To this end, and following-up on an earlier Communication on “Preparing the next steps in border management in the European Union” published in 2008, the European Commission (EC) issued in October 2011 a new Communication proposing a “Smart Border” programme and examining the options for its implementation to control the EU borders by electronic means. This “Smart Border” package aims at creating a new Entry/Exit System (EES) allowing to control not only incoming but also outgoing movements and a <b>Registered</b> <b>Traveller</b> Program (RTP) for frequent, pre-screened travellers. This package will add to the numerous existing mechanisms and databases, such as: EuroDac for asylum seekers; Passenger Name Records programmes for travellers pre-screening, the Visa Information System (VIS); the Schengen Information System; and many others. It will be interconnected or at least be interoperable to some of them. While most of the existing databases include biometric identifiers among the collected and processed personal data, the “Smart border” package proposal is intended to only include alphanumeric data in a first phase, leaving the possibility to include biometric identifiers in a second step. This proposed choice results from the observation that, although the inclusion of biometrics would immediately make the EES more efficient, it would have a negative impact on foreigners not requiring a visa (others being already identified using the VIS). Our proposed presentation will analyse the impact on fundamental human rights of this new EU “Smart Border” proposal, in relation with already existing mechanisms and databases for the control of migrants. Furthermore, it will show through our research conducted on the French immigration control legislation, practices and systems by information and communication means, how such policies are going well beyond the sole external borders control, to rather implement a full biometric monitoring of foreigners: from their very first visa request at a EU Member State consulate in their country of origin to their – voluntary or forced - return to this country, including their biometric registration and control during their stay as visitors or as regular foreign residents. We will show through this analysis how immigration control policies are intertwined with criminal policies, implying that migrants and foreigners are treated with the genral suspicion of being a criminal...|$|E
