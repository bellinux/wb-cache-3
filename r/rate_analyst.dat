40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} risk versus mispricing {{explanation}} of superior returns to contrarian strategies using {{the interactions between}} value-to-market indicators and corporate financing transactions that increase or de-crease the firm’s outstanding equity. Portfolio-level analyses and firm-level cross-sectional regressions indicate that the well-documented contrarian profits soar when value stocks which repurchase shares (value repurchasers) and growth stocks which issue shares (growth issuers) are considered. The results also show that value-to-market ratios cannot capture the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns when value issuers and growth re-purchasers are considered. Based on various risk measures, we find that value repurchasers are not riskier than growth issuers. Furthermore, examination of past and future growth <b>rates,</b> <b>analyst</b> estimates of long-term growth, and sensitivity of portfolio returns to investor sentiment support the misvaluation explanation for th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} issues {{giving rise}} to conflict of interest concerns in the credit rating industry and examines whether and how those issues are addressed in the current regulation that builds on the guidelines of the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the SEC rules that were initially adopted in 2007 and recently amended in 2009, and the internal code of conducts of rating agencies. The examination leads to a conclusion that conflict of interest at the individual <b>rating</b> <b>analyst</b> level and some concerns of conflict of interest at the agency level have been largely addressed in the current regulation, but conflict of interest arising from the issuer-pay business model and influences of large subscriber clients of rating agencies remains a concern.

40|$|The use of {{correlation}} between forecasts and actual returns is commonplace in the literature, {{often used as}} a measurement of investors’ skill. A prominent application {{of this is the}} concept of the Information Coefficient (IC). Not only can IC be used as a tool to <b>rate</b> <b>analysts</b> and fund managers but it also represents an important parameter in the asset allocation and portfolio construction process. Nevertheless, theoretical understanding of it has typically been limited to the partial equilibrium context where the investing activities of each agent have no effect on other market participants. In this paper we show that this can be an undesirable oversimplification and we demonstrate plausible circumstances in which conventional empirical measurements of IC can be highly misleading. We suggest that improved understanding of IC in a general equilibrium setting can lead to refined portfolio decision making ex ante and more informative analysis of performance ex post.

This is the fifth year in a row the Maryland College Investment Plan has received Morningstar’s highest <b>rating.</b> Morningstar <b>analysts</b> reviewed 64 plans for its 2014 ratings (10/21/2014), 2013 ratings (10/22/13) and 2012 ratings (10/15/12), of which four plans received a “Gold” rating. To determine a plan’s <b>rating,</b> Morningstar <b>analysts</b> considered five factors: the plan’s strategy and investment process; the plan’s risk-adjusted performance; an assessment of the individuals managing the plan’s investment options; the stewardship practices of the plan’s administration and parent firm; and whether the plan’s investment options are a good value proposition compared to its peers. Plans were then assigned forward-looking ratings of [...] "Gold," [...] "Silver," [...] "Bronze," [...] "Neutral," [...] and [...] "Negative."

Our framework provides an objective assessment of analyst quality that differs from the standard approach that uses survey evidence to <b>rate</b> <b>analysts.</b> Using a sample of equity analysts, we find that lead analysts identified by our procedures have more price impact than follower analysts. Evidence also is presented that suggests analysts use recent stock price trends to help them modify forecast revisions, {{regardless of whether the}} analyst is a leader or a follower.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} bond rating {{variability}} {{over time as}} well as the consistency of bond rating methodology adopted by rating agencies. The results indicate that bond ratings are becoming extremely variable over time and majority of these rating changes are on the downside having price risk implications for investors. While bond rating variability is increasingly higher for both manufacturing and financial sector, the figures are relatively higher for the latter. Rating changes also seem to have an industry pattern with a greater concentration in industries more affected by economic slowdown and global competition. The findings for consistency bond rating methodology are also not encouraging. While the key financial ratios desirably do not vary for companies belonging to the same rating class, they also do not vary across companies belonging to different rating classes. This points at probable weaknesses in rating methodology as the important financial factors fail to discriminate across rating classes. Perhaps the subjective judgements of <b>rating</b> <b>analysts</b> taint the relationship between bond ratings and key financial factors. Inconsistency in bond rating methodology may partly explain the increasing bond rating variability over time...|$|R
