40|$|Seats {{received}} {{a variety of}} forced oscillation in <b>running</b> <b>tests,</b> so the results do not necessarily represent the vibration characteristics of the seat itself. We thus carried out seat vibration measurement using a shaking table to identify the vibration characteristics of the seat itself. The input acceleration PSD of the table surface Seats are the train equipment closest to passengers. As passengers come into direct contact with seats, those {{play an important role}} in efforts to provide service. For rolling stock seats, comfort is required in terms of vibration when running on top of improving the comfort of the seats themselves 1). We found in <b>running</b> <b>tests</b> using the FASTECH 360 S Shinkansen high-speed test train that high-speed running caused high-frequency vibration to occur on the car floor and be transmitted to the seats. Such transmission adversely affects seat comfort. In order to study methods of designing seats that control uncomfortable vibration, we measured seat vibration in high-speed <b>running</b> <b>tests</b> and in oscillation tests using a shaking table, built a seat dynamic model and conducted numerical simulation on the model...|$|R

50|$|A {{baseline}} is {{representation of}} the output device settings (i.e. paper feed, head alignment, etc.) and associated conditions (i.e. media, ink, screening, etc.).

50|$|Four similar EMD JT22CW-2 {{locomotives}} {{are used}} by Serbian Railways, designated as ŽS series 666. They were originally intended by Yugoslav Railways for use with Tito's special Blue Train, hence their all blue livery. These locomotives differ from the Irish units in being standard gauge rather than Irish 1600mm gauge and having a full width car-body. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the locomotives {{have been used to}} haul freight and passenger trains. Three locomotives are currently not operational and awaiting overhaul, while 003 (Sutjeska) started <b>running</b> <b>test</b> rides in January 2015 after an overhaul in Kraljevo. On 23 January 2015 003 re-entered service.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, a {{joint venture}} with the British Motor Corporation created the Austin-Healey marque and later on the Austin-Healey Sprite.

Donald Healey became a director of Jensen Motors in the late 1960s and a result of this was the Lotus engined Jensen-Healey which appeared in 1972. The Donald Healey Motor Company was finally sold to the Hamblin Group, although Healey Automobile Consultants and the engineering parts of the company remained in the hands of Geoffrey and Donald Healey.Geoffrey worked as a Vehicle test engineer for Rover Group up until his retirement, <b>running</b> <b>test</b> programmes in UK and overseas.|$|E
