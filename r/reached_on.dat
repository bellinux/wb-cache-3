The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the votes}} in {{parliament}} was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris, {{the leader of the}} LCL in the Legislative Council. DeGaris, who was elected to the council in 1962, was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries. The two were the de facto leaders of the party's two factions; Hall represented the urban-based progressives, and DeGaris the rural-based conservatives. The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level, contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be <b>reached</b> <b>on</b> the issue of electoral reform.|$|E

5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was <b>reached</b> <b>on</b> several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272.

5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down.

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the event, the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal (STCUM) {{announced}} that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend.

It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators. STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing a contingency plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running.
