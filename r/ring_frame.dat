25|$|The {{hand-operated}} mule was {{a breakthrough}} in yarn production and the machines were copied by Samuel Slater, who founded the cotton industry in Rhode Island. Development over the next {{century and a half}} led to an automatic mule and to finer and stronger yarn. The <b>ring</b> <b>frame,</b> originating in New England in the 1820s, was little used in Lancashire until the 1890s. It required more energy and could not produce the finest counts.|$|E
25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|E
25|$|About 1900 {{there was}} a high {{incidence}} of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. It was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles when running threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture since the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. By then cotton mules had been superseded by the <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> and the industry was contracting, so it was never established whether these measures were effective.|$|E

2500|$|Adjoining the SRB attach {{fittings}} {{is a major}} <b>ring</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] The loads {{are transferred}} from the fittings to the major <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> which then distributes the tangential loads to the intertank skin.

[...] These adjacent panels {{are made up of}} six stringer-stiffened panels.|$|E
2500|$|The Bodensee, {{designed}} by Paul Jaray, had an innovative hull shape of relatively low fineness ratio, (ratio of length to diameter). This was arrived at after wind-tunnel tests {{conducted at the}} University of GÃ¶ttingen had shown that this would significantly reduce drag. [...] The framework consisted of eleven 17-sided main transverse frames with a secondary <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> in each bay, connected by longitudinal girders [...] with a stiffening keel. [...] The forward-mounted control car was combined with the passenger accommodation and was constructed {{as an integral part}} of the hull structure rather than being suspended beneath it. [...] Passenger accommodation consisted of five compartments seating four people and a VIP cabin for one. An additional six passengers could be carried on wicker chairs in the gangway between the compartments. A galley and toilets were also fitted. It was powered by four [...] Maybach Mb.IVa engines, two in a centrally mounted aft gondola driving a single [...] diameter two-bladed pusher propeller, the other two in a pair of amidships engine cars mounted either side of the hull. These drove [...] two-bladed propellers via a reversing gearbox to enable reverse thrust for manoeuvering when landing.|$|E
5000|$|A major time {{constraint}} was doffing, {{or changing}} the spindles. Three hundred or more spindles {{had to be}} removed, and replaced. The machine had to be stopped while the doffers, who were often very young boys, did this task. The <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> was idle until it was completed. [...] Harold Partington (1906 - 1994) of Chadderton, England, patented a 'Means for Doffing Ring Frames' in September 1953 (US Patent 2,653,440). The machine removed full bobbins from the <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> spindles, and placed empty bobbins onto the spindles in their place; eight spindles at a time. It was traversable along {{the front of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> step by step through successive operations, and thereby reduced the period of stoppage of the <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> as well as reducing the labour required for removing all the filled bobbins on a frame and replacing them with empty bobbins. The Partington autodoffer was developed with assistance from Platt Brothers (Oldham) and worked perfectly in ideal conditions: flat horizontal floor and <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> parallel to the floor and standing vertically. Sadly, these conditions were unobtainable in most Lancashire cotton mills at the time and so the autodoffer did not go into production. The Partington autodoffer was unique and the only one to work properly as an add-on to a <b>ring</b> <b>frame.</b> A more modern mechanical doffer system fitted {{as an integral part of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>frame,</b> reduced the doffing time to 30-35 seconds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ring</b> <b>frame</b> (1929) {{developed}} {{out of the}} Throstle frame (19th century) {{an improvement}} on the Arkwright's Water frame. Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms. Over time, rings became suitable for finer counts and because of cheaper labour costs they replaced mules. By 1950 all mills had converted to the <b>Ring</b> <b>frame.</b> The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.|$|E

50|$|The mill was rebuilt, {{but in a}} new form: as a ring {{spinning}} mill, thus replacing the slower mules with <b>ring</b> <b>frames.</b> Mules still produced the finest spin, {{but that was a}} more niche market, and money was now made with rings. More ring spindles could be operated in the same space. Many mills were converted to <b>ring</b> <b>frames,</b> but the most efficient <b>ring</b> <b>frames</b> required a greater floor height, and the positioning of the floor support pillars (and hence the bay size) needed to be changed in order to achieve the greatest spindle density. The new mill was called the Ellenroad Ring Mill to distinguish it from the former Ellenroad mule mill. The opportunity was also taken to reconfigure the engine. The four-cylinder triple-expansion horizontal engine by J & W McNaught was rebuilt as a twin tandem which would deliver the extra power required by the increased number of spindles.|$|R

50|$|The mule <b>frames</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>frames</b> were {{provided}} by Howard & Bullough, and initially there were 49,000 mule spindles and 26,000 ring spindles, spinning 16s. They had 300/408 mule twist, 208/368 ring twist, 228/428 weft.|$|R

50|$|The {{new method}} was {{compared}} with the self-acting spinning mule which was developed by Richard Roberts using the more advanced engineering techniques in Manchester. The <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> was reliable for coarser counts while Lancashire spun fine counts as well. The <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> was heavier, requiring structural alteration in the mills and needed more power. These were not problems in the antebellum cotton industry in New England. It fulfilled New England's difficulty in finding skilled spinners: skilled spinners were plentiful in Lancashire. In the main the requirements on the two continents were different, and the <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> was not the method of choice for Europe at that moment. Mr Samuel Brooks of Brooks & Doxey Manchester was convinced of {{the viability of the}} method. After a fact-finding tour to the States by his agent Blakey, he started to work on improving the frame. It was still too primitive to compete with the highly developed mule frames, let alone supersede them. He first started on improving the doubling frame, constructing the necessary tooling needed to improve the precision of manufacture. This was profitable and machines offering 180,000 spindle were purchased by a sewing thread manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} from cast iron, and later pressed steel. On {{each side of}} the frame are the spindles, above them are draughting (drafting) rollers and on top is a creel loaded with bobbins of roving. The roving (unspun thread) passes downwards from the bobbins to the draughting rollers. Here the back roller steadied the incoming thread, while the front rollers rotated faster, pulling the roving out and making the fibres more parallel. The rollers are individually adjustable, originally by mean of levers and weights. The attenuated roving now passes through a thread guide that is adjusted to be centred above the spindle. Thread guides are on a thread rail which allows them to be hinged out of the way for doffing or piecing a broken thread. The attenuated roving passes down to the spindle assembly, where it is threaded though a small D ring called the traveller. The traveller moves along the ring. It is this that gives the <b>ring</b> <b>frame</b> its name. From here the thread is attached to the existing thread on the spindle.|$|E

40|$|The use of graphite-composites {{as primary}} {{structure}} {{is essential for}} the development of a cost effective single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle (RLV). A full-scale segment of a graphite-composite intertank was designed and fabricated by an industry team and tested at NASA Langley Research Center as a part of the RLV technology development program. The intertank test component was approximately 3. 0 m long by 6. 7 m wide and included slightly less than a 90 deg section of a cylindrical intertank. The test article was fabricated using graphite-bismaelimide composite material and consisted of a hat-stiffened skin with five <b>ring</b> <b>frames.</b> The stiffeners were secondarily bonded to the panel skin and the <b>ring</b> <b>frames</b> were mechanically attached. The test article was loaded to failure with a uniform compression load applied by 21 individually controlled hydraulic actuators.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{fundamental}} features {{and the control}} mechanism of input mobilities of a complex ship structure by utilizing the well-established finite element analysis method. It is shown that the input mobility of a ship structure due to out-of-plane force and bending moment excitations at the engine mount locations {{is controlled by the}} bending stiffness of engine supports. The frequency averaged input mobility can be represented by that of the corresponding infinite beam. The input mobility due to an in-plane force excitation is bounded by those of the corresponding finite and infinite beams. The torsional moment input mobility can be predicted by the input mobility of the source engine bed section bounded by two consecutive <b>ring</b> <b>frames</b> attributed to the comparatively large in-plane stiffness of the <b>ring</b> <b>frames.</b> It is illustrated that the frequency averaged ship structural response is almost unaffected by neglecting the ship hull and deck plates in the analysis...|$|R
