25|$|From {{his first}} film {{appearance}} in 1935, he worked steadily in Western films, including a large supporting {{role as a}} singing cowboy while still billed as Leonard Slye in a Gene Autry movie. In 1938, Autry demanded more money for his work, {{and there was a}} competition for a new singing cowboy. Many singers sought the job, including Willie Phelps of the Phelps brothers, who appeared in early Western movies. Slye ended up winning the contest and was given the stage name <b>Roy</b> <b>Rogers</b> by Republic Pictures, shortening his first name and combining it with the surname of Will Rogers. He was assigned the leading role in Under Western Stars. Rogers became a matinee idol, a competitor with Autry as the nation's favorite singing cowboy.

Unlike other stars, the vast majority of his leading roles allowed him to play a character with his own name, in the manner of Gene Autry.|$|E

5000|$|Gerard Irwin Nierenberg (27 July 1923 - 19 September 2012) was an American lawyer, author, {{and expert}} in {{negotiation}} and communication strategy. [...] Forbes named Nierenberg “The Father of Negotiation Training” for his exploration of negotiation strategies and tactics {{as well as}} his decades of work disseminating the philosophy that “in a successful negotiation, everybody wins.” [...] He published 22 books on the subject, and in 1966 he founded The Negotiation Institute where he began a legacy of government, corporate, and non-profit organizational reform based on his ideas of how negotiation impacts the lives of everyone. [...] The three core tenets of Nierenberg’s philosophy are (1) to be patient; (2) to strive {{to meet the needs of}} the opposition party in order to build sustainable relationships from which all parties feel that they have 'won'; and (3) to limit frustrations in all negotiations by embracing the fact that logic does not always lead to negotiated success. [...] Nierenberg left a wife, Juliet, with whom he had three sons: <b>Roy,</b> <b>Roger,</b> and George.|$|R
