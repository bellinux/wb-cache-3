40|$|The {{preferred}} {{cooling process}} for household refrigeration appliances is a vapor compression refrigeration process with a capillary tube as expansion device. The vapor compression refrigeration system requires a phase {{change of the}} refrigerant inside the condenser and evaporator. Through a direct connection of condenser outlet and capillary tube inlet, which is commonly practiced for household refrigeration cycles, the condenser outlet defines directly the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Due to unsteady operation conditions the refrigerant state can change from subcooled liquid to saturated liquid with partially a vapor phase at the capillary tube inlet. The refrigerant flow inside the capillary tube is either adiabatic or non-adiabatic (by utilizing internal heat exchange). In both cases the refrigerants state changes during the expansion with an increase of vapor quality towards the capillary tube outlet. A variable vapor quality at the capillary tube inlet causes different flow patterns, especially at the capillary tube outlet. These flow patterns change periodically depending on the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Associated with the periodical changing flow patterns the occurrence of noise effects with the same periodicity and remarkable variations of the sound pressure level can be observed at the capillary tube outlet. Â This paper presents the experimental investigations on the simultaneous occurrence of refrigerant flow patterns and corresponding noise effects at the outlet of a capillary tube installed in a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>test</b> cycle. The discussion of the experimental results leads to an explanation of causal relation between distinguishable flow patterns and corresponding noise effects...|$|E

Isotropicity, drug solubility, viscosity, emulsification time (EMT), drug release, aqueous dilution, postemulsification drug precipitation and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on the coconut oil (CO) and shea butter oil (SBO) -based SEFs. Results showed that only four out of nine batches of the SEFs passed the preformulation isotropicity test. A 100 -mg quantity {{proved to be the}} maximum amount of drug that could be dissolved by the SEFs to form a stable solution. After 72 hrs all the SEFs still retained stability. All of CO SEFs witnessed remarkable phase separation or drug precipitation However, SBO SEFs having oil:surfactant:cosurfactant ratio of 35 : 45 : 20 and containing LOL or LOL-CARB blend lost isotropicity or displayed drug precipitation 6 months later. Refrigeration temperature did not introduce any form of instability or phase separation. Similar viscosities were recorded by the two oil-based SEFs. However, little but inconsistent variation in viscosity was observed between SBO SEFS and LOL-containing SEFs. Aqueous dilution and postemulsification drug precipitation test indicated absence of phase separation and drug precipitation, respectively. Drug-release studies showed that the t 50 of SBO SEFs almost ranked equally with SBO SEFs containing LOL. CO SEFs emulsified at a longer time than those of SBO.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and was awarded by Brunel University. Food retail with large supermarkets consumes significant amounts of energy. The environmental impact is also significant because of the indirect effect from CO 2 emissions at the power stations and due to the direct effect arising from refrigerant leakage to the atmosphere. The application of trigeneration (local combined heat, power and refrigeration) can provide substantial improvements in the overall energy efficiency over the conventional supermarket energy approach of separate provision of electrical power and thermal energy. The use of natural refrigerants such as CO 2 offers the opportunity to reduce the direct impacts of refrigeration compared to conventional systems employing HFC refrigerants that possess high global warming potential. One approach through which the overall energy efficiency can be increased and the environmental impacts reduced, is through the integration of trigeneration and CO 2 refrigeration systems where the cooling generated by the trigeneration system is used to condense the CO 2 refrigerant in a cascade arrangement. This research project investigates experimentally and theoretically, through mathematical modelling and simulation, such a system and its potential application to supermarkets. A small size CO 2 refrigeration system for low and medium food temperature applications was designed and constructed to enable it to be integrated with an existing trigeneration system in the refrigeration laboratory at Brunel University to form an integrated trigeneration and CO 2 <b>refrigeration</b> <b>test</b> facility. Prior to the construction, {{the design of the}} system was investigated using mathematical models developed for this purpose. The simulations included the CO 2 refrigeration system, CO 2 evaporator coils and the integration of the trigeneration and CO 2 refrigeration systems. The physical size of the design and component arrangement was also optimised in a 3 D AutoCAD model. A series of experimental tests were carried out and the results showed that the medium temperature system could achieve a very good COP, ranging from 32 to 60 due to the low pumping power requirement of the liquid refrigerant. The low temperature system performed with average steady state COP of 4, giving an overall refrigeration system COP in the range between 5. 5 and 6. Mathematical models were also developed to investigate the application of the integrated trigeneration and CO 2 refrigeration system in a case study supermarket. The models were validated against test results in the laboratory and manufacturers’ data. The fuel utilisation efficiency and environmental impacts of different trigeneration and CO 2 refrigeration arrangements were also evaluated. The results indicated that a system comprising of a sub-critical CO 2 refrigeration system integrated with a trigeneration system consisting of a micro-turbine based Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit and ammonia-water absorption refrigeration system could provide energy savings of the order of 15 % and CO 2 emission savings of the order of 30 % compared to conventional supermarket energy systems. Employing a trigeneration system with a natural gas engine based CHP and Lithium Bromide-Water sorption refrigeration system, could offer energy savings of 30 % and CO 2 emission savings of 43 % over a conventional energy system arrangement. Economic analysis of the system has shown a promising payback period of just over 3 years compared to conventional systems.

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} aspect of efficient and safe operation of refrigeration and air conditioning systems is superheat control for evaporators. This is conventionally controlled with a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, an expansion valve and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers or more advanced model based control. In this paper we show that superheat can be controlled without a pressure sensor and without {{a model of the}} system. This is achieved by continuous excitation of the system and by applying Fourier analysis, which gives an error signal that can be used together with standard PI control. The proposed method works for systems with ”S ” shaped input/output maps that satisfy sigmoid function properties and such behavior has been identified in both an air conditioning and a <b>refrigeration</b> system. <b>Tests</b> on these systems show that the superheat can be controlled to a low level over a large operating range with only one sensor.

40|$|A new antifog coating made of {{pullulan}} {{is described}} in this work. The antifog properties are {{discussed in terms of}} wettability, surface chemistry/morphology, and by quantitative assessment of the optical properties (haze and transparency) before and after fog formation. The work also presents the results of antifog tests simulating the typical storage conditions of fresh foods. In these tests, the antifog efficiency of the pullulan coating was compared with that of two commercial antifog films, whereas an untreated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film was used as a reference. The obtained results revealed that the pullulan coating behaved as a “wetting enhancer”, mainly due to the low water contact angle (24 °), which in turn can be ascribed to the inherent hydrophilic nature of this polysaccharide, as also suggested by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Unlike the case of untreated LDPE and commercial antifog samples, no discrete water formations (i. e., droplets or stains) were observed on the antifog pullulan coating on <b>refrigeration</b> during <b>testing.</b> Rather, an invisible, continuous and thin layer of water occurred on the biopolymer surface, which was the reason for the unaltered haze and increased transparency, with the layer of water possibly behaving as an antireflection layer. As confirmed by atomic force microscopy analysis, the even deposition of the coating on the plastic substrate compared to the patchy surfacing of the antifog additives in the commercial films is another important factor dictating the best performance of the antifog pullulan coating...|$|R

The blend and R- 22 were tested at saturated evaporator temperature conditions of about {minus} 10 F to {minus} 20 F and saturated condenser temperature conditions from about 80 [...] 100 F. The compressor speed was varied such that evaporator (cooling) capacity was held constant at approximately the same value for both refrigerants for each test condition. To maintain equal capacity, results showed the compressor speed for the blend to be at least 53 % greater than that for R- 22. Measured system efficiency with the blend was at least 25 % better than for R- 22 for near equal operating temperature and capacity conditions. When allowing for maximum impact of the experimental uncertainties, the minimum COP improvement observed for the blend was about 10 %. Ideal cycle calculations using the best available property estimates for the blend and the compressor efficiencies observed during the tests also suggested a 10 % improvement for the blend over R- 22 (almost all due to better isentropic efficiency of the compressor with the blend).

Also, this work proposes a self-organized subspace projection method for RC networks which uses information {{from the beginning of the}} episode to define a cluster to which the episode belongs to. This assigned cluster defines a particular binary input that shifts the operating point of the reservoir to a subspace of trajectories for the duration of the episode.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of environmentally damaging synthetic refrigerants {{due to their}} ODP or GWI potential by natural refrigerants such as CO 2 is now up in the research agenda. Moreover, current energy supply concerns make of efficiency another first priority issue to dictate new stringent design criteria for industrial and commercial equipment. Heat exchangers {{are the most important}} components in refrigeration systems where they are used as evaporators or condensers and their design and operation have a considerable impact on overall system performance. Hence, it is important to better understand their thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour in order to improve their design and operation. Numerical simulation represents a very efficient tool for achieving this objective. In this paper, a new modeling approach, accounting for the heat transfer the hydrodynamics of the problem and intended to predict the dynamic behaviour of a refrigeration coil under dry conditions is proposed. A related FORTRAN program was developed, allowing the study of a large range of complex refrigerant circuit configurations. The equations describing these aspects are strongly coupled, and their decoupling is reached by using an original method of resolution. Circuits may have several inlets, outlets, bifurcations and feed one or several other tubes inlets. The coil was subdivided into several elementary control volumes and its analysis provided detailed information in X, Y and Z directions. Validation was performed with data from a CO 2 secondary <b>refrigeration</b> loop <b>test</b> bench built in CanmetENERGY Laboratories. These data were predicted satisfactorily over the operating range corresponding to refrigeration applications. Exemplary simulations were then performed on an evaporator typically employed in supermarkets, showing the effect of circuiting on operation and performance. Even though circuiting is common practice in refrigeration this simulation shows that care must be exercised in making the selection. A two-circuit configuration was chosen for analysis in this investigation. In terms of capacity and heat transfer, it was shown that the two circuits were well balanced in terms of pressure drop and heat transfer capacity. Low CO 2 pressure drop resulted in reduced temperature glide as compared to a single circuit. Heat exchangers Refrigeration Simulation Carbon dioxide Modeling Circuiting...|$|R
40|$|When {{released}} into the atmosphere, traditional refrigerants contribute to climate change several orders of magnitude more than a corresponding amount of carbon dioxide. For that reason, an increasing amount of interest {{has been paid to}} transcritical vapor compression systems in recent years, which use carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. Vapor compression systems also impact the environment through their consumption of energy. This can be greatly increased by faulty operation. Automated techniques for detecting and diagnosing faults have been widely tested for subcritical systems, but have not been applied to transcritical systems. These methods can involve either dynamic analysis of the vapor compression cycle or a variety of algorithms based on steady state behavior. In this thesis, the viability of dynamic fault detection is tested in relation to that of static fault detection for a transcritical <b>refrigeration</b> system. Step <b>tests</b> are used to determine that transient behavior does not give additional useful information. The same tests are performed on a subcritical air-conditioner showing little value in dynamic fault detection. A static component based method of fault detection which has been applied to subcritical systems is also tested for all pairings of four faults: over/undercharge, evaporator fouling, gas cooler fouling, and compressor valve leakage. This technique allows for low cost measurement and independent detection of individual faults even when multiple faults are present. Results of this method are promising and allow distinction between faulty and fault-free behavior...|$|R
40|$|Thermo King as a {{supplier}} of {{mobile refrigeration equipment}} is interested in {{more information about the}} airflow distribution inside a refrigerated trailer in various loading conditions to optimise the performance of the refrigeration units. A more efficient way and/or more uniform way of keeping the internal environment inside the refrigerated box at the required conditions will increase the quality of the cargo as well as causing less damage to the environment. The objective of this project is to develop a testing environment that makes it possible to conduct airflow tests for the purpose of learning more about the internal airflow of a trailer. This test environment will be {{in the form of an}} hydraulic transparent test rig representing a scaled model o f a <b>refrigeration</b> system. The <b>test</b> environment must be able to simulate multiple unit configurations in the form of different airflow volumes, and different configurations of air inlet and outlet positions. Different cargo configurations inside the trailer will be used to simulate different types of loads. Secondly, advice and recommendations on the improvement of airflow as well as ideas for further research will be discussed. It is recommended that the project be continued by future researchers to obtain more extensive results from the simulation environment developed and created during this project. Real flow investigation and improvement in airflow distribution should be developed and tested to enable Thermo King to make a more efficient, competitive and more environmentally friendly refrigeration unit...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{use of a}} three-pipe {{distribution}} system is known to impair the operating costs of an air conditioning system. Additional costs are encountered because heating water and cooling water are mixed in a common return pipe after use by the various air conditioning units. This investigation covers the design and installation of an automatic temperature control system to operate a heat pump air conditioning system utilizing a three-pipe {{distribution system}}. The investigation also was directed toward {{the study of the}} economics of the three-pipe system while in use providing heating and cooling to an industrial plant. The experiment was performed with a centrifugal refrigeration compressor heat pump of 497 tons of <b>refrigeration</b> capacity. <b>Tests</b> were conducted at outside air temperatures of 42, 51. 5, and 53 °F. During each test, heating water flow, cooling water flow, heating supply water temperature, cooling supply water temperature, common return water temperature, and cooling return water temperature were measured. Sufficient data were recorded, during each test, to determine the heating load, cooling load, and operating penalty due to the mixed flow condition in the common return. These results were correlated with outside temperature occurrence data to determine the additional annual operating cost encountered because of the use of a three-pipe system. The additional annual owning cost of a conventional four-pipe system above that of the three-pipe system was determined. This cost included items for depreciation, interest, and taxes. A comparison between the annual owning and operating costs of the three-pipe system and the four-pipe system was made. It was determined that the three-pipe system installed in the particular industrial plant investigated exhibits a cost approximately one-third of that of the conventional system used for comparison. It was determined that the three-pipe system would become relatively less costly to own and operate if applied to a system with similar loads in all areas, if used with a heat pump system, and if used with a system employing final heat transfer elements selected for as high a water temperature drop or rise as possible. The three-pipe system would become relatively more costly to own and operate if the system piping runs were short, if the individual air conditioning units were larger, and if a system employing separate heating and cooling sources was used...|$|R
40|$|Small and micro-enterprises play a {{significant}} part in most economies, whether developed or developing. However, in developing countries these enterprises {{have tended to be}} looked at from a development, or poverty alleviation perspective, rather than as entrepreneurial activities and potentially growing businesses. This paper presents {{the first step in a}} longitudinal study of a group of micro entrepreneurs in Mozambique from an entrepreneurship perspective rather than a development one. Mozambique lies along the Indian Ocean sea border of Southern Africa and is characterised by mountainous inland zones with a coastal plain. As a result of war and natural disasters over a prolonged period, there is little industry, primary industries are primitive and there is virtually no infrastructure. Mozambique is ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world. The purpose of this paper is to document the activities of a group of micro-entrepreneurs in Beira, in Central Mozambique, who received micro-financing to establish or grow their micro-enterprises and to examine these enterprises in terms of their potential for long term success. The first series of interviews with the entrepreneurs at their place of work has been conducted with a second round planned for later in 2006. This process itself offered many challenges, as did identifying the commonalities between enterprises in the developed world and enterprises entered into for largely survival reasons, that had no access to basic services such as electricity, running water, <b>refrigeration</b> and transport. <b>Testing</b> well documented indicators of success in this context highlights interesting differences and identifies others that may or may not be relevant in a different context...|$|R
