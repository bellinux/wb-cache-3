One of the causes for these hospital stays is the lack of residential facilities willing to accept these patients after they leave the hospital.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the research is due to intense changes in the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> market in Ukraine and as result {{is determined by the}} fact, that Ukraine is in decline of development of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agencies.</b> This situation occurs due to different problems. Firstly, rapid market decline is under the general economic crisis pressure and reducing of purchasing capacity. Another one is an ability to buy, sale or rent the property without any help of a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agent. In such conditions <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> should do their best to change situation. One of the ways to solve the problem is using traditional and additional services, business jurisdictions in complex which allow increasing the competitiveness of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> in precarious conditions of Ukraine...|$|R

2500|$|After the vote, {{alderman}} Joni Painter discovered {{from the}} school website that Fruin {{was a member of}} the CCHS Board of Trustees, an interest not previously disclosed. Council members also learned that CCHS could renew the lease for its current practice field for up to another fifteen years. Fruin and CCHS principal Sean Foster stated they had believed the contract could not be renewed past 2015. [...] Mayor Tari Renner refused to sign-off on the approval pending an attorney general opinion on whether any conflict of interest law or ordinance was violated. Fruin stated he would defer to the attorney general and that did not believe there was a conflict of interest because trustees serve only an advisory role. A Pantagraph editorial later suggested several other potential conflicts of interest: the Deneen family - who donated land for the new school building - were stakeholders in the development firm from which the land would be purchased, Fruin's <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agency</b> - Coldwell Banker - was to oversee the transaction though he would have no role, and CCHS football coach Mike Moews is the brother of city parks superintendent Bobby Moews.|$|E

2500|$|To avoid over {{development}} the Gibneys {{had a series}} of deed restrictions placed on the selling of their land. The deed restricted the property to a one family dwelling. In order to preserve the perfect and natural beauty of the land, the placement of any structure had to be pre-approved by the Gibneys. The Gibneys also placed deed restrictions that prohibited the rental of the property. [...] Also, in their deed, they had the right to repurchase the property if and when the Oppenheimers wanted to sell the land. This first right of refusal was {{the most important part of}} the deed to the Gibneys. At first, the Gibney's deed did not seem to restrict the Oppenheimers, but they began renting their vacation cottage, soon after it was built, through the local <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>agency.</b> The Gibneys disapproved, and the Oppenheimers argued against the Gibneys and said that the tenants they were renting to were “just friends of theirs”. When Robert Oppenheimer died, Kitty began construction on a second building. Once again, the Gibneys protested and Kitty pleaded that this building was, “just a tool shed”. [...] The so-called “tool shed” was built on the property line between the Gibneys and the Oppenheimers, and was too close to the beach according to the Gibneys. That Christmas, both of the buildings built by the Oppenheimers were rented out to, “just friends”. The friendly relationship between the Gibneys and the Oppenheimers ended. A number of lawsuits followed, [...] and the police were called to intervene on several occasions.|$|E

The incumbent was appointed by the county court, which consisted of five members. My opponent had the advantage of birth over me (he was a citizen by adoption) and carried off the prize. I now withdrew from the co-partnership with Boggs, and, in May, 1860, removed to Galena, Illinois, and took a clerkship in my father's store.|$|E
