Antoine Lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777. Bone ash was {{the major source of}} phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a <b>retort.</b> <b>Carbon</b> monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack.|$|E
40|$|The {{two methods}} of {{processing}} synthetic crude from organic marlstone in demonstration or small-scale commercial {{status in the}} U. S. are in situ extraction and surface retorting. The considerable uncertainty surrounding the technological characterization, resource characterization, and choice of the system boundary for oil shale operations indicate that oil shale is only a minor net energy producer if one includes internal energy (energy in the shale that is used during the process) as an energy cost. The energy return on investment (EROI) for either of these methods is roughly 1. 5 : 1 for the final fuel product. The inclusions or omission of internal energy is a critical question. If only external energy (energy diverted from the economy to produce the fuel) is considered, EROI appears to be much higher. In comparison, fuels produced from conventional petroleum show overall EROI of approximately 4. 5 : 1. “At the wellhead” EROI is approximately 2 : 1 for shale oil (again, considering internal energy) and 20 : 1 for petroleum. The low EROI for oil shale leads to a significant release of greenhouse gases. The large quantities of energy needed to process oil shale, combined with the thermochemistry of the <b>retorting</b> process, produce <b>carbon</b> dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Oil shale unambiguously emits more greenhouse gases than conventional liquid fuels from crude oil feedstocks {{by a factor of}} 1. 2 to 1. 75. Much of the discussion regarding the EROI for oil shale should be regarded as preliminary or speculative due to the very small number of operating facilities that can be assessed. shale oil; EROI; in situ production; surface retorting; petroleum...|$|R
