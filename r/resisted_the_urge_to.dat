5000|$|To the {{government}} at Versailles, the Captain next proposed {{a variant of the}} Portsmouth attack plan— making raids on less well-defended British coastal towns. This was seen as a good fit with plans for a full-scale invasion, serving as a very useful diversion. Beginning in spring 1759, a new squadron was prepared at Dunkirk, led again by the Maréchal de Belle-Isle, with four other frigates: Begon (Capt. Grieux), Blonde (Capt. La Kayce), Terpsichore (Capt. Defrauaudais) & Faucon; a corvette, Amarante; and a little reconnaissance vessel, the Faucon. Simultaneously, large numbers of troop-carrying barges were prepared at both Dunkirk and Le Havre for the main invasion, and a war fleet assembled at Brest. Recruiting was initially very slow, as the British had {{had a great deal of}} success against the Dunkirk privateers in the early years of the war; also Thurot had legal problems over money he owed in Holland. Intelligence reports suggested that the squadron was to attack the Hanoverian town of Stade and link with French forces pushing northward, but the latter were defeated at Minden on 1 August. The plan then seems to have been changed, with a proposal that Thurot should ferry Bonnie Prince Charlie to Scotland, to arouse a new Jacobite rebellion; it seems the Prince did not like this idea, and at one point it was suggested that an imitator could be sent instead. Finally, with news arriving that the fleet assembling at Le Havre was being bombarded to destruction by the British, and that the French Mediterranean fleet had been defeated by the Royal Navy at Lagos Bay off the Portuguese coast, it was decided that any diversion from the main invasion in south-west England would be useful. In the last week of August, the squadron, with some 1300 infantry troops led by Brigadier General Flobert crammed in alongside the sailors, moved from the harbour at Dunkirk to stand just offshore, ready to sail at a few hours' notice. The British were most concerned with the main fleet at Brest, which they believed would now be used to invade Wales or western Scotland, but a Royal Navy squadron under Commodore William Boys was also blockading Dunkirk. On 5 September, the squadron was ordered to depart, but could not get past the blockade. This was not entirely unpleasant for François, as on 15 September his wife Henriette bore him a daughter, Cécile-Henriette, his only known child. Eventually, after a storm blew the British ships off-station, Thurot's squadron got away on 15 October and spent the next night at Ostend, dropping off a cheeky letter to the Belgian press, announcing that they were heading northward. Gale-force winds then drove the squadron rapidly northward, a fact which appeared to be confirmed by another letter published in the Brussels Gazette, dated 21 October, allegedly from aboard the Belle-Isle. Royal Navy ships had already been diverted by Boys from the Dunkirk blockade to defend the Scottish coast, though the British <b>resisted</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> arrest Jacobite clan chiefs in Scotland, on the grounds that most of the best Scottish fighters were already serving overseas with the British Army. The British press tried to make light of the situation:"EPIGRAM on THUROT's Squadron.Conflans, de la Clue, and such great Men as those,We send Hawke and Boscawen (great Men) to oppose;When Thurot's small Squadron this Island annoys,We think it sufficient to send only Boys !" ...|$|E

40|$|Welcome to this mini book! When I started this, I {{had in mind}} a set of Tarot sized {{cards with}} about 50 (ish) cards of {{teaching}} tips for librarians – a mix of general tips and actual interventions that could be dropped into a teaching session. I thought people could dip into the deck, or perhaps pull their favourite few to the front to refer to again. After writing a (rather expensive) book in the past of Active Learning ideas, I was concerned that these cards should not only be easy to dip into and pull out your favourites, but as affordable as possible too! Unfortunately at the sort of volumes I was expecting to sell, large playing cards seemed more expensive than I’d like to pass onto you, the reader. Hence this little book! The pages are roughly {{the same size as}} the cards would have been, but cost a fraction of the amount to print. I hope that explains the layout! I’ve pretty much kept to the restrictions of one small page per tip (with very few exceptions) and <b>resisted</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> waffle and expand unnecessarily! I hope everything is still clear despite the briefness, or at least clear enough to encourage further reading and idea generation of your own. So dip into the following pages to find about half the pages containing general tips and definitions, and half the pages giving brief descriptions of ideas you could use in your own teaching. Some are old favourites, some you might not have seen before, but hopefully all useful to some of you...|$|E
40|$|What’s {{the point}} of a {{citizenship}} test once the cramming schools get in on the act, asks PETER MARES ONE certain outcome of citizenship tests is that they spawn new products in the education market: cram schools and training kits to help prospective citizens prepare for the exam. This is evident in Britain, where a citizenship test was established in 2005, two years earlier than Australia’s test. With a little googling you can find the website of the Citizenship Training School-UK. “Do you want a British passport or indefinite visa?” asks the site. CTS-UK provides “a crash course which lasts for a period of no longer than five days” and includes “full training based on the exam and a short easy assessment which is carried out by independent examiners [...] . accredited by the Home Office. ” An oral exam lasts about ten minutes and is conducted at CTS-UK’s office. You get your results the following Tuesday morning and if you’re successful you receive a certificate “approved” by the Home Office. With this certificate you can apply for your British passport or indefinite visa. The website says the CTS-UK course is aimed at people whose English levels are “very low” and the company claims a 99. 9 per cent success rate. It spruiks its courses as the cheapest in the UK, and while there are no prices on the site, a classified ad from the same company on eBay puts the cost at £ 180. (It does not say whether this includes the £ 34 application fee to sit the UK citizenship test.) Perhaps CTS-UK is truly committed, as it says on the website, to “serving the community and enhancing integration within localities all over the UK. ” But even if we give the company the benefit of the doubt, the idea of a £ 180, five day cram course with a 99. 9 per cent success rate undercuts the Home Office’s stated intention of “creating a new, more meaningful, way of becoming a citizen in an effort to help people integrate and share in British values and traditions. ” I’m not aware of any citizenship cram schools having set up physically in Australia, but there are certainly products on the web aimed specifically at the Australian market. The Cititest website (which my computer protection software warned me it was a “high risk” site) is hosted in the United States and owned by someone in Vancouver Canada called Denis Kornev. For AUD$ 20 it offers a “Complete training kit” for the Australian citizenship test. Alternatively there are “Australian Citizenship Test Practice Questions” for $ 14. 95 and “Australian Citizenship Test Practice Questions - Advanced Level” for $ 12. 95. Payment can be made via Visa, Mastercard or Paypal. 	The website provides online training, printable practice questions in PDF format and a free evaluation. “All questions are separated into four categories, and five difficulty levels. Who was Australia’s first Prime Minister? What was the Snowy Mountains Scheme? The name of the Captain Cook’s ship? Australia’s national gemstone? These and many more questions can be found on Cititest. ” The site offers a 100 % money back guarantee if you fail the citizenship test (as long as the test is taken “not earlier than 5 and not later than 90 days” after purchase) and there is a special offer: pass the test and send a photo of yourself holding your citizenship certificate and your $ 20 will be cheerfully refunded. There is a gallery of mug shots of previous happy customers to prove that the offer is genuine (though the fine print reveals that the offer expired on 1 March 2008). 	I registered with Cititest and clicked the “test yourself” button, which asked me questions like whether Phar Lap was the “greatest cricket batsman of all time, lit the flame at the Melbourne Olympics or won the Melbourne Cup?” This question rated as “high difficulty”: Australian values include: a. Judeo Christian ethics b. Buddist (sic) principles c. support for absolute monarchy d. quest for conformity I <b>resisted</b> <b>the</b> <b>urge</b> <b>to</b> tick box (d) and completed the test with a perfect score. I then received the following message: “Congratulations. You are very well prepared. You answered correctly 8 questions out of 8. We still recommend you get our practice questions advanced level just to be sure. ” I then took a step up and sat the free online test of 35 questions dealing with Australia’s system of government. This time I failed to get a perfect score. When asked “who appoints the Governor General?” I nominated the prime minister rather than the Queen. (I guess it’s a question of semantics since it was Kevin Rudd not HM Elizabeth II who announced that Quentin Bryce would be the next incumbent at Yarralumla.) The Cititest website does not only cater for those seeeking Australian citizenship. Clicking back to the root of the site at [URL] reveals that it is also possible to buy a “Complete Training Kit” for the UK, Canadian, US, French and Danish citizenship tests (all with the same money back guarantee and expired promise of a full refund for successful purchasers who send in a citizenship photo). Further research reveals that the helpful Vancouver based Denis Kornev also runs sites under other names - like [URL] which offers training for the “Life in the UK Test” and has pages in Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. Does it matter if a few people make a buck out of citizenship tests? Perhaps not. But this kind of website does make a mockery of the test and its supposed aims. If the process of gaining Australian citizenship is reduced to a crash course in ticking the right boxes, then by introducing a test, we risk losing far more than we have gained. • Peter Mares is an adjunct research fellow at the Institute for Social Research, Swinburne University of Technology Photo: Brian Palmer/iStockphoto. co...|$|E
