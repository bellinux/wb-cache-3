5|$|Dentition is the {{key feature}} by which fossil <b>rodents</b> are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of <b>rodents</b> and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; <b>rodents</b> and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular clock data suggest modern <b>rodents</b> (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are {{in agreement with the}} fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, a {{minority}} scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs, such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, are not <b>rodents</b> {{and should be}} reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to lagomorphs). Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of <b>rodents</b> as monophyletic is justified.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult <b>rodents</b> have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult <b>rodents</b> consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult <b>rodents</b> fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult <b>rodents</b> partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

Multivariate tests for the effects of fire on <b>rodent</b> communities showed significant differences in <b>rodent</b> community structure in coastal sage scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetation types. Overall, the <b>rodent</b> communities in the burned habitats were much more similar to each other than to <b>rodent</b> communities in the unburned habitats.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide <b>rodent</b> pests are of {{significant}} economic and health importance. Controlling <b>rodent</b> pests will, therefore, not only benefit food security but also {{human and animal}} health. While <b>rodent</b> pests are most often chemically controlled, there is increased interest in biological control through avian predation. A rich body of research has addressed the impact of avian predators on wild <b>rodent</b> populations, but {{little is known about}} the effectiveness of avian predators as biological control agents of <b>rodent</b> pests in agricultural systems. In this study, we systematically reviewed research that investigated different aspects of avian predation on <b>rodent</b> pest populations in order to increase our understanding of the impact and effectiveness of avian predation on <b>rodent</b> pests. Several avian predators (Tyto alba, Elanus axillaris Falco tinnunculus, F. cenchroides, Bubo bengalensis, Buteo rufinus) were commonly cited in the biological control of rodents; however, barn owls (T. alba) are the most cited species (86 % of studies). We found some support that the use of avian predators produced positive, measurable effects where increased presence of avian predators tended to lower <b>rodent</b> pest numbers, resulting in lower crop damage. However, our review highlighted several shortcomings related to research on avian predation of <b>rodent</b> pests. First, research concerning <b>rodent</b> pest control through avian predation was limited (1. 86 articles per year). Secondly, we found that studies lack statistical rigor to detect and measure change in <b>rodent</b> pest species abundance. Finally, the majority of studies were short term and therefore not able to evaluate long term sustainable <b>rodent</b> pest population suppression. We suggest that current shortcomings could be adequately addressed with control-treatment studies that quantitatively investigate the effects of avian predation on <b>rodent</b> pest populations and agricultural impact. Such research could help develop recommendations regarding the use of avian predators in <b>rodent</b> pest management...|$|R

5|$|<b>Rodents</b> {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of <b>rodents</b> carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. <b>Rodents</b> {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rodents</b> {{are thought}} to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were {{severely}} affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, <b>rodents</b> and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of <b>rodents</b> and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of <b>rodents</b> in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with <b>rodents</b> with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>rodents</b> {{arrived in}} Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago. Although {{marsupials}} {{are the most}} prominent mammals in Australia, many <b>rodents,</b> all belonging to the subfamily Murinae, are among the continent's mammal species. There are about fifty species of 'old endemics', {{the first wave of}} <b>rodents</b> to colonize the country in the Miocene and early Pliocene, and eight true rat (Rattus) species of 'new endemics', arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The earliest fossil <b>rodents</b> in Australia have a maximum age of 4.5 million years, and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification. A further wave of adaptive radiation occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later.|$|E

40|$|None of the {{so-called}} developing countries has an adequate <b>rodent</b> control program at present. In {{only a few of}} these countries is any <b>rodent</b> control research occurring despite the fact that <b>rodent</b> problems are actually quite serious in many regions and potentially so in others. Expertise, techniques and materials from the developed countries are of limited usefulness because of major differences in <b>rodent</b> species involved, standards for food handling and sanitation, and in the cultural contexts in which <b>rodent</b> control must occur. Trained personnel, both for control work and the basic research needed, are in very short supply. In addition, <b>rodent</b> control is frequently a low priority item in the generally meager budgets of developing countries.

This paper presents field results and then discusses the successes and failures of three <b>rodent</b> control experiences based on ecological knowledge. The <b>rodent</b> control experiences discussed here are the following: 1) chemical control combined with environmental management in a shantytown, 2) reduction of vegetation height along farm perimeters and chemical control in poultry sheds, and 3) prevention of <b>rodent</b> reinfestation using physical barriers in poultry sheds. In the first two experiments <b>rodent</b> infestation decreased in the treated areas, althought in the shantytown infestations levels increased 90 days after the last application of rodenticide. In the third experiment the variation in <b>rodent</b> infestation was similar in sheds with and without physical barriers. A combination of rodenticide application and environmental management reduced <b>rodent</b> abundance...|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Rodent</b> pests {{severely}} affect crop production, {{particularly in}} monocultures where {{one or two}} <b>rodent</b> pest species dominate. We predict higher species richness of native small mammal species in more heterogeneous mosaic (crop–fallow–bush) subsistence agro-ecosystems in Africa. Conservation and agro-ecological imperatives require that such diverse natural communities should be maintained and may benefit crop protection through limiting domination of pest species. Ecologically based rodent-management alternatives to rodenticides are urgently required and one such method (community trapping) is herein advocated. Aims: To provide baseline information on <b>rodent</b> and shrew communities in agro-ecosystems in three African countries and to demonstrate efficacy of ecologically based <b>rodent</b> management (EBRM) in Africa (e. g. community household trapping). Methods: Removal-trapping {{in a variety of}} agro-ecological habitats provided accurate small-mammal species lists. Intensive kill-trapping by rural agricultural communities was carried out experimentally where the efforts of communities were scientifically monitored by kill-trapping to measure impact on <b>rodent</b> numbers and the levels of post-harvest damage to stored grains. Key results: Our study revealed a high diversity of endemic species in agricultural habitats in Tanzania and Namibia (but not Swaziland) and the existence of undescribed and possibly rare species, some of which may be at risk of extinction from unchecked habitat transformation for agriculture. Treatment-control studies showed that communities in three African countries could effectively reduce pest <b>rodent</b> populations and <b>rodent</b> damage by intensive trapping on a daily basis in and around the community. Conclusions: Community trapping reduced pest <b>rodent</b> populations and damage to stored grains. Unlike the use of indiscriminate rodenticide, this practice is expected to have a negligible effect on beneficial non-target <b>rodent</b> and shrew species. Implications: Ecologically based <b>rodent</b> management approaches such as community trapping will conserve beneficial non-pest <b>rodent</b> communities and ultimately improve crop protection...|$|R

40|$|International {{regulatory}} and pharmaceutical industry scientists are discussing {{revision of the}} International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S 1 guidance on <b>rodent</b> carcinogenicity assessment of small molecule pharmaceuticals. A weight-of-evidence approach is proposed to determine the need for <b>rodent</b> carcinogenicity studies. For compounds with high human cancer risk, the product may be labeled appropriately without conducting <b>rodent</b> carcinogenicity studies. For compounds with minimal cancer risk, only a 6 -month transgenic mouse study (rasH 2 mouse or p 53 þ/ mouse) or a 2 -year mouse study would be needed. If <b>rodent</b> carcino-genicity testing may add significant value to cancer risk assessment, a 2 -year rat study and either a 6 -month transgenic mouse or a 2 -year mouse study is appropriate. In many cases, therefore, one <b>rodent</b> carcinogenicity study could be sufficient. The rasH 2 model predicts neoplastic findings relevant to human cancer risk assessment as well as 2 -year <b>rodent</b> models, produces fewer irrelevant neoplastic outcomes, and often will be preferable to a 2 -year <b>rodent</b> study.
