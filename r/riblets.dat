2500|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The conical, scalar, umbilicate, whitish {{shell is}} moderately large for the genus with {{a height of}} 4.5mm, [...] It contains seven whorls. The nucleus is wanting. The upper whorls are eroded, the lower ones each contain three spiral lirae, of which the upper one runs at a little distance from the shallow but distinct suture, which is slightly undulate. From the first liration to the second, the shell is slightly convex, this latter liration is strong, prominent and divides the whorls in two subequal parts. Below this liration the shell is concave towards the basal or peripheral liration, which in the upper whorls, runs just in the suture {{and in the last}} one borders the basal surface. These lirations are slightly spinous. Distinct undulating plications run {{from one to the other}} of the lower lirae, with the convex side towards the aperture On the upper part they are directed in an opposite way, being less distinct about halfway the interspace between the upper and median liration. Moreover, the whole shell is covered with much weaker striae, having the character of growth striae and traces of more remote spiral striae. The basal face of the shell is subconvex, but quite flat in the centre, with a shallow groove between the peripheral keel and the first of the basal lirae, this space is rather smooth, though crossed by plicae running from the peripheral spipes in an oblique direction. The outermost of the basal lirae, which is not broad, is followed by two similar ones, about as strong as their interstices, the central ones, five in number, increasing in breadth towards the centre, (one of them nearly double) being larger than the interstices These lirae are connected by small radiating <b>riblets</b> in the interstices. The umbilicus is bordered by a liration, consisting of a row of subquadrate beads This umbilicus is pervious and funnel-shaped. Its wall is radiately striated and has one faint spiral rib. The aperture is rounded-subquadrate. Its right margin is incomplete, its columellar margin is curved, with a denticle in the basal part. It is slightly reflected over the umbilicus. The interior of the shell is nacreous, (the nacreous texture of the inner layers is clearly visible on some of the exterior ...|$|E

The available experimental facilities, instrumentation (i. e. hotwire) and measurement techniques (i. e. velocity spectra) have been employed to investigate the boundary layer velocity profiles and skin friction for flat plate and Serrate-Semi-Circular <b>riblet</b> surfaces.

Hot-wire data show that a single, isolated thin-element <b>riblet</b> causes formation of counter-rotating vortex-pairs with a spanwise wavelength of 130 viscous lengths. Abrupt shifts in turbulence intensity magnitude and peak location are observed for streamwise <b>riblet</b> arrays as spanwise <b>riblet</b> spacing is varied. Direct drag measurements show net drag reduction (up to 8. 5 percent) {{over a wide range}} of <b>riblet</b> spacings along with behavior at discrete non-dimensional spacings indicative of vortex activity. Overall, the data suggest that more than one drag reduction mechanism may be involved...|$|R

Experiments on bare as well as on clad sheets were conducted at an ultrasonic frequency of around 20 kHz with fully reversed axial loading (R = − 1). While for bare material the <b>riblet</b> structure reduces lifetime by around one order of magnitude, the clad material is not negatively affected by the surface structure. The threshold for fatigue failure of clad material is governed by the remaining thickness of the cladding below the <b>riblet</b> structure.

50|$|<b>Riblets</b> are {{prepared}} by butchers by cutting {{a full set}} of spare ribs approximately in half. This produces a set of short, flat ribs where the curved part of the rib is removed and gives them a more uniform look. Loin back ribs don't always have this removed. When not removed they have a rounded look to them and are often referred to as baby back ribs. Another product (imprecisely) called <b>riblets</b> is actually the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. <b>Riblets</b> used to be thrown out by butchers, but have become popular due to their excellent flavor and lower cost.|$|E

With the property of low drag and self-cleaning (antifouling), shark skin inspired <b>riblet</b> surfaces can also be used on navigation objects. In this paper, different marine drag reduction technologies are discussed, and a review of <b>riblet</b> performance studies is also given. Experimental parameters include <b>riblet</b> geometry, continuous and segmented configurations, fluid velocity (laminar and turbulent flow), fluid viscosity (water, oil and gas), and wettability are analyzed. However, force is obtained by area-weighted integral of shear stress distributions. So area of <b>riblet</b> surfaces is a crucial factor which has not been considered in many previous studies.

40|$|Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is {{performed}} to analyze systematically the variation of <b>riblet</b> geometry on the near-wall properties and flow structures. As a start, a standard V-groove <b>riblet</b> shape with sizes spanning both drag-reducing and drag-increasing regimes, are considered. These simulations in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow domain are conducted at two bulk Reynolds numbers, Rem = 1842 and 2800. The simulation results reveal intricate influences of different <b>riblet</b> configurations on the near-wall flow field. The amplification of cross-flow velocity fluctuation components constitutes {{an important role}} in degrading the drag reduction performance at large <b>riblet</b> sizes. The considerable rise in cross-flow fluctuations is traced to the motions of vortices residing in the grooves. Also, the rise in wall-normal velocity fluctuations causes the appearance of streaky patterns on the instantaneous wall-normal velocity field, and a second peak on the Reynolds stress profile. In addition, instantaneous flow reversal in the grooves is found to be closely related to spanwise-oriented vortical structures forming near the <b>riblet</b> tips. Lastly, new correlations capturing the changes in the flow field with the <b>riblet</b> size are proposed and assessed using the available results...|$|R
