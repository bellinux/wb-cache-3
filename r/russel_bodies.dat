40|$|We {{present the}} case of an 80 –year–old man who was {{admitted}} for anemia, back pain and progressive weakness. After a workup of clinical and laboratory data, the final diagnosis was multiple myeloma. The bone marrow aspirate revealed 53 % myeloma cells with peculiar and rare morphological features: numerous large asurophilic–bright red granules – mucopolizaccharides and immunoglobulins secreted and accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, typically known as <b>Russel</b> <b>bodies...</b>|$|E
40|$|Secretory {{defects in}} {{abnormal}} plasma cells, called Mott cells, {{that appear in}} lymphoid tissues of spontaneously autoimmune, "viable motheaten" (mev/mev) mice lead to deposition of immunoglobulin in RER- bound vesicles. Such vesicles have been termed <b>Russel</b> <b>bodies.</b> Cells with <b>Russel</b> <b>bodies</b> can also be observed rarely in normal animals, usually {{as a result of}} extreme antigenic loads or pathologic states. To understand why these abnormal cells appear commonly in mev/mev mice, we have established a panel of hybridomas that contain Russell bodies. Using immunochemical analysis and immunoelectron microscopy, we have characterized the secretory defects. Although these hybridoma cells synthesize a normal size heavy chain and it associates with light chain, the Russell bodies have many characteristics of inclusion bodies, which commonly appear in cells synthesizing mutant proteins and often are associated with incompletely or abnormally folded proteins. Pulse-chase experiments showed that immunoglobulins synthesized by these hybridomas accumulate rapidly into insoluble complexes and have an intracellular half life approximately 10 time greater than normal immunoglobulins. The defect affected only the immunoglobulin derived from the mev/mev mice and did not affect the secretion of normal immunoglobulin produced by an IgG 1 -secreting fusion partner. In addition to accumulating intracellular immunoglobulins, many mutant cell lines also secreted immunoglobulin. Endoglycosidase H digestion was used to determine the state of processing of the N-linked carbohydrates on the immunoglobulin molecules. This analysis demonstrated that the N-linked carbohydrates on the secreted immunoglobulin were resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion, indicating that they were processed normally. The insoluble IgM molecules were sensitive to endoglycosidase H, which is consistent with their localization to the RER. We propose several models by which these abnormal immunoglobulin-secreting cells commonly appear in this autoimmune mutant mouse...|$|E
40|$|Descreve-se a ocorrência de infecção pelo vírus sincicial respiratório bovino (BRSV) em bezerros descendentes de animais das raças pardo-suíça e holandesa importados da Alemanha, Áustria, Suíça e Uruguai, na qual morreram em Alagoas, Brasil, pelo menos 220 cabeças, de 1995 até a presente data. O quadro clínico caracterizou-se por hipertermia, tosse seca, mais tarde dispnéia acentuada e por vezes lacrimejamento; à auscultação havia estertores secos, depois úmidos, com sibilos, muitas vezes audíveis à distância. O exame histológico revelou {{pneumonia}} intersticial com formação de células sinciciais, infiltração predominantemente linfocitária com presença de eosinófilos e de corpúsculos de Russel, proliferação de pneumócitos tipo II e leve metaplasia escamosa. Células epiteliais de bronquíolos e células sinciciais marcaram-se positivamente com o anticorpo anti-BRSV. A ocorrência da enfermidade no Sul e agora no Nordeste do Brasil indica a necessidade de se promover um amplo levantamento epidemiológico para se avaliar o grau de perdas e a proporção de animais infectados no país. Lembramos que parte dos animais importados, ao que tudo indica, já estavam infectados nos países de origem, quando desembarcaram em Belém, Pará. Cases of bovine {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (BRSV) infection affecting calves in the State of Alagoas, Brazil, are described. At least 220 calves, {{which were}} the progeny of Brown Swiss and Holstein Friesian cattle imported from Germany, Austria, and Uruguay, have died from the disease since 1995. Clinical signs included fever, dry cough, serous ocular discharge and, towards the final stages, marked dyspnea. On auscultation there were loud and harsh breathing sounds, and a strong wheezing could be heard from a distance. Histopathology of the lung revealed interstitial pneumonia associated with syncytial cells and infiltration by lymphocytes and eosinophils. A few plasma cells containing <b>Russel</b> <b>bodies</b> in their cytoplasm were also observed. There was hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes and mild squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium. Bronchiolar epithelial cells and syncytial cells were positively stained with anti-BRSV antibody. The finding of BRSV infection in calves in Northeast Brazil plus identical findings already reported from South Brazil, strongly indicate {{the need for a}} wide epidemiologic survey in order to evaluate the losses due to BRSV infection and the incidence of infected cattle. There is evidence that {{at least part of the}} imported animals involved in this outbreak was already infected on arrival at the port of Belém, in the State of Pará, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Sixty skin biopsies of fifty-eight {{non-treated}} {{patients with}} cutaneous leishmaniasis from Nicaragua were studied. Biopsies were classified according to Ridley's histopathologic groups: 36 (60 %) {{were included in}} group B (diffuse necrosis), 14 in group C (focal necrosis), 7 (11. 6 %) in group D (reactive tuberculoid). Only three biopsies remained unclassified. None of our cases could be included in groups A and E. Immunohistochemistry disclosed in 17 cases <b>Russel's</b> <b>bodies</b> secreting IgM and only one IgG positive. There was no correlation between the histopathologic groups {{and the presence of}} <b>Russel's</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, we believe the presence of <b>Russel's</b> <b>bodies</b> help the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Correlation between morphological patterns and the different leishmania species was also considered...|$|R
40|$|Chicken {{intestinal}} globule leucocytes (GL) {{and various}} intraepithelial migrat-ing cells were light and electron microscopically investigated. The morphological characteristics of GL {{were consistent with}} those of intraepithelial lymphocytes, except for the high cytoplasmic/nucleus ratio, the well-developed Golgi apparatus and the cytoplasmic granules. GL could be light and electron microscopically distinguished from mast cells, plasma cells (<b>Russel</b> <b>body</b> cells), and other migrating cells. Plasma cells and macrophages were located in the epithelium covering the large lymphatic nodules, but not in the ordinary columnar epithelium. However, GL and lymphocytes populated both epithelia. The cellular traffic of GL and lymphocytes across the basement membrane of the mucous epithelium and the penetration of lymphocytes into the intestinal lumen were often found. The granules of GL, which located in the area neighboring Golgi complexes, were classified into two types; type I consisted only of amorphous matrix (AM), and type II of a marginal zone of fine reticular materials (FRM) in addition to th...|$|R
