Combine harvesters use both enclosed and open augers to move the unthreshed crop into the threshing mechanism and to move the grain {{into and out of}} the machine's hopper. Ice resurfacers use augers to remove loose ice particles from the surface of the ice. An auger is also a central component of an injection molding machine. An auger is used in some <b>rubbish</b> <b>compactors</b> to push the rubbish into a lowered plate at one end for compaction.|$|E
50|$|A Roll-off has a hoist and subframe, but no body, {{it carries}} {{removable}} containers. The container is loaded on the ground, then pulled {{onto the back}} of the truck with a winch and cable. The truck goes to the dump site, after it has been dumped the empty container is taken and placed to be loaded or stored. The hoist is raised and the container slides down the subframe so the rear is on the ground. The container has rollers on the rear and can be moved forward or back until the front of it is lowered onto the ground. The containers are usually open-topped boxes used for rubble and building debris, but <b>rubbish</b> <b>compactor</b> containers are also carried. A newer hook-lift system (“roller container” in the UK) does the same job, but lifts, lowers, and dumps the container with a boom arrangement instead of a cable and hoist.|$|R
