40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to investigate to what extent metacognitive <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategy</b> training would influence the <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> growth {{of a group of}} struggling Year Nine and Ten readers in a low decile New Zealand secondary school. The metacognitive <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategy</b> training framework Transactional Strategies Instruction (TSI) provided the theoretical basis of the project. TSI incorporates teacher-led explicit explanation and modelling of strategies as well as the guided practice of their use by students. The high levels of teacher involvement means that TSI potentially works within Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development and is therefore expected to help accelerate student comprehension growth. Developments in adolescent cognitive abilities also support comprehension growth within a TSI-style intervention. A ten week intervention which targeted four metacognitive <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> was carried out with a group of Year Nine and Ten students across two classes who had a history of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> under-achievement. The pre- and post-intervention comprehension test results demonstrated that above expected growth was achieved by many of the students {{as a result of the}} strategy training. The extent of the movement in student achievement data was significant in relation to national norms. Case study analysis of student think aloud transcriptions and class work revealed that students who accelerated their progress during the intervention were primarily aided by the explicit strategy instruction in that it transformed these students from passive decoders into active comprehenders. For students whom the intervention did not apparently work, factors which negated its success included negative attitudes towards the use of strategies and poor decoding skills.

The investigation is based on three observations of the tutoring about <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> and six interviews with a total of eleven pupils. The theoretical basis is composed of theories about the sociocultural perspective, scaffolding, zone of proximal development and reciprocal teaching. The result showed that the teacher tutored about the reading comprehension strategies: predicting, clarifying, questioning and summarizing. She encouraged the pupils to create inner images and to make text connections (text-to-self, text- to-text, text-to-world). She tutored about the strategies by the model "think aloud". The pupils seem to use the strategies predicting and clarifying most frequently when they are reading on their own but also creating inner images. For example, they use the strategy predicting when they are choosing books to read and the strategy clarifying when they don’t understand words while they are reading.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 90 This {{descriptive study}} aimed at investigating metacognitive knowledge and {{control in the}} use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> of ten freshman students in the Departments of American and British Studies at Ankara University. Recent research has focused on metacognition since it is claimed to {{play a crucial role in}} regulating mental processes. However, it is vital to our understanding of the role of metacognitive knowledge and control {{in the use of}} <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> This prediction was tested through a two-step procedure. The data were collected through think-aloud protocols and interviews. In the think-aloud protocols, the students were told to think aloud while they were reading a passage in an attempt to find out their <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> Through interviews, the students' knowledge about and control of their <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> were investigated. The results revealed from the analysis of think-aloud protocols indicated that these freshman students use various strategies to understand texts, falling into two groups: strategies that are used to comprehend the content by using non-linguistic cues (content-based), and those that are used to comprehend the content by using linguistic cues in the text (text-based). One major result that emerged from the analysis of the interviews showed that the students displayed varying amounts of knowledge and control in the use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> Knowledge about the strategies was identified as knowledge about person, task and strategy. Similarly, control of the strategies was explored in three categories: planning, monitoring and revising. However, it was found that the students lacked conscious knowledge about and intentional control of the strategies that they use. Putting it differently, the students did not possess metacognitive knowledge and control. Another finding illustrated that students demonstrated knowledge about the strategies more than control of the strategies since the latter requires some sort of action to regulate cognitive processes whereas the former does not. The results of the study suggest that the freshman students use a variety of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, they need to have metacognitive knowledge and control in the use of their <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> Çelik, JülideM.

This quantitative study was designed to address the following three questions: 1. 	What is the incidence of use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> by EFL teachers in Qatar government schools? 2. 	What is the incidence of use of explicit strategy instruction of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies?</b> 3. 	How does reading comprehension instruction vary according to teaching level, years of teaching experience and gender? In order to answer this study’s research questions, descriptive statistics were utilized. Further cross tabulations were processed and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) statistical test was implemented to investigate differences between variables. 		Data analysis revealed that participant teachers reported a general moderate and high frequency of using comprehension strategies. There were seven strategies used the most by the teachers. These strategies are: identify main ideas, set purpose for reading, predictions, preview text, monitor comprehension, prior knowledge activation, and handle unfamiliar words. Conversely, five strategies reported the comparatively lower use frequency. These strategies are text structure, questioning, visualizing, summarizing, and think aloud. The major findings on explicit strategy instruction indicated that teachers ignore the gradual release of responsibility to students. 		 Secondary level teachers reported the lowest use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> and explicit strategy instruction across the three grade levels. In addition, the lowest overall use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> in this study was reported by 0 - 5 years of teaching experience teachers.

40|$|AbstractProblem SituationWriting is {{the written}} {{expression}} of emotions, thoughts, desires and schemes, which requires skill rather than knowledge. However, skillful {{writing is a}} multidimensional process, and requires a desire for writing. On the other hand, {{it is a process}} which demands hard work, intensive reading, making inferences from the materials read and a long practice. Many students express their thoughts in written form with great difficulty. There are many reasons for this attitude toward writing; and one of them might be insufficient reading comprehension. Reading needs an effective mental process. And an accomplished reader uses some strategies for comprehensive reading, such as relating the text to one's own experience, summarizing the information, concluding and asking questions on the text, and so on. An effective reading process will most probably influence one's writing achievement. Purpose of the StudyPurpose {{of this study is to}} find out the relationship between writing achievement and levels of using <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> in the 4 th and 5 th grades of primary schools. Method of the StudyIn the study with the 4 th and 5 th grade primary school children, a descriptive method was used to determine the extant situation and the relationship between writing achievement and levels of using <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> SamplingWe studied with student subjects (Female: 649, Male: 667) of the 4 th and 5 th grades in 15 primary schools in Denizli. Of the 1316 subjects, 49. 3 % were females, and 50. 7, males. We applied Stratified Sampling Method to determine the sample group. Data Collecting InstrumentIn this study, we gave three separate themes to the students to see how they express their thoughts in written form, and used the “Essay Assessment Form (EAF) ” and the Scale of <b>Reading</b> <b>Comprehension</b> <b>Strategies</b> (SRCS) for the assessment of these essays. This form included 16 criteria evaluated out of 100 points. Analysis and Interpretation of the DataObtained written products have been assessed with the above-mentioned criteria and read by two lecturers, one of them being the researcher. Consistency coefficient of both grades has been calculated as 0. 81. We examined the correlation between the points obtained from the Scale of <b>Reading</b> <b>Comprehension</b> <b>Strategies</b> (SRCS) and those obtained from the written products.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed to}} achieve two goals. First, it investigated {{the effectiveness of}} a Web-Based Reading Instruction Program to teach reading strategies to college-level ESL students. In particular, this study examined how such a program may help ESL students learn and practice reading strategies, and develop the academic reading skills, as well as the necessary skills to interpret literary works they are exposed to in their freshman composition courses, in order to improve their overall <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension,</b> <b>strategy</b> use, and <b>reading</b> efficiency. Second, it explored the potentials and limitations of using a web-based program for teaching reading strategies. The subjects of this study were 22 ESL adult university learners enrolled in a freshman composition course at the University of Arizona. The results of the Nelson-Denny Standardized Reading Test and the Reading Comprehension Tasks used to measure students overall <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> or <b>reading</b> proficiency show significant differences before and after instruction. Significant differences were also found between pre- and post-treatment measures of the scores on the Reading Strategy Inventory indicating that as <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> improved, <b>strategy</b> use was also affected in that students perceived themselves as using strategies more frequently following strategy instruction. Significant differences were found in the cognitive, memory, and affective areas of reading strategies. Qualitative analysis of the students' responses on the Reading Comprehension Tasks in terms of patterns of strategy use revealed that students used cognitive, compensation, memory, metacognitive, and textual strategies more frequently after strategy instruction. Responses on these tasks after instruction also demonstrated a greater understanding of the texts and textual features. These results render strong support for the relationship between <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> and <b>strategy</b> use. As <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> improves, students use more strategies, more effectively, and more frequently. Results of the Nelson Denny Standardized Reading Test, Reading Comprehension Tasks, and Reading Strategy inventory, indicate that computer-assisted strategy training in general and task specific strategies has positive effects on the <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> of ESL learners.

It was also hypothesized that a student’s perceptual learning style as one of the dimensions of his/her general cognitive style affects the choice of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies.</b> Subjects were 66 freshmen and graduate students from two Turkish universities. The results of the Edmonds Learning Style Identification Exercise (ELSIE) suggest that two-thirds of the students do not have a strong preference for any of the following perceptual modalities: vizualization, listening, activity/feeling. Statistical analyses did not reveal significant differences between reading comprehension task scores of students with different perceptual modality preferences, indicating that the perceptual learning styles of EFL students with an average number of 9. 5 years of previous English study do not have direct relationship to their reading achievement. To study the possible impact of cognitive style on the use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies,</b> six students with a strong preference for a particular perceptual learning style were divided into proficient and less proficient comprehenders {{based on the results of}} the reading comprehension task first used by Carrell (1989) and the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency (Form D). <b>Reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies,</b> explicitly mentioned by the participants during their think-alouds and extrapolated by the researcher from participants’ protocols, were coded using a modified version of Block’s (1986) strategy classification scheme and then compared across students’ perceptual preferences and across their proficiency levels. The results of strategy use investigation show that all groups of EFL readers use similar strategies: rereading, monitoring their comprehension. summarizing. There appeared only one pattern of strategy use which distinguish EFL readers with different perceptual learning styles from each other. This pattern reflected their perceptual style preference. Proficient comprehenders with different perceptual learning styles differed from less proficient comprehenders in greater use of general (text-level) comprehension strategies and those of the local (word-based) strategies which are considered in research literature as effective. No evidence was found that would support the idea that the choice of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> is affected by learners'cognitive styles. Manayeva, LenaM. S...|$|E

The Reciprocal Teaching process is extended from the four traditional strategies of predicting, clarifying, questioning and summarising, to include further cognitive <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> applied to the context of solving Mathematical word problems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProblem Statement: It is not {{sufficient}} to simply decode word meaning to comprehend a reading text. To achieve comprehension in reading, an effective reader should be able to successfully implement such practices as relating the text with his or her own background knowledge, summarizing information, drawing conclusions, and posing questions at the text. Use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> facilitates a successful reading process. However, use of strategies may not always be sufficient for a successful reading process. There are other factors that increase student motivation. Allotting {{a certain amount of time}} to reading may be highly effective in increasing reading success. Purpose of the Study: This study aims to determine the relationship between use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> and daily free reading time among 4 th and 5 th grade primary education students. Method of the Study: Descriptive method was used to identify the situation. The study was conducted on 4 th and 5 th grade primary education students to examine the relationship between their use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> and daily time allotted to free reading. Sampling: The study was conducted on 402 (208 girls, 195 boys) students at 4 th and 5 th grades attending 7 primary education schools in İzmir/Buca. 51. 7 % of the participants were female and 48. 3 % were male. The sample was determined through stratified sampling method. Data Collection Instrument: In this study, a “Reading Comprehension Strategies Scale” (RCSS) was used to determine students’ level of use of reading strategies. The daily time that student spend free reading (stated in minutes as unit of time) was obtained through the personal information form of the scale. Data Analysis and Interpretation: As a result of the analyses, the use of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategies</b> was found to be a significant predictor on daily time spent reading (R 2 = 0. 57, p= 0. 00). Based on this result, it can be stated that there is a significant positive relationship at a medium level between use of reading strategies and daily time spent reading...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of literacy <b>strategies</b> in improving <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> was investigated. The {{study focused on}} three different literacy strategies that occurred before, during, and after reading. A triangulation of data {{was used to determine}} the results of the study. Data was collected through control and experimental group quizzes, classroom discussions, personal observations, and student reflections. The study indicates that implementing literacy strategies has a positive influence on <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension.</b> The <b>strategies</b> that focused on verbal communication were most effective in improving <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{involved}} {{two sets of}} tests: 1) an emotional quotient inventory for measuring the level of EI and 2) a <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> test battery for measuring the students’ mastery of <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> and <b>reading</b> <b>strategies.</b> Further elaboration of each instrument is provided below.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 43 - 47). A {{great number}} of students find <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> challenging and even frustrating in Arabic. By and large, Arabic teachers continue to use the traditional approach at the intermediate level that relies on direct instruction, without giving students the chance {{to think for themselves}} or develop metacognitive <b>strategies</b> for <b>comprehension.</b> Hence, students cannot find meaning to what they read without the immediate feedback of the Arabic teacher, and end up developing an aversion to reading grade-level Arabic books for leisure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to implement a group-based <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>strategy,</b> that help students become active and effective readers. When applied systematically and consistently, the new method yielded considerable improvement in <b>reading</b> <b>comprehension</b> scores in an experimental group of seventh graders compared to the control group. Recommendations included using this strategy at the intermediate level, even expanding its use to younger readers at the elementary level in an attempt to make them more effective readers. 1 bound copy: 70 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
