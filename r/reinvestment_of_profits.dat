25|$|Other {{researchers}} and historians have strongly contested {{what has come}} to be referred to as the “Williams thesis” in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Economic historian Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income. Historian Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before.|$|E

As regards capital accumulation, it can flourish, so that some people become wealthier, although society as a whole becomes poorer, and the net {{capital formation}} decreases.

5000|$|Ironically, this {{relative}} {{decline of}} the Dutch economy through increased competition from abroad was {{partly due to the}} behavior of Dutch capitalists. The Dutch economy had grown explosively in the 17th century because of retention and <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits.</b> Capital begat capital. However, the fastly accumulating fund of Dutch capital had to be profitably reinvested. Because of the structural changes in the economic situation investment opportunities in the Dutch economy became scarcer just at the time when the perceived risk of investing in more lucrative ventures abroad became smaller. Dutch capitalists therefore started on a large foreign direct investment boom, especially in Great Britain, where the [...] "Dutch" [...] innovations in the capital market (e.g. the funded public debt) after the founding of the Bank of England in 1696 had promoted the interconnection of the capital markets of both countries.

40|$|Price {{and profit}} data between the 1770 s and the 1820 s from {{accounting}} records of three Lancashire cotton firms help to illumine {{the nature of}} the economic processes at work in early industrialization. Many historians have seen the Industrial Revolution as a Schumpeterian process in which discontinuous technological change led by the mechanized factories of the cotton industry created large profits for innovators that persisted in succeeding decades while technology slowly diffused. In this view imperfect capital markets limited the use of the new technology, keeping <b>profits</b> high. <b>Reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> these <b>profits</b> gradually financed expansion of innovating firms. The new technology dominated only after a long diffusion process. The evidence here, however, supports a more equilibrium view in which the industry expanded rapidly and prices fell in response to technological change. Expansion of the industry led to dramatic declines in the prices of cotton goods as early as the 1780 s. There is no evidence <b>of</b> super-normal <b>profits</b> thereafter. Prices continued to fall and output expand thereafter as cost-reducing technological change continued. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{developments}} in the current accounts of transition countries in Central, Baltic and South-Eastern Europe. Attention is given to policy issues, such as the relationship between savings, investments and government deficits, reinvested profits, official transfers from the European Commission and private transfers. The overall situation in the sustainability of current account deficits in studied transition countries is characterised as steadily improving {{and the majority of}} economies reached a stage where the current account is not an immanent threat to their growth any longer. However, economic policies in many of the countries need important adjustments {{in order to keep the}} economies in macroeconomic equilibrium.

5000|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> undistributed earnings. A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> undistributed <b>profits.</b> In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|R

Drug trafficking has been closely linked with organised crime and with social harms. This project had two main aims: • To identify the disruptive effect of proceeds of crime action on criminal activity. The project attempted to measure the disruptive effect by developing an economic model that estimated the multiplier impact <b>of</b> the <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> drug trafficking. • The project also attempted to identify factors associated with successful proceeds of crime action. There are two main audiences for the findings of this study. Senior police, police intelligence, policymakers and researchers will be interested primarily in measuring the disruptive effect of proceeds of crime action. Police responsible for managing proceeds of crime investigations and senior investigators will be interested in the practical applications of findings relating to success factors in financial investigations. The results of the project should improve agencies’ ability to target trafficking and increase the seizure of proceeds of crime. The proposed index of the disruptive effect of proceeds of crime action—the Proceeds of Crime Drug Disruption Index (POCDDI) —will also allow agencies to provide both the Government and the community with a more accurate assessment of the value of their proceeds of crime initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Capitalism’s {{profound}} effect on society has encouraged economic and accounting historians to hypothesise {{about the importance of}} double entry bookkeeping to its development. According to Sombart the continual <b>reinvestment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>profits</b> earned depended on the existence of a capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping that would allow investors and managers to measure the return on investments as a means of making rational business decisions. More recently, with particular reference to the English East-India Company Bryer has argued that the adoption of the capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping was essential to resolving the social conflict between investing capitalist classes that arose with the rise of industrial capitalism in England in the late 17 th and 18 th centuries by providing the means to calculate the rate of return on socialised capital. This paper widens the historical context of these debates to The Netherlands in the early 17 th century by examining accounting practices of the Dutch East-India Company, the epitome of modern capitalism in motives, organization and funding. It establishes that, although the 17 th century Dutch were preeminent in Europe in their knowledge of the capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping, at no time during the period covered by the first charter (1602 – 1623) of the Dutch East-India Company, or thereafter, did the domestic operations of the Company use this form of bookkeeping across all chambers. This meant that the investors did not have the necessary information that would have allowed them to calculate the return on their investments. Indeed, the Company’s investors neither expected nor demanded information to calculate the return on their investments and, hence, double-entry bookkeeping was not a necessary condition for Dutch capitalism in the manner suggested by Sombart, Weber and Bryer. Instead, the form which capitalism developed in The Netherlands recognised the social and economic impact of its unique geography which produced a society characterised by a monetary economy, a long tradition of joint ownership, and a free market for assets and capital rights...|$|R
