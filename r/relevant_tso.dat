3000|$|Recognizing the {{operating}} difficulties arising {{from a large}} penetration of wind, many power system operators are making emulated inertia response from wind turbines mandatorily. For example, the European draft code (ENTSO-E) requires an inertia response from power plants above an agreed size. It specifies that [11], “The <b>relevant</b> <b>TSO</b> shall have the right, determined in cooperation with other TSOs in the relevant synchronous area, to require each Power Park Module, which does not inherently have a capability to supply additional active power to the network by its inertia and which is greater than a MW size to be specified by the <b>relevant</b> <b>TSO,</b> to install a feature in the control system which operates the Power Park Module so as to supply additional active power to the network in order to limit {{the rate of change}} of frequency following a sudden generation loss.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|As European Union {{published}} the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline, {{the goal was}} to publish a guideline which would, among others, optimise the use of the power grid as well as the calculation and allocation of the cross border capacities. The guideline requires a coordinated manner to calculate the cross borders within transmission system operators as well as increase the frequency of the capacity calculation. Based on these objectives the currently in use capacity calculation methodology has to be developed to be in line with capacity allocation and congestion management guideline. The calculation methodology developed in this thesis utilises the NTC-method, which is currently in use, as a theoretical base. In the future this methodology is required to calculate capacities hourly for the whole Nordic synchronous area. This sets a strict operational environment for the CNTC method, in which the methodology is meant to calculate secure values fast. CNTC method was developed to utilise a simulation environment, which is used in Fingrid’s current capacity calculation. The method is divided into three main parts, which creates the base for the calculated technical maximum capacities. In the first stage the method collects all the necessary input data. Second phase is steady state analysis, where the N- 1 principle is examined as well as the violation of thermal and voltage limits. As the greatest cross-border capacity in steady state is found, the dynamic analysis is run. Once a dynamically stable case is found, the capacity calculation is seen as completed. The developed method was tested in case study calculating the capacity for the AC-border between Finland and Sweden. In order to conduct the case study the input data was collected from the <b>relevant</b> <b>TSOs,</b> which included grid models which comprised the whole Nordic synchronous system. With these calculations the developed CNTC method was proven to give capacities close to the ones that the current NTC methodology gives for the border. In order to finalise the developed CNTC method into a capacity allocation and congestion management guideline compliant more work is needed. The topics for the further development include the implementation of the current capacity allocation methodologies and inclusion of remedial actions. The implementation of said additions require further testing in order to take the method to production use in the Nordic capacity calculation region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{shows some}} test cases from the EU project SAFEWIND on {{different}} {{ways that the}} planning phase of wind farms can benefit from early knowledge of wind power predictability. The interest is focused on day-ahead short-term forecasting, as the most <b>relevant</b> range for <b>TSOs</b> and wind energy traders. We shall use the term predictability assessment when we quantify wind predictability during the planning phase of a wind farm. This can be associated {{to the prediction of}} the hub-height wind speed (the meteorological wind resource), the gross wind power from a specified turbine power-curve model, or the net wind power output, which includes wind farm losses due to wake effects and other environmental aspects that are site and wind farm layout specific. Within the SAFEWIND project, wind power predictability is evaluated to suggest potential benefits during the planning phase of wind farm deployment. Predictability assessment can be useful, for instance, to anticipate operational costs due to market imbalance for energy traders, costs related to prediction of offshore weather windows for turbine installation or maintenance, or to benefit from portfolio effects when aggregating wind farms that operate in uncorrelated wind climates. While the weight of predictability for a wind farm developer is low in the decision-making process compared to the capacity factor, it remains a useful indicator of the quality of wind for grid integration purposes. A series of case studies are presented in various European regions to present tools for wind power predictability assessment at different scales...|$|R
