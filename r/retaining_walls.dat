40|$|<b>Retaining</b> <b>wall</b> {{structures}} in Malaysia region are placing {{more emphasis on}} lateral earth pressure rather than seismic effect. However, Malaysia actually experienced tremors due to the earthquakes occurred in the neighbouring countries. Therefore, the main objective {{of this research is}} to study the behaviour of <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> structure under earthquake loading and to determine acceleration and displacement of <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> structure during earthquake. Hence, a finite element seismic response simulation of a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> structure using SAP 2000 has been presented. Time history, response spectrum and free vibration analysis has been carried out and compared throughout this study. Generally, <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> {{structures in}} Malaysia region are capable of resisting low seismic activity based on the study.

5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of <b>retaining</b> <b>walls,</b> built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four <b>retaining</b> <b>walls,</b> the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E

Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} phase of work, {{four types of}} lake margin were constructed. On the southern side of the Central Basin, low reinforced concrete <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> were used, while on the eastern side, grouted rock wall can be seen near Commonwealth Park, as well {{as much of the}} East Basin. Sand and gravel beaches were built to cater for lakeside recreational pursuits. These are mostly prevalent on the western half of the lake complex. Rocky outcrops, steeply sloping stable shores with water vegetation such as bullrushes were also used. This treatment is evident in the West Lake in Yarralumla. William Holford and Partners were responsible for the foreshore landscaping, and over 55,000 trees were planted in accordance with a detailed scheme.

Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position.

5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the <b>retaining</b> <b>walls</b> of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the influence of}} excitation on the wavelet packet frequency band energy spectrum (ES), ES is acquired via wavelet packet decomposition of a virtual impulse response function. Based on ES, a character frequency band vector spectrum and damage eigenvector spectrum (DES) are created. Additionally, two damage identification indexes, the energy ratio standard deviation and energy ratio variation coefficient, are proposed. Based on the damage index, an updated damage identification method for <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> structures is advanced. The damage state of a <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> can be diagnosed through DES, the damage location can be detected through the damage index trend surface, and the damage intensity can be identified by establishing a quantitative relationship between the damage intensity and damage index. To verify the feasibility and validity of this damage identification method, a vibration test on a pile plate <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> is performed. Test results demonstrate that it can distinguish whether the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> is damaged, {{and the location of}} partial damage within the <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> can be easily detected; in addition, the damage intensity of the wall can also be identified validly. Consequently, this damage identification theory and method may be used to identify damage within <b>retaining</b> <b>wall</b> structures...|$|R
