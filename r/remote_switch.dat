25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal {{to get ready for}} a call and the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> would reply with an acknowledgment to go ahead with dial pulsing.

5000|$|Normally, long-distance {{calls were}} billed locally. Since the [...] "trick" [...] {{required}} {{a long distance}} call {{to be placed in}} order to connect to the <b>remote</b> <b>switch,</b> it would be billed as usual. However, there were some types of calls that had either no billing, like calls to directory service, or for which the billing was reversed or billed to another number, like WATS lines (area code 800 numbers). By dialing one of these [...] "toll-free" [...] numbers, the caller was connected to a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> as normal, but no billing record was made locally. The caller would then play the 2600 Hz tone into the line to return the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to on-hook, and then use a blue box to dial the number to which they really wanted to connect. The local Bell office would have no record of the call.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to dialing instructions, the system {{also included a}} number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the frequency of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone on-hook (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to go on-hook, but critically, the local switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local switch ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the <b>remote</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since the {{replacement}} of electromechanical exchanges by modern digital ones, the function of a Class-5 switch in rural areas is often performed by a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> or Remote Digital Terminal installed at the original switch site to handle local switching or concentration, respectively.

50|$|A key {{capability}} of a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> {{is the ability}} to act in emergency standalone (ESA) mode, wherein local calls can still be placed even in the event that the connection between that remote and the host has been lost.

ESA is increasingly available on digital loop carrier platforms as well as on purpose-built remote switches in order to improve the scope of their utility.|$|E
