25|$|The disappointing {{passenger}} {{numbers and}} the fight with SamTrans meant that between 2003 and 2010, BART repeatedly changed its routing patterns on the line south of Daly City, offering at least five distinct service patterns on different lines (Richmond, Pittsburg/Bay Point, Dublin/Pleasanton), with trips terminating at either Millbrae or SFO. The January 1, 2008 change eliminated most direct service between SFO and Millbrae on weekdays, {{except for a few}} morning and evening trips. Finally, in 2010 BART settled on a <b>routing</b> <b>pattern</b> that has Pittsburg/Bay Point trains running to SFO at all times. During peak times Mondays through Fridays, Richmond trains run directly to Millbrae without stopping at SFO. During off-peak hours (nights and weekends), Pittsburg/Bay Point trains serve both SFO and Millbrae sequentially. Passengers on the Fremont, Richmond, and Dublin/Pleasanton lines must make a transfer to the Pittsburg/Bay Point line to reach the airport. In addition, the cessation of direct BART service between Millbrae and SFO during weekday peak hours requires Caltrain passengers wanting to travel to the airport from Millbrae to travel to San Bruno Station and make a transfer to an SFO train.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we present the {{multistage}} off-line method, {{a new and}} rather natural way to model off-line packet routing problems, which reduces the problem of off-line packet routing to that of finding edge disjoint paths on a multistage graph. The multistage off-line method can model any kind of <b>routing</b> <b>pattern</b> on any graph and can incorporate {{the size of the}} maximum queue allowed in any processor. The paths for the packets are computed by a greedy heuristic method. Based on the multistage off-line method, we study the permutation packet routing problem on two-dimensional meshes. We ran millions of experiments based on random generated data and, for all of our experiments, we were able to compute a solution of length equal to the maximum distance a packet had to travel, and thus, match the actual lower bound for each <b>routing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Index Terms-Mesh, multistage graph, off-line algorithm, packet routing, permutations. ...|$|E

The focus here is instead on the opposite problem, does there exist weights for a certain set of shortest paths? OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) {{is one of several}} possible protocols that determines how routers will send data in a network like the internet. Network operators would however like to have some control of how the traffic is routed, and being able {{to determine the}} weights, which would lead to the desired shortest paths to be used, would be a help in this task. The first part of this thesis is a mathematical explanation of the problem with a lot of examples {{to make it easier to}} understand. The focus here is on trying to combine several <b>routing</b> <b>patterns</b> into one, so that the result will be fewer, but more fully spanned, <b>routing</b> <b>patterns,</b> and it can e. g. be shown that there can't exist a common set of weights if two <b>routing</b> <b>patterns</b> can't be combined.

Here we identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective dynamical reference states in complex networks.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{designing}} IP networks where the traffic is routed using the OSPF protocol. Routers in OSPF networks use link weights set by an administrator for determining how to route the traffic. The routers use all shortest paths when traffic is routed to a destination, and the traffic is evenly balanced by the routers when several paths are equally short. We present a new model for the OSPF network design problem. The model is based on <b>routing</b> <b>patterns</b> and does not explicitly include OSPF weights. The OSPF protocol is modeled by ensuring that all pairs of <b>routing</b> <b>patterns</b> are subpath consistent, which is a necessary condition for the existence of weights. A Lagrangean heuristic is proposed as solution method, and feasible solutions to the problem are generated using a tabu search method.

40|$|Collaborative {{networks}} {{are composed of}} experts who coop-erate {{with each other to}} complete specific tasks, such as resolving problems reported by customers. A task is posted and subsequently routed in the network from an expert to another until being resolved. When an expert cannot solve a task, his routing decision (i. e., where to transfer a task) is critical since it can significantly affect the completion time of a task. In this work, we attempt to deduce the cognitive process of task routing, and model the decision making of experts as a generative process where a routing decision is made based on mixed <b>routing</b> <b>patterns.</b> In particular, we observe an interesting phenomenon that an expert tends to transfer a task to someone whose knowl-edge is neither too similar to nor too different from his own.

Each time one of the retailers in a given region receives a delivery, this delivery is made by a vehicle who visits all other outlets in the region as well (in an efficient route). We describe a class of low complexity heuristics and show under mild probabilistic assumptions that the generated solutions are asymptotically optimal (within the above class of strategies).
