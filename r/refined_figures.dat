A delta fragmentation function {{much harder than}} the Peterson function, consistent with recombination scheme for charm meson formation, is needed to match the experimental data. Attempts to fit the non-photonic electrons at high p_T show large uncertainties and the B meson semi-leptonic decays may not be dominant for electron p_T up to 8 GeV/c. Correlations of non-photonic electrons with charged hadrons are studied. We propose an experimental method to quantitatively determine the relative contributions of D and B meson semi-leptonic decays to the non-photonic electrons.

The demodulation performance of GPS L 1 C simulated with SiGMeP in the AWGN propagation channel model, in the Prieto propagation channel model (narrowband Land Mobile Satellite model in urban configuration) and in the DLR channel model (wideband Land Mobile Satellite model in urban configuration) are computed and compared one to the other.

This reinterpretation consists of using the available observables to define a new observable which, in a model independent way and without assuming CPT invariance, compares a transition between a B^ 0 and a here-defined B_α-state, with its time reversed transition. The observable then offers a direct way to probe time reversal invariance and it is therefore independent of any conclusion obtained from current experimental information on CP violation and CPT invariance.

We have developed a variational method, a la Lee-Low-Pines (LLP) theory for electron-phonon systems, for description of the polaron with a conserved angular momentum around the symmetric axis. It is found in numerical results that the binding energy between the impurity and the excited bosons break the degeneracy {{with respect to the}} total angular momentum of the polaron. The angular momentum is partially shared by the excited bosons, which is due to a mechanism similar to the drag effect on the polaron momentum by a phonon cloud in the LLP theory.

Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimate that the minimum total Icarus scientific payload mass (i. e. the mass of probes and instruments which must be decelerated {{to rest in the}} target system to enable a meaningful programme of scientific investigation) will be in the region of 100 tonnes. Of this, approximately 10 tonnes would be allocated for cruise-phase science instruments, and about 35 tonnes (i. e. the average of estimated lower and upper limits of 28 and 41 tonnes) would be contributed by the intra-system science payload itself (i. e. the dry mass of the stellar and planetary probes and their instruments). The remaining ~ 55 tonnes is allocated for the sub-probe intra-system propulsion requirements (crudely estimated from current Solar System missions; detailed modelling of sub-probe propulsion systems will be needed to <b>refine</b> this <b>figure).</b> The overall mass contributed by the science payload to the total that must be decelerated from the interstellar cruise velocity will be considerably more than 100 tonnes, however, as allowance must be made for the payload structural and infrastructural elements required to support, deploy, and communicate with the science probes and instruments. Based on the earlier Daedalus study, we estimate another factor of two to allow for these components.

Yet, literally from his first hour, he had been tossed upon the surges of a most varied and tumultuous existence, having been born at sea, of American parentage, but on board of a Spanish vessel, and spending many of the subsequent years in voyages, travels, and outlandish incidents and vicissitudes, which, methought, had hardly been paralleled since the days of Gulliver or De Foe. When his dignified reserve was overcome, he had the faculty of narrating these adventures with wonderful eloquence, working up his descriptive sketches with such intuitive perception of the picturesque points that the whole was thrown forward with a positively illusive effect, like matters of your own visual experience.

40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a {{universal}} phenomenon experienced by both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated during the stress, which can damage most cellular components including proteins, lipids and DNA. Naturally, organisms have evolved defence mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage. In prokaryotic systems, Dps (DNA binding protein from stationary phase cells) forms {{an important component of}} the mechanisms. Dps is known to be produced maximally during the stationary phase of bacterial growth. They exhibit ferroxidase activity as well. Dps homologs have been identified in a variety of distantly related bacteria, thus implying that this protein has a crucial function. The crystal structures of these proteins from a few bacteria are available. The work reported here is concerned with structural studies on Dps molecules from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Well-established X-ray crystallographic techniques were used to study the structures reported here. Hanging drop vapour diffusion and microbatch methods were used for crystallization. X-ray intensity data were collected on MAR Research imaging plates mounted on Rigaku X-ray generators. The data were processed using the HKL program suite. All the structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the programs AMoRe and PHASER. Structure refinements were carried out using the programs CNS and REFMAC. Model building was carried out using FRODO and COOT. PROCHECK, ALIGN, INSIGHT, NACCESS, HBPLUS, CONTACT and ESCET were used for validation and analysis of the <b>refined</b> structures. <b>Figures</b> were prepared using MOLSCRIPT, BOBSCRIPT, RASTER 3 D and PYMOL. The structure of the first Dps identified in M. smegmatis has been determined in three crystal forms and has been compared with those of similar proteins from other sources. The dodecameric molecule can be described as a distorted icosahedron. The interfaces among subunits are such that the dodecameric molecule appears to have been made up of stable trimers. The situation is similar in the proteins from Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which are closer to the M. smegmatis protein in sequence and structure than those from other sources, which appear to form a dimer first. Trimerisation is aided in the three proteins by the additional N-terminal stretches they possess. The M. smegmatis protein has an additional C-terminal stretch compared to other related proteins. The stretch, known to be involved in DNA binding, is situated on the surface of the molecule. A comparison of the available structures permits a delineation of the rigid and flexible regions in the molecule. The subunit interfaces around the molecular dyads, where the ferroxidation centres are located, are relatively rigid. Regions in the vicinity of the acidic holes centred around molecular threefold axes, are relatively flexible. So are the DNA binding regions. The crystal structures of the protein from M. smegmatis confirm that DNA molecules can occupy spaces within the crystal without disturbing the arrangement of the protein molecules. However, contrary to earlier suggestions, the spaces need not to be between layers of the protein molecules. The cubic form provides an arrangement in which grooves, which could hold DNA molecules, criss-cross the crystal. M. smegmatis Dps is characterised by a 26 residue C-terminal tail which has been shown to be involved in DNA binding. The protein spontaneously degrades into a species in which 16 C-terminal residues are cleaved away. This species does not bind DNA, but forms dodecamers. A second species in which all the 26 residues constituting the tail were deleted not only does not bind to DNA, but also fails to assemble into dodecamers, indicating a role in assembly also for the C terminal tail. Therefore, the crystal structure of the species without the entire C-terminal tail was carried out. The molecule of the C-terminal mutant has an unusual open decameric structure, resulting from the removal of two adjacent subunits from the original dodecameric structure of the native form. It has been earlier shown that a Dps dodecamer could assemble with a dimer or one of two trimers (Trimer-A and Trimer-B) as intermediate and that Trimer-A is the intermediate species in the M. smegmatis protein. Estimation of surface area buried on trimerisation indicates that association within Trimer-B is weak. It further weakens when the C-terminal tail is removed, leading to the disruption of the dodecameric structure. Thus, the C-terminal tail has a dual role, one in DNA binding and the other in the assembly of the dodecamer. M. smegmatis Dps also has a short N-terminal tail of 9 residues. A species with this tail deleted, forms trimers in solution, but not dodecamers unlike wild type M. smegmatis Dps, under the same conditions. The crystal structure of this N-terminal mutant was also determined. Unlike in solution, the N-terminal mutant forms dodecamers in the crystal. In native Dps, the N-terminal stretch of one subunit and the C-terminal stretch of a neighbouring subunit lock each other into ordered positions. The deletion of one stretch results in the disorder of the other. This disorder appears to result in the formation of a trimeric species of the N-terminal deletion mutant contrary to the indication provided by the native structure. The ferroxidation site is intact in the mutants. A second DNA binding protein from stationary phase cells of M. smegmatis (MsDps 2) has been identified from the bacterial genome and its crystal structure determined. The core dodecameric structure of MsDps 2 is the same as that of the Dps from the organism described earlier (MsDps 1). However, MsDps 2 possesses a long N-terminal tail instead of the C-terminal tail in MsDps 1. This tail appears to be involved in DNA binding. It is also intimately involved in stabilizing the dodecamer. Partly on account of this factor, MsDps 2 assembles straightway into the dodecamer while MsDps 1 does so on incubation after going through an intermediate trimeric stage. The ferroxidation centre is similar in the two proteins while the pores leading to it exhibit some difference. The mode of sequestration of DNA in the crystalline array of molecules, as evidenced by the crystal structures, appears to be different in MsDps 1 and MsDps 2, highlighting the variability in the mode of Dps-DNA complexation. A sequence search led to the identification of 300 Dps molecules in bacteria with known genome sequences. 50 bacteria contain 2 or more types of Dps molecules each, while 195 contain only one type. Some bacteria, notably some pathogenic ones, do not contain Dps. A sequence signature for Dps could also be derived from the analysis In addition to the work on Dps molecules, the author was also involved in studies on the crystal structures of the adipic acid complexes of L- and DL-arginine and supramolecular association in arginine-dicarboxylic acid complexes. This investigation, carried out primarily to obtain a good grounding in crystallography, is presented in an appendix...|$|R
