5000|$|A guitar tech {{is often}} a [...] "jack of all trades" [...] {{when it comes to}} making simple repairs. As such, a guitar tech can often <b>resolder</b> a loose wiring {{connection}} inside a guitar volume potentiometer, replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, stick a loose wooden part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a misaligned neck with an allen key. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is often responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up the item(s), the guitar tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.|$|E
50|$|A partial port of Windows XP is {{available}} on some modding websites but this usually involves removing the CPU and <b>resoldering</b> a different Pentium III {{as well as a}} heavily modified BIOS. One advantage over a regular, unmodded Xbox, is the ability to use a trainer.|$|R
50|$|It is good {{practice}} to remove solder from a joint prior to resolderingâ€”desoldering braids or vacuum desoldering equipment (solder suckers) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be <b>resoldered.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aging models {{may lose}} pixel columns from the display. This {{is caused by}} {{detachment}} {{of one or more}} pins of one of the SMD (Surface Mounted Device) chips in the display itself. In many cases this may be repaired by reflowing (<b>resoldering)</b> of the pins on the offending chip, either with an SMD reflow tool, or a soldering iron with a very fine (0.2 mm) tip.|$|R
5000|$|The N900's MicroUSB (charger) port is very fragile; {{some people}} have {{successfully}} fixed this problem either with epoxy glue, or by <b>resoldering</b> the USB port onto the circuit board. [...] Some of the chips in N900's GSM module might be badly soldered to the circuit board, resulting in multiple N900 devices reported as troubled by the inability for the SIM card to be detected. This issue is fixable by putting something between the GSM-related chips and their shielding, though a proper fix would be reballing.|$|R
40|$|This {{case report}} {{presents}} the treatment sequence of a 56 years old patient after he developed periimplantitis at the implant in position of tooth 22. This implant was integrated in an overdenture reconstruction {{connected to a}} soldered screw retained gold bar. The entire 2 -stage procedure of implant explantation, simultaneous bone augmentation and new implant placement is documented. The onlay-graft was performed {{by means of the}} Transfer-Ring-Control System (Meisinger). The existing gold bar could be <b>resoldered</b> and adapted to the new implant. Accordingly the overdenture was relined and the female retainer mounted. The treatment period covered almost one year...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{thermometer}} often reading below zero the 1,200 technicians who had {{gathered at the}} Wichita factory and the Modification Centers were being asked to modify each bomber inside and out. Firstly the wings needed {{to have some of}} the plating removed, the required [...] "beef-ups" [...] were added then each piece of skin riveted back in place. At the same time the cowl flaps, which controlled airflow through and around the troublesome engines, were being modified. Each piece of glass installed in the nose had to be pulled out and replaced with new distortion free panes. After that the pressurization had to be rechecked: 75 B-29s in total needed new glass. Internally every electrical plug had to be removed, disassembled and <b>resoldered</b> - a total of 586,000 connections in completed aircraft, plus those on the assembly lines and in wiring harnesses ready for installation.|$|R
40|$|The joint process between {{tapes of}} coated {{conductors}} {{is a critical}} issue for {{the most of the}} applications of high temperature superconductors (HTS). Using different fabrication techniques joints of YBCO coated superconductors were prepared and characterized through electrical measurements. For soldering material low melting point eutectic alloys, such as In-Sn (m. p. 116 degrees C) and Sn-Pb (m. p. 189 degrees C) were selected to prepare lap joints with effective length between 1 to 20 cm. The splice resistance and the critical current of the joints were evaluated by I-V curve measurements with the maximum current strength above the critical current, in order to evaluate the degree of degradation for each joint method. Pressed lap joints prepared with tapes without external reinforcement presented low resistance lap joint nevertheless some critical current degradation occurs when strong pressing is applied. When mechanical pressure is applied during the soldering process we can reduce the thickness of the solder alloy and a residual resistance arises from contributions of high resistivity matrix and external reinforcement. The lap joints for reinforced tape were prepared using two methods: the first, using ""as-supplied"" tape and the other after reinforcement-removal; in the latter case, the tapes were <b>resoldered</b> using Sn-Pb alloy. The results using several joint geometries, distinct surface preparation processes and different soldering materials are presented and analysed. The solder alloy with lower melting point and the longer joint length presented the smallest joint resistance. Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL) Cape...|$|R
6000|$|At length my Sire, his rough cheek {{wet with}} tears, [...] Panted from weary sides 'King, you are free! [...] We did but keep you surety for our son, [...] If this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou, [...] That tends to her {{bristled}} grunters in the sludge:' [...] For I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers, [...] More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath, [...] And all one rag, disprinced {{from head to}} heel. [...] Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm [...] A whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look, [...] He has been among his shadows.' 'Satan take [...] The old women and their shadows! (thus the King [...] Roared) make yourself a man to fight with men. [...] Go: Cyril told us all.' [...] As boys that slink [...] From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye, [...] Away we stole, and transient in a trice [...] From {{what was left of}} faded woman-slough [...] To sheathing splendours and the golden scale [...] Of harness, issued in the sun, that now [...] Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth, [...] And hit the Northern hills. Here Cyril met us. [...] A little shy at first, but by and by [...] We twain, with mutual pardon asked and given [...] For stroke and song, <b>resoldered</b> peace, whereon [...] Followed his tale. Amazed he fled away [...] Through the dark land, and later in the night [...] Had come on Psyche weeping: 'then we fell [...] Into your father's hand, and there she lies, [...] But will not speak, or stir.' [...] He showed a tent [...] A stone-shot off: we entered in, and there [...] Among piled arms and rough accoutrements, [...] Pitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak, [...] Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot, [...] And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal, [...] All her fair length upon the ground she lay: [...] And at her head a follower of the camp, [...] A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood, [...] Sat watching like the watcher by the dead.|$|R
