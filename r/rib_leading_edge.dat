50|$|Leading edge {{inflatable}} kites (LEIs) {{are made}} of a single skin of fabric with, as the name suggests, an inflated tubular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and inflated <b>ribs.</b> The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>ribs</b> are inflated by the user with a pump prior to launching the kite.

LEI kites are primarily used for kitesurfing, as they retain their structure when wet and can be easily relaunched from the water after sitting on the surface for an extended period. Conversely, an open-celled foil kite crashed into the sea immediately becomes saturated with water and unflyable.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} natural {{convection}} heat transfer is of significance {{in several areas}} of technology. Natural convection represents a limit on the heat transfer rate and this becomes a very important consideration for situations in which other modes are either not possible or not practical. Natural convection from vertical surfaces {{with some sort of}} large-scale surface roughness elements is encountered in many technological applications. Of particular interest is the dissipation of heat from electronic circuits, where component performance and reliability are strongly dependent on operating temperature. Natural convection is an inherently reliable cooling process. Circuit boards represent a naturally enhanced free convection situation. In other applications, {{it may be necessary to}} enhance the surface to achieve the desired temperature level;The present research was undertaken to provide information on the nature of heat transfer from rough surfaces. An interferometric technique was used to experimentally measure local heat transfer coefficients. This method is essentially non-intrusive and therefore extremely suitable for the study of low-flux phenomena such as natural convection;Several different types of surfaces were studied [...] namely, repeated ribbed, stepped, and sinusoidal surfaces. The effects of parameters such as protuberance height-to-spacing ratios, amplitude of spacing, conductivity of <b>ribs,</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> geometry, and angle of inclination were studied;It was found that heat transfer enhancement was possible in laminar natural convection using transverse roughness elements with proper sizing and shape selection. The heat transfer from the ribbed surfaces was found to be less than that from a plane flat plate of equal projected area. It was found that stepped surfaces could be used to improve the heat transfer performance relative to a plane flat plate of equal projected area. The study indicated the presence of an optimum step-pitch-to-height ratio. The performance of sinusoidal surfaces was not significantly different from that of a plane flat plate of equal projected area at low amplitude-to-wavelength ratios. The heat transfer performance decreased as the amplitude-to-wavelength ratio increased. The study also showed that roughness elements induced an early transition to turbulent flow...|$|R

50|$|The Tipsy B was {{a wooden}} framed machine, {{covered with a}} mixture of plywood and canvas. The wing was built around an I-section main spar at about one quarter chord and an {{auxiliary}} rear box spar. These spars were linked by a rigid diagonal pyramid bracing. Stressed plywood skin was used from the main spar forward, {{with the rest of the}} wing fabric covered over wooden <b>ribs.</b> The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was almost straight, and the trailing edge straight but strongly forward swept except at the centre section. Differential ailerons were carried on the tapering section, so their hinge line was also strongly forward swept.The fuselage was based on four spruce longerons, flat sided and plywood covered apart from a rounded decking. The depth of the decking behind the cockpit depended on whether the seating was open or closed. The Tipsy B had an open cockpit, with almost side-by-side seating in the sense that the seats were slightly staggered fore and aft to minimise fuselage width, with the left hand seat 8 in (200 mm) further forward. The Tipsy Bc had the same seat arrangement, but enclosed under a Rhodoid (cellulose acetate) canopy, faired into the fuselage rearwards by a much deeper decking. Some Tipsy Bs had an asymmetric windscreen formed out of a single Rhodoid sheet, with its free edge further forward on the left to match the displaced seating, but symmetric screens became common. Both seats were equipped with controls. The control column was on the mid-line between the seats, with a horizontal extension that could be rotated over either position.

In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> it was clarified by comparison that different <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> compared to a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> respectively.
