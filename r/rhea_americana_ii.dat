40|$|Infrared {{thermography}} is {{an innovative}} tool {{that has been}} used in several studies involving animal. This tool used to study heat stress, thermoregulation, behavior, disease diagnosis, mainly in the animal production and animal welfare. Wild birds are animals that get tense with the presence of man in his environment, causing changes in its thermal physiology and behavior. In the Brazilian semiarid, high temperatures cause further stress the birds, in studies involving animal welfare and animal production is important to use procedures and tools that do not cause stress to the animal, hence the implementation of infrared thermography. The <b>Rhea</b> <b>americana</b> is a wild bird, native to Brazil, which is gaining market share because of its meat is healthy and other products that are extracted from it. Little is known about the thermal physiology and behavior of this ratita, it is essential to improve poultry facilities in order to provide a pleasant environment and increase production. Birds and other ratites as the ostrich, emu, kiwi and cassowary use some body areas to dissipate body heat, the areas are: legs, beak and neck. All these body areas used by birds to dissipate heat were found using infrared thermography. Being a ratita, <b>Rhea</b> <b>Americana</b> can use the same body regions to reduce heat stress.

Twenty young animals aging between two and six months from the Centre for Wild Animals Multiplication (Cemas, scientific breeding license form Ibama no. 1478912) were used. After dissection it was observed that their tongue was small and presented a rhomboid form, being disposed on the oral cavity floor, and inserted in its base by a frenulum. The esophagus was a rectilinear tube with elastic aspect and longitudinal elastic fibers, without dilation, which gives it an absence of crop. The proventriculus presented a fusiform form and the gastric ventricle showed and slightly oval form when filled, and was internally coated with a thick gastric cuticle. The small intestine was composed of three distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The duodenum had a light gray color and showed a "U" curved shaped. The jejunum was dark green, long and composed of several short loops arranged above each other. The ileum had a gray color and was connected with the jejunum. In ventral line to the rectum and cloaca, the ileum extended cranially, dorsally to the ascending duodenum. The large intestine was composed of two caeca, one right and one left, and colon-rectum and ileum were continuous with the cloaca.

50|$|As {{regards the}} length and stoutness of the lower leg and the foot, E. eocaenus would {{probably}} have been similar to a good-sized American <b>rhea</b> (<b>Rhea</b> <b>americana)</b> in measurements. Its toes, however, differed vastly in shape and posture from those of this ratite (and most other birds). Above the tibiotarsal trochleae of the African bird, the bone was considerably wider than the ankle, among ratites being matched by some moa and the dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennetti). Thus, towards its toes the midfoot bone must have flared outwards, resulting in an overall wide-footed appearance. It is notable that while elephant birds have toes that are only a little more flaring than those of rheas, those of fast-running long-legged birds (ratites and others, like seriemas and some Charadriiformes) generally tend to bunch together in a narrower angle, with the most extreme situation found in the ostrich.

Later, lice were counted, preserved in jars with alcohol 70 ºGL and sent to the Laboratory of Animal Health of Federal University of Piauí for identification. In samples obtained from adult emus, met a total of 77 lice, and the incidence of the wing feathers collected, 84. 4 % (65), significantly higher than in the feathers of the lower neck, 15. 6 % (12). No lice were found in young animals born in brooder. The adult rheas showed a high degree of infestation by S. rhea.

Coletaram-se, aleatoriamente, duas penas das asas e duas da base do pescoço de cada animal, as quais foram colocadas em sacos plásticos fechados. Posteriormente, os piolhos foram contados, preservados em frascos com álcool etílico 70 ºGL, e enviados ao Laboratório de Sanidade Animal da Universidade Federal do Piauí. Nas amostras obtidas das emas adultas, encontrou-se um total de 77 piolhos, sendo a incidência nas penas colhidas das asas, 84, 4 % (65), significativamente maior do que nas penas da base do pescoço, 15, 6 % (12). Não foram encontrados piolhos nos animais jovens nascidos em chocadeira. As emas adultas apresentaram um alto grau de infestação por S. rheae [...] A incubação artificial dos animais evitou a infestação das emas jovens por S. rheae. A alta infestação por S. rheae inviabiliza o aproveitamento comercial das penas de emas. Este é o primeiro registro da ocorrência de S. rheae em emas no estado do Piauí...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rhea</b> (<b>Rhea</b> <b>{{american}}a</b> americana) is {{an american}} bird belonging to Ratite's family. Studies related to its morphology are still scarce. This study aims to describe the macroscopic structures of the oropharyngeal cavity. Five heads (2 to 6 months old) formalin preserved were anatomically dissected to expose the oropharynx. The oropharynx of the rhea was "bell-shaped" composed by the maxillary and mandibular rhamphotheca. The roof and floor presented two distinct regions different in colour of the mucosa. The rostral region was pale pink contrasting to grey coloured caudal region. The median longitudinal ridge extended rostrally from {{the apex of the}} choana to the tip of the beak in the roof and it is clearly more prominent and rigid than the homolog in the floor that appeared thin and stretched merely along the rostral portion of the regio interramalis. The floor was formed by the interramal region, (regio interramalis) tongue and laryngeal mound containing glove-shaped glottis. This study confirmed the basic morphology of the oropharinx of the rhea. However, important morphological information not previously described is highlighted and contradictory information present in the literature is clarified...|$|R
