50|$|They {{eventually}} begin a {{test flight}} of the plane {{for a pair of}} aircraft company officials, but things begin to go awry. Curly accidentally breaks the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable,</b> Moe orders him to throw out the clutch, Curly unable to find it, throws out the gear shift lever instead. Moe attempts to repair the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable</b> but fails and the plane turns upside down and the three fall right back into the same well as before, dousing the aircraft officials with water as they splash into the well's bottom.|$|E
50|$|Examination of the {{aircraft}} and the cargo door, which was recovered largely intact in Windsor, demonstrated that the latches had never rotated to their locked position. In their locked position, pressure on the door presses the latches further shut, and no force is transmitted into the actuator system that closes and opens them. With the latches only partially closed, forces on the door were transmitted back into the actuator, eventually overwhelming it at about 6,600 lbf. The rapid depressurization when the door broke off caused the floor above it to partially cave in, which pulled the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable</b> to its extension limit and severed several other operating cables.|$|E
50|$|Single, double, and quad sculls {{are usually}} steered by the scullers pulling harder {{on one side}} or the other. In other boats, there is a rudder, {{controlled}} by the coxswain, if present, or by one of the crew. In the latter case, the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable</b> is attached to the toe of one of his shoes which can pivot about the ball of the foot, moving the cable left or right. The bowman may steer since he has the best vision when looking over his shoulder. On straighter courses, the strokesman may steer, since he can point the stern of the boat at some landmark {{at the start of the}} course. On international courses, landmarks for the steersmen, consisting of two aligned poles, may be provided.|$|E
50|$|She was {{attacked}} by a PBY Catalina flying boat of No. 190 Squadron RAF on 3 August. During the action, the 'Cat' was hit twice and retired. Her crew were obliged to jettison depth charges and on their return, found the <b>rudder</b> <b>cables</b> almost severed. Her place was taken by a Lockheed Hudson of 269 Squadron, which succeeded in damaging U-489.|$|R
50|$|The wings have {{conventional}} Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. The {{elevator and}} rudder are also conventional. Ailerons and elevator {{are controlled by}} dual centre-mounted sticks through push-pull tubes, while the rudder is controlled by <b>cables.</b> The <b>rudder</b> <b>cables</b> attach to the rudder by wrapping around the wide bottom diameter of the rudder itself. The pitot tube is mounted on the left-hand strut.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engineering}} officer {{called out}} [...] "800 feet" [...] (240 m), which {{was followed by}} a [...] "gust" [...] of intense violence. The steersman reported no response to his wheel as the lower <b>rudder</b> <b>cables</b> had been torn away. While the control gondola was still hundreds of feet high, the lower fin of Akron had struck the water and was torn off.|$|R
5000|$|The crew {{consists}} of four rowers, each having one oar. There are two rowers on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and two on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). There is no cox, but the rudder is controlled {{by one of the}} crew, normally with the <b>rudder</b> <b>cable</b> attached to the toe of one of their shoes which can pivot about the ball of the foot, moving the cable left or right. The steersman may row at bow, who has the best vision when looking over their shoulder, or on straighter courses stroke may steer, since they can point the stern of the boat at some landmark {{at the start of the}} course. The equivalent boat when it is steered by a cox is referred to as a [...] "coxed four".|$|E
5000|$|... 13 April 1945 :On 5 April, a B-24H-15-DT, 41-28779, of the 564th Bomb Squadron, 389th Bomb Group (Heavy), {{captured}} by the Luftwaffe on 20 June 1944 (MACR 6533), and operated as KO+XA by KG 200, departs Wackersleben to avoid the Soviet advance with 29 KG 200 personnel aboard for a flight to Bavaria via Braunschweig. About 25 minutes into the flight, a German flak battery fires on the Liberator, damaging the fuselage, wings and number 4 (starboard outer) engine and cutting the <b>rudder</b> <b>cables.</b> Pilot Oberfeldwebel Rauchfuss manages to maintain control, however. Two passengers, injured by the gunfire, require immediate medical attention (one later dies), and the pilot lands in a meadow near Quedlinburg, but a powerline forces him to apply power to clear it and the bomber breaks its nosewheel strut when it overruns into a freshly ploughed field. The strut is removed {{and sent to the}} Junkers Component Factory at Eilsleben for repair. The oil leak on the engine and the <b>rudder</b> <b>cables</b> are also repaired. Returned on 12 April, the strut is reinstalled and an attempt is made to take off on 13 April, after all excess equipment is removed to lighten the plane, but the clearing proves too short, the B-24 bogs down in sodden soil, and the nose strut again breaks. Reluctantly, the crew destroys the airframe by punching holes in the fuel tanks and setting it alight with a flare pistol.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{almost all}} UK-approved amateur-built designs the RAF 2000 {{is subject to}} Civil Aviation Authority Mandatory Permit Directives, similar to {{airworthiness}} directives for certified aircraft. As of January 2010 these MPDs include repetitive inspections for rotor blade cracks, a one time installation of an emergency egress placard, a one time replacement of control system components and a one time inspection of <b>rudder</b> <b>cables.</b> As {{a result of a}} fatal accident [...] the CAA issued an MPD in 2009 which indicates that the design does not fully comply with the required BCAR Section T and that as a result unmodified aircraft are subject to a number of restrictions including flight with doors being prohibited, VNE limited to 70 mph and crosswind limited to 7 knots for take-off and landing, maximum 15 knots windspeed with a 10 knot gust spread are prohibited from flight in moderate or higher turbulence. Many of these restrictions can be removed by modifying the aircraft with a tailplane/rudder centring spring and new doors, although the 70 mph VNE is retained on both modified and unmodified aircraft flown in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The Aerolite 103 {{features}} a high wing with half-span flaps that are extended {{by use of}} an overhead bellcrank {{to a maximum of}} 40 degrees. The flight controls are three-axis and are actuated by a wheel mounted on a control column via flexible push-pull <b>cables</b> and conventional <b>rudder</b> pedals connected to the <b>rudder</b> by <b>cables.</b> The engine throttle is a twist-grip type and incorporates a brake lever to operate the non-differential mechanical drum brakes installed on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear.|$|R
5000|$|The SZD-51-1 [...] "Junior" [...] is a single-seat glider of {{fiberglass}} construction. Only {{the rudder}} is fabric covered. The fuselage has an internal tubular steel frame. The aircraft has a two-piece wing with a spar, and a fixed main wheel. The Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are fitted {{only on the}} top surface of the wing. Rudder pedals are adjustable. The control for the <b>rudder</b> via <b>cables,</b> all other control surfaces are operated by rods. The Junior is characterized by good slow flight characteristics and is very forgiving in flight behaviour. The aircraft is designed for early solo and club flying, but is certified for aerobatics and can be equipped for high-altitude flight and cloud flying.|$|R
50|$|Bellcranks {{are often}} used in {{aircraft}} control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the rudder often has a bellcrank whose pivot point is the <b>rudder</b> hinge. A <b>cable</b> connects the pilot's rudder pedal {{to one side of}} the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes on the rudder pedal, the rudder rotates on its hinge. The opposite rudder pedal is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The rapid {{decompression}} {{in the cargo}} hold caused a partial collapse of the passenger compartment floor, which in turn jammed or restricted some of the control cables which led to various flight control hydraulic actuators. The jamming of the <b>rudder</b> control <b>cable</b> caused the <b>rudder</b> to deflect to its maximum right position. The cable controls to the number two (tail) engine were severed, causing that engine to shut down. Fortunately, there was no rupture of any hydraulic system, so the pilots still had control of the ailerons, the right elevator and the horizontal stabilizer. However, because the right elevator cable was partially restricted, both pilots had to apply back pressure on the yoke for the landing flare. Additionally, the approach and landing {{had to be made}} at high speed, to prevent the sink rate from becoming too high. The tendency to turn right was offset by using 45 degrees of left aileron, combined with asymmetrical thrust of the two wing engines. In spite of the partial restriction of the controls, the pilots were able to return to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and land safely with no major injuries.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} aircraft, the HM.14 has no ailerons or elevators, and no foot-operated {{flight control}}s. The {{flight control system}} comprises a conventional control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick is transmitted via cables to the rear underside of the main wing, that {{is supported by a}} single pivot at the front underside, mounted on a pylon on the fuselage. Rearward movement of the stick pulls the cables, and increases the pitch and therefore the lift of the main wing. The aircraft will then pitch up, due to the centre of pressure being forward of the center of gravity. Forward stick movement has the reverse effect. Resistance to stick movement is usually an aerodynamic force from the main wing, {{but there is also a}} rubber spring (bungee) pulling down on the leading edge of the wing, and a telescopic strut behind the pilot's head limits the total wing movement. Side-to-side movement of the stick controls the all-moving <b>rudder</b> via <b>cables.</b> In flight, this produces a stable rolling motion, as required in a banked turn, because the wings both have dihedral. That rolling characteristic is not safely available during take-off or landing, so crosswinds are not easily tolerated.|$|R
500|$|Schnaufer {{claimed his}} first aerial victory on their thirteenth combat mission flown {{one day after}} the attack on Cologne on the night 1/2 June 1942. Nominally this was the RAF's second 1,000 bomber raid against Germany, {{although}} the attacking force actually numbered 956 aircraft. Schnaufer shot down a Handley Page Halifax south of Louvain in Belgium. The aircraft probably was a Halifax from No. 76 Squadron piloted by Sergeant Thomas Robert Augustus West, which was shot down at 01:55 on 2 June 1942 and crashed at Grez-Doiceau, [...] south of Louvain. West and another member of the crew were killed. This victory was achieved by ground-controlled interception through the Kammhuber Line. Once near to the target, Rumpelhardt had visually found the bomber and directed Schnaufer into attack position from below and astern. The Halifax caught on fire after two firing passes. During this mission the Himmelbett flight officer vectored them to a second bomber, a Bristol Blenheim. The attack had to be aborted after Hauptmann (Captain) Walter Ehle shot down the bomber from a more favourable attack position. Shortly before 03:00, they were then flying in the vicinity of Ghent, they spotted another target. Schnaufer made two unsuccessful attacks. During their third attack, which closed the distance to , they were hit by the defensive gunfire. Schnaufer was hit in his left calf, the port engine was burning, the <b>rudder</b> control <b>cables</b> were severed, and an electrical short circuit caused the landing lights to be permanently on. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer considered bailing out but decided to make an attempt for their home airfield after they managed to put out the flames and restart the engine. While Rumpelhardt made radio contact with the Sint-Truiden airbase, Schnaufer landed the aircraft without rudder control and on ailerons and engine-power alone. This was the only time that their aircraft sustained damage in combat or any member of the crew was wounded. Both Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer were awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for their first aerial victory. Schnaufer had hoped that he could stay on active duty and that the bullet lodged in his calf would isolate itself. However, he had to be admitted to a hospital in Brussels from 8–25 June for surgery. Rumpelhardt was given home leave until 26 June while Schnaufer was in the hospital.|$|R
