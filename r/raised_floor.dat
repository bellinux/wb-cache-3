5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, have yet to be excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its <b>raised</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} to withstand a 100-year flood because it is located on a flood plain. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> outlets and electrical switches.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a <b>raised</b> <b>floor,</b> covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E

25|$|Javanese {{people are}} {{descendant}} from Austronesian peoples. Temple relief in 9th-century Borobudur shows Javanese houses that were archetype of Austronesian houses: pile foundations, pitched roofs and an extended roof ridge. While these reliefs suggest houses on piles were in common use from the 9th to 12th centuries, between the 13th and 14th century the preferred Javanese style (east and central Java) {{was to build}} on the ground with a <b>raised</b> <b>floor,</b> the form of Javanese house that we know today. This new form resembles the vernacular architecture of eastern Indonesia such as Balinese and Sumbanese houses. Excavations at Trowulan (East Java), the probable site of Majapahit's capital in the 14th century, have uncovered remains of dwellings with permanent materials such as brick floors, foundations for walls and tile roofs.|$|E

The western senthong is used as storing rice and other agricultural produce, while the eastern senthong is used to store farming equipment.

Traditionally the central senthong was the abode of Sri herself. It is the room where incense is burnt for ceremonies, and in some areas the first rice grains of the harvest are placed here. In wealthy village houses in Central Java, the central senthong is flanked {{by a pair of}} mirrors and a pair of cabinets for holding important textiles. On {{the floor in front of}} the senthong is the loro blonyo, a statue of male and female in bridal attire, representing Sri and her male companion Raden Sadono. Also decorating the front of the central senthong are paired spittoons, textiles, and Madura wooden geese. The central senthong is also used as a sleeping room for newly married couples.|$|E
25|$|The Christopher Turnor {{monument}} sits on {{a black-and-white}} marble-tiled raised level. Within this level is set a worn sculpted medieval monument, supposed the early 14th-century memorial to John de Neville and his wife, with two recumbent figures—the man in chain armour, the woman with a wimple—draped from elbow to ankle and set within a sunken field. A dog lies {{at the feet of}} each figure, and a shield with three Fleur-de-lis lies partly over the man. Set into the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> against the north wall is a recessed table tomb with inset panels with angels holding shields, above which is a curved and moulded canopy arch with embedded fleuron repeats and a crocketed top running to a cross-shaped floriate finial. The origin of the monument is unknown. Next to the de Neville monument and set into a marble tile is a lozenge-shaped metal plaque to Florence Amy Laura Neville (died 1934 aged 85 years), daughter of Henry Martin Turnor who was the son of antiquarian Edmund Turnor (1755–1829) and brother of Christopher Turnor (1809–1886).|$|E

[...] The college accepted [...] "this munificent gift" [...] {{with the intention of}} displaying the painting in the chapel, possibly as an altarpiece. [...] The painting was initially displayed in the antechapel but a significant faction of the fellowship – including Michael Jaffé and Provost Noel Annan – were determined for the painting to become the focal point of an entirely redesigned east end. [...] As the first stage of this project, the Edwardian reredos and 17th-century wood panelling were removed and the Rubens installed in their stead behind the altar in April 1964. [...] The painting was so big that the <b>raised</b> <b>floor</b> of the chapel's east end, required by the 1448 Founder's Will, would have to be levelled so as to prevent the baroque artwork obscuring the bottom of the Tudor east window. [...] However, twenty fellows and honorary fellow E.M.Forster signed a letter urging the college to reverse its plan and [...] "admit that it has made a mistake"; the levelling of the floor nevertheless went ahead. [...] The newly refitted east end opened in 1968 and proved highly controversial, with the Architects' Journal criticising it as [...] "motivated not by the demands of liturgical worship but by those of museum display." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Raised</b> access <b>floor</b> panels {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these <b>raised</b> access <b>floor</b> panels are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the <b>raised</b> access <b>floor</b> panel’s mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre filled epoxy of floor panels were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software.
