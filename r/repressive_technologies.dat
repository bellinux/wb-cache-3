The central theme sets up and critically examines the need to examine {{the work of the}} anarchist punk band Crass in light of a poverty of discussion of their activities in previous cultural studies writings on punk. Equally, notions of endpoints in underground cultures are put to the question. The broad thesis of the monograph interrogates links between critical theory and Frankfurt school perspectives on art and subversive culture and Neo Marxist accounts of their phylogeny. There is critical discussion of the tension and similarities between Crass and Neo Marxist accounts of the role of dominant ideology (traditional notions of false consciousness/media effect) in contrast to the cultural monopoly of survival needs as the central motor of social reproduction in capitalist culture. The monograph concludes with a discussion {{of the importance of the}} legacy of Crass and the need for future research. This monograph was written before the groundswell of punk scholarship in its wake and serves as vindication of its obscure and early importance. It's principle importance lies in the fact that most accounts beyond this work have focussed not on critical theory but instead on historical contextual salience, aesthetic value and biographical detail. This new edition comprises a new extensive introduction assessing methodological approaches in punk scholarship and examines the stormy DiY publication and contextual history of the original monograph. Moreover expanded versions of an original chapter is included in addition to essays on subversive culture, the 1982 Falklands conflict and an examination of philosophical approaches to <b>repressive</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|E

The author looks at the new dynamics of control and repression that are {{at stake in the}} current historical and socio-political context, characterized by the interaction of different forms of power – disciplinary, necropolitical and biopolitical – which act to construct new definitions, representations and countermeasures about concepts such as “threat”, “enemy” and “terrorism”. This concerns securitarian and <b>repressive</b> state <b>technologies</b> in the Italian political framework, situated in the broader European context, in relation to social and political movements. The thesis will explore how securitarian narratives and emergencial rhetoric, connected to an increased militarization of territories, act as devices for the criminalization of social movements and political struggles and how these narratives always build up larger spaces for the legitimation of the exercise of state control and oppression within a growing invisible structural systemic violence – “terror” – acted upon bodies along the lines of class, gender, race and ethnicity. Throughout the case study the author analyses queer and transfeminist movements (Atlantide) and focuses specifically on the ways they have been affected by a hegemonic narrative of securitization and on how queer subjectivities become stigmatized and marginalized...|$|R
