40|$|Aim: Sheep milk-born {{bioactive}} peptides {{have been}} found to exhibit various physiological activities. The present work was designed with the aim to evaluate the effect of boiling on antidiabetic property of peptides derived from sheep milk caseinate on hydrolysis with three different proteases. Materials and Methods: In this investigation, casein prepared from raw and boiled sheep milk was hydrolyzed by three commercially available proteases (trypsin, pepsin, and chymotrypsin). These hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (60, 120, 160, and 240 min) were assayed for their antidiabetic activity. Results: Among the three different enzyme hydrolysates, casein treated with chymotrypsin shows the highest antidiabetic activity among other enzymes. While the antidiabetic effect of raw milk-derived casein hydrolysates always exceeds than effect shown by boiled milk casein hydrolysates. Conclusion: The result obtained hence shows that the effect of boiling on the properties of bioactive peptides released during different enzyme digestion depends largely on the enzymatic formulation used and treatment conditions. Chymotrypsin treatment of <b>raw</b> <b>casein</b> yields peptides with maximum antidiabetic activity as compared to pepsin and trypsin. Moreover, the peptides produced after enzymatic treatment of boiled casein show reduced antidiabetic properties. Therefore, enzymatically treated raw milk casein hydrolysates may be used as effective nutritional supplements for diabetic patients, as it causes a significant inhibition of α-amylase activity...|$|E
40|$|Phaseolus vulgaris phaseolin {{has been}} shown to stimulate faecal losses of {{endogenous}} N in rats. Experiments with purified phaseolin were carried out in rats to test the hypothesis that these losses reflect intestinal disorders. Phaseolin composition varies depending on its constitutive subunits. Therefore, three phaseolin types (S, T, I) were tested. Phaseolin T was incorporated in varying levels (0, 33, 67 or 100 % of the dietary protein) as raw material in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the three phaseolin types were incorporated at 50 %, with or without previous thermic treatment. <b>Raw</b> <b>casein</b> was the basal protein source and was also heated in experiment 2. Faecal digestibility of phaseolin and gut integrity were evaluated in both experiments. The incorporation level or type of phaseolin had little effect on gross anatomy of gut segments but these factors influenced the weight and pH of fresh contents of the stomach and caecum (P< 0 · 05). Raw phaseolin T incorporated at various levels led to an enlargement of duodenal villi together with a tendency for increased crypt depth in the jejunum (P= 0 · 06). Activities of both alkaline phosphatase in the duodenum and aminopeptidase N in the ileum decreased (P< 0 · 05) after thermal treatment of casein while they increased (P< 0 · 05) for heat-treated phaseolin S and T, respectively. In conclusion, raw phaseolin had no effect on the tissue weight of gut segments and induced limited alterations in the small intestine. Differences due to phaseolin level or type were limited too.

40|$|Raw, {{cooked and}} HCl-extracted baobab, Adansonia digitata seed meals {{were used for}} {{biological}} and nutritional evaluation studies. The seed is low in protein (16. 60 g/ 100 g DM) but {{could be a good}} source of oil (17. 50 g/ 100 g) and minerals, particularly sodium, potassium and phosphorus, which contained 228. 0, 1429. 0 and 924. 5 mg/ 100 gDM respectively. Low levels of antinutritional factors such as tannin, phytate, cyanide, oxalate, nitrate/nitrite and absence of trypsin inhibitors were observed. Seed protein is high in sulfur-amino acid, with a chemical score (CS) of 126. 80, but marginally limiting in lysine and threonine, with CS of 64. 31 and 85. 59 respectively based on the preschool age (2 - 5 yrs) reference protein requirement. The seed oil contain appreciable level of unsaturated fatty acids with oleic and linoleic acids making up 66. 32 % of total fatty acids. The raw diet was similar to the casein diet in weight gain, feed intake, net protein retention (NPR) and true digestibility (TD) but significantly inferior in protein effici ency ratio (PER). Cooking did not have any significant effect on feed intake but significantly lowered the weight gain relative to the <b>raw</b> and <b>casein</b> diets. HClextracted meal exerted significantly lower weight gain compared to the <b>raw,</b> cooked and <b>casein</b> diets. It is concluded that the raw seed showed promise as a source of food supplement and is likely to be satisfactory in supporting growth and maintenance in livestock feeding...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} changes in {{microstructure}} of <b>casein</b> micelles in <b>raw</b> and pasteurized milk were investigated by SEM and TEM. Milk was pasteurized by L. T. L. T. method (Temperature: 63 oC_ Time: 30 minute). Samples of raw and pasteurized milk {{were taken from}} research pilot plant of The College of Agriculture. Each sample was divided into two parts. One part of each sample was directly prepared for SEM and TEM, whereas the second part were renneted at 2 oC and kept at this temperature for 24 h. and then prepared for evaluation by electron microscopes. Results indicated that in native state, particularly in <b>raw</b> milk <b>casein</b> micelles are in spherical shape with smooth surface and in the single form. The samples, which stored in the cold were under {{the effect of the}} rennet, encounter of filamentous status that might be due to the changes occurred in kappa-casein following the action of rennet along with partial removal of beta-casein and micellar calcium phosphate. Micrographs of casein micelles in pasteurized milk indicated that thermal condition during pasteurization had influenced on increasing of casein micelles size...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} some {{properties of the}} casein micelles in the raw and pasteurized milk were studied by electron microscopy. SEM and TEM were {{used to evaluate the}} differences in acidified <b>casein</b> micelles of <b>raw</b> and pasteurized milk at the Iso Electric Point (pH= 4. 6). Milk samples were taken from research pilot plant of The College of Agriculture. Milk was pasteurized by the L. T. L. T. method in the same pilot plant. The samples of raw and pasteurized milk were divided into two parts. One part of raw and pasteurized milk was acidified to the Iso Electric Point of caseins (pH= 4. 6) by lactic acid (9 %) and then sample preparation for electron microscopy was done. According to the previous findings, results indicated that in the native pH, specially in fresh <b>raw</b> milk <b>casein</b> micelles were in spherical and individual form with the smooth surface. Aggregated casein micelles were present of acidified samples of the raw and pasteurized milk. Aggregation was the result of neutralization of electric charges in the isoelectric pH of casein and partial removal of micellar calcium phosphate. Results of both electron microscope confirmed each other and effects of heating on increasing of the casein micelle size during pasteurization were seen...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between somatic cell count (SCC) in <b>raw</b> milk and <b>casein</b> fractions of 15 batches of the corresponding ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk was examined. Raw milk was collected, pasteurised and submitted to UHT treatment. Samples of the UHT milk were taken on days 8, 30, 60, 90 and 120 of storage {{at room temperature}} and their casein fractions analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. SCC ranged from 197, 000 to 800, 000 cells/mL. No correlation (p> 0. 05) was found between SCC and K-casein concentrations in raw or UHT milks. The alpha(s 2) and P-casein concentrations in raw milk were negatively correlated with SCC (p< 0. 05). In UHT milk, negative correlations were observed for a, 1 -casein (p< 0. 05) and beta-casein (p< 0. 05) on the 8 th day, and for alpha S- 2 -casein (p< 0. 01) on the 60 th day of storage. Results indicate that higher SSC in raw milk is associated with substantial degradation of beta-casein and alpha(s) -casein, which may lead to quality defects in UHT milk during storage. Aust. J.
