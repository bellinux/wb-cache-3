40|$|Abstract Voice Over IP (VoIP) is a {{technology}} that could pass the voice traffic and data packet form over an IP network. Network {{can be used for}} intranet or Internet. Phone calls using VoIP has advantages in terms of cheaper cost of PSTN phone to more than half, because the cost is calculated by the cost of the global nature of the Internet. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol at the application layer that serves to establish, modify, and terminate a multimedia session involving one or more users. This SIP signaling has SIP message in text form that is used for session management by the SIP components, such as User Agent, Registrar, <b>Redirect</b> <b>Server,</b> and Proxy Server. Building a SIP communication requires SIP Express Router (SER) to be able to receive SIP messages, for handling the basic functions of SIP messages. Problems occur when the NAT through which the voice communication affected, blocked, starting from the sound that is not sent or one side of the sound are sent (half duplex). The method {{that could be used to}} penetrate NAT is to use a given mediaproxy random RTP port to penetrate NAT. 1...|$|E
40|$|SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is an application-layer control {{protocol}} for creating, modifying and terminating session {{with one or}} more participants. These seSSlOns include internet multimedia distribution. " SIP supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to the user's current location. In this SIP the basic language used is 12 ME Wireless toolkit. 12 ME supports layered software for the development of applications, targeted to run on small devices such as mobile phones, pagers etc. SIP describes how the message is transfer between client and client. Both contains SIP- INVITER and SIP- RECEIVER in that one client acts as SIP- INVITER and the other is used as SIP_RECEIVER. From the first client we are sending messages & images to the other client. It requires less API classes. It is easy to implement. Up to now we have described one to one message sending and receiving. If we want to initiate more than one client for sending messages and images it requires more API classes. For initiating more than one client we require the address of those clients and send requests to the server. The server receives those requests and searches for the appropriate client. This process is carried out by different servers like Proxy server, Location server, Registrar server, <b>Redirect</b> <b>server,</b> etc. School of Computingg, Communications and Electronic...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{introduce}} a new peer-to-peer (P 2 P) approach to instant messaging systems based on a fully decentralized network, and where each human owning a peer can control the traffic supported by her system. The control may be based on criteria such as: (a) her desire to help the endpoints of the communication, e. g., based on friendship, (b) her desire to help a cause, e. g., based on the content/topic of the communication, (c) reputation, or (d) the utility brought to her by the handled data. Peers need help to communicate when they are behind NATs. Unlike the P 2 P chat system used in Skype, no centralized servers are involved (no central <b>redirect</b> <b>server,</b> login server or web server). Providing intrinsic motivation such that peers help with traffic is important in order to eventually make an open source P 2 P chat system viable. In current non-incentive P 2 P systems like Skype, availability of open source versions can potentially starve the system of supernodes (since users can disable the resource consuming supernode-function). In our approach, each peer has equal privileges to any other peer. Nodes register their address with other peers of their choice, which can then act as directories on their behalf. Each peer with sufficient resources can voluntarily {{play the role of}} directory for her friends or of forwarding incoming messages to peers behind NATs.

40|$|Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) arises {{as a new}} {{standard}} of establishing and releasing connections for vast variety of multimedia applications. The protocol {{may be used for}} voice calls, video calls, video conferencing, gaming and many more. The 3 GPP (3 rd Generation Partnership Project) suggests SIP as the signalling solution for 3 rd generation telephony. Thereby, this purely IP-centric protocol appears as a promising alternative to older signalling systems such as H. 323, SS 7 or analog signals in PSTN. In contrast to them, SIP does not focus on communication with PSTN network. It is more similar to HTTP than to any of the mentioned protocols. The main standardisation body behind Session Initiation Protocol is The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The most recent paper published on SIP is RFC 3261 [5]. Moreover, there are working groups within IETF that publish suggestions and extensions to the main standard. One of those extensions is “Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) ” [1]. This document describes a set of new rules that allow a caller to express preferences about request handling in servers. They give ability to select which Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) a request gets routed to, and to specify certain request handling directives in proxies and <b>redirect</b> <b>servers.</b> It does so by defining three new request header fields, Accept-Contact, Reject-Contact, and Request-Disposition, which specify the caller preferences.

For providing multimedia services with high quality in MM-CDN, the traditional request routing approaches in CDN face two key challenges, namely performance and cost. To balance the tradeoff between performance and cost in MM-CDN, we propose an improved request routing approach. First, based on the idea of network coordinates, the computation and transfer costs of different server clusters are computed depending on the network and server status change. Then, all the server clusters are reorganized in the coordinate space. Finally, user requests can be adaptively <b>redirected</b> to the <b>server</b> clusters with minimum cost without sacrificing performance.

For device targeting, client side <b>redirects</b> or non-cacheable <b>server</b> side <b>redirects</b> are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually <b>server</b> side <b>redirects</b> are used for Geotargeting but client side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis proposes an infrastructure to dynamically replicate services across an internetwork and have them provide a single fault tolerant service access point to clients. For service replication, it relies on previous work for network support for large-scale service scaling within the HydraNet effort. The current work develops a means to combine service replication with TCP communication service to provide fault-tolerant services in a fully client-transparent fashion. The HydraNet-FT infrastructure consists of two components: host <b>servers</b> and <b>redirecting.</b> Host <b>servers</b> are hosts that are specially equipped to act as servers for replicated and fault-tolerant services. The location of the host servers is known to the redirecting, specially equipped routers that detect requests for replicated services and direct the requests to them. Host servers allow one-to-many message delivery from the client to servers and many-to-one message delivery from the servers to the clients. They also provide a low-latency failure estimator to determine server unavailability due to failure or congestion. A management protocol allows to dynamically install or remove service replica and reconfigure the system in case of failure or prolonged congestion of a server in the system. The thesis studies the results obtained by implementing the infrastructure on an experimental testbed. Throughput results indicate that the amount of overhead imposed by using the HydraNet-FT scheme is not unreasonably high...|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} adaptive framework {{improves the}} availability of the published web services through reacting to failures on the servers of the consumed services. The adaptation is realized by automatically replicating the failed services on another server. Then, the incoming requests would be transparently <b>redirected</b> to that <b>server.</b> Remarkably, the requests of a consumer will not be replicated; they will just be forwarded to the free replicas. The framework enhances the performance of the published services by using a centralized dynamic load balancing process (Alakeel 2010). The dynamic load balancing process is needed to make request balancing decisions at runtime. And the load balancing process, being centralized, will execute the utilized load balancing algorithm, e.g. the Round-Robin algorithm (Silberschatz et al. 2010), as a single service, called Load balancer. For example, if the server that publishes a particular web service becomes overloaded at some point in time, the suggested replication framework will make the required decision immediately to replicate the published web service on another server and balance the incoming requests between the original and the copied services.|$|R

40|$|Mobile IP {{can provide}} macromobility {{instead of the}} {{original}} IP existing communication. Mobile IP hosts are able to retain all existing communication, send and receive information while moving, despite their current point of attachment of Internet. Since the original mobile IP does not consider micromobility, it cannot avoid handoff latency. The latency causes packet loss or large variations of the packets delivery time. This study, proposed a mechanism to perform fast handoff in IP-based mobile networks for real time packet communication in a commercial cellular environment. Present proposal is used to re-establish the communication link quickly and to minimize the handoff latency that occurs during mobile IP handovers. In this scheme, two different mechanisms are proposed to handle micromobility and macromobility. The micromobility handover handles the movements within the same domain. Macromobility handover supports handovers between two adjacent domains. The reason for having several subnets is to deploy the network over a wide area to keep the mobile user in the same network as long as possible. The novelties of the scheme is to retransmit the buffered packets during micromobility handover and several multiple mobility agents protocols extensions have been proposed to avoid potential bottlenecks in single mobility agent configurations. Such multiple mobility agents schemes allow the use of dynamic load balancing policies to further improve the overall performance. Load balancing action consists of data flows being <b>redirected</b> to vacant <b>servers</b> (mobility agent) rather than packets being dequeued and moved among servers. The entire scheme is performed within the proposed hierarchical topology named as Seamless Handoff Architecture (SHA) based on next-generation IP networks in which both micromobility and macromobility handovers are analyzed. The architecture and simulation results presented {{in this study are}} based on the network simulator (ns- 2). The performance of the proposed architecture is compared with hierarchical mobile IP micromobility protocol. From the results, it is observed that, in the proposed architecture the handoff latency due to binding updates is reduced because of localizing the binding updates and thereby reducing the probability of the packet loss during handoff...|$|R
