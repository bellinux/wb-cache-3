5000|$|RMGs are the {{finished}} textile product from clothing factories and the Bangladeshi RMG sector {{is one of}} the fastest growing sectors in the Bangladeshi economy, with a growth rate of 55% from 2002 to 2012. Exports of textiles, clothing, and ready-made garments (RMG) accounted for 77% of Bangladesh’s total merchandise exports in 2002.By 2005 the (<b>RMG)</b> <b>industry</b> was the only multibillion-dollar manufacturing and export industry in Bangladesh, accounting for 75 per cent of the country's earnings in that year. Bangladesh's export trade is now dominated by the ready-made garments (<b>RMG)</b> <b>industry.</b> In 2012 Bangladesh’s garment exports - mainly to the US and Europe - made up nearly 80% of the country’s export income. By 2014 the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> represented 81.13 percent of Bangladesh's total export. Much of the tremendous growth of the sector and its role as an economic powerhouse for the country is attributed to the availability of [...] "cheap" [...] labor. Of the four million workers employed by the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry,</b> 85% are illiterate women from rural villages.

This paper examines the issues related to wage income differentials in RMG sector. In fact wage determination behavior during the last two decades did not follow one of the basic premises in the theory of labor market in economics. In general, employment and wage determined by the marginal productivity of labor in value term. Labor Market {{outcomes in}} Bangladesh {{at different stages of}} industrialization need not be similar as behavioral rationality of economic agents depends on the market context. Women are increasingly becoming visible in the productive labor force in Bangladesh. The surplus labor is expected to take in the family farms in the rural areas and in other informal enterprise. During the last two decades, rapid changes had taken place in this scenario. Women’s employment in garment factories is one of these changes. The garment sector is rapidly rising in the country since the 1980 ’s. The paper is based survey findings conducted among the woman’s workers of <b>RMG</b> <b>industries</b> located at Dhaka and Narayangong – the second largest hub of RMG factories in Bangladesh. The study was conducted on 200 female garment workers of 20 garment industries. This paper investigates the existing labor market and status of women workers in the context of wage discrimination based on gender, obstacles of work place environment in and outside of the industries.

The comparative advantages of different countries and companies‟ intention to maintain increased focus on their core businesses drive them to go for offshore production sourcing their needs by utilizing an effective supply chain system. Although global outsourcing enables companies to achieve competitive advantage but the outsourcing operations {{is not easy to}} perform. Several factors are involved which ultimately affects the efficiency of the entire Supply Chain system and global outsourcing firms in different locations could face problem that make it challenging for managers. Therefore, {{it is important to consider}} these inefficiency factors while conducting outsourcing operations in Global market. Purpose The purpose of our thesis is to investigate how inefficiency factors affect the Supply Chain system of Multi National Corporations (MNC‟s) during outsourcing process. With that view we have analyzed what implications of these factors in overall efficiency in entire value chain System, how these factor affects Supply Chain efficiency and, in particular, which factors are significantly responsible for inefficiency. We will also analyze probable solutions to minimize inefficiency in Cross Border Outsourcing. Case Study We have selected the Ready Made Garments <b>industry</b> (<b>RMG)</b> of Bangladesh to investigate our problem. Ready Made Garments <b>industry</b> (<b>RMG)</b> in Bangladesh has emerged as the main export earning sector in Bangladesh and in 2008 - 2009 financial year 79. 33 % of its total export income from this sector. We have selected H&M as our case company as it has been sourcing in Bangladesh since 1981. Research Findings: Study finding shows that some factors acting as a hindrance to this smooth operation in cross boarder outsourcing. Finally we analyzed several factors and find out the potential ways to minimize the effect of these inefficiency factors and recommended some probable measures to increase overall supply chain efficiency in total value chain system.

40|$|In Bangladesh a {{significant}} amount of foreign currency comes from the <b>RMG</b> sector. Garment <b>industries</b> in developing countries are more focused on sourcing of raw material and minimizing delivery cost than labor productivity because of the availability of cheap labor. Due to this, labor productivity is lower in developing countries than in the developed ones. So productivity improvement {{is one of the major}} concern in garments factories. This paper addresses the scope of value stream mapping (VSM) application in a selected garments factory of Bangladesh. The core idea behind the thesis work was to examine the existing condition of production system where there is no application of VSM technique and to analyze the scope of VSM technique application in the studied production line. The main objective of the research paper is to identify various wastes occurs in the production system. Additionally it tries to find out some areas for improvement and propose some improvement strategies. In this concern this case study has been conducted focusing cutting, finishing and on a particular production line of sewing section in a selected garments factory. During the investigation, attention has been concentrated how non- value adding activity hampers daily production rate and how to improve the productivity. Value adding, non-value adding (necessary and unnecessary) processes and different types of wastes have been identified by drawing the current state map for cutting, sewing and finishing sections.

40|$|The Readymade Garment (<b>RMG)</b> <b>industry</b> of Bangladesh {{has emerged}} as a {{competent}} garment producer in global garment business in recent times. This industry has successfully transformed Bangladesh into an export-oriented economy. The <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> also became the major foreign currency-earning sector with highest rates of absorption of industrial employment. Interestingly, women comprise more than 80 percent of the total labour force and most of them could be otherwise destitute or empty handed. In a patriarchal society like Bangladesh, the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> effectively challenged the traditional view of conflating domesticity with femininity by allowing women of low-income backgrounds to move from the household to the labour market. Garment trade is regarded as a leading driver of globalisation. Though garment workers gain much by working in the garment industry the informal nature of job and adverse working conditions often threaten the livelihood possibilities of workers. This study focuses on the labour rights implementation in the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> in Bangladesh. It is assumed that labour rights safeguard workers from negative consequences. It is also evident that labour rights increase labour productivity. Theoretically there are opportunities to establish labour rights in the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> but in practice the picture is simply unsatisfactory. The recent labour unrest in Bangladesh is the outcome of longstanding violation of labour rights in the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry.</b> Labour rights can be ensured if Bangladesh Government can formulate and implement a comprehensive and effective labour law that incorporates labour rights in the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry.</b> The existing business model favoured multinational enterprises headquartered in developed countries and largely overlooks labourers’ interests especially in developing countries. The organizations such as ILO, WTO, which are supposed to protect labourers from insecurity, vulnerability and injustice, are somehow problematic in relation to the implementation of labour rights in Least Developed countries. The <b>RMG</b> <b>industry</b> is the lifeline of Bangladesh economy and it has the potentialities to reduce poverty to a large extent by gaining increasing share in the world apparel market. Implementation of labour rights can ensure sustainable livelihood of the garment workers, which in turn enhances sustainability of the <b>RMG</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|E

Because of quota system abolition many of the less efficient suppliers will lose quota rents and market shares as {{they are forced to}} compete with more efficient suppliers among developing countries. Since 1974, Bangladesh was enjoying a quota free access of garments under the Multi- Fibre Arrangement (MFA). But the phase out of the Multi- Fibre Arrangement (MFA) has completed in 2005 under the Uruguay round of GATT (General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade) in 1994. The freeing of trade in textiles and clothing has created a formidable challenge to the Bangladesh Ready Made Garments (<b>RMG)</b> <b>Industry.</b> The phase-out of the MFA, emergence of competitors such as China, India, Vietnam, Turkey, Mexico and African nations have negatively impacted on the fortunes of Bangladesh RMG sector. Dependence on imported raw materials, political instability, turbulent economy, high bank interest rates, lack of government incentives, poor knowledge of international marketing, port problem, poor infrastructure and labor union are some of the internal problems of Bangladesh RMG. This sector is being incrementally faced with the burden of obligations imposed by the developed countries in the guise of compliance issues. There are two types of views about the future of Bangladesh Ready Made Garments (<b>RMG)</b> <b>Industry</b> after MFA era. The optimistic view emphasized that Bangladesh had held a strong position in the global market due to its abundant supply of cheap labor.
