50|$|Honda {{released}} its first mid-sized four-stroke scooter onto the western {{market in the}} spring of 1984. The Elite 125 (CH125) continued Honda's trend of shifting from two-stroke engines to the much more emissions friendly four-stroke engine. The 1984 Elite featured many new technologies never before seen on a conventional scooter, such as a <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamp,</b> liquid-cooled engine, a digital dashboard, and more.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s British Leyland started an {{intensive}} programme of vehicle safety research, producing {{a number of}} prototype experimental safety vehicles demonstrating various innovations for occupant and pedestrian protection such as air bags, anti-lock brakes, impact-absorbing side-panels, front and rear head restraints, run-flat tires, smooth and deformable front-ends, impact-absorbing bumpers, and <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps.</b> Design has also been influenced by government legislation, such as the Euro NCAP impact test.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{many parts}} of the {{interior}} and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps</b> no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model; its dimensions were: length 3945 mm, width 1678 mm, height 1228 mm and wheelbase 2265 mm. Without options, the NB weighed 1000 kg. The new generation was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a [...]|$|R
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps,</b> such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{glass cockpit}} in back, a squared {{steering}} wheel resembling a superellipse (with n = 3‚ÅÑ2, a = b = 1) and thermostatically controlled air conditioning system. The interior is rust colored {{in contrast to}} the ruby paintwork. The design included the first backseat-mounted radio loudspeakers and hidden windshield wipers, which start themselves when it rains. Other features include <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps,</b> rear turn signals which swivel as the car turns, 'floating' bumpers and a trunk that was hinged from the driver's side. Each of the four bucket seats have their own thermostatically controlled air conditioning, individual cigarette lighters and ashtrays, as well as a radio loudspeaker. The original engine, a Cadillac V8, was later replaced by a high-performance Ford engine when it was taken on the show circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The HBR {{was first}} {{introduced}} as the [...] "DB Coach" [...] at the 1954 Paris Salon, with production beginning in January 1955. An earlier prototype with a body made of Duralinox (an aluminium-magnesium alloy) had been shown at the 1953 Paris Salon, but productionising the car took some time. The early Chausson designs received <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps</b> and often the front portion of the roof is plexiglass. This plexiglass sunroof, with a removable inner cover, continued to be available throughout the HBR's life. Chausson built the fibreglass body; this was considered an experience-gaining effort and DB was charged a very modest per-unit price. The first hundred interim cars were built by Chausson, after which, experiment over, they sold the tooling to Deutsch and Bonnet themselves. They in turn turned the equipment over to another bodybuilding company which proceeded to sell the finished bodies to DB, meaning DB {{got into the car}} manufacturing business at a minimal cost. The first Coach/HBR had a [...] version of the 848 cc Panhard Dyna engine, with twin Solex carburettors. Early models, show cars in particular, also often exhibited luxurious equipment with lots of chrome and two-tone paintjobs.|$|R
5000|$|The 3rd Generation of Firebirds {{consisted}} of three models: Firebird, Firebird S/E, and Firebird Trans Am. The Firebird was the base model, equivalent to the Camaro Sport Coupe; the Firebird S/E was the luxury version; and the Trans Am, the high-performance version. For 1982, the new Firebird and Camaro had been completely restyled, with the windshield slope set at a dramatic, more aerodynamic 62 degrees, (about 3 degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), flush mounted side glass, {{and for the first}} time, a large, glass-dominated rear hatchback. Electronically controlled <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps,</b> and a rounded hoodline and front fenders were the primary characteristics that distinguished the Firebird from its Camaro sibling and its previous Firebird incarnations. The Firebird would retain hidden headlamps until the end of all production in 2002. Pontiac had also hoped to drop the [...] "Trans Am" [...] moniker from the redesigned cars to save royalties paid to the SCCA for use of the name. Early promotional cars were marked [...] "T/A" [...] as an alternative, however it was decided that doing so might cause more problems than it was worth and the [...] "Trans Am" [...] nameplate remained. Still, with its dimensions reduced, wheelbase shortened, and weight reduced, the Third Generation Firebird was also the closest yet in size to the original 1967 model. It won [...] "Best Sports GT" [...] category in the $11,000 to $14,000 range (also along with the Camaro). Road & Track called the fuel-injected Trans Am [...] "a dramatic improvement on its predecessors," [...] accelerating from 0-60 in 9.2 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing {{more than}} 8 inches in overall length, {{measured}} {{about an inch}} narrower, and weighed nearly 500 lb less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of [...]32. The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 {{would be the most}} aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The <b>retractable</b> <b>headlamps</b> popped up from {{the leading edge of the}} hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided [...] of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper. It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.The front end of the vehicle featured 10.5 in power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.|$|R
