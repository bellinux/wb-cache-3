500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. [...] Stevens stated that [...] "There {{can be no doubt that}} the challenged practices of the NCAA constitute a 'restraint of trade'" [...] but noted not all restraints of trade were unreasonable, and that only an unreasonable restraint was prohibited by the Sherman Antitrust Act. [...] Stevens noted that a league governing body was necessary for sporting events to take place and determined that the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason,</b> not [...] rules applied to the case. [...] Stevens determined that since the NCAA restrained price and output, it created a system that was unrelated to a free and competitive market. [...] Since the NCAA television plan constituted a restraint of trade on its face, it placed the burden on the NCAA of establishing an affirmative defense that would justify the deviation from a free market.|$|E

6000|$|Sir, when I cannot obey all his laws, I will do {{the best}} I can. I will {{endeavor}} to obey such of them as have the sanction of his example, and to stick to that rule which, though {{not consistent with the}} other, is the most rational. He was certainly in the right, when he took the matter largely. I cannot prevail on myself to agree with him in his censure of his own conduct. It is not, he will give me leave to say, either useless or dangerous. He asserts, that retrospect is not wise; and the proper, the only proper subject of inquiry, is [...] "not how we got into this difficulty, but how we are to get out of it." [...] In other words, we are, according to him, to consult our invention, and to reject our experience. The mode of deliberation he recommends is diametrically opposite to every <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason</b> and every principle of good sense established amongst mankind. For that sense and that reason I have always understood absolutely to prescribe, whenever we are involved in difficulties from the measures we have pursued, that we should take a strict review of those measures, in order to correct our errors, if they should be corrigible,--or at least to avoid a dull uniformity in mischief, and the unpitied calamity of being repeatedly caught in the same snare.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{a painful}} truth {{that not only}} individuals, but even whole nations, are ofttimes so enslaved to the habits of their {{education}} and immediate circumstances, as not to judge disinterestedly even on those subjects, the very pleasure arising from which consists in its disinterestedness, namely, on subjects of taste and polite literature. Instead of deciding concerning their own modes and customs by any <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>reason,</b> nothing appears rational, becoming, or beautiful to them, but what coincides with the peculiarities of their education. In this narrow circle, individuals may attain to exquisite discrimination, as the French critics have done in their own literature; but a true critic can no more be such without placing himself on some central point, from which he may command the whole, that is, some general rule, which, founded in reason, or the faculties common to all men, must therefore apply to each,--than an astronomer can explain {{the movements of the}} solar system without taking his stand in the sun. And let me remark, that this will not tend to produce despotism, but, on the contrary, true tolerance, in the critic. He will, indeed, require, as the spirit and substance of a work, something true in human nature itself, and independent of all circumstances; but in the mode of applying it, he will estimate genius and judgment according to the felicity with which the imperishable soul of intellect shall have adapted itself to the age, the place, and the existing manners. The error he will expose, lies in reversing this, and holding up the mere circumstances as perpetual to the utter neglect of the power which can alone animate them. For art cannot exist without, or apart from, nature; and what has man of his own to give to his fellow-man, but his own thoughts and feelings, and his observations so far as they are modified by his own thoughts or feelings? ...|$|E
