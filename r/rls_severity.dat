A standard set of scales (<b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> scale IRLS, SF- 36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) in mailed questionnaires was repeatedly used to assess <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> and health status over time and a 7 -day diary once to assess short-term variations. A clinically relevant change of the <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> was defined by a change of at least 5 points on the IRLS scale.

40|$|Background. Uraemic {{restless legs}} {{syndrome}} (RLS) affects {{a significant proportion of}} patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) therapy. Exercise training has been shown to improve RLS symptoms in uraemic RLS patients; however, the mechanism of exercise-induced changes in <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> is still unknown. The aim of the current randomized controlled exercise trial was to investigate whether the reduction of <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> often seen after training, is due to expected systemic exercise adaptations or it is mainly due to the relief that leg movements confer during exercise training on a cycle ergometer. This is the first randomized controlled exercise study in uraemic RLS patients. Twenty-four RLS HD patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the progressive exercise training group (n 12) and the control exercise with no resistance group (n 12). The exercise session in both groups included intradialytic cycling for 45 min at 50 rpm. However, only in the progressive exercise training group was resistance applied, at 6065 of maximum exercise capacity, which was reassessed every 4 weeks to account for the patients improvement. The severity of RLS symptoms was evaluated using the IRLSSG severity scale, functional capacity by a battery of tests, while sleep quality, depression levels and daily sleepiness status were assessed via validated questionnaires, before and after the intervention period. All patients completed the exercise programme with no adverse effects. RLS symptom severity declined by 58 (P 0. 003) in the progressive exercise training group, while a no statistically significant decline was observed in the control group (17 change, P 0. 124). Exercise training was also effective in terms of improving functional capacity (P 0. 04), sleep quality (P 0. 038) and depression score (P 0. 000) in HD patients, while no significant changes were observed in the control group. After 6 months of the intervention, <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> (P 0. 017), depression score (P 0. 002) and daily sleepiness status (P 0. 05) appeared to be significantly better in the progressive exercise group compared with the control group. A 6 -month intradialytic progressive exercise training programme appears to be a safe and effective approach in reducing RLS symptom severity in HD patients. It seems that exercise-induced adaptations to the whole body are mostly responsible for the reduction in <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> score, since the exercise with no applied resistance protocol failed to improve the <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> status of the patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was {{to study}} not only the {{prevalence}} but more importantly the severity and the correlation between sleep quality and restless legs syndrome (RLS) in a large population of well-defined migraine patients as poor sleep presumably triggers migraine attacks. METHODS: In a large cross-sectional and observational study, data on migraine and RLS were collected from 2385 migraine patients (according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders ICHD-IIIb) and 332 non-headache controls. <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> (International RLS Study Group severity scale) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed. Risk factors for RLS and <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> were calculated using multivariable-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Restless legs syndrome prevalence in migraine was higher than in controls (16. 9 % vs. 8. 7 %; multivariable-adjusted odds ratio 1. 83; 95 % confidence interval 1. 18 - 2. 86; P = 0. 008) and more severe (adjusted severity score 14. 5 ± 0. 5 vs. 12. 0 ± 1. 1; P = 0. 036). Poor sleepers were overrepresented amongst migraineurs (50. 1 % vs. 25. 6 %; P < 0. 001). Poorer sleep quality was independently associated with RLS occurrence (odds ratio 1. 08; P < 0. 001) and <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> (P < 0. 001) in migraine patients.

Participants of a web-based survey answered the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and, if the diagnostic criteria of RLS were met, the International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale. Diagnosis of RLS was affirmed in screen-positive patients by means of a standardized telephone interview. HRQoL was assessed by using the SF- 36 questionnaire. Age- and sex-matched control subjects were recruited from waiting relatives of surgical outpatients. 227 adult self-reported CMT patients answered the above questionnaires, 42. 9 % were male, and 57. 1 % were female. Age ranged from 18 to 78  years. Compared to controls (n =  234), CMT patients reported significantly higher fatigue, a higher extent and prevalence of daytime sleepiness and worse sleep quality. Prevalence of RLS was 18. 1 % in CMT patients and 5. 6 % in controls (p =  0. 001). <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> was correlated with worse sleep quality and reduced HRQoL. Women with CMT were affected more often and more severely by RLS than male patients. With regard to fatigue, sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, RLS prevalence, <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> and HRQoL, we did not find significant differences between genetically distinct subtypes of CMT. HRQoL is reduced in CMT patients which may be due to fatigue, sleep-related symptoms, and RLS in particular.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Whereas {{insomnia}} is frequent in {{restless legs}} syndrome (RLS), {{little is known about}} daytime sleepiness. We studied a series of 27 consecutive patients with idiopathic RLS in order to identify the characteristics and evolution of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) under dopaminergic treatment. METHODS: Patients were assessed by clinical examination, questionnaires and video-polysomnography (PSG). Sleepy patients, as defined by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) > 10, were also assessed by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). We excluded RLS patients with other sleep-wake disorders, in particular chronic sleep deprivation. RESULTS: Mean age was 56 years, the mean International RLS Study Group Rating Scale score was 24 at baseline. Ten (37 %) of the 27 patients reported EDS. RLS patients with sleepiness had a higher amount of total sleep time (p = 0. 029) on PSG and a mean sleep latency of 6. 4 min on MSLT. No other differences regarding clinical or polysomnographic parameters were found. <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> improved in all patients under dopaminergic treatment (p = 0. 001); this was also the case for the ESS score in sleepy patients (p = 0. 007).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the influences of hormones and menstrual cycle on the severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in reproductive women. Materials and Methods: A total of 381 volunteered women (aged 14 - 53 years) were interviewed using a validated diagnostic questionnaire to determine the presence of the disease. Volunteers were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics. 54 women who fulfilled the disease criteria were administered the International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale. The patients were also assessed by using the Short Form- 36 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in order to evaluate the quality of life. Blood samples were drawn on the days 3, 13 and 23 of the menstrual cycle to determine hormone levels. Results: There was no statistically significant difference among the groups in terms of the 381 women surveyed, 14. 2 % were positive for the disease. Severity of the disease symptoms were not correlated with hormone levels. We found no association of RLS with educational level, smoking, marital status and number of parity. However, a significant difference was found in alcohol intake and caffeine consumption between patients and controls (p< 0. 05). Perceived <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> was increased significantly in the follicular phase. The severity of the disease symptoms affected sleep quality and quality of life. No correlation was observed between hormone levels and SF- 36 scores. Conclusion: RLS is a common disease, affecting women in reproductive ages more often than in post-menopausal ages. Female hormonal changes do not correlate with the severity of RLS symptoms. RLS is perceived more severely in the follicular phase.

40|$|Menopause in {{the female}} life cycle is a special period due to {{important}} hormonal, physical and psychological changes. Sleep disruption represents a common complaint for midlife and menopausal women, related to primary sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), mood and anxiety disorder, other medical illness, hormonal-related vasomotor symptoms, and aging per se. Aims of our study were to evaluate the prevalence of sleep disorders {{in a sample of}} pre and post menopausal women, and to investigate the relationship between sleep and other medical disorders, and life habits. Among workers in the six participant centers, we enrolled 334 women, aged between 40 and 60 years, that completed a questionnaire that included screening on menarche, menstrual cycle, fertility, parity, menopause, life habits, personal medical and sleep history and related treatment, and self-administered scales for sleep quality (PSQI), excessive daytime sleepiness [Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ], mood disorder [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ], Berlin Questionnaire for sleep disordered breathing (SDB), IRLS diagnostic interview and Rating Scale.

Methods: In an observational cross-sectional design, we evaluated the psychological features of 166 consecutive RLS patients from three outpatient clinics, by means of the Symptom Checklist 90 -R (SCL- 90 -R) questionnaire. Additionally, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale (IRLS) were measured.

40|$|Background: The {{aetiology}} of uremic {{restless legs}} syndrome (RLS) remains unclear. Our research investigated whether an elevated plasma concentration of the excitatory amino acid homocysteine might be associated with RLS occurrence in patients with chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis. Methods: Total plasma homocysteine as well as creatinine, urea, folate, parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and albumin levels were compared between 26 RLS-affected (RLSpos) and 26 non-affected (RLSneg) patients on chronic hemodialysis. We further compared subjective sleep quality between RLSpos and RLSneg patients using the Pittsburgh-Sleep-Quality-Index and investigated possible relationships between laboratory parameters and sleep quality. Results: Taking individual albumin concentrations into account, a significant positive correlation between total plasma homocysteine and RLS occurrence was observed (r= 0. 246; p= 0. 045). Sleep quality was significantly more reduced in RLSpos compared to RLSneg patients and <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> correlated positively with impairment of sleep quality. Bad sleep quality in all patients was associated with higher concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Conclusion: Our results suggest a possible aetiological role of homocysteine in uremic RLS.

40|$|Background: Augmentation is {{the main}} {{complication}} during long-term dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and reflects an overall increase in <b>RLS</b> <b>severity.</b> Its severity varies considerably from a minor problem to a devastating exacerbation of disease. Despite its clinical relevance, systematic evaluations have rarely been undertaken {{and there has been}} no development of methods to assess the severity of augmentation. To fill this gap, the European RLS Study Group (EURLSSG) has developed the Augmentation Severity Rating Scale (ASRS), using three items that assess the degree of change in three specific dimensions of augmentation. The changes in each dimension are summed to give an ASRS total score. Methods: The ASRS was developed to cover the basic dimensions defining RLS augmentation. The items were developed by an interactive process involving professional and patient input. The ASRS that was evaluated included four major items and two alternative forms of one item. The validation was conducted using 63 (85 %) mostly untreated RLS patients from six centers, who were treated for six months with levodopa (l-Dopa) (up to 500 mg/day, as clinically needed). Two consecutive assessments before and at baseline measured test-retest reliability. Consecutive ASRS ratings by two independent raters on a subsample of patients evaluated inter-rater reliability. Comparison with clinical severity ratings of two independent experts provided external validation of the ASRS. Comparison of patients with and without augmentation with regard to the items and the total score of the ASRS added discriminant validity. Results: Sixty patients (63 % females, mean age: 53 years, baseline International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Rating (IRLS) score 24. 7 ± 5. 2) were treated with a median daily dose of 300 mg l-Dopa (range: 50 - 500 mg). Thirty-six patients (60 %) experienced augmentation. Item analyses indicated that one item could be removed as it did not contribute significantly to the test score and only one form of the duplicated item needed to be used. The final ASRS then included three items. Test-retest reliability for the total score was ρ = 0. 72, and inter-rater reliability was rcc = 0. 94. Cronbach's α was 0. 62. Validity as assessed by the correlation between the worst ASRS total score during the trial and the expert rating was ρ = 0. 72. ASRS total score differed between patients without versus with augmentation (mean: 7. 4 (standard deviation (SD) = 4. 0) vs. 2. 0 (2. 7) (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The ASRS is a reliable and valid scale to measure the severity of augmentation. Due to the need to systematically quantify augmentation for both long-term efficacy and tolerability, the ASRS may become a useful tool to monitor augmentation in future clinical trials. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) is {{the most}} widely used of the scales rating the {{severity}} of restless legs syndrome/Willis–Ekbom disease (RLS/WED). It has been well validated and is the primary end point for most of the therapeutic and nontherapeutic studies of RLS/WED. It has excellent psychometric properties, although it does not capture the severity of RLS under a wide variety of circumstances and times of day. Moreover, the IRLS has a large placebo effect. MethodsThe Restless Legs Syndrome- 6 Scale (RLS- 6), however, takes another potentially valuable approach. Six items are rated on a 0 – 10 scale from no symptoms at 0 to very severe at 10. In addition to questions on satisfaction with sleep and sleepiness, the scale rates the severity of RLS for the past week under four separate circumstances: while falling asleep, during the night, during the day while sitting or lying, and during the day when moving around. The purpose of the current study is to report the validation of the RLS- 6 under baseline and therapeutic conditions. ResultsThe RLS- 6 seems to be an acceptable, reliable, precise, valid, and responsive instrument for the assessment of <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> in a specific and pragmatic manner.

METHODS: Twenty RLS patients were monitored for 10 - 15 nights using a validated, tri-axial accelerometer worn on the ankle. RESULTS: The mean difference in PLMs index (PLMI) between the lowest and highest night was 25. 1 /h (range: 3. 9 - 73. 8). Inter-subject differences accounted for nearly five times the variance in PLMI relative to between nights within an individual. Based on a single night of recording, PLMI criterion thresholds of 5, 10, and 15 /h were exceeded on approximately 70. 1 %, 51. 9 % and 34. 1 % of individual nights among these patients. Based on five randomly sampled nights of recordings, the likelihood that such thresholds were met on at least a single night increased to 91. 2 %, 80. 8 % and 62. 7 %, respectively. Women exhibited greater variability. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in PLMs within RLS subjects was substantial, yet individuals' characteristic PLM level represented a quantitative trait. Variability was unrelated to age or scores on scales of <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> sleepiness, functional status, and mood. A larger number of recording nights increased the likelihood that any criterion was reached...|$|E

This unique responsiveness of RLS to both dopaminergic agents and opioids places it at the crossroad of the two systems implicated in the placebo response. Indeed, in recent large-scale studies a substantial placebo response was observed. We performed a meta-analysis to provide an evidence-based estimate of the magnitude of the placebo response in RLS. Search strategies included the electronic databases PubMed and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (from 1966 to March 2007), the reference lists of retrieved articles, hand-searching abstract books of sleep, neurology andmovement disorder congresses and visiting clinical trial register web sites. All randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies exploring a pharmacological treatment in subjects with RLS were considered. Outcome measures from five domains were extracted: <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> subjective sleep parameters, sleep parameters derived from nocturnal poly-somnography, periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) and daytime functioning. We identified 60 clinical trials and 36 of them were eligible for the meta-analysis. In 24 trials, the pooled placebo response rate wa...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of restless legs syndrome (RLS) on quality of life (QoL), anxiety, and depression in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. RLS was diagnosed by a neurologist masked on psychological evaluation. Data on severity, frequency, and duration of the sleep disorder were collected. The Italian version of the SF- 36 was used to assess QoL. Psychological status was investigated by a neuropsychologist masked on RLS diagnosis. Patients with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) were considered affected by anxiety and depression, respectively. A modified version of the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales (HARS and HDRS) was also administered. RESULTS: RLS was an independent predictor for several mental domains of the SF- 36 and for the mental component summary. Multivariate analysis showed that RLS was an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> correlated with HARS and HDRS scores, whereas frequency per week of RLS had a significant correlation only with HARS score. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with diabetes, RLS can impair mental health, increasing the risk for anxiety and depression. Since RLS consequences on nocturnal rest and psychological status may impair glycemic control in this population, diabetologists and diabetes educators should investigate for the presence of RLS in their patients and treat them...|$|E
40|$|Objective: the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} identify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant Brazilian women, with individual diagnostic clinical interviews during the trimesters of pregnancy, and to determine the severity. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. We interviewed 524 pregnant women (18 - 45 years old) who came to the prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician. We used a RLS clinical-diagnostic interview and the International RLS Study Group rating scale (IRLS). Results: the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy was 13. 5 % in our sample, among which 90. 1 % of the cases started with their symptoms during pregnancy. More than half of the patients (53. 5 %) presented severe or very severe symptoms and the largest proportion of them (15. 2 %) were in their third trimester. We did not observe any demographic differences among the trimesters for RLS prevalence and <b>RLS</b> <b>severity.</b> Conclusion: RLS during pregnancy is more frequent than in the general population, such that more than half of the pregnant women with RLS present it severely or very severely. It occurs especially in the third trimester. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The ramularia {{leaf spot}} (RLS) disease causes cotton yield losses. Choosing a less {{susceptible}} cultivar and a sowing time {{that are less}} favorable to the pathogen contribute to the management of this disease. The objective of this work was to evaluate the severity of ramularia leaf spot on cotton cultivars sowed in two different times. The experiment was conducted in a triple factorial design (4 x 3 x 2), consisted of four cultivars, the three thirds of the plant and two sowing times, with four replications. Each plot was divided in two twin plots, one with fungicide application (with disease control) and the other without fungicide application (without disease control). The severity assessments were performed every seven days, considering each third of the plant with a diagrammatic scale. Yield was evaluated in each plot. There was a significant interaction between sowing times and the thirds of the plant in the plots without disease control for <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> with the highest values of area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) in the first sowing time (ST 1) and in the lower third of the plant. The FMT 705 cultivar had the highest and FM 951 LL the lowest value of AUDPC. The AUDPC of these cultivars were no statistically different in the second sowing time (ST 2), but they had higher AUDPC values in the lower third. Highest yields were found with ST 1 in plots with disease control, with no differences between the cultivars, however, lower yields were found in plots without disease control...|$|E
40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} neurological condition, frequently idiopathic, sometimes associated with specific disorders such as iron deficiency. We investigated RLS prevalence in celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease characterized by several features such as malabsorption-related iron deficiency anemia and peripheral neuropathy. We screened a population of 100 adult CD patients for CD features, iron metabolism, clinical and neurological conditions, and enrolled 100 age- and sex-matched controls in the general population. RLS was ascertained in CD patients and controls by both {{the presence of the}} four essential International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria and neurological examination. The International RLS Study Group rating scale was used to measure <b>RLS</b> <b>severity.</b> We found a 31 % prevalence of RLS in the CD population that was significantly higher than the prevalence in the control population (4 %; P < 0. 001). The average severity of RLS in CD population was moderate (17 6 6. 5). In the CD population, no significant correlation was found between RLS and either gluten-free diet or iron metabolism, despite hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in CD patients with RLS than without RLS (P 5 0. 003). We found no correlation between RLS and other possible causes of secondary RLS, including signs of peripheral neuropathy, pregnancy, end-stage renal disease, and pharmacological treatments. Our study broadens the spectrum of neurological disorders associated with CD and indicates that RLS should be sought for in all patients with CD. 2010 Movement Disorder Society Key words: restless legs syndrome; celiac disease; sleep disorder...|$|E
40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{the most}} common movement disorder in pregnancy, which can be idiopathic or secondary. There are limited comparative data regarding these two forms of RLS. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare clinical features of idiopathic and secondary RLS in pregnant women. Over a period of 3 months, 443 women who admitted for delivery in two clinical centers were screened for RLS using four diagnostic criteria of the international RLS study group. A total of 79 subjects diagnosed with RLS were consecutively enrolled in the present study. All of them were interviewed for medical history and complaints during pregnancy and responded to self-administer international RLS rating scale. Ten subjects (12. 9 %) out of 79 pregnant women with RLS had idiopathic form, and their mean age was significantly higher than patients with secondary RLS (30. 6 ± 7. 3 years vs. 26. 4 ± 4. 6 years, P = 0. 0260). Compared with women with secondary RLS, sleep duration in pregnancy was significantly decreased in idiopathic RLS group (P = 0. 0460), whereas <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> score was similar in both groups. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of other sleep complaints, the positive family history of RLS, parity, duration of pregnancy, or frequency of cesarean section (P > 0. 0500). Idiopathic and secondary RLS have relatively similar courses and features during pregnancy. However, the idiopathic form may have more negative impact on sleep in pregnancy.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of {{restless legs syndrome}} (RLS) is approximately 10 % in general population. This condition is more prevalent in certain diseases and we previously reported the {{prevalence of}} RLS in chronic liver disease population to be 62 %. Objectives: Our aim {{was to assess the}} self-reported prevalence of RLS using an RLS symptom specific questionnaire in liver transplant patients. Methods: Subjects were a convenience sample in transplant clinic. They completed a validated survey for core RLS symptoms and if positive went on to completed a telephone survey using the validated International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale Questionnaire (IRLS) and the Johns Hopkins RLS QoL survey to measure the effect of RLS symptoms on daily activities. Results: 40 patients surveyed, RLS was found in 16 subjects (40 %) with moderate severity { 17 (SD + 7. 2, high score 31) }. Hepatitis C as indication for liver transplant was more likely associated with RLS (p = 0. 05). Calcium channel blockers were protective (p = 0. 032) while antidopaminergic agent use was statistically significant for RLS symptom (p = 0. 005). On multiple linear regression analysis, diabetes (p = 0. 024) and use of antidepressants/antihistamines (p = 0. 049) were associated with RLS. Quality of Life (QoL) surveys specific to RLS suggested RLS symptoms resulted in significantly diminished QoL, with an average QoL score of 80 (SD + 11. 7). Conclusion: There was a very high prevalence of RLS in our liver transplant patients with majority experiencing moderate or severe symptoms. The explanation for this higher prevalence is likely due to combination of comorbidites as well as medications that can trigger RLS. </span...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Recent {{community-based}} {{studies have}} shown strong associations between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and major depressive disorder and panic disorder. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether patients with a manifest depressive disorder have an increased prevalence of RLS and whether there is an association with different depressive disorders. METHODS: Three psychiatry departments in two countries (Germany and Australia) each recruited 100 consecutive patients with current depression. All patients completed a standardized questionnaire including diagnostic questions for RLS, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the International <b>RLS</b> <b>Severity</b> Scale (IRLS), if RLS was present. The treating doctors completed a second standardized questionnaire including RLS diagnostic questions and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 277 questionnaires could be evaluated, 184 in Germany (96 in Bremen, 88 in Freiburg) and 93 in Australia. The Australian patients were younger than the German patients (45. 4 [*]±[*] 13. 8 vs. 49. 7 [*]±[*] 15. 0 years, p[*]=[*] 0. 02); the gender distribution was not different (p[*]=[*] 0. 71). The minimal diagnosis criteria for RLS were fulfilled by 8. 3 % of the German and 17. 0 % of the Australian patients (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). The treating physicians rated 4. 3 % of the German and 12. 4 % of the Australian patients as RLS cases. RLS prevalence was similar across all subtypes of depression. CONCLUSION: RLS is not more frequent in patients with manifest depression in Germany as compared to the general population. Possible reasons for the higher prevalence of RLS in depressive patients in Australia are discussed. S. Happe, B. T. Baune, M. Lanz, K. Berger and M. Hornya...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The two {{disorders}} of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movements (PLM) {{are well}} recognised as fairly common neurological disorders. The presentation is of a sensory and motor component suggestive {{of a state}} of hyperexcitability of the nervous system. The underlying abnormality is believed to involve a dopamine deficiency but many of characteristics of the disorders have not been adequately described or quantified. I investigated, firstly, the possible reasons for the gender bias in the prevalence studies and found that women {{were more likely to have}} some associated conditions which may be related to RLS as well as a higher symptom load when compared to men subjects with RLS. I then looked at the problems of analysing the sensations occurring in RLS. Due to the lack of an adequate measuring tool and the possibility of a relationship between the sensations of RLS and those of pain, I used a validated descriptive pain questionnaire (the McGill pain questionnaire) to measure the sensations of RLS. Subjects with RLS were able to describe the sensations with the pain questionnaire and severity indices calculated from the McGill correlated well with measures of <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> but not with other intensity measures for pain. In the area of motor events I investigated the possibility of creating a classification system for the muscle activations documented as PLM. I recorded multiple muscle groups in the legs during sleep and devised a classification using sequence of activation and timing of activations from the different muscles. I also used the classification to show subtle changes in the leg activation patterns associated with change in sleep stage...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of {{restless legs syndrome}} (RLS) relies upon diagnostic criteria {{which are based on}} history only, and dopaminergic treatment is not normally the first choice of treatment for all patients. It would be worthwhile to identify patients non-responsive to dopaminergic treatment beforehand, because they may suffer from a restless legs-like syndrome and may require alternative treatment. We included retrospectively 24 adult patients fulfilling the four essential criteria for restless legs and 12 age-matched healthy controls. They were investigated by ambulatory actigraphy from both legs over three nights, and patients started treatment with dopamine agonists after this diagnostic work-up. We examined 12 responders to dopaminergic treatment and 12 non-responders and studied the association between response to dopaminergic treatment and the periodic limb movement index (PLMI) as assessed with actigraphy. Demographic characteristics, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue at baseline were similar in all three groups. Baseline <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> was similar between responders and non-responders [International Restless Legs Severity Scale (IRLS) : 25  ±  9 and 24  ±  8]. Group comparisons of PLMI before treatment initiation showed significant differences between the three groups. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that healthy controls had significantly lower PLMI (4. 9  ±  4. 5) than responders (29. 3  ±  22. 7) and non-responders (13. 3  ±  11. 2). Similarly, the PLMI in responders was lower than in non-responders. PLMI day-to-day variability did not differ between responders and non-responders and there was no correlation between treatment effect, as assessed by the decrease of the IRLS and baseline PLMI. Our retrospective study indicates that actigraphy to assess periodic limb movements may contribute to a better {{diagnosis of}} dopamine-responsive restless legs syndrome...|$|E

Two subscales were identified: symptom severity (SS 1) and symptom impact (SS 2). Only one study has investigated the subscales&# 39; responsiveness to a 12 -week treatment with ropinirole. This current study was undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} a 4 -week, non-pharmaceutical treatment on the two subscales and to explore whether or not both subscales were impacted by the observed placebo effect. Methods: The pooled data from questionnaires of 58 patients (41 from both treatment groups and 17 from the sham treatment control group), who participated in two clinical studies, were reviewed. Their change in score over a 4 -week trial was computed. The average change in both subscales in both groups was computed and t-tests were performed. Results: In the treatment group, the average scores of both subscales changed significantly from baseline to week 4 (P< 0. 005 for both). Compared to the control, SS 1 changed (P< 0. 001), but not SS 2 (P= 0. 18). In the sham treatment group, the scores for SS 1 changed significantly (P= 0. 002), but not for SS 2 (P= 0. 2). Conclusion: This study corroborated findings from an earlier study in which both subscales changed with a 12 -week drug treatment. It also showed that the observed placebo effect is attributed to a small but significant change in symptom severity, but not symptom impact.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} compare the {{efficacy}} of fixed doses of bupropion and ropinirole and iron alone {{for the treatment of}} restless legs syndrome (RLS) and to look for the tolerability of these medications. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with RLS were randomly divided into three groups with thirty patients in each group (Group A: Bupropion [300 mg/day], Group B: Ropinirole [0. 25 - 0. 5 mg/day], and Group C: Oral iron [150 mg elemental iron] along with folic acid [500 μg]). Each participant was then assessed for severity of RLS, as well as RLS-related quality at the baseline, and thereafter, every 14 th day till 6 weeks based on the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) severity rating scale and Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLSQoL) Questionnaire, respectively. Results: IRLS scores differed significantly from baseline visit to last (F = 4. 85; P = 0. 01). The interaction between the time x treatment group was significant (F = 10. 37; P < 0. 001) showing an improvement with the therapy in all the groups. Pair-wise comparison depicted that ropinirole group differed from other two groups in IRLS score (F = 7. 06; P = 0. 001), which were comparable to each other. Regarding quality of life of these cases, within each group scores differed among all the four visits (F = 5. 12; P = 0. 002).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDue to the {{symptoms}} and the sleep disturbances it causes, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) {{has a negative}} impact on quality of life. Measurement of such impact can be performed by means of questionnaires, such as the Kohnen Restless Legs Syndrome–Quality of Life questionnaire (KRLS-QoL), a specific 12 -item instrument that is self-applied by patients. The present study is aimed at performing a first formal validation study of this instrument. MethodsEight hundred ninety-one patients were included for analysis. <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> was assessed by the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS), Restless Legs Syndrome- 6 scales (RLS- 6), and Clinical Global Impression of Severity. In addition the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was assessed. Acceptability, dimensionality, scaling assumptions, reliability, precision, hypotheses-related validity, and responsiveness were tested. ResultsThere were missing data in 3. 58 % patients. Floor and ceiling effects were low for the subscales, global evaluation, and summary index derived from items 1 to 11 after checking that scaling assumptions were met. Exploratory parallel factor analysis showed that the KRLS-QoL may be deemed unidimensional, ie, that all components of the scale are part of one overall general quality of life factor. Indexes of internal consistency (alpha[*]=[*] 0. 88), item-total correlation (rS[*]=[*] 0. 32 – 0. 71), item homogeneity coefficient (0. 41), and scale stability (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 73) demonstrated a satisfactory reliability of the KRLS-QoL. Moderate or high correlations were obtained between KRLS-QoL scores and the IRLS, some components of the RLS- 6, inter-KRLS-QoL domains, and global evaluations. Known-groups validity for severity levels grouping and responsiveness analysis results were satisfactory, the latter showing higher magnitudes of response for treated than for placebo arms. ConclusionsThe KRLS-QoL was proven an acceptable, reliable, valid, and responsive measure {{to assess the impact of}} the RLS on quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Noel J Vargas-Pérez, Kanika Bagai, Arthur S Walters Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA Introduction: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is a sensorimotor {{neurological disorder}} associated with poor quality of life. Growing evidence links RLS and periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) with {{increased risk of}} cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. This article reviews the association of RLS and PLMS with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: PubMed and Medline database (1990 to July 2016) were searched for the terms “restless legs,” “restless legs syndrome,” “periodic limb movements,” “periodic limb movements in sleep” cross-referenced with “cardiovascular disease,” “heart disease,” “coronary artery disease,” “coronary heart disease,” “heart arrhythmia,” “heart failure,” “congestive heart failure,” “echocardiogram,” “echocardiographic,” “hypertension,” “high blood pressure,” “cerebrovascular disease,” “stroke,” “autonomic nervous system,” “heart rate,” “heart rate variability,” “hypoxia,” “microcirculation,” “oxidative stress,” “inflammation,” “chronic kidney disease,” “end-stage renal disease,” “renal disease,” “hemodialysis,” “multiple sclerosis,” “Parkinson,” “Parkinson’s,” “iron deficiency anemia,” and “mortality. ” Other relevant articles from the reference list of the above-matched manuscripts were also reviewed. Studies that did not specify the diagnostic criteria for RLS or manuscripts in languages other than English were excluded. Articles with emphasis in RLS secondary to pregnancy {{were not included in}} this manuscript. Results: Eighty-six original articles were included in this review. Although mixed results were found regarding the association of RLS and PLMS with CVD, hypertension, stroke and mortality, an informal review of the literature does suggest that the bulk of the evidence favors such an association. Conclusion: The current evidence in general supports the association between RLS/PLMS and CVD. The variability of results likely represent differences in study designs, RLS criteria used, <b>RLS</b> <b>severity,</b> duration of disease, and time of follow-up between the studies. As the association between RLS/PLMS and CVD is not definitive at this time, further suggested studies are outlined.

The {{objective of this}} study was to compare serum endocan levels in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and control subjects in order to elucidate whether RLS is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Methods: A total of 31 drug naïve female patients with RLS and 31 age- and BMI-matched women were included in the study. Patients with pathological or physiological conditions or with a history of medication use that could potentially influence endothelial functions were excluded, as well as those with alcohol or drug abuse history. The two groups were compared with routine blood tests and serum endocan levels. Results: Patients with RLS had lower serum endocan levels than the controls (P= 0. 037). There was a negative bivariate correlation between <b>RLS</b> <b>severity</b> score and serum endocan levels (r=- 0. 406, P= 0. 023). While white blood cell count was significantly higher in RLS group, 25 -hydroxy vitamin D 3, vitamin B 12, transferrin saturation rate, and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower. Creatininemia and diastolic blood pressure were also marginally insignificantly lower in RLS group. Due to the presence of differences between two groups in these variables, a linear regression analysis was performed that showed a positive association between endocan and creatininemia (β= 0. 310, P= 0. 022), and a negative association between endocan and RLS (β=- 0. 502, P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The results of this study seem to suggest that patients with RLS may have better endothelial functions when compared with the general population and that these patients may be better protected against atherosclerosis.
