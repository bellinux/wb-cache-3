50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> for the Logitech Cordless Precision {{controller}} is Nickel-metal hydride <b>battery.</b> The <b>pack</b> provides up to 300 {{hours on}} 2 AA batteries (not included). It is recommended {{in place of}} disposable AA batteries (which differ slightly in voltage). It also ships {{as part of the}} <b>Battery</b> <b>pack</b> charger kit. Third party <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> kits are also available. Despite the official <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> being nickel metal hydride, the normal (AA) battery casing advises to use only with alkaline batteries.|$|R

50|$|The {{calculator}} can be powered from {{an external}} adapter or from internal NiCd <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> (although the <b>battery</b> has to remain present {{when using the}} external AC adapter to avoid damage to the calculator circuitry).|$|R
25|$|Although these {{lights were}} {{primarily}} designed for off-road use, {{where they are}} almost universal, many commuters and transportational cyclists now choose to use high-power halogen front lights which operate from a NiMH, lead-acid, or Li-ion <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|R
50|$|Digital cameras utilize either {{proprietary}} or standard consumer batteries. , most cameras use proprietary {{lithium-ion batteries}} while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> but have an optional AA battery holder available.|$|R
50|$|A common {{complaint}} {{found in}} most HX-20 computers today is {{the failure of the}} internal Ni-Cd <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> The <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is easily replaced by a NiMH (or equivalent) <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> Changing the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is not generally considered to reduce the collectible value of the computer, as doing so does not damage any internals.|$|R
50|$|This {{low power}} usage made it {{feasible}} for Sharp {{to introduce a}} battery-powered version, the QT-8B, in mid-1970. This was the first mass-produced electronic calculator to be battery-powered. It replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> but it was otherwise nearly identical to the QT-8D.|$|R

5000|$|Components of <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> {{include the}} {{individual}} batteries or cells, and the interconnects which provide {{electrical conductivity between}} them. <b>Rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> often contain a temperature sensor, which the battery charger uses to detect the end of charging. Interconnects are also found in batteries as they are the part which connects each cell, though batteries are most often only arranged in series strings.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a company}} that has {{developed}} a rechargeable power supply for the Stroboflash II, III, and IV, which plugs right into the Stroboflash power pack instead of the original dry cell batteries and utilizes two 12 volt <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> They also repair these flashes. This can be found at Stroboflash.com.|$|R
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle with <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> {{that can be}} charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion.

50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of USB for mobile phones and tablets, USB sockets and plugs have become a common choice for other small devices that require five volts or less, even those that require no data connection. Examples include flashlights, toys such as small helicopters, and <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> (which in turn provide five volts over USB to recharge other devices). Wall sockets with built-in USB power adapters and USB sockets are available.|$|R

The battery could be recharged at home or swapped out at a special Aurica recharging station “in three minutes or less.” Aurica touts that its recharging stations would be powered with green energy.|$|R
50|$|The Sharp QT-8B Micro Compet, a {{portable}} electronic desktop calculator, {{was the first}} mass-produced calculator to be battery-powered. Introduced in mid-1970, {{it was based on}} its immediate predecessor, the QT-8D introduced in late 1969, but it replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a <b>rechargeable</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> It has the same calculating integrated circuits as the QT-8D and is of similar appearance and dimensions; the power supply is the only major difference.|$|R
