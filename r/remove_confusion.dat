25|$|After the Federal {{criminal}} investigation ended in 1996, Zimmermann {{and his team}} started a company to produce new versions of PGP encryption. They merged with Viacrypt (to whom Zimmermann had sold commercial rights and who had licensed RSA directly from RSADSI), which then {{changed its name to}} PGP Incorporated. The newly combined Viacrypt/PGP team started work on new versions of PGP encryption based on the PGP 3 system. Unlike PGP 2, which was an exclusively command line program, PGP 3 was designed from the start as a software library allowing users to work from a command line or inside a GUI environment. The original agreement between Viacrypt and the Zimmermann team had been that Viacrypt would have even-numbered versions and Zimmermann odd-numbered versions. Viacrypt, thus, created a new version (based on PGP 2) that they called PGP 4. To <b>remove</b> <b>confusion</b> about how it could be that PGP 3 was the successor to PGP 4, PGP 3 was renamed and released as PGP 5 in May 1997.|$|E

5000|$|Because of the {{neurological}} deterioration {{associated with}} this delusion, {{it can be difficult}} to separate conditions of mirrored-self misidentification with conditions of common comorbidities. [...] Hypnosis is a commonly-used method to study this delusion because it offers the opportunity to recreate particular aspects of delusions in research participants without the presence of comorbidities. [...] Researchers can <b>remove</b> <b>confusion</b> caused by other unrelated symptoms and make specific conclusions about mirrored-self misidentification itself. Hypnosis generates false beliefs and disrupts normal cognitive evaluation without having any lasting consequences for healthy research participants. [...] Hypnotic delusions are very similar to clinical delusions, in that both subjects exhibit delusional resistance to challenge and autobiographical memory during delusions. [...] When their beliefs are challenged, both clinical and hypnotic patients will defend their delusional beliefs, will refuse to reject their beliefs, and will provide fabricated explanations to account for them. [...] Because hypnosis can recreate the false beliefs (accounting for factor 1 of the two-factor theory of delusional belief above) and disrupt the ability to reject a belief on implausibility (accounting for factor 2) with no lasting consequences, it is a good model to study monothematic delusions, particularly mirrored-self misidentification.|$|E

5000|$|Pseudosuchia {{was defined}} as a stem-based clade in 1985. It {{includes}} crocodiles and all archosaurs more closely related to crocodiles than to birds. A second clade with a similar definition, Crocodylotarsi, was named in 1988, possibly as a replacement for Pseudosuchia. The name Pseudosuchia, meaning [...] "false crocodiles", has been used for over a century, and traditionally included only aetosaurs, but when defined as a clade, Pseudosuchia came to includes the group Eusuchia ("true crocodiles") as well. Crocodylotarsi may have been named to <b>remove</b> <b>confusion,</b> but as a stem-based clade it is synonymous with Pseudosuchia. Because Pseudosuchia was named first, it has precedence. A third group, Crurotarsi, traditionally included the same archosaurs as Pseudosuchia, but as a node-based clade it is not synonymous. The scope of Crurotarsi has recently been changed by the phylogenetic placement of phytosaurs. In 2011, Sterling J. Nesbitt found phytosaurs to be the sister taxon of Archosauria, and therefore not crocodile-line archosaurs. Because phytosaurs are included in the definition of Crurotarsi, crurotarsans are not solely crocodile-line archosaurs, but also bird-line archosaurs and phytosaurs. Under this phylogeny, Crurotarsi includes phytosaurs, crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, while Pseudosuchia still contains only crocodile-line archosaurs. Below is a cladogram modified from Nesbitt (2011) showing the new changes (bold terminal taxa are collapsed).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recommender systems {{improve the}} access to {{relevant}} information and products by giving suggestions to the user based on user’s previous rating to the product or like and dislike of user towards the information. Many existing recommendation system use collaborative filtering approach that give recommendation based on other users preferences. On the other side we have content based method which gives recommendation based on user’s previous history or past profile. Game Recommender System aims to provide accurate results of recommendation to the user by both the available approaches. The system maintains user profile with certain ratings given to the games and based on that recommendation results are displayed to the user. The system has great advantage as it has personalized recommendation with social filtering methods to accurately recommend games to the user, so user can enjoy games that matches their interest and helps user to <b>remove</b> <b>confusion</b> as to which game they should play with plenty of games available in the market...|$|E
40|$|The lithostratigraphy of Neogene hemipelagic sediments {{recovered}} from the Japan Sea during Leg 127 was revised to improve intersite consistency and to <b>remove</b> <b>confusion</b> stemming from diagenetic modification of the lithology through the opal-A to opal-CT transformation. Special emphasis {{was put on the}} presence and nature of dark-light cycles in revising the lithostratigraphy. Mineral composition analysis was conducted for samples from Sites 794, 795, and 797. In addition, major element chemical composition analysis was conducted for these same sample sets from Site 794. The result of mineral composition analysis suggests that the detrital component, which consists of such minerals as quartz, plagioclase, illite, and kaolinite plus chlorite, is diluted to various degrees by biogenic silica (opal-A) and its diagenetic equivalents (opal-CT and quartz). Smectite, on the other hand, may be a diagenetic or hydrothermal alteration product of volcanic material, although more study is necessary to confirm its origin. As a whole, vertical variation in the sediment composition is consistent with the revised lithostratigraphy and helps to characterize the redefined lithologic units quantitatively...|$|E
