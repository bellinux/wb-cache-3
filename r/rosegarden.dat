In contrast, because Rosegarden(-4) uses the Linux ALSA system, it only runs in a very limited manner on non-Linux systems.|$|E

leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with

cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes

50|$|Here, the {{nightingale}} is only implied (as {{being the}} poet/lover), while the rose, or beloved, {{is shown to}} be capable of inflicting pain with its thorns (خار hâr). The world, as a result, is seen as having both positive aspects (it is a <b>rosegarden,</b> and thus analogous to the garden of Paradise) and negative aspects (it is a <b>rosegarden</b> full of thorns, and thus different from the garden of Paradise).|$|E
5000|$|Parc de Bagatelle, in Paris was {{the brainchild}} of Commissioner of Gardens for Paris Jean-Claude Forestier, who created a classic <b>rosegarden</b> in strict {{geometric}} style between 1905 and 1907. Today, the park contains more than 9,000 modern roses of over 1,000 varieties in two rose gardens - the classic rose garden and a landscape <b>rosegarden</b> (roseraie de paysage). The first international competition for roses was organised here in 1907 and has been held annually ever since. It was granted the WFRS's Award of Garden Excellence in 2007.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rosegarden</b> {{is a free}} {{software}} digital audio workstation program developed for Linux with ALSA and Qt4. It acts as an audio and MIDI sequencer, scorewriter and musical composition and editing tool. It {{is intended to be}} a free alternative to such applications as Cubase.|$|E
50|$|There {{are cases}} where famous {{applications}} have ported their entire code base from another toolkit to Qt {{to enjoy the}} benefit of having a cross-platform native GUI, such as the Wireshark network packet analyzer, LXQt desktop, VLC media player and the <b>Rosegarden</b> audio editor.|$|E

Other graphical applications serve as front ends to LilyPond, including Frescobaldi and the LilyPondTool plugin for jEdit. Denemo integrates the PDF output of LilyPond in its display, allowing some editing operations {{on the final}} typeset score.|$|E
50|$|Software {{synthesizer}} {{is available}} as a plugin, {{and it is possible}} to use external MIDI synthesizer, hardware or software (such as FluidSynth or TiMidity++) in order to make any sound from MIDI compositions.

50|$|Some panel {{paintings}} of the Madonna by Botticelli remain from the years around 1470 which are striking expressions of Botticelli's stylistic development. Two full figure pictures of the Madonna - the Madonna in Glory and the Madonna of the <b>Rosegarden</b> - are in the Uffizi. They represent monumental seated figures filling the entire picture.|$|E
50|$|The LilyPond {{project was}} started in 1996 by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen, after they decided to abandon work on MPP (MusiXTeX PreProcessor), a project they began collaborating on in 1995. Its name was {{inspired}} both by the <b>Rosegarden</b> project and an acquaintance of Nienhuys and Nieuwenhuizen named Suzanne, a name that means lily in Hebrew (שׁוּשָׁן).|$|E
50|$|<b>Rosegarden</b> was {{developed}} up through 1.0 by Chris Cannam, Richard Bown and Guillaume Laurent. Since then, each release {{has been developed}} by a different mix of core and contributing project members, including, {{but not limited to}} D. Michael McIntyre, Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas, and Heikki Junes. Bown has retired from the project, while Laurent has left to pursue his interest in porting to Mac OS X via Cocoa in an as yet unnamed spinoff project.|$|E
5000|$|Just after Christmas 1942, he {{was given}} the lead of an escort group, in command of the {{destroyer}} , becoming one of the first RNVR officers in the Royal Navy (along with Commander E N Wood of [...] a year earlier) to be so promoted. Rayner returned to familiar ground, with his group operating in the North Atlantic on convoy escort duty. In June 1943 he was to lead Operation <b>Rosegarden,</b> an attempt to hunt and kill U-boats as they crossed the Denmark Straits, but this was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of digital audio for Linux and BSD fostered {{technologies such as}} ALSA, which drives audio hardware, and JACK. JACK allows any JACK-aware audio software to connect to any other audio software running on the system, such as connecting an ALSA- or OSS-driven soundcard to a mixing and editing front-end, like Ardour or <b>Rosegarden.</b> In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, {{and it can be}} configured to use a computer's resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the DAW's latency. This kind of abstraction and configuration allows DJs to use multiple programs for editing and synthesizing audio streams, or multitasking and duplexing, without the need for analogue conversion, or [...] saving and reloading files, and ensures a high level of audio fidelity.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{outline of}} the story is this: Gippich is the lord of the <b>rosegarden</b> in Worms, and as Kriemhild's father, Gippich dares any wooer to defeat the garden's twelve guardians. Dietrich von Bern and Etzel, king of the Huns take up the {{challenge}} together. They travel to Worms with their retinue, and face each of the guardians in single combat. Among the guardians are giants, named Pusolt, Ortwin, Schrutan and Asprian.Dietrich von Bern fights and defeats Siegfried. Except for one draw (Biterolf refuses to fight his kinsman Walther of Aquitaine), all fights end with Dietrich's side victorious. Dietrich fights against Siegfried, initially doing poorly and complaining of Siegfried's hardened skin. Hildebrand tells Wolfhart to falsely tell Dietrich of the tutors death, after which point Dietrich's rage causing him to breathe fire and Hildebrand must intervene so that Dietrich does not kill Siegfried.Finally, Gippich has to submit to Dietrich and Etzel, and the victors are honoured with garlands and kisses.|$|E
