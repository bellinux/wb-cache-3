40|$|The article {{describes}} the design and control of dynamical behaviour of a non-contact ultrasonic motor with flexurally-vibrating <b>ring-shaped</b> <b>stator</b> and rotor provided with blades. Due to asymmetric arrangement of blades (structural asymmetry), rotational movement of the rotor can be produced by excitation of standing waves in the stator in contrast to other non-contact ultrasonic motors relying on application of travelling waves. This simplifies design {{and control of the}} motor. Dynamics of the rotor is studied using a finite element method and qualitative theory of nonlinear conservative systems. It is shown that the control of structural asymmetry (particularly, application of an asymmetric rotor with twinned design) can be used for creation of a dynamical system with no equilibrium points. In such a system {{it will be possible to}} set rotor into stable rotational motion for any initial angular position...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic motors {{have the}} merits of high ratio of torque to volume, high {{positioning}} precision, intrinsic holding torque, etc., compared to the conventional electromagnetic motors. There have been several potential applications {{for this type of}} motor in aerospace exploration, but bearings and bonding mechanism of the piezoelectric ring in the motors limit the performance of them in the space operation conditions. It is known that the Langevin type transducer has excellent energy efficiency and reliability. Hence using the Langevin type transducer in ultrasonic motors may improve the reliability of piezoelectric motors for space applications. In this study, a novel in-plane mode rotary ultrasonic motor is designed, fabricated, and characterized. The proposed motor operates in in-plane vibration mode which is excited by four Langevin-type bending vibrators separately placed around a <b>ring-shaped</b> <b>stator.</b> Two tapered rotors are assembled to the inner ring of the stator and clamped together by a screw nut. In order to make the motor more stable and convenient to fix, a thin cylindrical support is placed under the stator ring. Due to its no-bearing structure and Langevin transducer excitation, the prototype ultrasonic motor may operate well in aeronautic and astronautic environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” We {{report the}} {{development}} of a manipulator using a spherical ultrasonic motor (SUSM) and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -compatibility of the SUSM. The SUSM is constructed of three <b>ring-shaped</b> <b>stators</b> and a spherical rotor and has two or three degrees of freedom (DOF). In the present study, a novel SUSM composed of non-magnetic materials has been constructed. In an MRI-compatibility test of the SUSM in a 1. 5 T MRI, the noise effects on MRI images of driving SUSM and not driving SUSM were observed. The results have shown a sharp image, though the quality of the image reduced. Terrible noise and deformation were not observed. On the other hand, the solution by a shield cloth was attempted. The results show some knowledge...|$|R
