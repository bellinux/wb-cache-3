5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. <b>Researchers</b> <b>may</b> be able to predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E

It holds themed exhibitions of media based on national holidays, including Independence Day, {{the anniversary of}} the Youth Pledge, and National Press Day; the museum may also take some of its collection on a mobile exhibition. The digital collection and library is accessible to the general public, while <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> access paper copies of the newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|Appaloosas have an eightfold {{greater risk}} of {{developing}} Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25percent of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Eightypercent of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas with physical characteristics including roan or light-colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting the most at-risk individuals. <b>Researchers</b> <b>may</b> have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, {{other jurisdictions}} {{such as the}} United Kingdom and New Zealand have held that a <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> ignore a patent when {{conducting}} experiments. Fair research and experimentation is considered to end when the product or process is ready for commercial exploitation. Essentially, a <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> patent the improvement of an existing patent, but cannot exploit it without {{the permission of the}} earlier patent holder until the earlier patent expires.|$|R
25|$|To solve problems, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> use {{algorithms}} that terminate in {{a finite}} number of steps, or iterative methods that converge to a solution (on some specified class of problems), or heuristics that may provide approximate solutions to some problems (although their iterates need not converge).|$|E
25|$|The complex {{nature of}} polyamory {{presents}} difficulties in structuring {{research into the}} stability of polyamorous relationships. For instance, polyamorists {{may be reluctant to}} disclose their relationship status due to potential negative consequences, and <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> be unfamiliar with the full range of polyamorous behaviours, leading to poorly framed questions that give misleading results.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology {{also has}} a {{prominent}} role in the fast developing field of Tissue Engineering. When designing scaffolds, researchers attempt to the mimic the nanoscale features of a Cell's microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage. For example, when creating scaffolds to support the growth of bone, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> mimic osteoclast resorption pits.|$|E
5000|$|Applied: ABA {{focuses on}} the social {{significance}} of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior {{so that it is}} more acceptable to the persons involved, to others, and to society as a whole.|$|R

While {{there is}} not a precise, consistent and functional acoustic definition for barking, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> classify barks according to several criteria. University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers identified volume, pitch, tonality, noise, abrupt onset and pulse duration are amongst the criteria {{that can be used to}} define a bark.|$|E
25|$|Studies in bird {{behaviour}} {{include the}} use of tamed and trained birds in captivity. Studies on bird intelligence and song learning have been largely laboratory based. Field <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> make use {{of a wide range of}} techniques such as the use of dummy owls to elicit mobbing behaviour, dummy males or the use of call playback to elicit territorial behaviour and thereby to establish the boundaries of bird territories.|$|E
25|$|The Bender Library {{provides}} {{a variety of}} individual and group study spaces and includes a Curriculum Materials Center, a New Media Center, Graduate Research Center, classrooms, and a café. About 160 public computer workstations are available throughout the Bender building and researchers also may borrow laptops, chargers, tablets, and other electronic devices. In October 2012, the library acquired a large poster printer which <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> use for presentations and other academic purposes.|$|E
50|$|Mental health {{literacy}} has three major components: recognition, knowledge, and attitudes. A conceptual framework of mental {{health literacy}} illustrates the connections between components, and each is conceptualized as an area to target for measurement or intervention. While some researchers have focused on a single component, others have focused on multiple and/or the connection between components. For example, a <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> focus solely on improving recognition of disorders through an education program, whereas another <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> focus on integrating all three components into one program.|$|R

25|$|Genetic {{research}} studies of individuals without chromosome anomalies also support {{this idea that}} an autism-related gene may be present in 15q11.2-q13.1 Specifically, {{research studies}} found that certain DNA markers from the (15q1.2-q13.1) region were found more often in individuals with autism than in individuals without autism. Although these DNA markers {{are too small to}} be genes, they suggest that <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> be getting close to finding an autism gene in this region.|$|E

The document collection has items dating to the 13th century, including charters and coats of arms, charity records and records of the company's landholdings, including the Londonderry estates. The silver collection includes an ancient Celtic decorative collar found on the Londonderry estate and pieces of the company's own silverware from the 16th century onwards. There is also a collection of paintings, mostly of former members. <b>Researchers</b> <b>may</b> view its collections by appointment.|$|E
25|$|According to Christina Starmans et al. (Nature Hum. Beh., 2017), the {{research}} literature contains no evidence on people having an aversion on inequality. In all studies analyzed, the subjects preferred fair distributions to equal distributions, in both laboratory and real-world situations. In public, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> loosely speak of equality instead of fairness, when referring to studies where fairness happens to coincide with equality, but in many studies fairness is carefully separated from equality {{and the results are}} univocal. Already very young children seem to prefer fairness over equality.|$|E

25|$|Experimental neuropsychology is an {{approach}} that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover {{the relationship between the}} nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between neuroanatomy and psychological function.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept {{have been}} made on many grounds, {{including}} a lack of conceptual clarity. Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital, {{in order to examine}} which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, Nature {{launched}} {{an experiment in}} parallel open peer review: some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment. The results were less than encouraging – only 5% of authors {{agreed to participate in}} the experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments. The editors have suggested that <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> have been too busy to take part and were reluctant to make their names public. The knowledge that articles were simultaneously being subjected to anonymous peer review may also have affected the uptake.|$|E
50|$|A special {{informed}} consent problem happened historically with biobanks. Previous to {{the advent of}} biobanks, researchers would ask specimen donors for consent {{to participate in a}} single study, and give participants information about that study. In a biobank system, a <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> have many specimens collected over many years and then long after the donors gave the sample, that <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> want to conduct a new study using those samples but have no good way to give donors information about that study and collect their consent. This problem was first identified in widespread publication in 1995 when an article on this topic was published.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, a <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> conduct {{exploratory}} research but report {{it as if}} it had been confirmatory ('Hypothesizing After the Results are Known', HARKing—see Hypotheses suggested by the data); this is a questionable research practice bordering on fraud.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} a sample, the <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> {{elect to}} insert a single tone to {{indicate}} the end of the sample, as sentence-final prosody differs across sentence types and it may not be clear to the subject that the sample has in fact ended.|$|R
25|$|ResearchGate's {{competitors}} include Academia.edu, Google Scholar and Mendeley. Academia.edu {{reportedly has}} more registered users (about 34 million versus 11 million) and higher web traffic, but ResearchGate is substantially larger {{in terms of}} active usage by researchers. The fact that ResearchGate restricts its user accounts to people at recognized institutions and published <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> explain the disparity in active usage, as {{a high percentage of}} the accounts on Academia.edu are lapsed or inactive. In a recent and ongoing survey of academic profile tools, about as many respondents have ResearchGate profiles and Google Scholar profiles, but almost twice as many respondents use Google Scholar for search than use ResearchGate for accessing publications.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western <b>researchers</b> <b>may</b> systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E
30|$|The <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> also inform {{either the}} main or the {{crosscutting}} concern in a filter. This allows {{the researcher to}} find out (i) what are the requirements affected by a specific crosscutting concern or (ii) what are the requirements of a particular main concern.|$|R
50|$|Many {{universities}} do {{not focus}} on teaching ability when they hire new faculty; rather, they emphasize candidates' publications list (and, especially in technology-related areas, the ability to bring in research money). This single-minded focus on the professor as <b>researcher</b> <b>may</b> cause faculty to neglect or be unable to perform some other responsibilities.|$|R
30|$|A concern catalog {{may have}} several {{software}} concerns.
