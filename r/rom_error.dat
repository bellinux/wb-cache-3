40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a new software program for semiautomatic measurement of the volume and mass of ground-glass nodules (GGNs) in a chest phantom and to investigate the influence of CT scanner, reconstruction filter, tube voltage, and tube current. Materials and Methods. We used an anthropomorphic chest phantom with eight artificial GGNs with two different CT attenuations and four different volumes. CT scans were obtained with four models of CT scanner at 120 kVp and 25 mAs with a soft and a sharp reconstruction filter. On the 256 -MDCT scanner, the tube current-exposure time product and tube voltage settings were varied. GGNs were measured with software that automatically segmented the nodules. Absolute percentage error (APE) was calculated for volume, mass, and density. Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis. Results. Volume and mass did not differ significantly from the true values. Whe n measurements were expressed as A PE, the error range was 2 - 36 % for volume and 5 - 46 % <b>rom</b> no <b>error.</b> We did not find significant differences in APE between CT scanners with filters for lower tube current for volume or lower tube voltage for mass.

Three dimensional motion data were collected using an inertial sensor-based system from 9 persons with stroke and 9 healthy older adults as they ascended and descended a staircase at a self-selected pace.

40|$|International audienceParametric, projection-based, Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a {{mathematical}} tool for constructing a parametric Reduced-Order Model (ROM) by projecting a given parametric High Dimensional Model (HDM) onto a Reduced-Order Basis (ROB). It is rapidly becoming indispensable {{for a large}} number of applications including, among others, computational-based design and optimization, multiscale analysis, statistical analysis, uncertainty quantification, and model predictive control. It is also essential for scenarios where real-time simulation responses are desired. During the last two decades, linear, projection-based, parametric MOR has matured and made a major impact in many fields of engineering including electrical engineering, acoustics, and structural acoustics, to name only a few. By comparison, nonlinear, projection-based, parametric MOR remains somehow in its infancy. Nevertheless, giant strides have been recently achieved in many of its theoretical, algorithmic, and offline/online organizational aspects. The main purpose of this lecture is to highlight some of these advances, discuss their mathematical and computer science underpinnings, and report on their impact for an important class of problems in aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, nonlinear solid mechanics and structural dynamics, failure analysis, multiscale analysis, uncertainty quantification, and design optimization. To this effect, nonlinear, projection-based, parametric MOR will be first interpreted as a constrained semidiscretization on a subset of a compact Stiefel manifold, using a low-dimensional basis of global shape functions constructed a posteriori — that is, after some knowledge about the response of the system of interest has been developed. Usually, such a knowledge is gathered using the given parametric HDM and an offline training procedure where the model parameters are sampled with a greedy strategy based on a cost-effective <b>ROM</b> <b>error</b> indicator. Specifically, a set of problems related to the parametric problem of interest are solved at the sampled parameter points using the given HDM, and the computed solution snapshots are compressed to obtain the desired global ROB. Depending on the mathematical type of the governing equations underlying the given HDM, a dual ROB is also constructed and the sought-after nonlinear parametric ROM is constructed by Galerkin (or Petrov-Galerkin) projection of the HDM onto the global ROB (and its dual counterpart) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{computer-aided}} generation of reduced-order macromodels (ROMs) for system level simulation using VHDL-AMS. The focus is thereby set on the application of ROMs in system simulation. It also gives an survey of our approach of reduced-order modeling. VHDL-AMS is used to describe microelectromechanical systems based on lumped and rigid bodies for several years. But such models often have a limited accuracy if the system contains flexible bodies or nonhomogeneous electrical fields. Methods of reduced-order modeling of linear systems to increase the system model accuracy are also available for some years. The work {{presented in this paper}} combines the advantages of reduced-order modeling and VHDL-AMS system level simulation, whereas our approach of reduced-order modeling is able to handle nonlinear systems too. The application of ROMs on system level and their export to VHDL-AMS have been demonstrated by two surface micromachined vibration sensor arrays which are intended for wear state recognition. Additionally, a new approach called "multi architecture modeling" has been applied which simplifies the integration of macromodels into the system. As a result of this work, we are able to simulate certain classes of nonlinear <b>ROMs</b> with an <b>error</b> less than 1 % compared with the finite-element method simulation. Also, simulation time of ROMs is shorter than simulation time of models based on lumped and rigid bodies...|$|R

This study measured prospectively, motor system function (cervical range of movement (<b>ROM),</b> joint position <b>error</b> (JPE) and activity of the superficial neck flexors (EMG) during a test of cranio-cervical flexion) as well as a measure of fear of re-injury (TAMPA) in 66 whiplash subjects within 1 month of injury and then 2 and 3 months post injury. Subjects were classified at 3 months post injury using scores on the neck disability index: recovered (, 8), mild pain and disability (10 [...] 28) or moderate/severe pain and disability (. 30). Motor system function was also measured in 20 control subjects. All whiplash groups demonstrated decreased ROM and increased EMG (compared to controls) at 1 month post injury. This deficit persisted in the group with moderate/severe symptoms but returned to within normal limits in those who had recovered or reported persistent mild pain at 3 months. Increased EMG persisted for 3 months in all whiplash groups. Only the moderate/ severe group showed greater JPE, within 1 month of injury, which remained unchanged at 3 months. TAMPA scores of the moderate/severe group were higher than those of the other two groups. The differences in TAMPA did not impact on ROM, EMG or JPE. This study identifies, for the first time, deficits in the motor system, as early as 1 month post whiplash injury, that persisted not only in those reporting moderate/ severe symptoms at 3 months but also in subjects who recovered and those with persistent mild symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{dynamical}} {{systems are}} an intrinsic {{part of many}} areas of science and engineering. Frequently, they are simulated using high-dimensional discretized equations whose accurate solutions often can only be obtained at very high computational cost. For this reason, {{there has been a}} lot of research on the development of reduced order models (ROM's) in the last few decades. Ideally, these models are low-dimensional but still manage to replicate the important characteristics of the system. One popular model is POD which provides the optimally ordered, orthonormal basis from a set of data. A reduced order model is then constructed by representing the solution using a subset of this basis, e. g. projecting the problem onto a lower dimensional subspace in order to obtain a lower dimensional model. In this thesis, we explore both how to evaluate the response of a POD model to perturbations and how to improve its ability to handle perturbations. We also investigate the use of sensitivity analysis on POD reduced order models. Additionally, we look at the POD method's dependence on the type of system being modeled, and ways to improve computational efficiency. We first present results comparing the outcomes of using essentially the same POD basis for different types of PDE's that demonstrate the accuracy of the POD model depends not only on the ability of the POD basis to represent the solution as set by the tolerance used in the POD selection procedure, but also on the type of equation. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the way in which inaccuracies arise in POD reduced order models are dependent on the type of equation being modeled. Next, we introduce an error indicator that detects when the POD reduced order model stops performing well on a perturbed system as the numerical solution evolves. This has the advantage that the POD basis can be adjusted as needed during the evolution of the <b>ROM.</b> The <b>error</b> indicator is shown to effectively detect the error as it arises during the evolution of the model on four different types of PDE's. Additionally, we found that sensitivity analysis applied to POD models with significantly reduced dimension compared to their full dimensional counterparts still generated accurate sensitivities. We address the related issue of how to improve the ability of a POD model to handle perturbations in its parameters. To do this, we introduce a number of basis augmentation strategies. Our tests of these strategies demonstrate that using augmented bases can substantially improve the accuracy of POD reduced order models on perturbed systems. Lastly, we consider how to improve the computational efficiency of POD. We propose that the implicit filtering associated with POD enables the use of larger timesteps in the POD model. Our computational experiments support this idea that POD based ROM's will generally have reduced stability timestep restrictions. The consequence of this observation is that the ability to use a larger timestep will typically lead to greater computational efficiency, and thus help to offset the additional cost per timestep that evolving a POD based ROM requires for problems with nonlinear terms that cannot be precomputed...|$|R

40|$|Transonic {{aeroelastic}} and aeroservoelastic (ASE) modeling {{presents a}} significant technical and computational challenge. Flow fields {{with a mixture}} of subsonic and supersonic flow, as well as moving shock waves, can only be captured through high-fidelity CFD analysis. With modern computing power, it is realtively straightforward to determine the flutter boundary for a single structural configuration at a single flight condition, but problems of larger scope remain quite costly. Some such problems include characterizing a vehicle's flutter boundary over its full flight envelope, optimizing its structural weight subject to aeroelastic constraints, and designing control laws for flutter suppression. For all of these applications, reduced-order models (ROMs) offer substantial computational savings. ROM techniques in general have existed for decades, and the methodology presented in this dissertation builds on successful previous techniques to create a powerful new scheme for modeling aeroelastic systems, and predicting and interpolating their transonic flutter boundaries. In this method, linear ASE state-space models are constructed from modal structural and actuator models coupled to state-space models of the linearized aerodynamic forces through feedback loops. Flutter predictions can be made from these models through simple eigenvalue analysis of their state-transition matrices for an appropriate set of dynamic pressures. Moreover, this analysis returns the frequency and damping trend of every aeroelastic branch. In contrast, determining the critical dynamic pressure by direct time-marching CFD requires a separate run for every dynamic pressure being analyzed simply to obtain the trend for the critical branch. The present ROM methodology also includes a new model interpolation technique that greatly enhances the benefits of these ROMs. This enables predictions of the dynamic behavior of the system for flight conditions where CFD analysis has not been explicitly performed, thus making it possible to characterize the overall flutter boundary with far fewer CFD runs. A major challenge of this research is that transonic flutter boundaries can involve multiple unstable modes of different types. Multiple ROM-based studies on the ONERA M 6 wing are shown indicating that in addition to classic bending-torsion (BT) flutter modes. which become unstable above a threshold dynamic pressure after two natural modes become aerodynamically coupled, some natural modes are able to extract energy from the air and become unstable by themselves. These single-mode instabilities tend to be weaker than the BT instabilities, but have near-zero flutter boundaries (exactly zero in the absence of structural damping). Examples of hump modes, which behave like natural mode instabilities before stabilizing, are also shown, as are cases where multiple instabilities coexist at a single flight condition. The result of all these instabilities is a highly sensitive flutter boundary, where small changes in Mach number, structural stiffness, and structural damping can substantially alter not only the stability of individual aeroelastic branches, but also which branch is critical. Several studies are shown presenting how the flutter boundary varies with respect to all three of these parameters, as well as the number of structural modes used to construct the ROMs. Finally, an investigation of the effectiveness and limitations of the interpolation scheme is presented. It is found that in regions where the flutter boundary is relatively smooth, the interpolation method produces ROMs that predict the flutter characteristics of the corresponding directly computed models to a high degree of accuracy, even for relatively coarsely spaced data. On the other hand, in the transonic dip region, the interpolated <b>ROMs</b> show significant <b>errors</b> at points where the boundary changes rapidly; however, they still give a good qualitative estimate of where the largest jumps occur...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{pain and}} {{disability}} {{is not uncommon}} in 20 - 60 % of persons following a whiplash injury. A number of causes for symptom persistence have been suggested, but current diagnostic imaging techniques have not clearly identified pathoanatomical causes. As a result, there continues to be long-standing acrimony about whether persistent pain is attributable to a salient structural physical pathology or to other underlying processes. Nevertheless qualitative observations have been made on MRI of fatty infiltrate in the sub-occipital extensor muscles in chronic neck disorders and these have been aligned with a decrease in standing balance and EMG abnormalities in the rectus capitis posterior minor muscles reasoned {{to be related to}} a denervation of the C 1 dorsal ramus. However there has been no systematic quantitative evaluation of the presence of fatty infiltrate in the extensor muscles in chronic whiplash and no detailed study of the relationship of any fatty infiltrate to symptomatic and physical features. The aim of this thesis was to establish a MRI measure to quantify muscle/fat constituents in cervical extensor muscles as well as to investigate any relationship between musculature degeneration (fatty infiltrate, atrophy) and sensory, physical or psychological features in female subjects with chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD). This thesis reports a series of studies which make up this body of research. A conventional MRI measure was developed to analyze signal intensities for cervical extensor muscular fat content. Clinical tests which have shown to characterize the chronic condition were also examined: thermal and pressure pain thresholds, cervical range of movement (<b>ROM),</b> joint position <b>error</b> (JPE), and questionnaires of self-reported pain and disability (neck disability index (NDI); dizziness handicap inventory (DHI)); general well being (general health questionnaire (GHQ- 28), Short-Form- 36 (SF- 36) and psychological stress (Impact Events Scale (IES); Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK) were collected. Comparison was made between 79 female subjects, aged 18 - 45 years with chronic WAD and 34 healthy female controls of similar ages. A final study was conducted in which subjects with chronic insidious onset neck pain were examined to assess whether the findings of fatty infiltrate were peculiar to chronic WAD or were generic to chronic neck pain disorders. The outcomes of the studies present the development of a reliable MRI measure for cervical muscle/fat constituents as well as muscle morphometry. It was determined that age, body mass index and activity levels did not influence muscular alterations in both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Physical, sensory, motor and psychological impairments were found in subjects with chronic WAD but not in healthy controls or insidious onset neck pain. The presence of muscular degeneration was identified in subjects with chronic WAD. It was widespread involving all extensor muscles, but higher indices of fatty infiltrate were found in the sub-occipital and multifidus muscles, especially at the C 3 level. Nevertheless the fatty infiltrate was not strongly related to clinical features, with only marginal relationships being observed between cervical ROM, JPE, thermal/pressure thresholds and psychological stress. Nevertheless all of the WAD subjects demonstrated widespread fatty infiltrate in combination with impairments that typically characterize the chronic condition, suggesting that chronic WAD represents a complex, debilitated state. Widespread fatty infiltrate was not found in subjects with insidious onset neck pain, suggesting this is a feature characteristic of WAD. The mechanisms for the development of fatty infiltrate in chronic WAD could not be determined from this thesis but its presence underpins the need to further utilize advanced MRI techniques to better determine the origin behind these changes. This research is a vital step forward towards a more accurate identification and diagnosis for those who continue to suffer in the long-term following a whiplash injury. Future research should include a more heterogenous sample of whiplash subjects to determine if fatty infiltrate is unique to those with chronic symptoms or a general feature of the condition regardless of recovery. It is also imperative to conduct a longitudinal study to establish the temporal development of fatty infiltrate following whiplash and these studies should include male subjects to determine gender differences. Early recognition of these muscular changes in tandem with clinical tests may ultimately assist in the diagnosis and hence contribute towards the development of treatments aimed at lessening the transition from acute to chronic pain following whiplash injury...|$|R
