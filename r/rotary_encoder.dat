Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is used to vary the voltage supplied to the DC motor armature(with fixed field voltage), thus controlling the motor speed.

40|$|In {{its current}} state, the wide {{acceptance}} of the Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI) technique is hindered due to noise, lack of recordable results, and impossibility of data post-processing. This paper presents some add-ons made to a commercial MOI system to ease the image interpretation, archiving and reporting of the results. In addition, a few image processing techniques are also employed {{in an attempt to}} perform automatic flaw detection. The recording capability of the MOI instrument output images was addressed by digitizing the video signal in video or image files. To help with the identification of the damage location and distance between images, a <b>rotary</b> quadrature <b>encoder</b> was mounted onto the MOI scan head. The use of the encoder allowed the identification of the inspection location with respect to a reference position, such as the beginning of the scan. Moreover, it allowed saving images at fixed intervals, which were then stitched into a single image, thus simplifying the post inspection analysis process. Both live and post-inspection image processing capabilities were made available. Implemented image processing included background subtraction, de-noising, contrast adjustment and morphological operation, among others. Contrast stretching transform and background subtractions were found to be among the most powerful techniques {{that could be used in}} simplifying the image interpretation.

However, in this project position angle analysis was limited to determine position angle for passive joint. Two different techniques were tested using three rotations (3 R) under-actuated robot manipulator. The approach embedded Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm and SIMULINK block diagram. Experiments were conducted to predict an algorithm on position angle measurement either SIMULINK block diagram or program code method applied to three joints; Active 1, Active 2 and Passive respectively. MATLAB software was utilized for data acquisition and analysis for the passive position of 3 R under-actuated robot manipulator.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to report}} the {{development}} of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Testbed Training Platform (TTP). The development is to enable users to safely fly and control the UAV in real time within a limited (yet unconstrained) virtually created environment. Thus, the paper introduces a hardware–virtual environment coupling concept, the Panda 3 D gaming engine utilization to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) and the 3 D-flying environment, as well as the interfacing electronics that enables tracking, monitoring and mapping of real-time movement onto the virtual domain and vice verse. Design/methodology/approach – The platform comprises a spring-shuttle assembly fixed to a heavy aluminium base. The spring supports a rotating platform (RP), which is intended to support UAVs. The RP yaw, pitch and roll are measured by an inertial measurement unit, its climb/descend is measured by a low cost infrared proximity sensor and its rotation is measured by a <b>rotary</b> optical <b>encoder.</b> The hardware is coupled to a virtual environment (VE), which was developed using the Panda 3 D gaming engine. The VE includes a GUI to generate, edit, load and save real-life environments. Hardware manoeuvres are reflected into the VE. Findings – The prototype was proven effective in dynamically mapping and tracking the rotating platform movements in the virtual environment. This {{should not be confused with}} the hardware in loop approach, which requires the inclusion of a mathematical model of the hardware in a loop. The finding will provide future means of testing navigation and tracking algorithms. Research limitations/implications – The work is still new, and there is great room for improvement in many aspects. Here, this paper reports the concept and its technical implementation only. Practical implications – In the literature, various testbeds were reported, and it is felt that there is still room to come up with a better design that enables UAV flying in safer and unlimited environments. This has many practical implications, particularly in testing control and navigation algorithms in hazardous fields. Social implications – The main social impact is to utilise the concept to develop systems that are capable of autonomous rescue mission navigation in disaster zones. Originality/value – The authors are aware that various researchers have developed various testbeds, at different degrees of freedom. Similarly, the authors are also aware that researchers have used game engines to simulate mobile robots or sophisticated equipment (like the VICON Motion Capture System) to measure to perform complex manoeuvres. However, the cost of this kind of equipment is very high, autonomous movements are planned in restricted environments and tested systems are only autonomous in certain setups. However, the idea of mapping the dynamics of an avatar flying object onto a 3 D-VE is novel. To improve productivity and rapid prototyping, this paper proposes the use of commercially available game engines, such as the Panda 3 D, to create virtual environments...|$|R
