Huggins did not marry, and lived with his sister while in Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|James Leroy Bottomley (April 23, 1900– December 11, 1959) was an American {{professional}} baseball player. A first baseman, Bottomley played in Major League Baseball from 1922 through 1937 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati <b>Reds,</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis Browns.

Packed in boxes by the dozen or half dozen, glimpses of the ornaments could be caught through the cellophane windows of the boxes' covers. The <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other vibrant colors.|$|E
5|$|Although Ruth knew he {{was nearly}} {{finished}} as a player, he desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati <b>Reds,</b> <b>and</b> Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E
5|$|Bako {{attended}} {{high school}} and college {{in his home state of}} Louisiana, winning two conference championships at the University of Southwest Louisiana. After reaching the majors with the American League's Detroit Tigers in 1998, Bako spent seven seasons in the National League, playing with six different teams. He returned to the American League with the Baltimore Orioles and the Kansas City Royals, then played for the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> the Philadelphia Phillies for one season each.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly {{adults are}} {{characterized}} by their four scale-covered wings, which give the Lepidoptera their name (Ancient Greek λεπίς lepís, scale + πτερόν pterón, wing). These scales give butterfly wings their colour: they are pigmented with melanins that give them blacks and browns, as well as uric acid derivatives and flavones that give them yellows, {{but many of the}} blues, greens, <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> iridescent colours are created by structural coloration produced by the micro-structures of the scales and hairs.|$|E
5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati <b>Reds)</b> <b>and</b> to indicate {{he was trying to}} win the team's 10th championship.|$|E
5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
50|$|The club colours are <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue, a {{blend of}} the main colours of the former clubs. Athletic played in <b>red</b> <b>and</b> Town played in blue. The {{original}} playing kit was <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue stripes, blue shorts, blue socks - but that has evolved over the past 10 years. Now the playing kit is a solid blue body with <b>red</b> sleeves, <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flashes {{down the side of}} the body, blue shorts <b>and</b> <b>red</b> socks.|$|R

5|$|The 1926 NL pennant {{race was}} heated. During {{the second and}} third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi-game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day. On September 17, the Cards took a one-game lead over the <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> {{extended}} their lead when the Reds lost several games in a row. They lost the last game of the season to the Reds on September 26, but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings.|$|E
5|$|The All-Star Game {{managers}} {{selected the}} entire lineups from 1933 to 1946. In 1947, the fans {{were given the}} ability to select the starting lineups. This continued until 1957, when Cincinnati Reds fans stuffed the ballot box and selected seven <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> Stan Musial. This forced Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick {{to step in and}} replace Wally Post and Gus Bell with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron that season and to turn over the starting lineup selection to players, coaches and managers for several subsequent seasons. Since 1970, the fans have elected the starting lineup of one player for each baseball position (except the pitcher) for both the National League and American League teams.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Royals had {{the most}} picks of any team, with 74; {{following}} the Royals, the Toronto Blue Jays made 71, and the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> New York Mets made 61 apiece. The total number of players drafted, 1,263, broke a record for the most players ever selected in a draft. The previous record of 1,162 was set during the 1967 draft. The California Angels drafted the fewest future MLB players, with only four of their draftees appearing in an MLB game, while the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers both drafted 13 future MLB players, {{the most of any}} team.|$|E
25|$|For {{the left}} distribution, {{the size of}} the areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue are {{approximately}} proportional to the widths of each <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue bar. Therefore, the numbers drawn from this distribution will approximately follow Benford's law. On the other hand, for the right distribution, the ratio of the areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue {{is very different from the}} ratio of the widths of each <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue bar. Rather, the relative areas of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> blue are determined more by the height of the bars than the widths. Accordingly, the first digits in this distribution do not satisfy Benford's law at all.|$|R

5|$|The Melbourne club {{then went}} forward with signing players, mainly from folding Super League clubs Perth <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> Hunter Mariners. Some of these players {{included}} Robbie Ross, Glenn Lazarus, Brett Kimmorley and Scott Hill. With the Super League and ARL joining into one {{competition for the}} 1998 season, the Melbourne team {{became part of the}} National Rugby League (NRL). The Melbourne Storm Rugby League Club was unveiled at a function at the Hyatt Hotel - Melbourne in February 1998.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{finished}} with {{the best record in}} MLB. Hamels started Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>and,</b> {{for the first time in}} his postseason career, pitched a complete game shutout. The Phillies advanced to the National League Championship Series facing the San Francisco Giants, where Hamels took the loss in Game 3 giving up three runs as the Giants' Matt Cain shutout the Phillies, en route to the Phillies' ultimate elimination in six games.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates opened PNC Park {{with two}} {{exhibition}} {{games against the}} New York Mets—the first of which was played on March 31, 2001. The first official baseball game played in PNC Park was between the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> the Pirates, on April 9, 2001. The Reds won the game by the final score of 8–2. The first pitch—a ball—was thrown from Pittsburgh's Todd Ritchie to Barry Larkin. In {{the top of the}} first inning, Pittsburgh native Sean Casey's two-run home run was the first hit in the park. The first Pirates' batter, Adrian Brown, struck out; however, later in the inning Jason Kendall singled—the first hit by a Pirate in their new stadium.|$|E

5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> Whites engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds were {{established}} as an expansion {{team of the}} Double-A Southern League (SL) in 1978. They moved to the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1985 and to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. The team won the Southern League Championship in 1979 as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati <b>Reds</b> <b>and</b> again in 1982 as the Double-A club of the New York Yankees. The Sounds won the Pacific Coast League Championship in 2005 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
