The executive committee of the constitutional convention called the members together in July. The convention declared the state offices vacant, and appointed a Unionist interim state government.

[...] It is still a matter of debate as to whether a quorum existed for this vote. The Confederate state government was unable to control very much Missouri territory.

Sponsored by the Japan Society of Applied Physics with co-sponsorship by the 162 nd Committee on Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Photonic and Electronic Devices of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, technical sessions focused on topics ranging from growth and material characterisation to fabrication and commercialisation of devices such as high power FETs and laser diodes. This is a review of talks related to high power devices, AlGaN/GaN FETs, that have recently been the focus of intense scrutiny and may replace GaAs technology in the future...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{contains}} {{the proceedings of}} the Fourteenth International Workshop on the ACL 2 Theorem Prover and Its Applications, ACL 2 2017, a two-day workshop held in Austin, Texas, USA, on May 22 - 23, 2017. ACL 2 workshops occur at approximately 18 -month intervals, and they provide a technical forum for researchers to present and discuss improvements and extensions to the theorem prover, comparisons of ACL 2 with other systems, and applications of ACL 2 in formal verification. ACL 2 is a state-of-the-art automated reasoning system that has been successfully applied in academia, government, and industry for specification and verification of computing systems and in teaching computer science courses. Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore were awarded the 2005 ACM Software System Award for their work on ACL 2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore theorem-prover family. The proceedings of ACL 2 2017 include the seven technical papers and two extended abstracts that were presented at the workshop. Each submission received two or three reviews. The workshop also included three invited talks: "Using Mechanized Mathematics in an Organization with a Simulation-Based Mentality", by Glenn Henry of Centaur Technology, Inc.; "Formal Verification of Financial Algorithms, Progress and Prospects", by Grant Passmore of Aesthetic Integration; and "Verifying Oracle's SPARC Processors with ACL 2 " by Greg Grohoski of Oracle. The workshop also included several <b>rump</b> <b>sessions</b> discussing ongoing research and the use of ACL 2 within industry...|$|R

The 2003 publication included parameter recommendations for 80-bit security. A subsequent 2005 publication revised the parameter recommendations for 80-bit security, presented parameters that gave claimed security levels of 112, 128, 160, 192 and 256 bits, and described an algorithm to derive parameter sets at any desired security level.

50|$|The Missouri Constitutional Convention reconvened to {{consider}} {{the status of the}} state in July. The convention declared the governor's office and state legislative offices to be vacant and appointed Gamble as governor of a provisional government of Missouri on August 1. Gov. Jackson called a <b>rump</b> <b>session</b> of the exiled General Assembly in Neosho, Missouri, and in late October with a dubious quorum passed an ordinance of secession. Although secessionists considered Gamble an unelected puppet of the Union forces, he opposed harsh Union treatment of the state. For instance, he protested to President Lincoln about the Fremont Emancipation, which unilaterally freed the state's slaves in 1861 and imposed martial law. Lincoln agreed to Gamble's request to overturn this decision, rescinded the emancipation and removed John C. Fremont from command.|$|E

5000|$|Lars Knudsen {{appears to}} be the first to use a form of this attack, in the 1998 paper where he {{introduced}} his AES candidate, DEAL. The first presentation to attract the attention of the cryptographic community was later the same year at the <b>rump</b> <b>session</b> of CRYPTO '98, in which Eli Biham, Alex Biryukov, and Adi Shamir introduced the name [...] "impossible differential" [...] and used the technique to break 4.5 out of 8.5 rounds of IDEA and 31 out of 32 rounds of the NSA-designed cipher Skipjack. This development led cryptographer Bruce Schneier to speculate that the NSA had no previous knowledge of impossible differential cryptanalysis. The technique has since been applied to many other ciphers: Khufu and Khafre, E2, variants of Serpent, MARS, Twofish, Rijndael, CRYPTON, Zodiac, Hierocrypt-3, TEA, XTEA, Mini-AES, ARIA, Camellia, and SHACAL-2.|$|E

50|$|Additionally {{there are}} a number of attacks that work {{directly}} on a card and without the help of a valid reader device. These attacks have been acknowledged by NXP. In April 2009 new and better card-only attack on MIFARE Classic has been found. It was first announced at the <b>Rump</b> <b>session</b> of Eurocrypt 2009. This attack was presented at SECRYPT 2009. The full description of this latest and fastest attack to date can also be found in the IACR preprint archive. The new attack improves by a factor of more than 10 all previous card-only attacks on MIFARE Classic, has instant running time, and it does not require a costly precomputation. The new attack allows to recover the secret key of any sector of MIFARE Classic card via wireless interaction, within about 300 queries to the card. It can then be combined with the nested authentication attack in the Nijmegen Oakland paper to recover subsequent keys almost instantly. Both attacks combined and with the right hardware equipment such as Proxmark3, one should be able to clone any MIFARE Classic card in not more than 10 seconds. This is much faster than previously thought.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} is {{a report on the}} Evening <b>Rump</b> <b>Session</b> on InN held as part of the 2004 International Workshop on Nitride Semiconductors. It summarises (1) the presentations given by the 5 panellists covering data generated from theory and a wide range of experimental techniques relating to the properties of InN, in particular its bandgap and (2) the subsequent discussion. The most recent parameter-free electronic-structure calculations predict a value for the InN bandgap of 0. 8 +/- 0. 4 eV; experimental results obtained {{from a wide range of}} InN samples point to a bandgap around 0. 7 eV, or to a bandgap around 1. 3 eV. The interpretation of available data is hotly contested, not surprisingly a definitive conclusion on the true value of the bandgap of InN was not reached during the <b>Rump</b> <b>Session.</b> It was agreed that InN is a difficult material to grow and its properties vary depending on how and where it is grown.
