5|$|Stela 29 bears a Long Count (8.12.14.8.15) date {{equivalent}} to AD 292, the earliest surviving Long Count {{date from the}} Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the Tikal emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding {{the head of an}} underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip</b> close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} French attack {{continued}} throughout the 15th century. Instead {{of relying on}} murage grants, more funds for the town walls were directly granted by the king in 1400, including an ongoing annual grant of £100. Concerns increased significantly after the invasion scare of 1457, when French troops successfully attacked the town of Sandwich on the south coast. Indeed, the guns on Southampton's walls were fired at French raiding ships the same year. The walls continued to be maintained {{for the rest of}} the century, with £40 being allocated annually between 1478 and 1485 for this purpose. By contrast, the castle fell into a rapid decline and its inner bailey became used first as a <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip,</b> then for small-scale agriculture.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{contemporary}} documents describing the design or methods of {{construction of the}} canal and nothing about its opening. However, a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men {{were involved in the}} work, so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks. Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers, since there were no newspapers to carry advertisements. The work would have been done using pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight. Excavations for a sewer in 1974 and work on a <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip</b> in 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay, and there were clay pits near Stamford, which supported a pottery industry, although their precise location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip</b> and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|Though relegation to the Third Division {{meant the}} club was no longer bound by the Taylor Report's 1994 {{deadline}} for conversion to all-seater, new owner David Sullivan continued the £4.5million development as planned. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished, helped by fans who took home a significant proportion as souvenirs, the land was cleared – the <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip</b> beneath the Kop which had earned the club £800 in 1906 (£ at 1994 prices) cost £250,000 to decontaminate – and {{by the start of}} the new season, 7,000 seats in the Tilton Road Stand were ready for use. On completion of the Kop Stand, the stadium was formally re-opened in November 1994 by Baroness Trumpington, representing the Department of National Heritage, who unveiled a commemorative plaque and presented a cheque for £2.5million on behalf of the Football Trust; the ceremony was followed by a friendly match against Aston Villa, attended by a crowd of 20,000. Planning permission for an all-seater Railway Stand was granted in March 1995, but work was delayed by a dispute over land owned by Railtrack and the stand opened only in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Major changes {{occurred}} in the 1960s and 1970s. The main access to the area from Perth was via Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Beach Road, a road which roughly corresponded to Karrinyup Road but included modern-day North Beach Drive and Osborne Place. Hertha Road (now Civic Place and Telford Crescent) was the main road in the area, and {{the site of the}} present-day footbridge was the municipal <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip</b> until the early 1970s. The Osborne Park hospital was opened on 4 April 1962 and the civic centre and council chambers were opened in 1966, along with houses in the George Street area near the civic centre. The postal district was approved and gazetted in April 1976, and over the next eight years, most of the suburb was subdivided and built.|$|E

500|$|The castle began {{a second}} period of {{decline in the}} 16th century. After 1518, no more money was spent {{repairing}} the castle. The inner bailey became used first as a <b>rubbish</b> <b>tip,</b> then for small-scale agriculture. By 1585, the castle was [...] "very ruynaise and in greete decaye". In contrast to many royal castles, Southampton Castle was never converted into a gaol, with Southampton's two prisons instead being built in the town at the Bargate and on Fish Street. In 1618 James I sold the castle to property speculators; it was then sold on to George Gollop, a local merchant, and a windmill was subsequently built on the motte. The castle played {{no role in the}} subsequent English Civil War, although some of the masonry was used to strengthen the town walls in 1650. Two of the entrances to the castle, Southgate and Castle Eastgate, were demolished in the late 18th century; and the remaining castle buildings fell into significant disrepair.|$|E

40|$|Like {{a number}} of gull species, the silver gull Larus novaehollandiae has {{expanded}} its population in response to human food subsidy. The major anthropogenic food source is food waste at <b>rubbish</b> <b>tips.</b> Other sources of human food waste are also exploited. Many problems result from the activities of these birds, including human health and safety, economic impacts, and effects on the conservation of other species. My study examines aspects of the economic impacts of the silver gull on the human community of the Greater Melbourne Area comprising approximately 4065 km 2 (1569 square miles). My data collection method involves identifying sites where problems have been experienced and completing questionnaires during face to face interviews with the managers of those sites. Data collected {{at this early stage}} of the study demonstrate that there are significant, quantifiable economic impacts associated with the superabundance of the silver gull in this area. Other impacts, such as reduced amenity and potential health hazards are equally real but more difficult to quantify. Costs include damage to structures and products, damage prevention measures, and loss of production. Information about the costs of these problems will be presented to the relevant landfill management authorities to encourage them to consider alternative means of disposing of putrescible waste, rather than by open landfill disposal, because even current best practice management of open landfill sites (<b>rubbish</b> <b>tips)</b> provides ample opportunity for silver gulls and certain other bird species to exploit this food source. Controlling access by the silver gull to food at <b>rubbish</b> <b>tips</b> would be an important first step in managing the population of this species. <br /...|$|R

Snowfinches are not migratory but may move to lower altitudes or human habitation in winter, when these highly gregarious birds form large flocks. Snowfinches are primarily ground-feeding seed-eaters, though they also consume small arthropods, especially when breeding.

40|$|The {{origin and}} age of Lesser Black-backed Gulls Larus fuscus {{wintering}} inland on the Iberian Peninsula were mapped using sightings of colour-ringed birds. A total of 288 individuals were sighted over a 17 year period. The gulls originated from seven different countries, with the majority being ringed in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The most commonly resighted age group were adults, and most birds were sighted two years after ringing. Our analysis provides evidence {{for a change in}} the migration patterns of Lesser Black-backed Gulls, which may be explained by Baker’s exploratory migration model. It is probable that the gulls follow the rivers Tagus and Guadiana to the <b>rubbish</b> <b>tips</b> in the inner part of the Iberian Peninsula.
