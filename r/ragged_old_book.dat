60|$|At last {{he threw}} {{all the money}} into an old sack, which he pushed under his bead, and then, rolled in his <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> blanket, {{he went off to}} sleep.|$|R

60|$|The nonchalant cow-boys riding {{about the}} camp, the somber squaw-men (attended by their {{blanketed}} wives {{and groups of}} wistful half-breed children), and the <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> medicine men all in their several ways made up a marvelous scene, rich with survivals of pioneer life.|$|R
2500|$|Shenandoah National Park {{is one of}} {{the most}} dog-friendly in the {{national}} park system. The campgrounds all allow dogs, and dogs are allowed on almost all of the trails including the Appalachian Trail, if kept on leash (6 feet or shorter). Dogs are not allowed on ten trails: Fox Hollow Trail, Stony Man Trail, Limberlost Trail, Post Office Junction to <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Shelter, <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Ridge Trail, <b>Old</b> <b>Rag</b> Saddle Trail, Dark Hollow Falls Trail, Story of the Forest Trail, Bearfence Mountain Trail, Frazier Discovery Trail. These ten trails fall short of a total of 20 miles of the 500 miles of trails of the Shenandoah National Park.|$|R
60|$|At last, I {{walked on}} toward an open {{lot in the}} alley, hoping to meet there some <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> women, whom I had daily noticed groping amid foul rubbish for little {{particles}} of dirty cotton, which they washed out and sold for a trifle.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a way, he did not," [...] said Marston. [...] "He was a dirty, <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> impostor--and yet I don't know. Perhaps {{it was his}} grin, but you got a {{hint that}} he was a bigger man than he looked. There was {{something}} about him----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Garden of the Schwarzenberg Palace (1719-1724). Especially the <b>Ragged</b> <b>Old</b> Woman with a Pig is remarkable. This {{statue of}} an ugly, grimacing hag {{seems to be}} the product of a sickly imagination.

60|$|So {{he pulled}} off all his clothes in such haste that he tore some of them, which was easy enough with such <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> things. And he put his poor hot sore feet into the water; and then his legs; and the farther he went in, the more the church-bells rang in his head.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes. You don’t think I am complaining, do you? I wouldn’t {{have missed}} it for the world. Blunt in a <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> jacket and a white tie and that incisive polite voice of his seemed strange and weird. It seemed {{as though he were}} inventing it all rather angrily. I had doubts as to your existence.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Toad {{was very}} well pleased with himself until he thought how terribly untidy that <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> suit looked lying on the ground. What should he do with it?

60|$|As he went on, Elsie {{stared at}} the picture fixedly, and it changed under her glance till his deeply passionate words seemed written on the canvas.

60|$|One {{of these}} fellows was about seventy or upwards, {{and had a}} bald head and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses--no, he only had one. He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, {{and both of them}} had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.|$|R
60|$|But they were! The clear {{cold water}} came {{bubbling}} {{up out of}} the ground just as it always had, and ran off down into the Green Forest in a little stream that would grow and grow as it ran and became the Laughing Brook.

60|$|I'd trade {{anything}} and everything for anything else, and turn it over in a dozen more trades until it was transmuted into something that was worth something. I was famous as a trader.

40|$|Integrated Pest Management (IPM) of {{the drug}} store beetle, Stegobium paniceum (L.), a serious pest of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> Abstract- Recently (January 2010), {{we have found that}} {{drugstore}} beetle, Stegobi-um paniceum (L.), is a serious pest of <b>old</b> <b>books</b> in a religious library in Cra-cow, Poland. About 80 % <b>old</b> <b>books</b> were found more or less damaged by this pest. As the result of larval activity, many holes and tunnels were formed in damaged books. Some of them were old, some of them were new tunnels with live larvae and pupae. Many characteristic emergence holes of the adults were found in the book bindings. Around books there was an enormous amount of dust as a result of larval feeding activity. Live and dead adults were found around <b>old</b> <b>books</b> and within the library room, especially near windows. The Integrated Pest Manage-ment program was suggested to the owners and curator of the library to control infestation and to avoid the continuation of the damage. Key words: drug store beetle, infestation, IPM, <b>old</b> <b>books,</b> Stegobium paniceum...|$|R
6000|$|I suspect his fiddlin' was {{not even}} [...] "middlin'," [...] but he beat time fairly well and kept the dancers somewhere near to rhythm, and so when his <b>ragged</b> <b>old</b> cap went round he often got a handful of {{quarters}} for his toil.

He had a high respect for the skill of my Uncle David and was grateful to him and other better musicians for their non-interference with his professional engagements.|$|R

60|$|I {{looked out}} of the window, which should have {{commanded}} the back yards of the neighbouring buildings. But there were no back yards, or, rather, they were covered with one-storey hovels, cowsheds, in which people lived. The roofs of these hovels were covered with deposits of filth, in some places {{a couple of feet}} deep--the contributions from the back windows of the second and third storeys. I could make out fish and meat bones, garbage, pestilential <b>rags,</b> <b>old</b> boots, broken earthenware, and all the general refuse of a human sty.|$|R
