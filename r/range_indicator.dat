50|$|A {{proposed}} extension by David Howe uses sequencing {{operators to}} describe multi-leg moves as sequences of legs described {{with the original}} Betza system. It distinguishes between the case where the move must continue {{in the same direction}} and where it can alter direction arbitrarily, indicated by a single hypen or a double one, respectively. A + sign can be used as alternative to concatenation, to enhance readability, while use of parentheses serves the same purpose. The <b>range</b> <b>indicator</b> gets the character of exponentiation w.r.t. the - operator (i.e. repeated continuation in the same direction), which can also be applied to a parenthesized expression that already describes a sequence of moves. The convention is introduced that a leading zero on a range specifier means exactly that number of steps, rather than maximally, and an asterisk * as exponent indicates an arbitrarily large number of steps.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{identical}} to the C-scope is the G-scope, which overlays a graphical representation of the range to the target. This is typically represented by a horizontal line that [...] "grows" [...] out from the target indicator [...] "blip" [...] to form a wing-like diagram. The wings grew in length at shorter distances to indicate the target was closer. A [...] "shoot now" [...] <b>range</b> <b>indicator</b> is often supplied as well, typically consisting of two short vertical lines centered {{on either side of}} the middle of the display. To make an interception, the pilot guides his aircraft until the blip is centered, then approaches until the [...] "wings" [...] fill the area between the range markers. This display recreated a system commonly used on gunsights, where the pilot would dial in a target's wingspan and then fire when the wings filled the area inside a circle in their sight. This system allowed the pilot to estimate the range to the target. In this case, however, the range is being measured directly by the radar, and the display was mimicking the optical system to retain commonality between the two systems.|$|E

The aid is a single-station flashing or flickering <b>range</b> <b>indicator,</b> which would indicate lateral position in a channel by varying the flash frequency observed by the vessel operator, with a steady light seen when on the centerline and an increasing flash rate as {{the edge of the}} channel is approached. FINDINGS The ability of observers to detect motion across a channel's width was measured over a range of flash frequencies. The sensitivity to lateral motion afforded by this type of indicator was found to be potentially quite high, but the magnitude of the uncertainty in the judgments of motion would considerably reduce the operational sensitivity of such a device.

The aid is a single-station range beacon that would indicate lateral position in a channel by displaying a change in color as the vessel operator moved across the channel. The beacon would show a strong green at one side, gradually changing to white in the cen-ter, and increasing to a strong red at the other side.
