5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. <b>Renewables</b> are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making <b>renewables</b> competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of <b>renewables</b> is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, over 40 {{per cent}} of Scotland's {{electricity}} came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40 per {{cent of the}} UK's <b>renewables</b> output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed <b>renewables</b> electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95 per cent (1,005 MW) {{on the end of}} 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011, the previous record year for <b>renewables</b> output. The bulk of electricity production is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with <b>renewables</b> 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that electricity production {{is only part of the}} overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).|$|E

Assuming constant variable marginal costs for both energy sources, convex adjustment costs {{and a more}} expensive <b>renewable</b> energy, we show the following. With sufficiently abundant non <b>renewable</b> energy endowments, the dynamic equilibrium path is composed of a first time phase of only non <b>renewable</b> energy use followed by a transition phase substituting progressively <b>renewable</b> energy to non <b>renewable</b> energy before a last time phase of only <b>renewable</b> energy use.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} China's policy {{approach to}} <b>renewable</b> energies and assesses how effectively China has met {{the ideal of}} appropriate interactions between <b>renewable</b> energy policy and <b>renewable</b> energy industrial policy. First we briefly discuss the interactions between these two policies. Then we outline China's key <b>renewable</b> energy and <b>renewable</b> industrial policies and find that China’s government has well recognized the need for this policy interaction. After that, we study the achievements and problems in China's wind and solar PV sector during 2005 - 2012 and argue that China's policy approach to <b>renewable</b> energies has placed priority first on developing a <b>renewable</b> energy manufacturing industry and only second on <b>renewable</b> energy itself, {{and it has not}} effectively met the ideal of appropriate interactions between <b>renewable</b> energy policy and <b>renewable</b> energy industrial policy. Lastly, we make an in-depth analysis of the three ideas underlying this policy approach, that is, the green development idea, the low-carbon leadership idea and indigenous innovation idea. We conclude that Chinas policy approach to <b>renewable</b> energies needs to enhance the interactions between <b>renewable</b> energy policy and <b>renewable</b> energy industrial policy.

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives <b>renewables</b> priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
