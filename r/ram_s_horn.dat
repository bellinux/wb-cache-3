He tried to buy Ram and threatened him of dire consequences if he gave evidence against him. But Ram was not for sale. Both Soni and Mona were arrested. Soni came out on bail, but Mona refused to bail herself out. Infuriated with this, Soni vent his anger on Ram who he thought was the root cause of all his unhappiness.

We show here that gas 1 Δ cells release β 1, 3 -glucan into the medium. Western {{analysis}} of the medium proteins with β 1, 3 -glucan- and β 1, 6 -glucan-specific antibodies showed further {{that at least some}} of the released β 1, 3 -glucan was linked to protein as part of a β 1, 3 -glucan–β 1, 6 -glucan–protein complex. These data indicate that Gas 1 p might play a role in the retention of β 1, 3 -glucan and/or β-glucosylated proteins. Interestingly, the defective incorporation of β 1, 3 -glucan in the cell wall was accompanied by an increase in chitin and mannan content in the cell wall, an enhanced expression of cell wall protein 1 (Cwp 1 p), and an increase in β 1, 3 -glucan synthase activity, probably caused by the induced expression of Fks 2 p. It is proposed that the cell wall weakening caused by the loss of Gas 1 p induces a set of compensatory reactions to ensure cell integrity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Acetylcholine is {{important}} to hippocampal function, including the processes of learning and memory. Patients with schizophrenia show impaired learning and memory and hippocampal dysfunction. Thus, acetylcholinergic systems may be primarily or secondarily disrupted in the hippocampal formation of schizophrenic patients. The present study tested the hypothesis that [3 H]pirenzepine-labeled muscarinic cholinergic receptor levels are altered in the hippocampal formation of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: We have used quantitative autoradiography to measure [3 H]pirenzepine binding to M 1 and M 4 receptors in the hippocampal formation from 15 schizophrenic and 18 nonschizophrenic subjects. Results: The mean density of [3 H]pirenzepine binding was reduced in all regions studied, including the dentate gyrus, subdivisions of Ammon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Horn</b> (CA 1 -CA 4), subiculum, and the parahippocampal gyrus, of the schizophrenic cohort. Moreover, unlike controls, {{there was no significant}} variation between the mean levels of [3 H]pirenzepine binding across the subregions of the hippocampal formation from schizophrenic subjects. Conclusions: These findings provide support for a possible involvement of the muscarinic cholinergic system in the pathology and/or treatment of schizophrenia...|$|R
