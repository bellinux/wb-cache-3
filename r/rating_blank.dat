40|$|An {{investigation}} into material wrinkling failure mechanics of conventional metal spinning {{and the effects}} of process parameters and material properties are presented in this paper. By developing finite element (FE) models using the Box-Behnken design of experiments, the effects of six key process and material parameters on the start of material wrinkling have been investigated. These key factors include roller feed per pass, feed <b>rate,</b> <b>blank</b> thickness, tool path profile, material Young’s modulus, yield stress and strain hardening exponent. The results of FE simulation are validated by comparing the modelled roller tool forces and spun part end shape with those measured during a spinning experiment. From FE simulations, large residual stresses in the form of bending moments are found to be present in the flange of the blank, induced by the roller contact. It is found that material wrinkling failure begins when a plastic hinge is formed between the roller and the edge of the blank. It is found that both roller feed per pass and feed rate produce the most significant effect on the initiation of wrinkling failure, as they increase the bending stresses causing a plastic hinge to form more rapidly, thus wrinkling to occur more quickly...|$|R
40|$|The general aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} how perceived health risk of a chemical exposure and self-reported distress are related to perceived odor intensity and odor valence, symptoms, cognitive performance over time as well as reactions to blank exposure. Based on ratings of general distress, 20 participants constituted a relatively low distress group, and 20 other participants a relatively high distress group. Health risk perception was manipulated by providing positively and negatively biased information regarding n-butanol. Participants made repeated ratings of intensity, valence and symptoms and performed cognitive tasks while exposed to 4. 7 ppm n-butanol for 60 min (first 10 min were blank exposure) inside an exposure chamber. Ratings by the positive and negative bias groups suggest that the manipulation influenced perceived health risk of the exposure. The high distress group did not habituate to the exposure in terms of intensity when receiving negative information, but did so when receiving positive information. The high distress group, compared with the low distress group, rated the exposure as significantly more unpleasant, reported greater symptoms and performed worse on a cognitively demanding task over time.

AdditionalKeyphrase: enzymatic method “Diaphorase ” is the generic name for a group of enzymes widely used in clinical diagnostic reagents to couple pyridine nucleotide-dependent analyte oxidation to reduction of chromogenic electron acceptors. This allows many different assays to be done with measurements within the visible range of the spectrum, rather than in the ultraviolet. Diaphorase activity is commonly measured spectrophotometrically,with use of various electron acceptors such as 2, 6 -dichlorophe-nolindophenol (DCPIP.) 2 Unfortunately, there are several problems with these techniques, including nonlinearity, high <b>blank</b> <b>rates,</b> and measurement of decreasing ratherthan in-creasing absorbance. Tetrazolium salts have been increasingly applied in recent years, particularly in oxidation-reduction histochemistry (1).

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the change from discoidal flake production to prismatic blade-making during the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition in Europe led to enhanced technological efficiency. Specifically, blade-making is thought to promote higher <b>rates</b> of <b>blank</b> production, more efficient and complete reduction of the parent core, and a large increase in the total length of cutting edge per weight of stone. Controlled replication experiments using large samples, computer-assisted measurements, and statistical tests of several different measures failed to support any of these propositions. When resharpened, the use-life of flake edges actually surpasses that of blades of equivalent mass because the narrower blades are more rapidly exhausted by retouch. Our results highlight the need to replace static measurements of edge length that promote an illusion of efficiency with a more dynamic approach that takes the whole reduction sequence into account. An unexpected by-product of our replications was the discovery that real gains in cutting-edge length per weight of stone are linked to surface area. There is now a need to test the proposition that all the perceived advantages currently bestowed upon blades only occurred during the shift from macroblade to bladelet production. If our results are duplicated in further experiments, the notion of "economical" blades {{will have to be}} rejected and alternative explanations sought for their appearance in the early Upper Paleolithic. While Aurignacian bladelet (Dufour) production could signal the advent of composite tool technology (wooden handles or shafts with bladelet inserts), this does not help to explain why macroblades were also produced in large numbers. We may need to reexamine the notion that macroblades were of more symbolic than functional significance to their makers...|$|R

Methods: H 22 {{cells were cultured in}} vitro and divided into 5 groups: blank control group, low-dose ESB group, medium-dose ESB group, high-dose ESB group and fluorouracil (5 -Fu) group. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was utilized to determine the proliferation rates of H 22 cells. Cellular morphology was observed under a transmission electron microscope (EM). The rhodamine 123 was used as a fluorescence probe to label the H 22 cells, and the fluorescence intensities were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. The fluorescence intensity of H 22 cells indicated the MTP of H 22 cells.

We investigate HOOH formation from •OH attack on 10 environmentally relevant organic compounds: formaldehyde, formate, glycine, phenylalanine, benzoic acid, octanol, octanal, octanoic acid, octanedioic acid, and 2 -butoxyethanol. Liquid and ice samples with and without nitrate (as an •OH source) were illuminated using simulated solar light, and HOOH formation rates were measured {{as a function of}} pH and temperature. For most compounds, the formation rate of HOOH without nitrate was the same as the background formation <b>rate</b> in <b>blank</b> water (i. e., illumination of the organic species does not produce HOOH directly), while formation rates with nitrate were greater than the water control (i. e., reaction of •OH with the organic species forms HOOH). Yields of HOOH, defined as the rate of HOOH production divided by the rate of •OH production, ranged from essentially zero (glycine) to 0. 24 (octanal), with an average of 0. 12 ± 0. 05 (95 % CI). HOOH production rates and yields were higher at lower pH values. There was no temperature dependence of the HOOH yield for formaldehyde or octanedioic acid between − 5 to 20 °C and ice samples had approximately the same HOOH yield as the aqueous solutions.

Yields of HOOH in ice for solutions containing nitrate and either phenylalanine, benzoate, octanal, or octanoic acid were indistinguishable from zero.

In this paper, we present a sensitive fluorimetric assay for continuous determination of disulphide reduction activity of PDI. This assay utilizes the pseudo-substrate diabz-GSSG [where diabz stands for di-(o-aminobenzoyl) ], which is formed by the reaction of isatoic anhydride with the two free N-terminal amino groups of GSSG. The proximity of two benzoyl groups leads to quenching of the diabz-GSSG fluorescence by approx.   50 % in comparison with its non-disulphide-linked form, abz-GSH (where abz stands for o-aminobenzoyl).

However, the very high strength exhibited by these components makes subsequent operations such as cutting difficult due to the high process forces and associated high wear of the cutting tools. Moreover, for some applications, such as B-pillars and other automotive components that may undergo impact loading, it may be desirable to create regions of the part with softer and more ductile microstructures. The novel process called the tailored tempering process allows doing this by suppressing the martensitic transformation in those zones of the sheet located under heated parts of the tools.

The structural response in a crash situation can be altered by {{the design of the}} component with formation of different material grades based on the microstructure in designated areas of the component. Material models used in finite element analysis are required by the automotive industry and its suppliers. These models contribute to the improvement and quality of press hardened components. In this work a set of tensile test specimens with different volume fractions of phases are produced. As material is the boron steel 22 MnB 5 chosen which is a common material used in press hardening due to its good hardenability. The specimens are austenitized before starting the heat treatment at different temperatures and holding times. In total fourteen different microstructures are produced. Reference material grades for pure phases are ferrite, bainite and martensite. The produced samples consist of ferrite-bainite, ferrite-martensite and bainite-martensite with different volume fractions, additionally a microstructure consisting of three phases, ferrite-bainite and martensite, is available. Using measured mechanical properties of pure phases and the volume fraction of formed phases different homogenization methods are compared in their ability to represent the mechanical response of mixed microstructures. The homogenization methods account for elastic deformation and the hardening of the material. The onset of necking is seen as the last valid point for all homogenization methods. After this point a localization and damage function for the prediction of softening and fracture is applied. Strain localization and fracture are mesh dependent, therefore an analysis length scale is introduced to account for different element sizes. A weakest link criterion is used for fracture. This means failure of the composite is assumed to occur if one phase fails. The material model for homogenization of mixed microstructures including damage is implemented in the commercial available finite element code LS-Dyna and validated by comparison to experimental results.

40|$|Hot forming {{of boron}} steels is {{becoming}} increasingly popular in the automotive industry due to the demands for weight reduction and increased safety requirements for new vehicles. Hot formed components offer {{a significant increase in}} strength over conventional cold-formed steels, which has allowed for reductions in material thickness (and thus weight) while maintaining the same strength. Hot formed components are typically used in structural applications to improve the integrity of the vehicle’s cabin {{in the event of a}} collision. It has been suggested, however, that the crash performance of certain hot formed parts may be increased by locally tailoring their mechanical properties to improve their energy absorption. The final microstructure of a hot formed part is driven by the rate at which it is cooled within the tooling during the forming and quenching process. By controlling the cooling rate of the part, it is possible to control the final microstructure, and thus the final mechanical properties. This thesis outlines the experimental and numerical studies that were performed for the hot forming of a lab-scale B-pillar. A hot forming die set was developed which has both heating and cooling capabilities to control the local cooling <b>rate</b> of the <b>blank</b> as it is formed and quenched. The first aspect of this research is to produce a hot formed part which is representative of an industrial component, and then to numerically model the process to predict the final mechanical properties. The second aspect is to produce a hot formed part with tailored mechanical properties, such that there are regions of the part with very high strength (very hard) and other regions with increased ductility (softer). By tailoring the microstructure to meet the performance requirement of a hot formed part, it may be possible to optimize its crash behavior and also reduce the overall weight. Cartridge heaters were installed into sections of the tooling allowing it to reach a maximum temperature of 400 °C. Cooling channels are used in other sections to maintain it at approximately room temperature. Experiments were performed on 1. 2 mm Usibor® 1500 P steel at heated die temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 400 °C. In the fully cooled region, the Vickers hardness of the blank was measured to be 450 – 475 HV, on average. As the temperature of the heated region was increased, a significant softening trend was observed in the areas of the blank that were in contact with the heated tool. The greatest levels of softening occurred in the 400 °C heated die trial. Hardness measurements as low as 234 HV were recorded, which represents a reduction in hardness of 49 % compared to the fully cooled trials. Numerical models of the experiments were developed using LS-DYNA and use of its advanced hot forming material model which allows for microstructure and hardness prediction within the final part. The numerical models have shown promising results in terms of predicting the hardness trends as the temperature of the die increases. Thermal expansion of the tooling resulted in local changes in the geometry of the tooling which proved to be problematic during the forming and quenching stages of the process. The expansion caused unexpected changes in the part-die contact, and the resulting microstructures were altered. These thermal expansion issues were addressed in the current work by shimming the tooling; however, in future work the tooling should be designed to account for this expansion at the desired operating temperature...|$|R

When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M.

Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the <b>rate</b> of 6 <b>blanks</b> per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.
