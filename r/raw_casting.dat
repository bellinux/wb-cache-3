5000|$|When a {{production}} piece is contemplated, it may {{go through a}} design process that can range from one person with an idea to a full-scale planning stage involving teams of artists and marketing professionals. Eventually, that design {{will need to be}} made into a real piece of metal jewelry, which is generally called a model, and the worker who makes it is generally the model maker. This is often considered the highest form of craftsmanship, as the piece must be made true to the design and also to most exacting standards. A good model maker is, along with a fine watchmaker among the most technically skilled workers in any trade. After the model is made and found to be what is desired, it is molded or perhaps entered into a machining process to make copies. Assuming it is molded, multiples of the piece are cast from the mold. See lost-wax casting, which article has a sculptural inclination, though the principles are the same for jewelry casting. The cast pieces will likely need a variety of work done to them, including filing to remove the skin left from casting and prepare for polishing, straightening parts, rounding and sizing rings, and assembling many various parts together using solder. Although the method used is called soldering, it is actually a form of brazing, using [...] "solders" [...] of the metal being worked, i.e. gold solders for gold pieces, silver solder for silver pieces, etc. All of this is the work of bench jewelers, who at this level are sometimes known as production workers in some arenas. In this context, the bench jeweler (often known simply as a goldsmith) is responsible for all of the main work involved in turning a <b>raw</b> <b>casting</b> into a piece of jewelry - filing it, straightening it, assembling parts or adding settings for stones, repairing any problems that might have occurred, and preparing it for stonesetting and polishing.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{aimed at}} {{determination}} of increased carbon content influence on segregation processes in a duplex ferritic-austenitic cast steel. The analysis of <b>raw</b> <b>cast</b> steel structure {{was carried out}} using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 optical microscope. The chemical composition of selected areas was examined using a JEOL JSM 5400 scanning microscope equipped with an EDX microanalyser and the obtained results were verified using the Thermo-Calc software. The investigations carried out {{have shown that the}} lower carbon content causes the smaller amount of the intermetallic phases precipitates undesirable in the manufacturing process, which – affecting a clear deterioration in <b>raw</b> <b>cast</b> steel impact strength – promote origination of cracks in the castings. The increased, due to segregation processes, content of carbon, chromium and molybdenum within the solidification grain boundaries promotes precipitation of carbides already in the liquid state, what increases the propensity for hot cracking. The molybdenum content, in a cast steel of increased carbon content, varies from ~ 4 % in the centre of solidification grain to ~ 6. 5 % in its boundary areas, and the chromium content from ~ 28 % to 32 %, respectively. Small enrichment of ferrite with molybdenum and chromium in boundary areas of cast steel solidification grains containing 0. 02 % carbon causes higher ferrite stability and prevents its decomposition in the temperature range from 600 to 900 °C, what makes that the cast steel of lower carbon content features uniform ferritic-austenitic structure in as cast state...|$|R

40|$|<b>Raw</b> {{materials}} were <b>cast</b> from different specific processes {{in order to}} produce cleaner steels with a reduced amount of inclusions. Studied materials that are HSS hardened alloys belonging to the Fe-Cr-C-X system were shared out in four groups depending on the tempering temperature and the presence of secondary and primary carbides. Both inclusions and carbides were roughly assessed by means of Image Analysis. Forging was done on all studied materials with different reduction ratios in order to highlight the texture influence oil mechanical properties. High cycle fatigue tests were made using the boundary method to allow a quick evaluation of results. Fractographic analyses carried out on broken samples led to the definition of four failure modes depending on the nature and the location of the point from which the crack was initiated in one hand, and the roughness of striations in the propagating area over and around the initiation point. Internal and surface crack initiation points were found, the latter being more harmful than the first ones. Though oxides appeared to be more detrimental than other inclusions, primary carbides were also found to be both crack initiation candidates and crack propagation enhancers. Various parameters likely to influence high cycle fatigue failures were finally defined, the most significant one dealing with the nature and location of embedded precipitates and the forging reduction ratio.

40|$|Integrating {{images taken}} at street-level with {{satellite}} imagery {{is becoming increasingly}} valuable in the decision-making processes not only for individuals, but also in business and governmental sectors. To perform this integration, images taken at street-level need to be accurately georeferenced. This georeference information {{can be derived from}} a global positioning system (GPS). However, GPS data is prone to errors up to 15 meters, and needs to be corrected for the purpose of geo-referencing. In this thesis, an automatic method is proposed for correcting the georeference information obtained from the GPS data, based on image registration techniques. The proposed method uses an optimization technique to find local optimal solutions by matching high-level features and their relative locations. A global optimization method is then employed over all of the local solutions by applying a geometric constraint. The main contribution of this thesis is introducing a new direction for correcting the GPS data which is more economical and more consistent compared to existing manual method. Other than high cost (labor and management), the main concern with manual correction is the low degree of consistency between different human operators. Our proposed automatic software-based method is a solution for these drawbacks. Other contributions can be listed as (1) modified Chamfer matching (CM) cost function which improves the accuracy of standard CM for images with various misleading/disturbing edges; (2) Monte-Carlo-inspired statistical analysis which made it possible to quantify the overall performance of the proposed algorithm; (3) Novel similarity measure for applying normalized cross correlation (NCC) technique on multi-level thresholded images, which is used to compare multi-modal images more accurately as compared to standard application of NCC on <b>raw</b> images.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the modes of {{production}} and the sources of metal supply for Migration period bow brooches, concentrating on a single form, the Anglian cruciform brooch. The thesis is in two volumes; text and bibliography (volume 1), catalogues, tables, illustrations (volume 2). The text is in six chapters. Attitudes to artefact studies are briefly discussed in Chapter 1 and the techniques employed {{in this study are}} outlined. Chapter 2 places the cruciform brooch forms into a simple hierarchical typology by formal similarity. A relative chronology is gained by contextual evidence, with absolute dates given by associations with other artefact types. Similarities between early English and continental forms are shown to be adequate to suggest importation, {{during the first half of}} the fifth century. Frisian and north German brooches have a special place in this system. Parallel stylistic development persisted during the second half of the fifth century but sixth-century English brooches are well distinguished from their continental contemporaries. Simple brooch types are thought to have had a long period of production and use. By examining methods of casting and assembling cruciform brooches, Chapter 3 establishes the types and ranges of technical variation observable. Some of these technical attributes provide links between England, Frisia, northern Germany and Denmark. English brooch manufacture is diverse throughout the period under study. Norwegian metalworkers developped a very different style and the technical evidence suggests a movement towards standardisation and mass production. In Chapter 4 we discover the types of alloy used and discuss the likely sources. Initially the alloys used were leaded brasses or bronzes. By the sixth century, copper alloys were commonly very impure. It is suggested that recycling provided a major part of the <b>raw</b> materials for <b>cast</b> copper alloys. Imports of copper alloys from France or the Celtic regions of Britain are relegated to a position of minor importance. The chemical compositions of Norwegian, Frisian, north German and Dutch cruciform brooches demonstrates access to high-tin, high-purity bronzes prevailed throughout the period. Brasses and mixed alloys were also available, probably originating from scrap. With the exception of Frisia, which appears to be more similar to Kent, alloy supplies were similar throughout the Scandinavian and continental cruciform brooch production. Chapter 5 provides a synthesis for these findings. Plans are given for a project extension into other regions (Chapter 6). </p...|$|R

Both the Roman and the Celtic names mean [...] "village or farm of Antunnos/us"—a man not yet identified. It was the southernmost outpost of the Electorate of Cologne from the 12th to the 19th century. In addition to the touristically appealing medieval remnants of the old town fortifications, the city of Andernach is the location of several old industrial plants such as a huge malt mill (the last one of more than ten mills and breweries from the 19th and 20th centuries dismantled in 2008). Among the more modern of its industrial / manufacturing base is a large steel-mill to produce cold formed tin plate and companies manufacturing medicinal products, <b>raw</b> food materials, <b>cast</b> iron products, engines and engine parts.Tourists who come to the region usually visit the medieval fortifications such as the 183 ft tall [...] "Round Tower" [...] (Ger.

For 350 years it was in operation from 1561 to 1911. Two to four men were required to rotate the crane top by means of a huge double ended lever (horizontal wooden bar) attached to the vertical wooden crane [...] "beam" [...] and four others on a (treadwheel men or menials) to operate the huge wooden twin treadwheels (more than 14 ft in diameter) which lifted and lowered the load—mainly millstones, tuff-stone blocks for the Netherlands and wine casks. This treadwheel crane with stone walls (most cranes had a timber housing) is one of only a few of its kind in Europe to have survived. A prince-electoral order or permission was needed to build and operate such a crane in the times of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
