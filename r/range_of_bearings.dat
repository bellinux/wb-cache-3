The last aim determined the functional effects of short term exposure to TGF-beta, IL- 1 beta, and OSM on the frictional properties of cartilage explants. These studies demonstrate that molecular modification of the tissue surface by localization or removal of lubricin altered the boundary mode frictional properties of cartilage. Additionally, localization of lubricin at the tissue surface is not a simple adsorption mechanism, with aggregation, steric arrangement of the molecule, and electrostatic interactions possibly playing a role in lubricin's boundary lubricating ability. These findings point to two distinct mechanisms by which lubricin lubricates, one mechanism involving lubricin bound to the tissue surface and the other involving lubricin in solution. The results presented herein suggest that production of extracellular matrix capable of localizing lubricin may be just as or more important than lubricin production in the lubrication of engineered tissues. Further, the recovery of lubrication for catabolically exposed tissue by exogenous lubricin may be therapeutically important to combat high tissue friction found in injury and disease...|$|E

A numerical method is developed to determine the full bearing stiffness matrix corresponding to two radial, one axial, and two angular coordinates; the rotation about the shaft axis is free by design.

The bearing dynamics are examined when an external harmonic force is imposed on the bearing due to bearing begin situated within a larger complex dynamical system. A compressible Reynolds equation is formulated for the gas film which is coupled to the bearing structure through an axial force balance where the rotor and stator correspond to spring-mass-damper systems. Surface slip boundary conditions are derived on the bearing faces, characterised by the slip length parameter. The coupled bearing system is analysed using a stroboscopic map solver with the modified Reynolds equation and structural equations solved simultaneously.

Previous studies including a Navier slip length shear condition on the bearing faces are extended to investigate applications with a coned bearing gap. A modified Reynolds equation for the film flow is coupled, through the pressure exerted by the fluid film, to the dynamic motion of the stator. Introducing a new variable leads to explicit analytical expressions for the pressure field and force on the stator with the equation for the time-dependent face clearance transformed to a nonlinear second-order non-autonomous ordinary differential equation. The face clearance for periodic axial motion of the coned rotor is obtained using a stroboscopic map solver; a focus is investigating bearing behaviour under extreme conditions.

40|$|Abstract]The <b>bearing</b> {{capacity}} <b>of</b> foundations is {{a fundamental}} problem in geotechnical engineering. For all structures placed on a soil foundation, geotechnical engineers must ensure that the soil has sufficient load carrying capacity so that the foundation does not collapse or become unstable under any conceivable loading. The ultimate bearing capacity is the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> pressure at which the supporting ground is expected to fail in shear, i. e. a collapse will take place. During {{the last fifty years}} various researchers have proposed approximate techniques to estimate the short term undrained <b>bearing</b> capacity <b>of</b> foundations. The majority of existing theories are not entirely rigorous and contain many underlying assumptions. As a consequence, current design practices include a great deal of empiricism. Throughout recent decades, there has also been a dramatic expansion in numerical techniques and analyses, however, very few rigorous numerical analyses have been performed to determine the ultimate <b>bearing</b> capacity <b>of</b> undrained soils. In this study, finite element analysis has been used to analyse a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity problems in undrained soil.
