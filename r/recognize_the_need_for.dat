5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> racial harmony. The celebration of the Day of Reconciliation can take the form of remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E

25|$|In the West Indies {{the elected}} {{assemblies}} of Jamaica, Grenada, and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause {{and called for}} mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.|$|E
25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the Thousand Islands region {{increasingly}} became the focus of outdoor recreation, tourism, and private development. The New York side of the St. Lawrence River in particular became host to a number of lavish private estates built by wealthy newcomers to the region, to the exclusion of recreational visitors; in addition, river anglers grew frustrated with the impacts of illegal fishing and the lack of enforcement of game laws. In response to what they viewed as the spoiling of a formerly open and abundant recreational resource, some of the region's residents and sportsmen began to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> protection of lands and waters on both sides of the river's international border.|$|E
25|$|The data-collection {{systems and}} {{terminology}} used by services and funders {{are said to}} be typically incompatible with recovery frameworks, so methods of adapting them have been developed. It has also been argued that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (and to some extent any system of categorical classification of mental disorders) uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model, leading to suggestions that the next version, the DSM-V, requires: greater sensitivity to cultural issues and gender; to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> others to change as well as just those singled out for a diagnosis of disorder; and to adopt a dimensional approach to assessment that better captures individuality and does not erroneously imply excess psychopathology or chronicity.|$|E

Companies that <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E

Munson suffered a broken neck and would have most likely suffered from quadriplegia had he lived. Munson died of asphyxiation due to the inhalation of superheated air and toxic substances.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Du Bois and Trotter, Fredrick L. McGhee of St. Paul, Minnesota and Charles Edwin Bentley of Chicago had {{also come to}} <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a nationwide activist group. [...] These four men organized a conference {{to be held in}} the Buffalo, New York area in the summer of 1905, inviting 59 carefully selected anti-Bookerites to attend. [...] In July 1905 28 men met at the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, opposite Buffalo. Differing explanations exist for why the group met in southern Ontario and not Buffalo. A commonly given reason, which has not been substantiated by primary sources, is that they had originally planned to meet in Buffalo, but were refused accommodation. [...] Du Bois' writings of the time, however, show that his original plan was to find a quiet, out of the way location for the event, and that the Erie Beach Hotel satisfied his requirements. [...] Researcher Cynthia Van Ness has further located contemporary evidence of Buffalo hotels complying with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895. [...] Bookerites had been alerted to the planned conference, but one who traveled to Buffalo to investigate the conference found no activity there.|$|E
2500|$|Community {{attitude}} towards homeless shelters varies widely, but {{one study found}} that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often adverse to the concept of homeless shelters in general. [...] Calgary neighborhoods <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> shelters, but many don't want to situate a shelter near their own homes. A similar response came from residents in Oahu. In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the [...] "Sisters of the Road" [...] cafe, which supports both homeless shelter clientele and also some unsheltered persons. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, jurisdictions such as Santa Barbara, California, feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode. Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit supportive housing project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments pro and con, despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Senate was a {{political}} institution starting in the ancient Roman Kingdom. The Latin term, [...] "senātus," [...] is derived from senex, which means [...] "old man". Therefore, senate literally means [...] "board of old men." [...] The prehistoric Indo-Europeans that settled Italy in the centuries before the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC were structured into tribal communities. These communities would often include an aristocratic board of tribal elders. The early Roman family was called a gens, or [...] "clan". Each clan was an aggregation of families under a common living male patriarch, called a pater (Latin for [...] "father"), who was the undisputed master of his clan. When the early Roman gentes were aggregating to form a community, the patres from the leading clans were selected for the confederated board of elders (which later became the Roman Senate). Over time, the patres came to <b>recognize</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a single leader. Therefore, they elected a Roman king (rex), and vested in him their sovereign power. When the king died, that sovereign power would naturally revert to the patres. The senate of the Roman Kingdom held three principal responsibilities: it functioned as the ultimate repository for the executive power, served as counsel to the king, and functioned as a legislative body {{in concert with the}} people of Rome.|$|E
