40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the development of a regional crisis competence centre in Sweden. The overall research approach utilizes action research methodology to support the development process. The overall development process is divided into three steps; early need finding, the organizational platform, and business development. This paper is devoted to the first phase - early need finding - which deals with the specific needs and demand of four municipality organizations and how these requirements can be converged into a organizational setting that correspond to national crisis management strategies as well as regional responsibilities in crisis management. The research approach is action based and the theoretical considerations to support progress in development activities are from the Actor Network Theory (ANT). The main conclusion from the research is that the formation of a crisis competence <b>centre</b> <b>revolves</b> around sharing competences, and compromising between internal and external objectives in the progress towards a common goal.

60|$|Were there space, {{we might}} {{go on to}} point out how the {{conception}} of the heavens as a revolving hollow sphere, {{the discovery of the}} globular form of the earth, the explanation of the moon's phases, and indeed all the successive steps taken, involved this same mental process. But we must content ourselves with referring to the theory of eccentrics and epicycles, as a further marked illustration of it. As first suggested, and as proved by Hipparchus to afford an explanation of the leading irregularities in the celestial motions, this theory involved the perception that the progressions, retrogressions, and variations of velocity seen in the heavenly bodies, might be reconciled with their assumed uniform movement in circles, by supposing that the earth was not in the centre of their orbits; or by supposing that they revolved in circles whose <b>centres</b> <b>revolved</b> round the earth; or by both. The discovery that this would account for the appearances, was the discovery that in certain geometrical diagrams the relations were such, that the uniform motion of a point would, when looked at from a particular position, present analogous irregularities; and the calculations of Hipparchus involved the belief that the relations subsisting among these geometrical curves were equal to the relations subsisting among the celestial orbits.|$|R

Although the worm sequence is essentially ®nished, the tidying-up of that and the physical map is ongoing. There is also a continuous need for communication with the worm ®eld with regard to information and materials relating to the sequence project. For example, the cosmids and YACs of the physical map continue to be, {{as they have been}} for many years now, an extremely powerful resource, and the Sanger Centre distributes in the order of 500 clones per month to the community. Alan is team leader of the worm {{functional genomics}} group, which is currently small but will be expanding shortly. Patricia Kuwabara {{is a member of the}} team and a description of their activities can be found below. The Human Genome Project is sequencing mapped PAC and BAC clones. Alan's primary involvement is with the team that is responsible for subcloning the 10 000 or so clones that will be required to complete the one-third of the genome sequence to be contributed by the Sanger Centre. Patricia Kuwabara has been using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for understanding how protein±protein interactions regulate cell-to-cell signalling. Her research has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetics of C. elegans sexdetermination. This work has led into a study of regulated proteolysis involving calpains and also into the roles of the multiple C. elegans Patched proteins, which in other organisms have been shown to be receptors for th...|$|R
500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be <b>revolved</b> on her <b>centre</b> at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: In the final analysis, the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|R

60|$|As we may sum up a {{definite}} number of singular propositions in one proposition, {{which will be}} apparently, but not really, general, so we may sum up {{a definite}} number of general propositions in one proposition, which will be apparently, but not really, more general. If by a separate induction applied to every distinct species of animals, it has been established that each possesses a nervous system, and we affirm thereupon that all animals have a nervous system; {{this looks like a}} generalization, though as the conclusion merely affirms of all what has already been affirmed of each, it seems to tell us nothing but what we knew before. A distinction, however, must be made. If in concluding that all animals have a nervous system, we mean the same thing and no more as if we had said “all known animals,” the proposition is not general, and the process by which it is arrived at is not induction. But if our meaning is that the observations made of the various species of animals have discovered to us a law of animal nature, and {{that we are in a}} condition to say that a nervous system will be found even in animals yet undiscovered, this indeed is an induction; but in this case the general proposition contains more than the sum of the special propositions from which it is inferred. The distinction is still more forcibly brought out when we consider, that if this real generalization be legitimate at all, its legitimacy probably does not require that we should have examined without exception every known species. It is the number and nature of the instances, and not their being the whole of those which happen to be known, that makes them sufficient evidence to prove a general law: while the more limited assertion, which stops at all known animals, can not be made unless we have rigorously verified it in every species. In like manner (to return to a former example) we might have inferred, not that all the planets, but that all planets, shine by reflected light: the former is no induction; the latter is an induction, and a bad one, being disproved by the case of double stars—self-luminous bodies which are properly planets, since they <b>revolve</b> round a <b>centre.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore and {{generate}} knowledge about cantered based ECCD as it is experienced by Orphans and Vulnerable children and staffs (adults) from the urban setting. This study was conducted at an ECCD Centre located in Garden compound in Lusaka, Zambia. The social studies of childhood formed an overarching theoretical framework of the entire research process and supported by the children’s right perspective. In addition, the social exchange theory and norm of reciprocity shed light on the interdependent of parent- child relationship in relation to reciprocity and perceptions. The empirical material for the study was collected between June and August 2013 with seventeen participants of which twelve were children and five were adults. Qualitative participatory methods; individual drawings, observations, interviews, focus group discussion and informal dialogues were employed. The study revealed that Children’s everyday life at the <b>centre</b> <b>revolved</b> around two intertwined activities; play and learning however, children have preference for play over learning. In addition, it was revealed that education and care cannot be separated. The study also revealed diverse perceptions of play, healthcare and learning which have different policy and projects implication. The study brought to light that children are social actor with agency. In addition it was revealed that gendered play in early learning centre is instantaneous, momental and contextual. The study further revealed direct and indirect benefits of ECCD. Moreover, ECCD provides an arena for both formal and informal learning to children. However, lack of policy has affects the implementation of ECCD. The study also revealed that Local cultural practices in ECCD centre help children to transition smoothly between home and the centre and helps in maintenance of cultural heritage. The Use of the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child (UNCRC) more than the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the child (ACRWC) in implementing ECCD has been influenced by donor funding. Finally, the study revealed multiple challenges that staff encounter in implementing centre based ECCD. The study revealed ambivalences surrounding the practice of ECCD resulting from a lack of policy framework. Therefore, I argue that ECCD policy should be built on Zambian culture and practices, a model that the local people and program implementers will identify themselves with and should include children’s views to meet their needs...|$|R
40|$|Ludi za Helsinkijem, izložba je koja pruža jedinstven na pregled povijesti grada od 16. stoljeća do današnjih dana. Na donjem su se katu Gradskog muzeja Helsinki, kvadraturom dvostruko većemu od gornjega, kustosi očito odlučili za tematski pristup, pa se unutar skupina predmeta i/ili na infopanoima naziru teme Led, Plaže, Parkovi, Trgovi, Dom, 1918. godina. Uglavnom su to prostorni odnosno vremenski pečati zabilježeni u kolektivnoj memoriji stanovnika Helsinkija, ponajprije njihova najdraža mjesta - od popularnih kafića do običnih stanova u nekadašnjim radničkim četvrtimaMad about Helsinki is an {{exhibition}} {{that provides a}} unique view {{of the history of}} the city since the 16 th century. On the ground floor of the Helsinki City Museum the curators opted for a thematic approach, and within the groups of objects and/or on info panels the themes Ice, Beaches, Parks, Squares, Home, 1918 can be made out. On the whole these are signs of a time or space recorded in the collective memory of the inhabitants of Helsinki, most of all of their favourite places – from popular cafes to ordinary flats in the former workingclass neighbourhoods. On the upstairs unfolds a chronological conception of the exhibition, starting off with several archaeological remains of the 16 th century, related to the very beginnings of the settlement, concentrating then on twelve characters who in different phases of history were connected in various ways with Helsinki. For instance, interesting details can be learned about 16 th century mayor Lars Michelsson, the national poet Aleksis Kivi of the 19 th century or the contemporary comic strip artist and caricaturist Timo Mäkelä, whose drawings of Helsinki embellish the wall surfaces at the very end of the exhibition. The fact that the linear history of the city has been successfully narrated on the basis of the biographies of some of its, some more, some less, prominent individuals tells that the link between city and citizens is very tangible. The creator of the exhibition gives an interesting review with commentaries from multimedia and interactive museographic aids. At the end of the visit the public is given the microphone again through the set-up of the exhibition, undoubtedly a very important factor in the whole of the project. A great wall surface serves as a blackboard on which visitors can chalk their impressions and messages, while for a more permanent storage of information there is a tabletop computer with a questionnaire in three languages. The exhibition is accompanied by a Web site in Finnish: [URL] an extension of the questionnaire from the preparatory phase, but with more publicity and dialogue among the participants. It is intended to expand the repository of the collective memory about contemporary places of Helsinki, which the users of the page themselves add, recording their evaluations and comments about a given place, object or institution, and it enables them to add their own photographs. Putting the citizen, around whose experience everything <b>revolves,</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the whole project, Helsinki City Museum imitates the city. For the city is its inhabitants...|$|R
