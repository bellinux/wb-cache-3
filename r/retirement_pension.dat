25|$|During the Speaker's term, teacher benefit {{reforms were}} also accomplished. The legislation, which is {{described}} as the biggest change in the state's teacher retirement system in a generation, allows school districts to allocate less towards retirement pensions and more towards students. School district leaders have noted the change to <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> requirements have been a blessing, saying the separation allows school districts to spend more on school operations. The reform also created the option for teachers to commit more towards their own retirement, or have the option for a smaller pension.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck's {{idea was}} to {{implement}} welfare programs that were acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as safe working conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women's and child labor. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program. Bismarck's program centred squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity, and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers' government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a <b>retirement</b> <b>pension,</b> none of which were then in existence to any great degree.|$|E
25|$|Social {{problems}} on annexed territory were {{discussed in the}} cabinet meeting on December 22, 1939. The interior minister, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, {{who was responsible for}} questions of common goods, health service and social policy, proposed a solution based on unification. The Minister for Upper Country, Andor Jaross, disagreed with this solution and proposed providing the Czechoslovak welfare system for those in the annexed areas for a transitional period, but had no objections to decreasing it to the Hungarian level. The cabinet finally agreed on a compromise. The elimination of Czechoslovak laws from annexed territory was understood as a duty, but {{it had to be done}} step by step. The first step was to decrease the value of a <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> from its Czechoslovak value (150 pengő) to its Hungarian value (60 pengő) through a transition value of 120 pengő. Sickness insurance for workers in agriculture was preserved in the form of Czechoslovak regulation for the moment, but it was changed from compulsory to voluntary. In Slovakia, the Czechoslovak system of welfare was preserved after the break-up of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

Shepard became Chief of the [...] "Revenue Marine Division" [...] and is considered to be the first Commandant. He immediately began a campaign of reform and petitioned for funds for new cutters and a plan for officer retirement pensions. His plan was to quit spending money on repair of older vessels that did not meet modern needs of the service and acquire new vessels that served more efficiently. The officer situation was one of many officers serving well into their eighties, thus hindering younger officers chances of promotion. This affected the morale of the service considerably and kept many able young men from joining the service. The senior officers stayed on in command {{because of a lack of}} a <b>retirement</b> <b>pension.</b> Shepard closed the Revenue Cutter School at Fort Trumbull, Connecticut soon after assuming the office of Chief of the Revenue Cutter Division to dramatize the lack promotion opportunities and the last class of Cadets graduated in May 1890.
