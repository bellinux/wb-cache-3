5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the CIA's Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, {{commissioned}} the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with {{the cover story}} of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine, the K-129, {{with the goal of}} retrieving Soviet code books.|$|E

5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|In {{the gold}} <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, {{and it was}} used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1835, Jackson {{sent two}} representatives from Washington, D.C., Richard <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> Pennsylvania and Benjamin Chew Howard of Maryland, to Toledo to {{arbitrate}} {{the conflict and}} present a compromise to both governments.

5|$|San Francisco {{was founded}} on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain {{established}} Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.|$|E
5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in a <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line and then stopped following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies were struggling to raise funding.|$|E
5|$|These acts were {{followed}} {{by a number of}} bands who shared aspects of their music, including Snow Patrol, from Northern Ireland and Elbow, Embrace, Starsailor, Doves and Keane from England.

5|$|Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to {{a design}} by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and {{reflects}} the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> the 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{influx of}} population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s goldrushes, particularly the Kiandra <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> 1859–60. The goldrushes prompted {{the establishment of}} communication between Sydney and the region {{by way of the}} Cobb & Co coaches, which transported mail and passengers. The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon the following year. Bushranger activity continued with the goldrushes: Australian-born bandits Ben Hall and the Clarke brothers were active in the area, targeting mail coaches and gold transportation.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E

5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, {{under the cover}} of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial now sits {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E

It has since been certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and it has sold sales 4,925,000 copies as of July 2014. It has been certified 7x platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, having accumulated shipments of over 490,000units, and 4x times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 400,000.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E
