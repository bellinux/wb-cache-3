5000|$|Like in {{most other}} European countries, family law has {{traditionally}} given legal authority to the husband; but has been reformed {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. The marital power of the husband was abolished in 1958, but property laws were reformed only in the 1970s, when legal gender equality between husband and wife was <b>established.</b> <b>Adultery</b> was decriminalized in 1987. Same-sex marriage in Belgium was legalized in 2003. The divorce law in Belgium was liberalized in September 2007. In the 21st century, the link between marriage and fertility has decreased: in 2012, 52.3% of births were outside of marriage. The centrality of marriage in peoples' life is no longer so strong: in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, the percentage of respondents who agreed with the assertion that [...] "Marriage is an outdated institution" [...] was 34.3% in Belgium.|$|R

5000|$|If the pursuer {{establishes}} an irretrievable {{breakdown of}} the marriage on grounds of adultery or behaviour then they can obtain a divorce immediately, while the other grounds require some period of prior separation. Circumstantial evidence can be provided to support {{the claims of the}} pursuer and the case is determined [...] "on the balance of probability" [...] rather than [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt". Therefore, for example, evidence of a husband staying in a hotel room with another woman for a night will likely <b>establish</b> <b>adultery,</b> even if sexual intercourse cannot be proved. The pursuer cannot seek a divorce based on their own adultery and the adulterous sexual intercourse committed by the defender must have been voluntary. To found a divorce on the behaviour of the defender the behaviour must be such as a reasonable person could not be expected to live with the defender. The behaviour can be from one event, though showing a pattern is more likely to convince the court, and it is irrelevant if the behaviour is passive or active or caused by a mental abnormality. There is no exact list of what behaviour will constitute grounds and the case law is filled with different examples. The finding by the court that the defender is at [...] "fault" [...] for the divorce will, however, not affect the amount of financial provision awarded or arrangements regarding any children.|$|R

Theophilus confined his wife to a house in Wild Court, Great Wild Street, from where she was rescued by her brother Thomas who broke in and knocked out the guard. Theophilus had Thomas imprisoned in Bridewell temporarily, and Susannah Maria {{returned to}} Sloper. Becoming greedy, Cibber sued Sloper for £5,000 damages for criminal conversation, which he described as threatening [...] "his peace of mind, his happiness, and his hopes of posterity". The prosecution produced witnesses, lodging house keepers Mr and Mrs Hayes, who admitted to spying on Sloper and Mrs Cibber through a wainscot partition, thus <b>establishing</b> <b>adultery</b> beyond doubt. Sloper's defence counsel rebutted by calling the Kensington housekeeper, Anne Hopson, who testified that Cibber received money from Sloper with full knowledge of his wife's affair. The defence said of Cibber: [...] "He takes his money, lets him maintain his family, resigns his wife to him, and then comes to court for justice, for reparation in damages." [...] Counsel concluded that [...] "there is no denomination in coin small enough to give in damages." [...] The jury concurred, and awarded Cibber a nominal £10.|$|R
