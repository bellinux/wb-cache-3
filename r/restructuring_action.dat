40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a model seeking {{to explain the}} discretionary write-downs, write-offs, and other restructuring provisions reported by managers. The model comprises a firm, a manager, and a financial market. The firm {{is about to be}} restructured. The manager has some private information about the likelihood of success of his <b>restructuring</b> <b>action.</b> The manager may recognise {{all or part of the}} expenditure associated with his future <b>restructuring</b> <b>action</b> by reporting a discretionary restructuring provision. The manager chooses whether or not to report a provision, recognising the impact of the provision on his compensation. The paper shows how. Under certain conditions, the manager may credibly communicate his private information to investors through his pro-vision policy. Testable implications are consistent with the empirical evidence reported by Strong and Meyer (1987), Elliott and Shaw (1988), and Zucca and Campbell (1992). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|E
40|$|The Australian grape-growing {{and wine}} {{producing}} industry enjoyed meteoric growth {{from the early}} 1990 s onwards, with wine sales forming an increasingly important element of both national export earnings and farm-sector income. Despite this success, a recent downward slump in industry profitability and a dampening of demand for wine {{has resulted in a}} call for government-assisted intervention, which would include a national „vine-pull‟. This paper examines the „Wine <b>Restructuring</b> <b>Action</b> Agenda ‟ (WRAA) proposed by a suite of industry bodies, and in particular the vine-pull policy option, in light of its predecessor, the vine-pull scheme of 1985 - 87. We argue that past experience suggests that both state and federal governments, and the industry itself, ought to explore the other options contained in the WRAA more fully, and indeed other emerging proposals for industry innovation and „light touch ‟ regulation, when addressing the long-term sustainability of the Australian wine industry...|$|E

In this paper we develop a simple model of …nancial distress, consis-tent with institutional characteristics of out-of-court renegotiation of debt. We use an asymmetric, sequential-move global game framework. The model contains three sectors: a …rm in …nancial distress, a well (though not perfectly) informed bank creditor and a di¤use set of small claimants to the …rm that interact in an environment of asymmetric information about the …rm’s solvency condition. We show that when the bank ac-cepts restructuring, it injects a degree of strategic solidity in the market and contract-revision o¤ers become successful for lower levels of the …rm’s fundamentals than when the bank does not interact with other creditors. However, it is shown that making the bank’s concession contingent on high minimum tendering rates may destroy the information content of its <b>restructuring</b> <b>action.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} utility industry is changing dramatically, with {{the generation of}} electricity moving away from nearly a century of economic regulation. In a new, competitive market for electricity supply, water and wastewater utilities of {{all shapes and sizes}} will need to change the way that they purchase electricity. They also will be called upon to provide different types of services to their customers. Compounding these concerns will be increased pressure on water resources from changes in the use of water for the generation of electricity. Finally, the trend toward consolidation in the water and wastewater industry, including the acquisition of water and wastewater systems by electric utilities, is expected to intensify. 1. 0 OVERVIEW As of October 1999, legislation has been enacted in 21 states to restructure the {{electric utility}} industry. Two other states have begun the process of restructuring through administrative action.

It is overlaid by a complex governance arrangement due to multiple landowners and stakeholders. There are four Inner West local government partners, the NSW Government and over ten other active community and stakeholders groups. This paper reports on an action research project aimed at developing sustainable governance processes and improving sustainable management outcomes. The academic research approach included a literature review, international case study comparisons, stakeholder participation analysis (including interviews and meeting observation), and capacity building practices. The journey towards sustainable governance by the Greenway stakeholders explored the need for social and ecological <b>restructuring</b> <b>action,</b> and recognised it as a political activity within which a collective and interactive process of negotiation takes place.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of two common methods of {{internal}} restructuring, layoffs and divestitures on the survival of a sample of UK firms. Using a Poisson regression model, we find that divestitures improve survival likelihood by reducing the probability and speed of market exit via takeover or bankruptcy, whereas layoffs increase the probability and speed of market exit via bankruptcy. Surprisingly, classifying firms into financially distressed and healthy groups, we find that distressed firms are less likely to restructure. Furthermore, while divestitures improve survival likelihood in both groups, layoff firms are less likely to survive, irrespective of whether they are distressed or healthy. Our findings are consistent with event studies that examine the market reaction to layoffs and divestiture decisions, and so provide some support for the view that the market correctly values the consequences of these <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> on firm survival. The results are robust to several econometric and modeling issues, including controlling for potential self-selection bias. Ronan Powell and Alfred Yawso...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of MNCs’ crisis-driven cost-cutting and organizational <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> on their local subsidiaries in Hungary. We hypothesize that much of the cost-cutting minded and efficiency-focused organizational transformation prompted by the global crisis of 2008 can actually be beneficial to some subsidiaries. Drawing on interviews carried out at 13 manufacturing subsidiaries, we find that upgrading occurs partly as a consequence of MNCs’ pressure to reduce costs and improve efficiency, partly as an outcome of organizational restructuring and resources reallocation, and partly as a result of an increasing delegation of advanced functions to production subsidiaries. Although the Hungarian subsidiaries were on the receiving end: they hosted some of the relocated production activities, the main managerial implication is that caution is needed, success often breeds failure. The resulting overconfidence may prevent local managers and policy-makers from monitoring and analyzing industry-specific technological and market trends to detect opportunities and threats as early as possible...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{privatization}} programmes in a variety of different countries have radically reduced {{the role of the state}} as a major owner of productive assets. While there is empirical evidence to show that the switch in ownership generally improves productive efficiency and profitability at company level, its effects on research and development (R&D) activities, which can impact strongly on long-term performance, have been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper we address this issue by analyzing seven cases of privatization that have recently occurred in Italy and France in order to gauge how R&D activities may be affected by privatization in terms of objectives and organization.

The sample periods covering the 1997 East Asian economic crisis are separated into three phases: pre-crisis (1996), during the crisis (1997 - 1998) and post-crisis (1999 - 2000). The presence of relationships between firms and banks is expected to increase the possibility of firm restructuring activities because of useful and timely advice from their close banks. In the pre-crisis period, the probability of dividend cut is higher among bank-connected firms than non-connected firms; during the crisis, top management turnover appears to be the restructuring strategy adopted by connected firms. In the post-crisis period, however, connected firms are less likely to undertake debt <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions,</b> which are mainly driven by a lower incidence of financial advisor appointments. Nevertheless, we find no strong evidence that bank relationships add value to the firms because changes in performance after undertaking restructuring activities are not significantly different between connected and non-connected firms.

3000|$|An {{important}} gap becomes obvious when {{accounting for}} the fact that most empirical corporate restructuring studies are only based on cross-sectional data. Pandit (2000) concludes in his review that large longitudinal sample studies are scarce. This lack of longitudinal restructuring research hinders scholars to effectively link restructuring content to the process (Pettigrew 2012). Additionally, various scholars note a lack of consistency regarding clearly defined restructuring time frames (Smith and Graves 2005; Stopford and Baden-Fuller 1990). As Chowdhury (2002) points out that allowing for a certain time span is critical, as most <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> yield lagged results. However, if the chosen time frame is too short, a specific move’s true effects might be excluded, and if too broad, model noise rapidly increases. Researchers could address this gap by resorting to dynamic panel data models, enabling them to account for both firm-specific and industry-specific fixed effects, as well as time-variant influences (Brauer 2006). The outcome variation could thus be linked to distinct process patterns, increasing the turnaround models’ explanatory power. The resulting research questions include: “Does post-bankruptcy performance represent a firm’s final profitability, or is this an intermediate effect?”, “How long do individual turnaround moves’ impacts lag behind implementation?”, and “When should an individual restructuring activity be best implemented to release its full potential during the turnaround phase?” [...]...|$|R
40|$|Generating {{government}} revenue {{is a common}} objective in privatization. This paper asks: what determines privatization prices? Pursuing this query helps resolve the current controversies about the bearing of speed and the role for government actions prior to privatization. The data, gathered from primary sources, encompass 361 privatized Mexican companies in 49 four-digit industry codes. The determinants of auction privatization prices are divided into three groups: (1) company performance and industry parameters; (2) the auction process and its requirements; and (3) the prior <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> taken by the government. Controlling for company and industry effects reveals the significant impact of the costs and characteristics of the labor force. Minority control packages carry large discounts. Auction requirements that allow foreign investors result in higher sale premia, while restrictions constraining participation or payment forms reduce net prices. The speed of privatization substantially influences net prices: the longer it takes to put the company on the block, the more severe the deterioration in performance, and the lower the premium obtained. Pre-sale reductions in labor force, and particularly the firing of CEOs, lead to significantly higher premiums. Debt absorption, investment, and performance improvement programs do not increase the net price, while de-investment measures prove more beneficial. Overall, the results show increased premia for government actions that stimulate bidder participation and expedite the privatization process. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{case study}} evidence of large Slovak firms chosen {{to represent a}} wide range of initial conditions, privatization techniques and success with restructuring. We document the ownership changes and <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> of firms. We then re-examine several hypotheses about firm restructuring in the light of this new evidence. In particular, we show that the majority of large Slovak firms have successfully restructured in the absence of foreign investors and government-led restructuring programmes. The study also generates some new queries on the effectiveness of different privatization methods in enhancing corporate governance and improving access to skills and capital. We find that privatization to insiders through management-employee buy-outs did not hamper firm restructuring, at least in the initial years after privatization, as the new owners (old managers) invested heavily in new technology, laid off a substantial part of their workforce, sought foreign partnerships, and were prepared to sell controlling stakes to outsiders in return for fresh financial resources. The evidence also suggests that the mass privatization programme in the Slovak Republic did not result in weak corporate governance since it was followed by a rapid consolidation of outsider ownership. This is in contrast to the anecdotal evidence for Georgia, Russia and Ukraine which opted for mass privatization to insiders (managers and employees) Copyright The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1998. ...|$|R

Data The data of this study consists of a unique hand-collected sample of U. S. listed firms that have filed for Chapter 11 during 1994 - 2003. All financial data is obtained from Thomson Reuter’s DataStream database. Information on Chapter 11 filing and resolution dates as well as on Chapter 11 outcomes is gathered by manually examining firm news and stock exchange releases, which are accessed via the Lexis-Nexis news database. For many of the larger firms, dates and initial outcomes are retrieved from the Bankruptcy Database, which can be accessed via Lexis-Nexis. Results This thesis finds a number of firm-specific determinants that significantly explain cross-sectional variation in Chapter 11 duration and outcome. Empirical results indicate that smaller firms with higher pre-filing profitability spend less time in Chapter 11. However, while debt restructuring is shown to significantly increase a firm’s likelihood of a successful reorganization, larger reductions of debt considerably lengthen the Chapter 11 process. Consistent with the theories of economies of scale in bankruptcies, this study finds evidence of significant minimum Chapter 11 durations, suggesting there exists a fixed component in indirect bankruptcy costs. Furthermore, this study reports evidence that support earlier arguments that Chapter 11 durations have declined lately. 	 Larger firm size as well as higher pre-filing leverage and profitability are found to be related to an increased likelihood of a successful reorganization. Furthermore, firms that decrease their number of employees, cut capital expenditure and reduce leverage while in Chapter 11 significantly increase the likelihood of emergence. These results support the views that the existing Chapter 11 bankruptcy process allows promising firms to emerge. Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate that firms are able influence their fates in Chapter 11 and that certain <b>restructuring</b> <b>actions</b> significantly improve a firm’s chances of success in reorganization...|$|R
40|$|We {{contrast}} {{the features of}} the German corporate governance system with those of other systems and discuss the recent regulatory initiatives. For example, the rules on insider trading and anti-trust have been strengthened. The Restructuring Act has been revised to prevent minority shareholders from stalling corporate <b>restructuring</b> via legal <b>actions.</b> The Takeover Act now prescribes a tender offer as soon as an investor acquires at least 30 % of a firm's equity. However, the Act also allows anti-takeover devices. Despite the recent, substantial changes, we conclude that the main characteristics of the German system are still in place. ...|$|R
