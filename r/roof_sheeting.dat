25|$|The {{dominant}} {{element of the}} church's design is the parabolic arched roof over the nave and sanctuary. Clad in metal <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting,</b> the parabolic form is created by a reinforced concrete arch at the front, regularly spaced laminated timber arches throughout the interior and a brick end wall at the rear. A raised strip of roofing along the apex is clad in opaque sheeting.|$|E
25|$|Located on the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} show ring and set into the earth bank which rises up to the railway line is a toilet building. This houses female amenities and a baby change room. The walls are a combination of face brickwork and rendered masonry with high level fixed vent glass louvres. The roof consists of two intersecting gables and is clad with metal custom orb <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|E
25|$|When completed, the {{parabolic}} {{roof was}} clad in flat aluminium sheeting, folded over angled timber fillets which ran horizontally {{along the length}} of the roof. Panels of translucent corrugated fibreglass sheeting ran along the apex and in six vertical strips at the southern end. By 1968, problems with leaking led to the <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> being replaced with corrugated aluminium. Repairs and changes have been made since and all of the original translucent sections of the parabolic roof have been replaced with opaque sheeting. Thus, internal features such as the side-lighting of the sanctuary wall and indirect light along the apex of the parabolic ceiling have been lost.|$|E
40|$|Wind-induced fatigue {{loading and}} damage to roof {{claddings}} on gable-roof and hip-roof buildings are investigated {{in this study}} through both wind tunnel tests and computer analyses. The magnitude and distribution of wind pressures on both roofs are first measured at different wind directions. Fatigue characteristics of wind pressures are identified based on a rainflow count method for each tap at its critical wind direction in which its largest negative pressure occurs. Total fatigue loading at each tap on both roofs is then computed using the obtained fatigue characteristics and information on wind climate. Finally, fatigue damage to screw-fastened light-gauge steel <b>roof</b> <b>sheetings</b> of different profiles is estimated in terms of previously obtained S-N curves and a modified Miner's rule. The distributions of fatigue damage index over both roofs show that under the same strong winds, fatigue damage to the hip roof cladding is much less severe than that gable roof cladding. For each type of roof configuration, there are considerable differences in fatigue loading and fatigue damage with respect to different locations of pressure taps and different profiles of <b>roof</b> <b>sheetings.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{walls were}} clad with sandstone from Scania, {{and the new}} castle was given a <b>roof</b> with copper <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} of a roof may range from banana leaves, wheaten straw or seagrass to laminated glass, copper (see: copper <b>roofing),</b> aluminium <b>sheeting</b> and pre-cast concrete. In {{many parts of}} the world ceramic tiles have been the predominant roofing material for centuries, if not millennia. Other roofing materials include asphalt, coal tar pitch, EPDM rubber, Hypalon, polyurethane foam, PVC, slate, Teflon fabric, TPO, and wood shakes and shingles.|$|R
25|$|Hangar 7 was {{the fourth}} timber framed igloo on the airfield, located some {{distance}} from the others at the end of straight six for security reasons. It became the workshops for the ATAIU, and was rectangular in plan with personnel access from centrally located skillion roofed door openings. The west end was clad with weatherboard, with a large central doorway for aircraft access. The building had corrugated iron <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> with flush skylights as it had no artificial lighting. Internally it was divided by low partitions, creating separate cells for the various tasks associated with dismantling, analysing and reassembling the captured aircraft. Each cell had its own specialisation, which included workshops for aircraft engines, navigation systems, radio, weapons, and body reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b> The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E
2500|$|The lych gate, flanked on {{both sides}} by random rubble {{retaining}} walls, defines the main entrance to the church grounds {{at the corner of}} Vulture Street and Balmoral Terrace. Constructed from heavy timbers, it has decorative cross bracing and a gable roof, clad in metal <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> and lined with timber tongue and groove boards. Curved brackets on the street-facing side form an archway, above which the words [...] "Seek and ye shall find" [...] are carved in Gothic-style script. Curved red concrete steps ascend from street level to the gate, before continuing as straight steps up to a red concrete pathway leading to the entrance porch.|$|E
50|$|The two {{buildings}} are linked with a low-pitched gabled <b>roof</b> with translucent <b>sheeting.</b> Amenities and some service areas {{are located in}} this area. External concrete stairs lead from the upper floor towards the train station.|$|R
50|$|The Southport Bathing Pavilion {{demonstrates}} {{the influence of}} a Spanish Mission style of architecture particularly with the decorative parapeted gables, roughcast stucco render, entrance loggia, prominent <b>roof</b> with corrugated <b>sheeting</b> reminiscent of the cordova tile and arched openings.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the winding}} house are {{the remains of}} a storage shed roughly 4 m by 5 m with walls that {{supported}} a gabled <b>roof</b> of profiled <b>sheeting</b> and is probably more recent than the winding house, built in a period of improvement in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 $620,000 was {{allocated}} by the Federal {{government for}} the restoration and conservation of the building, including the repair of the sandstone, masonry and <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along the ridgeline, {{natural light}} enters the hall through {{sections}} of translucent <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b> A suspended, arched light cove partially shields {{views of the}} roof structure and five large metal ventilators along the ridgeline. The arched roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting.|$|E
50|$|The centre’s energy {{efficient}} features includes rain water storage, water flow restrictors, an insulated roof with light coloured <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> and solar hot water panels and louvers. The centre is ISO 9001 accredited with Lloyd's of London {{and has an}} EarthCheck Benchmarked Bronze status.|$|E
50|$|In steel construction, {{the term}} purlin {{typically}} refers to roof framing members that span {{parallel to the}} building eave, and support the <b>roof</b> decking or <b>sheeting.</b> The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized {{in a manner that}} allows flexural continuity between spans.|$|R
25|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a concrete floor throughout and exposed unpainted timber truss arches. Sections of the <b>roof</b> have translucent <b>sheeting</b> for light, and the eastern end is supported by scaffolding. The single-storeyed office accommodation along the southwest projects into the space, and is constructed in hardboard sheeting and is surmounted by air handling equipment. The hangar is currently used for freight storage.|$|R
50|$|In 1856 {{the kitchen}} wing was {{constructed}} {{perpendicular to the}} original house and using slabs of timber from earlier slab huts and shingling from trees on the property. The construction work was completed by general employees of Tarong. In 1870 a chimney was constructed near the kitchen, which collapsed in 1872 and required replacement, which was done {{in conjunction with the}} covering of the shingled <b>roof</b> with iron <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The extant {{church is}} a {{substantial}} red faced brick building, featuring external solid brick buttresses and lancet windows. The apse section of the church has metal <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b> Whereas the main roof of the church - a simple gable roof - is clad in asbestos <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> material. The vestry addition to the {{church is a}}lso of red brick, and has a corrugated sheet metal gabled roof. This structure has windows and doors that reflect {{the form of the}} original church building. Storm water from the main church structure and the vestry is collected in two separate concrete water tanks that are visually obtrusive. These storm water tanks are situated on the Gordon Street side of the main church building.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, the State of Missouri {{acquired}} {{the bridge and}} established the Locust Creek Covered Bridge State Historic Site, then repaired the bridge, replacing its <b>roof,</b> <b>sheeting,</b> and flooring. The Missouri Department of Conservation undertook another major improvement in 1991, raising the bridge by six feet to protect the wooden frame and flooring from the marshy ground.|$|E
50|$|The roof is a {{pyramidal}} {{shape with}} a truncated apex {{to allow a}} square ventilator on top. The timber-framed roof is sheeted externally with corrugated iron, and has iron capping covering the four ridges. It is lined internally with an insulating material, possibly fibro cement sheeting. The eastern and western sides of the top ventilator are still attached to {{the apex of the}} roof. They are made of flat galvanized sheet and are also lined with the same insulating material as the <b>roof.</b> The <b>sheeting</b> on the western side of the ventilator clearly shows an imprint of the queen's head and the number 33 underneath. A shaped piece of iron lying inside the building indicates that the damper over this ventilator was also pyramidal in shape.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the farm house is a large barn {{constructed}} primarily of hardwood slabs and milled weatherboards with a corrugated iron roof. The barn is 15 metres by 10 metres and is elevated off the ground. The floor of the central section is made of hardwood boards, while the lower floors to either side are laid with large timber slabs. The building has been rebuilt recently and some <b>roof</b> framing and <b>sheeting</b> are therefore quite recent. Some new hardwood slabs have been introduced recently.|$|R
40|$|Covering is {{the partial}} or total {{enclosure}} of raw materials, byproducts, finished products, containers, equipment, process operations, and material storage areas that, {{when exposed to}} rain and/or runoff, could contaminate storm water. Tarpaulins, plastic <b>sheeting,</b> <b>roofs,</b> buildings, and other enclosures are examples of temporary or permanent coverings that are effective in preventing storm water contamination. The most prominent advantage of covering {{is that it is}} inexpensive in comparison to other BMPs. Temporary covering methods, such as plastic sheeting, can become torn or ripped, exposing the contaminant to precipitation and/or storm water runoff...|$|R
50|$|Of {{the earlier}} buildings, {{the engine room}} and its annexe and the gas {{producer}} room are of two distinct types of construction. The engine room is constructed of a sawn timber frame with a trussed roof structure. Both walls and <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> have been replaced at least in parts. The amenities wing east of the engine room is similarly of sawn timber frame construction. The amenity rooms are clad in corrugated galvanised iron externally and lined internally with composition board. The workshop, constructed in 1934 is a sawn timber framed with trussed roof clad in corrugated iron without internal lining. By contrast, the gas producer rooms are constructed of large timber posts set directly {{into the ground and}} to which a sawn timber frame is attached. The building is clad with corrugated iron sheeting. Roof trusses, supporting corrugated <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting,</b> are themselves supported at mid-span by hardwood poles.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-1880s {{alluvial}} {{output from}} the Palmer River goldfields declined, {{and money to}} develop the extensive reefs in the district was not forthcoming. By 1894 the amount of explosives stored in the Cooktown Powder Magazine was very small, and little was being expended on maintaining the building. In 1907 repairs to the <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting,</b> roof framing, batteries and fence were carried out.|$|E
50|$|Rush House {{has been}} more {{recently}} refurbished and includes the removal of roof ventilator fleches and chimneys, {{the replacement of the}} <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting</b> in COLORBOND sheeting and the painting of the brickwork. Changes to the interior include the addition of partitions to dormitory areas, the replacement of joinery, lining of floors and the addition of suspended ceilings and air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|The first {{imported}} {{roofing material}} was corrugated iron <b>sheeting.</b> <b>Roofs</b> {{of this type}} were {{to become part of}} the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.|$|R
50|$|Ullanad Panikkars rescued {{and looked}} after the temple from 1825 to 1900. Like Chempakasseri Nambudiri and Desavarma Nambudiri, Panikkars offered {{everything}} from service to property. Thus with their help daily puja and annual festivals {{were once again}} restored. From 1859 to 1892, the Chuttambalam, the Vilakkumatam, the Koottambalam and Sasta shrine were renovated and <b>roofed</b> with copper <b>sheeting.</b> In 1900, Konti Menon, as a manager fixed the hours of worship and led the drive to keep the temple premises clean. He set up the big bell and reconstructed Pattayappura (granary). In 1928, Kozhikode once again became the administrator of Guruvayur.|$|R
40|$|Asbestos {{is a term}} {{referring}} to six naturally occurring silicate materials used commercially for their intrinsic properties of high tensile strength, heat and fire resistance, as well as acoustic and thermal insulation. The English name is derived from a Greek term meaning “inextinguishable. ” Aside from its fire retardant properties, humans also discovered early on that asbestos fibres were strong enough to be woven—such that the traditional Chinese character for asbestos 石棉 actually means “stone cotton. ” Asbestos fibres occur in two natural configurations, amphibole and serpentine, with a derivative of the latter (chrysotile), accounting for around 95 % of all asbestos used around the world. Being more flexible than the amphibole forms, chrysotile asbestos was {{the most commonly used}} variant throughout the 20 th Century—often as asbestos cement <b>roofing,</b> wall <b>sheeting,</b> water storage tanks and brake pads. Chrysotile mining began in Quebec, Canada, in the late 1870 s, and by the 1980 s, consumption of asbestos products in the United States alone, had exceeded half a million tons per year...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} wing {{was extended}} {{with a more}} substantial single-storey structure distinguished by the {{break in the roof}} between the main hipped form and the separate skillion over the verandahs on two sides. The materials are loadbearing facebrick, timber floor and colorbond custom orb <b>roof</b> <b>sheeting.</b> Verandah posts on these first two wings consist of rectangular profile timber supports with simple column capitals.|$|E

50|$|The Gross Point Light's primary {{structure}} is the conical light tower. The tower {{stands on a}} concrete foundation with wooden piles that reach {{to a depth of}} 30 ft. The tower's two outer walls include an inner air space between them. The inner wall has a thickness of 8 in and rises vertically. The outer wall, at a thickness of 12 in, rises at a slight incline and gives the tower its conical shape. The tower begins with a 22 ft circumference at its base and 13 ft at its parapet. The tower lantern is of glass and iron construction and is topped by a copper <b>sheeting</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hurricane's high {{storm surge}} swept into Miami and Miami Beach, {{flooding}} city streets with knee-deep water. Yachts and large vessels were {{carried by the}} intense wind and waves onto shore. The MacArthur Causeway connecting Miami and Miami Beach was submerged under 6 ft of water, and communication between the two locales {{as well as the}} rest of the United States was cut after all local telecommunications and power lines were blown down. Due to their susceptibility to strong winds, most wooden buildings in Miami were either blown down or lost their roofs. Concrete and steel buildings were warped at their bases. While skyscrapers mostly sustained minor damage, the 18-story Meyer-Kiser Building bore considerable damage. The structure reportedly swayed and vibrated precipitously during the storm; eyewitnesses likened it to the Charleston dance. Many of the injuries in the city were due to ballistic fragments of broken <b>roofing</b> including iron <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
40|$|Human UV {{exposure}} {{is influenced by}} many factors. Localised human UV {{exposure is}} particularly influenced by the surfaces surrounding humans, such as the reflectivity of UV radiation of these surfaces. Albedo is the classical characteristic to express reflectivity, however, this is somewhat limited to surfaces at which the incident and reflected radiation is broadly defined as 'up-welling' and 'down-welling' UV radiation. Where large solar zenith angles allow, albedo {{can be used for}} vertical surfaces, where the incident radiation is striking the surface close to the normal of the surface, however, for other solar zenith angles, albedo either over-estimates, or under-estimates the reflective capacity of a vertical surface, particularly in direct UV environments. An alternative characteristic of the reflective capacity that takes into account surface orientation has been proposed and used: reflected global irradiance. This characteristic is a non-specific unit ratio of the reflected irradiance to the global irradiance present in the atmosphere. The reflected global irradiance is dependent on solar zenith angle, orientation, position, and surface type. In this study, the impact of reflected global irradiance on UV exposures of humans working near vertical surfaces has been explored. Metal sheeting is often used in an urban environment for walls and fences as well as <b>roofing.</b> Metal <b>sheeting</b> is UV reflective and this study concentrates on the impact of working near vertical metal sheeting surfaces, by considering erythemal and vitamin D 3 weighted exposures. ...|$|R
