5|$|Being a political, <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> {{centre of}} unique {{prestige}} and influence, Winchester, through the conscious efforts of its monastic school to standardize language, {{must also have}} become a factor of prime importance {{in the evolution of}} the literary standard in use throughout England in the late Old English period.|$|E
5|$|There are cave monasteries which functioned {{during the}} Second Bulgarian Empire as <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> centres.

5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> centre, intended {{more as a}} display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Sélestat {{had a total}} {{population}} of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in Alsace. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance {{it was the third}} largest city in the region, after Strasbourg and Colmar, and it is ranked the third commune in Alsace for cultural heritage. Sélestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks to the trade in wine and a thriving <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century. The town eventually experienced a new demographic growth {{in the second half of}} the 20th century when it became a small industrial and cultural centre.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying mantis and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of immortality. Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems.

5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
5|$|The seafront has {{ornamental}} gardens, a Victorian bandstand {{and other}} attractions. Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter {{and is used}} for donkey rides in the summer. The shore consists of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour at {{the western edge of}} the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo. The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Clevedon Pier, opened in 1869, is one of the earliest surviving examples of a Victorian pier. On 17 October 1970, two outward spans collapsed when the seventh set of legs from the shore failed during a routine insurance load test. A trust was eventually formed and the pier and its buildings were restored and reopened on 27 May 1989, when the Waverley paddle steamer berthed and took on passengers. Other landmarks include Walton Castle, Clevedon Court the Clock Tower and the Curzon Cinema. Clevedon's light industry is centred mainly in industrial estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 motorway junction. It is a dormitory town for Bristol. The town is home to educational, <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> buildings and sports clubs.|$|E
