Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at Warwick University in partnership with the School of the Built Environment at Oxford Brookes University under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.£25m into universities across the country to strengthen <b>research-informed</b> teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for <b>research-informed</b> teaching. In April 2007 the University of Central Lancashire appointed the first ever Chair in <b>Research-informed</b> Teaching, Stuart Hampton-Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for <b>Research-informed</b> Teaching.|$|E

50|$|<b>Research-informed</b> Teaching {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of linking research with teaching in Higher Education. Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research.|$|E

5000|$|According to Lithuanian {{literary}} critic and philosopher of culture V. Daujotytė, [...] ""here comes {{a very important}} idea {{in the book of}} A. Bučys: conflicts have arisen and arise {{from the fact that the}} world from the middle ages, and earlier, could not and cannot agree, cannot find a common language due to various approaches and a fierce desire for a single truth. The position of the author, tested and discussed, it seems reasonable: [...] " [...] "the true sacral base by its nature is not compatible with any mono-paradigm“; sacred nature lies deeper than reaches the dogma of “monopartism” in religion and in the humanities. But the strong position of the [...] "powers that be" [...] suppress other positions, other paradigms“. According to the author, „the chronicle of the medieval ages is not one text shows a belief that all that is outside of the Christian faith, this is the world of heretics“. In the book positively says about the work of Vladimir Pashuto [...] "Formation of the Lithuanian State" [...] (1959); for this study, <b>research-informed,</b> lets see how much untruth has been written about the beginning of the statehood of Lithuania. The author reminds about the work of Edward W.Said's [...] "Orientalism" [...] (1978); according to A. Bučys, „we can expect a study, which, in the tradition of W.Said's, consistently and deeply will reveal a long history of creating a negative image of Paganism in the Baltic countries and ancient Lithuania". „Wherever the right is considered a single paradigm, there to its limits is narrowed world“.|$|E
40|$|There is now {{considerable}} {{support in}} the higher education literature for <b>research-informed</b> teaching {{as a means of}} improving student learning, particularly where this involves students as co-investigators. Such an approach, however, comes with a number of risks that have received little pedagogic attention. This paper addresses that knowledge gap by advocating a novel approach to <b>research-informed</b> teaching which adopts a risk-management philosophy. We review the literature surrounding the challenges of this style of teaching and identify why a risk-management approach might be appropriate to address some of the inherent issues of <b>research-informed</b> teaching previously reported. Our findings indicate a range of potential risks associated with either the delivery, or non-delivery, of <b>research-informed</b> teaching. We offer a broad framework categorising these risks. Forming the basis of a wider risk-management approach, this framework could promote increased reflection and enhancement of teaching practice...|$|E
40|$|Reported {{benefits}} of <b>research-informed</b> teaching include enhanced student engagement and graduates that are {{better prepared for}} employment in an uncertain world. However, {{there are a number}} of academic risks that can have both positive and negative impacts on staff and students when implementing <b>research-informed</b> teaching. Mitigating such risks could smooth the way for, or even encourage, wider exploration of innovative teaching methods with associated benefits. This paper presents findings of an empirical study that identifies what risks were encountered or perceived from both student and staff perspectives when adopting a <b>research-informed</b> teaching approach. Risks were identified through semi-structured interviews with multi-disciplinary staff and a questionnaire survey with students. Two risk categories were revealed as particularly significant for student learning: curriculum bias and how research engagement impacts on student experience. Staff reported considerable positive impacts on well-being and motivation when adopting <b>research-informed</b> teaching. In light of this, the frequently encountered strategies for staff to reduce risks and negative impacts are presented, including raising awareness of key teaching styles or methods and fostering a sense of wider cultural support for innovative pedagogies within and between disciplines and departments. More could be gained by acknowledging and managing the risks associated with <b>research-informed</b> teaching than by strategically avoiding this type of activity...|$|E
40|$|In a bid {{to attract}} {{students}} amidst increasing competition within the sector, many universities claim that their teaching is “research-informed”. However, there is some disagreement amongst academics about what actually counts as <b>research-informed</b> teaching and therefore {{how it should be}} developed and delivered. Furthermore, whilst academic reputation is a key factor for prospective university applicants, the primary objective of the majority is to enhance employability. Institutions must therefore be careful to ensure that <b>research-informed</b> teaching is developed {{in a way that is}} perceived to help rather than hinder this fundamental objective. This article seeks to define <b>research-informed</b> teaching and then considers whether clinical approaches to both teaching and research can offer more widely applicable strategies for effective integration of the two. Two case studies are considered: first, the writer’s own experience as a solicitor in private practice; and secondly, Hallam Law, Sheffield Hallam University’s pro bono law clinic. It is submitted that by adopting a clinical approach to the research and teaching on more orthodox, academic modules, it may be possible to develop and deliver <b>research-informed</b> teaching in a way that enhances employability and therefore appeals to prospective law students...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{qualitative}} health researchers of diverse disciplinary backgrounds {{are experimenting with}} various forms of performance (e. g., film, live theater, dance) as innovative approaches to engage broader communities in complex and critical ways with research. Despite this emerging alliance between performance and research, much of <b>research-informed</b> performance work is informed by an "aesthetic of objectivity," which assumes a linear trajectory between research findings and performance, and minimizes the relevance of aesthetic interpretation, which we argue is fundamental to achieving critical <b>research-informed</b> performative work. To move beyond this aesthetic of objectivity, we will explore our development of a <b>research-informed</b> film, "Fit for Dialysis. " We argue that embracing the role of aesthetics, imagination, and embodiment more fully is essential to achieving the full interactive, educational, and emancipatory potential of the alliance between performance and research.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the pedagogical literature in drawing on findings from an institutional survey exploring perceptions of <b>research-informed</b> teaching, to examine how links between research and teaching can be suitably strengthened. Whilst the integration of research and teaching in higher education can provide valuable ways of enhancing the student learning experience, establishing such integrative links can be complex and problematic given different practices and levels of understanding. Definitions of ‘research-informed’ teaching indicate variations {{with respect to the}} active involvement of students in research that can be compounded by disciplinary traditions. The survey provided an indication {{of the extent to which}} <b>research-informed</b> teaching was practised at the University of Birmingham and thus an insight into understanding and practices. In particular, it offered insights into the ways in which <b>research-informed</b> teaching relationships were interpreted and embedded within disciplines, the barriers/difficulties to linking research and teaching and the perceived impact on the student learning experience. The findings suggest that understanding with respect to <b>research-informed</b> teaching was variable, with a lack of understanding among students of precisely what it constitutes identified as being a key issue. In this paper we discuss the type of approaches that could support more active student engagement in the curriculum and call for the sharing of more curriculum examples from within the disciplines...|$|E

40|$|Many {{institutions}} make {{claims in}} strategy documents and official publications {{that students will}} receive an education which is research-led, <b>research-informed,</b> or guided by the scholarship of teaching and learning. Academics who teach regularly experience at first-hand the sometimes conflicting demands of research, teaching and supporting learning. Curricula guidelines are unlikely to help in developing any sophisticated understanding {{of ways in which}} research and teaching can be symbiotically applied, since such guidelines most typically deal with the content rather than the educational process experienced by our undergraduates. For these reasons an academic’s understanding of the research teaching nexus {{is more likely to be}} informed by their own workaday experience of designing and delivering educational experiences than from an analysis of the students ’ perspective. If academics in the computing disciplines are to effectively deliver on their institutional missions to be scholarly, research-led or <b>research-informed</b> in their educational approaches, a clearer understanding of the possible meanings and implications of these terms in the context of the typical computing curricula would be of assistance. This paper presents and analyses the results of a survey conducted at two Universities which sought to identify how far their undergraduate curriculum was informed by research. This data is presented alongside qualitative data gathered from academics which explores their attitudes towards, and understanding of, the various terms commonly used to describe a <b>research-informed</b> approach to education in the computing disciplines...|$|E
