5|$|The {{net effect}} of all Reagan-era tax bills was a 1% {{decrease}} in government revenues when compared to Treasury Department revenue estimates from the Administration's first post-enactment January budgets. However, federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989, rising from $308.7 billion to $549 billion or an average annual rate of 8.2% (2.5% attributed to higher Social Security <b>receipts),</b> <b>and</b> federal outlays grew {{at an annual rate}} of 7.1%.|$|E
5|$|Traffic, <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> {{dividends}} steadily increased. Tolls {{rose from}} £1,468 in 1779 to £6,807 in 1821. The first dividend of 3.75 per cent was paid in 1786, and had reached 15.78 per cent by 1821. Figures for tonnage {{are not available}} for the early years, but were 79,359 tons in 1821. There was {{a dip in the}} carriage of merchandise in 1810, when the Kennet and Avon Canal opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London, but it picked up again after 1819, when the North Wilts Canal opened, providing a link from Latton to Abingdon via Swindon and the Wilts and Berks Canal, which was easier than using the Thames. The highest dividend paid was in 1833, when shareholders received 26.33 per cent, after which <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> dividends steadily dropped. In 1859 in order to allow the passage of a coal barge called the Queen Esther two of the locks were widened.|$|E

5|$|The {{new company}} {{made its debut}} at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff on 15 April 1946 with a double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. The {{orchestra}} was professional, mostly drawn {{from members of the}} BBC Welsh Orchestra; all the singers were amateurs, except for Tudor Davies, a tenor well known at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells, who sang Canio in Pagliacci. During the week-long season the new company also staged Faust, with Davies in the title role. Although nearing {{the end of his career}} he was a considerable box-office draw, and the company played to full houses. Nevertheless, the expense of a professional orchestra and the hire of costumes and scenery outweighed the box-office <b>receipts,</b> <b>and</b> the season made a small loss. Finance remained a recurring problem over the succeeding decades.|$|E
5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E

Fixed-effect regressions indicate {{that the relationship between}} parental welfare <b>receipt</b> <b>and</b> children’s educational outcomes becomes weaker after controlling for unobserved family characteristics, but they do not eliminate the negative relationship. The relationship between parental welfare <b>receipt</b> <b>and</b> children’s educational attainment is not uniform across childhood stages.
