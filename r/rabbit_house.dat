While Rabbit goes {{to get the}} plant food, Piglet gets startled by {{a knock on the}} door and he hides under Rabbit's bed with the carrot.

After hearing a noise coming from the cupboard, he opens it and finds Pooh inside, helping himself to some honey, much to Rabbit's annoyance. After finding Piglet under the bed with the carrot, he hears another knock on the door, which turns out to be Tigger, who bounces on him. Eeyore suddenly pops out from under them. Tigger then tries to demonstrate an ability where he throws a snowball and then catches it himself, but he misses it and flies into <b>Rabbit's</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Rabbit</b> worries about his carrot and although it is unharmed, he is more annoyed with Tigger's antics. Pooh then announces the party that Christopher Robin is hosting at <b>Rabbit's</b> <b>house.</b> While Tigger enjoys the moment, Rabbit doesn't. When Tigger tries to decorate the place, he ends up making a mess, making Rabbit so angry that he throws everyone out, planning to move. While they wonder what to do to keep Rabbit from leaving, Pooh suggests doing a resolution (which Christopher Robin had told him about earlier), a promise that they must keep no matter what.|$|R
40|$|Public opinion {{asks for}} {{adopting}} welfare-friendly techniques during rearing of farm animals. The housing system in pairs within wire-net cages (2 rabbits/cage) or small groups (4 - 8 rabbits/cage), {{which is currently}} implemented for rabbits should change and alternative pen housing should be adopted to ameliorate animal welfare in respect of growth performance and meat traits. The farming environment should change and be adjusted {{to the presence of}} a large group of animals with diversified social relationships that could be influenced by gender composition and slaughter age. The passage from the conventional housing systems to the new alternative ones cannot be achievable without previous research on the effects of this new system on growth performance and welfare of animals. To achieve this general goal, four trials have been conducted under the present thesis and the summaries of the results obtained are reported below: Trial No. 1 -Welfare and productivity of growing <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in bicellular cages and collective pens Trial No. 2 - Effect of floor type, stocking density, slaughter age, and gender on welfare and productivity of growing <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in collective pens Trial No. 3 –Effect of environmental enrichment and slaughter age on welfare and productivity of growing <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in collective pens Trial No. 4 –Effect of different gender composition and floor combinations on welfare and productivity of growing <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in collective pens On the base {{of the results of the}} present Thesis, pen housing may be a succesfull way for growing rabbits giving productive results comparable with those obtained in the current cage systems, but only if housing conditions are suitable for the animal...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of this {{experiment}} was {{to verify the}} compatibility of a group housing system, from weaning to slaughter, with the rabbit modern productive standards, evaluating the effects of different stocking densities and type of litter on health, performances and some aspects of carcass and meat quality. Two single experiences were carried out: a first, where 184 <b>rabbits</b> were <b>housed</b> in two-place cages or in pens on a straw litter at different densities (8 or 16 rabbits per m 2); a second, where 232 <b>rabbits</b> were <b>housed</b> at the same densities on straw or on wood shaving, while the control group was traditionally housed in cages. In trial 1, mortality rate was significantly higher for rabbits bred on litter at the higher density (15. 6 % vs 4. 2 % and 7. 5 % for groups housed on litter at low density or in cages, respectively). Higher death incidence was mainly due to coccidiosis. Thus, a prophylactic treatment was provided to all the animals {{before the beginning of}} trial 2 resulting in a lack of differences in mortality rate among the groups. If <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in cages showed a significantly higher weight increase and a better feed efficiency than <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> on litter in trial 1, final live weight, daily weight gain and feed to gain ratio for caged animals were not significantly higher than for <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> on litter in experiment 2. However, growing performances for rabbits kept at lower density were significantly higher than for the other animals reared in pens (P< 0. 05), while the type of litter had no effects. Animals caged showed a carcass weight and dressing out percentage significantly higher than all the other groups in the first assay. Furthermore, the hot carcass weight among <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> on litter was significantly higher for lower stocking density. In experiment 2, carcass weight turned out to be higher for rabbits in cage than on litter at the highest density while dressing out percentage was better than all the other experimental groups (P< 0. 001). Moreover, carcass weight was significantly higher in rabbits kept at lower density than the others ones reared in pens (P< 0. 05). The full gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier in <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> in pens on straw litter, in comparison with the caged animals. The chemical composition of the caecal content however did not show variation of the fibre composition {{as a function of the}} litter type. In trial 1, the pH at 45 min and at 24 hrs post mortem, as well as meat colour parameters were the same in all experimental groups. In experiment 2, it can be observed that the hind leg weight was constant among the groups, while the muscle to bone ratio of the cut was significantly higher in caged than in all the other animals. Furthermore, rabbits on litter had on the whole meat with an higher water and a lower lipid content. In conclusion, group housing system on litter imply some relevant questions that have to be pointed out, particularly concerning pathology problems (mainly connected to coccidiosis) compared to the intensive breeding in cages. Growth performances, slaughter results and carcass quality are on the whole better for animals traditionally caged. [ [...] . ...|$|R

50|$|Specific {{challenges}} to the keeping of rabbits vary by specific practices. Losses from coccidiosis are much more common when rabbits are kept on the ground (such as in warrens or colonies) or on solid floors than when on wire or slat cages that keep rabbits elevated away from urine and faeces. Pastured rabbits are more subject to predator attack. Rabbits kept indoors at an appropriate temperature rarely suffer heat loss in comparison to <b>rabbits</b> <b>housed</b> outdoors in summer. At the same time, if <b>rabbits</b> are <b>housed</b> inside without adequate ventilation, respiratory disease can be a significant cause of disease and death. Production does on fodder are rarely able to raise more than 3 litters a year without heavy losses from deaths of weak kits, abortion, and re-adsorption, all related to poor nutrition and inadequate protein intake. In contrast, rabbits fed commercial pelleted diets can face losses related to low fiber intake.|$|R
