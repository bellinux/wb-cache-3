40|$|In 2012 and 2013, was {{studied the}} occurrence, biology and {{harmfulness}} of Byctiscus betulae (L.) (Rhynchitidae) on forest woody {{plants in the}} Brno region. Leaf <b>rolls</b> were found <b>on</b> 13 species (and 10 genera) of woody plants. Most frequently, they occurred on Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp. (namely on T. cordata), Salix caprea and Populus tremula. The beetles hibernate in ground pupal chambers and appear on woody plants {{in the last decade}} of April. After hibernation, females live on average seven (males five) weeks, and damage on average 40 (males 25) cm 2 of leaves. The females create leaf <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> annual shoots they have gnawed, exceptionally (in 2 %) on leaves with damaged petioles. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> F. sylvatica, they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 5. 6 leaves whose total average area is 49. 5 cm 2 and lay on average 5. 1 eggs. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> Tilia spp., they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 63. 2 cm 2 and lay on average 4. 9 eggs. In the <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> S. caprea, they <b>roll</b> <b>on</b> average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 38. 3 cm 2 and lay on average 3. 5 eggs. The maximum number of laid eggs (on average 8. 0) was observed in the leaf <b>rolls</b> <b>on</b> Vitis vinifera. The average number of eggs in the leaf rolls was decreasing from May to July. The number of eggs was increasing with the increasing total leaf area rolled. The females lay on average 50 eggs. On P. tremula, S. caprea and Pyrus pyraster they create about 15 leaf <b>rolls,</b> <b>on</b> F. sylvatica and Tilia spp. about 10 leaf <b>rolls</b> and <b>on</b> V. vinifera ca. 8 leaf rolls. Embryogenesis lasts from 8 to 9 days. Larvae develop over 3 instars and damage ca. 300 mm 2 of leaves. Coming of age within 4 − 7 weeks, they leave the leaf rolls from mid-June to the beginning of September...|$|R
