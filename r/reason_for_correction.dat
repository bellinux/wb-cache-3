40|$|Abstract. Non-metric dissimilarity {{measures}} {{may arise}} in practice e. g. when objects represented by sensory measurements or by structural descriptions are compared. It {{is an open}} issue whether such non-metric measures should be corrected {{in some way to}} be metric or even Euclidean. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> such <b>corrections</b> is the fact that pairwise metric distances are interpreted in metric spaces, while Euclidean distances can be embedded into Euclidean spaces. Hence, traditional learning methods can be used. The k-nearest neighbor rule is usually applied to dissimilarities. In our earlier study [12, 13], we proposed some alternative approaches to general dissimilarity representations (DRs). They rely either on an embedding to a pseudo-Euclidean space and building classifiers there or on constructing classifiers on the representation directly. In this paper, we investigate ways of correcting DRs to make them more Euclidean (metric) either by adding a proper constant or by some concave transformations. Classification experiments conducted on five dissimilarity data sets indicate that non-metric dissimilarity measures can be more beneficial than their corrected Euclidean or metric counterparts. The discriminating power of the measure itself is more important than its Euclidean (or metric) properties. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum mechanical propagator for a particle {{moving in a}} $d$-dimensional Lorentz gas, with fixed, hard sphere scatterers. To evaluate this propagator in the semi-classical region, and for times less than the Ehrenfest time, we express its effect on an initial Gaussian wave packet in terms of quantities analogous to those {{used to describe the}} exponential separation of trajectories in the classical version of this system. This result relates the spread of the wave packet to the rate of separation of classical trajectories, characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents. We consider applications of these results, first to illustrate the behavior of the wave-packet auto-correlation functions for wave packets on periodic orbits. The auto-correlation function can be related to the fidelity, or Loschmidt echo, for the special case that the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the particle. An exact expression for the fidelity, appropriate for this perturbation, leads to an analytical result valid over very long time intervals, inversely proportional {{to the size of the}} mass perturbation. For such perturbations, we then calculate the long-time echo for semi-classical wave packets on periodic orbits. This paper also corrects an earlier calculation for a quantum echo, included in a previous version of this paper.

40|$|The notes {{start with}} an {{elementary}} introduction to a few important analytic techniques of algebraic geometry: closed positive currents, L^ 2 estimates for the -operator on positive vector bundles, Nadel's vanishing theorem for multiplier ideal sheaves (a generalization of the well-known Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem). Applications to adjoint line bundles are then discussed. T. Fujita conjectured in 1987 that K_X+(n+ 2) L is very ample for every ample line bundle L on a non singular projective variety X with X=n. The answer is known only for n< 2 (I. Reider, 1988). In the last years, various bounds have been obtained for integers m such that 2 K_X+mL is very ample (by J. Kollár, L. Ein-R. Lazarsfeld, Y. T. Siu and the author, among others). Two approaches are discussed: an analytic approach via Monge-Ampère equations and current theory, and a more algebraic one (due to Siu) via multiplier ideal sheaves and Riemann-Roch. Finally, an effective version of the big Matsusaka theorem is derived, {{in the form of}} an explicit bound for an integer m such that mL is very ample, depending only on L^n and L^n- 1 · K_X; these bounds improve Siu's results (1993), and essentially contain the optimal bounds obtained by Fernandez del Busto for the surface case.

In this report, we will consider two simpler problems, using similar methods. We consider the case when we make M beam position measurements per superperiod, and we wish to apply an equal number M of orbit correcting bumps to reduce the measured position errors to zero. We also consider the problem when the number of correcting bumps is less than the number of measurements, and we wish to minimize the weighted rms position errors.

40|$|When {{ordering}} {{very high}} resolution (VHR) imagery of IKONOS or QuickBird a cloud coverage up to 20 % within the scenes {{has to be}} accepted. This indicates the high impact of atmospheric conditions to VHR imagery. Beside clouds the images are influenced by haze oftentimes. This haze could be removed using new atmospheric correction algorithms, which were not available for VHR data so far. Furthermore, effects caused by the terrain are influencing the classification quality of VHR imagery in particular in areas of high relief energy. These effects can be eliminated using a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) within the correction process. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> atmospheric <b>correction</b> is that multi-temporal scenes become comparable, because digital numbers are substituted by surface reflectances. Thus, classification schemes developed once can easily be applied to other subsequent recorded scenes. The haze removal and atmospheric-topographic correction algorithms are implemented in the software ATCOR 3 which is available {{as an extension of}} standard remote sensing software, like ERDAS IMAGINE 8. 7 or PCI Geomatica, and as stand-alone software based on IDL as well. The software was tested and improved in cooperation between users and the developers using IKONOS data, but it is also applicable to other VHR data (QuickBird etc.). Within the paper the procedure and the results of correcting two hazy IKONOS scenes will be demonstrated and evaluated from an end-user’s point of view. On the other hand the terrain correction of this imagery using a VHR laser scanning DEM is in the focus of the investigation. * Corresponding author. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{expectations}} {{of both the}} patient and surgeon have been greatly revised in the last 10  years {{with the introduction of}} pedicle screws (PS) in spinal surgery. In this study, we have retrospectively evaluated and compared the results of PS instrumentation and the Hybrid System (HS), the latter consists of pedicle screws, sublaminar wire and hooks. The mean follow-up period was 60. 1  months (range: 49 – 94  months) for the patients of the HS group and 29. 3  months (range: 24 – 35  months) for those of the PS group. In the HS group, pedicle screws were used at the thoracolumbar junction and lumbar vertebra, the bilateral pediculotransverse claw hook configuration was used at the cranial end of the instrumentation, sublaminar wire was used on the concave side of the apical region and the compressive hook was used on the convex side. In the PS group, PS were used on the concave sides at all levels and on the convex side of the cranial and caudal end of instrumentation, in the transition zone and at the apex. The two groups were comparable for variables such as mean age, preoperative Cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis angle, lordosis angle, coronal balance, flexibility of the curve, apical vertebra rotation (AVR), apical vertebra rotation (AVT) and the number of vertebrae included in the fusion (p[*]>[*] 0. 05). The parameters of values of correction, ratio of correction loss, AV derotation, AVT correction ratio, amount of blood loss, operation time, postoperative global coronal and sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis angle and lumbar lordosis angle were measured at the last follow-up and used for comparing the HS and PS groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups <b>for</b> <b>correction</b> ratio, postoperative coronal balance, postoperative thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis angle, operation time, amount of blood loss and number of fixation points (p[*]>[*] 0. 05) The difference for the ratio of correction loss, AV derotation angle and the AVT correction ratio at the last follow-up visit and for the total follow-up period between the groups was found to be statistically significant (p[*] [*] 0. 05) between the groups in terms of correction rate, postoperative coronal and sagittal balance, operation time, blood loss and number of fixation points. This may indicate that anchor points are more important than the use – or not – of screws.

We study this problem for r points in the plane over an algebraically closed field k of arbitrary characteristic in case either r < 8 or the points lie on a (possibly reducible) conic. In either case, it follows from work of the second author that there are only finitely many configuration types of points, where our notion of configuration type is a generalization of the notion of a representable combinatorial geometry, also known as a representable simple matroid. (We say p_ 1, [...] .,p_r and p'_ 1, [...] .,p'_r have the same configuration type if for all choices of nonnegative integers m_i, Z=m_ 1 p_ 1 + [...] . +m_rp_r and Z'=m_ 1 p'_ 1 + [...] . +m_rp'_r have the same Hilbert function.) Assuming either that 7 < r< 8 (see recent work of Guardo and the second author for the cases r< 6) or that the points p_i lie on a conic, we explicitly determine all the configuration types, and show how the configuration type and the coefficients m_i determine (in an explicitly computable way) the Hilbert function (and sometimes the graded Betti numbers) of Z=m_ 1 p_ 1 + [...] . +m_rp_r. We demonstrate our results by explicitly listing all Hilbert functions for schemes of r< 8 double points, and for each Hilbert function we state precisely how the points must be arranged (in terms of the configuration type) to obtain that Hilbert function.

50|$|Error {{correction}} is {{a technology}} {{that is used by}} the ATSC tuner to make sure that any data that is missing can be corrected. For instance, sometimes interference or a poor-quality signal will cause the loss of some data that the ATSC tuner receives. With error correction, the tuner has the ability to perform a number of checks and repair data so that a signal can be viewed on a TV set. Error correction works by adding some extra information to the signal before transmission that can be used upon reception to fill in gaps. Therefore, error correction has the opposite effect of compression—it increases the amount of data to transmit, rather than reducing it like compression does, and it improves the quality and robustness of the signal rather than reducing it. Compression removes redundant (and some non-redundant) data, while error correction adds some redundant data. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> using error <b>correction</b> rather than just using less compression and keeping the redundancy that was already there is that error correction systems are specially designed to get the maximum benefit out of a very small amount of redundant data, whereas the natural redundancy of the data doesn't do this job as efficiently, so with error correction the net amount of data needed is still smaller.|$|R

Third, the incidence of many complications, in which certain risks are acceptable in adults, is unacceptable in children. The optical correction of aphakia in children has changed dramatically however, accurate optical rehabilitation and postoperative supervision in pediatric cases is more difficult than adults.
