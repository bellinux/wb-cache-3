50|$|Peter van Zante enlists in the U.S. {{military}} as a soldier. After being wounded in action, he is treated with an experimental <b>radiation</b> <b>device</b> while out at sea. A lightning strike during a freak storm destroys the device but van Zante is rejuvenated. While convalescing, van Zante discovers he can manipulate water and create semi-solid three-dimensional shapes. Becoming a professional criminal, van Zante dons a costume and adopts the alias of Water Wizard, and robs a brokerage house. He is then {{employed by the}} criminal the Enforcer and assigned to kill Ghost Rider, but fails. He salvages the Enforcer's ring from San Diego harbor, and battles and is defeated by Ghost Rider. The magician Moondark also recruits Water Wizard in Chicago to battle Ghost Rider, but Water Wizard is burned by Ghost Rider's mystical flames again; he goes into shock and is institutionalized. Ghost Rider then breaks van Zante out of prison shortly afterwards to assist a drought-stricken town. At this time van Zante travels to Saudi Arabia, where he discovers he can also affect forms of liquid other than water, including oil, and after a brief criminal venture and battling the Arabian Knight, he is returned to prison by Ghost Rider. Although Water Wizard is later employed by criminal mastermind Justin Hammer to battle Iron Man with several other villains, he panics and flees the fight, earning Hammer's enmity.|$|E
