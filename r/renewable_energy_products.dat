500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{began working}} on the project in early 2007. They found {{difficulties}} in recruiting a production company for the shooting of [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to be risky and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products.</b> Jared Leto described the whole project as [...] "one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge we have ever undertaken as a band. It has also {{been one of the}} most inspiring – a rare opportunity to reach into our imagination and push the limits of what's possible."

40|$|<b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> {{technologies}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important due to uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources worldwide, by human beings, to sustain the current lifestyle. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies development and acceptance is key to keep the current technological evolutionary pace with responsible use of natural resources. This work is based on identification and test of constraints that have been retaining the acceptance process of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies in Brazil and testing these in organizational environment. For this purpose, the researcher has based its work on behavioural theory i. e. the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975), and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1985). With these in mind, the researcher has adopted the technology acceptance model (TAM) (Davis, 1985) and integrated some extensions to it regarding environmental attitude. The environmental view was considered based on the new environmental paradigm (NEP) (Dunlap and Van Liere, 1978) and the ecologically conscious consumer behaviour model (ECCB) (Roberts, 1996). This research has adopted a mixed methodology using quantitative research and action research via learning sets, gathering data from the environment, referred to technological and environmental challenges identified by the society and using this data as information to an organization {{so that it could}} learn and develop new strategies that will help increasing sales of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies' based <b>products.</b> On the quantitative phase of this research, 132 Brazilian citizens living in the south and southeast area of Brazil, with an income not lower than 9 minimum wages, owning graduation degree, responded the quantitative questionnaire.

By looking at these constraints during the learning sets, the organization managed to develop new working strategies for increasing sales of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies' <b>products,</b> such as working with the government for funding and help on price reduction levels and increasing user's environmental knowledge of the importance and benefits that <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies' <b>products</b> can bring not only to their businesses but to society...|$|R

40|$|The {{main problem}} in the present day {{refrigeration}} system is that it runs a heavy compressor consuming large power and pollutes our environment with emission of Freon gases. These form cfc's and hcfc's and destroy the ozone and creates space for entry of harmful ultraviolet radiations. In this method an alternate way of refrigeration is tried. The method is known as thermoelectric cooling using the principle of peltier effect. An array of thermoelectric sensors can be arranged {{in a particular way}} that it removes all heat from a particular region and transfers it to the other side. The region deprived from the heat gradually builds up refrigeration. The heated region can be cooled using exhaust fans or other cooling mechanisms.

Biogas engineering has rapidly developed attributes to solve environmental problems and create a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>product</b> biogas. In this paper, two different biogas plants’ materials were analyzed by emergy method. One {{of them is a}} biogas project whose degraded material is feces (BPF system), and the other is the one whose degraded material is corn straw (BPC system). As a result, the ecological-economic values of BPF and BPC are $ 28, 300 /yr and $ 8, 100 /yr, respectively. Considering currency, environment, and human inputs, both of the biogas projects have the ability of disposing waste and potential for development. The proportion of biogas output is much more than fertilizer output; so, fertilizer utilization should be emphasized in the future. In comparison, BPF is better than BPC in the aspects of ecological-economic benefits, environmental benefits, and sustainability. The reason is the difficulty of corn straw seasonal collection and degradation. Thus it is proposed that BPC should be combined with the other raw materials...|$|R
