[...] The D51 simulator requires a reservation through a <b>reservation</b> <b>terminal</b> {{installed in the}} museum and costs 500 yen, but the other simulators are all free.|$|E

50|$|By the 1960s, {{with the}} American Airlines SABRE {{reservations}} system up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed Deltamatic for Delta Air Lines on the IBM 7074, and PANAMAC for Pan American World Airways using an IBM 7080. By 1967/8 IBM generalized its airline reservations work into the PARS system, which {{ran on the}} larger members of the IBM System/360 family and which could support the largest airlines' needs at that time (e.g. United Airlines ran about 3000 <b>reservations</b> <b>terminals</b> online in the 1972 timeframe). In the early 1970s IBM modified its PARS reservations system so it could accommodate the smaller regional airlines on smaller members of the 370 systems family. The high performance PARS operating system evolved from ACP (Airlines Control Program) to TPF (Transaction Processing Facility).|$|R

This approach is {{also referred to as}} context-aware routing.|$|R
