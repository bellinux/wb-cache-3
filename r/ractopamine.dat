5000|$|Russia and China banned <b>ractopamine</b> in pork, and Russia also in beef, deeming it {{unfit for}} human consumption. Taiwan banned <b>ractopamine</b> {{along with other}} beta-adrenergic {{agonists}} in October 2006, but in 2012, its legislature passed amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for <b>ractopamine.</b> The Department of Health ultimately established an MRL of 10 [...] for <b>ractopamine</b> in beef on 31 July 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The {{metabolic}} fate of <b>ractopamine</b> hydrochloride {{is similar in}} the target species (pigs and cattle), laboratory animals, and humans. Besides the pharmacology effect, <b>ractopamine</b> may cause intoxication effect; therefore, any consumption by humans of a meat and/or byproducts of animals that consumed <b>ractopamine</b> with feed for growth stimulation, may result in such clinical effects as tachycardia and other heart rate increases, tremor, headache, muscle spasm, or high arterial blood pressure. [...] The effect of <b>ractopamine</b> on humans is not entirely known, but consumption of products that contain <b>ractopamine</b> residues is not advisable for persons with cardiovascular diseases.|$|E
50|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define the pharmacological response of humans to <b>ractopamine.</b> A single oral dose of 40 mg of <b>ractopamine</b> hydrochloride was given to human volunteers. The drug was rapidly absorbed; the mean blood plasma half-life was around 4 hrs and it was not detected in plasma 24 hrs after dosing. Less than 5% of total <b>ractopamine</b> excreted represented the parent drug, while the urinary metabolites were monoglucuronide and monosulfate conjugates, with <b>ractopamine</b> monosulfate being the major metabolite present.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>ractopamine</b> in Russia is prohibited. On 6 June 2011, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture {{notified}} key meat import/exporters in Russia of {{a future}} prohibition of <b>ractopamine</b> in meat imported to Russia.|$|E
50|$|Most pigs in America get <b>ractopamine</b> {{to put on}} {{more muscle}} instead of fat, to put on weight more quickly, to reduce costs and to reduce {{pollutants}} in the environment because pigs on <b>ractopamine</b> do not need as much feed to reach finishing weight and do not produce as much manure. However, <b>ractopamine</b> has not been approved {{for use by the}} European Union, China, Russia and several other countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ractopamine</b> is not {{considered}} to be a carcinogen and not listed by IARC, NTP, ACGIH, or OSHA. The observation benign leiomyomas (tumors of smooth muscle) in mice and rats could be due to a general feature of beta-adrenergic activity of <b>ractopamine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The USDA {{approved}} {{of a new}} label, [...] "no <b>ractopamine</b> — a beta-agonist growth promotant" [...] to be used. Currently, the USDA label for organic means no antibiotics or growth hormones, but <b>ractopamine</b> is not covered by this label, as it is neither a growth hormone nor an antibiotic.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2015, <b>ractopamine</b> {{use as a}} feed {{additive}} is authorized in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The American Institute in Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan, claims that these [...] "and many other countries have determined that meat from animals fed <b>ractopamine</b> is safe for human consumption"; {{this is in the}} context of an ongoing trade dispute between Taiwan and the U.S. on this subject, which threatened to prevent Taiwan's entry to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. In the U.S., <b>ractopamine</b> is allowed to be used at a feed concentration of 5-20 mg/kg feed for finishing pigs and in dosages of 5-10 mg/kg feed for finishing pigs heavier than 109 kg. The maximum residue limit for <b>ractopamine</b> for meat in the USA is 50 ppb.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has stated}} that <b>ractopamine</b> use in beef [...] "is not an urgent issue." [...] After the Codex Alimentarius Commission voted to permit trace amounts of <b>ractopamine</b> in beef, Lee {{suggested}} that the government adopt the international standard and propose legislative amendments to allow the United States to export beef to Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 July 2012, the Legislative Yuan passed {{amendments}} to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for <b>ractopamine.</b> Following this development, food safety and nutrition exports from the Department of Health agreed on a maximum residual level of 10 [...] for <b>ractopamine</b> in beef on 31 July.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to <b>ractopamine,</b> {{clenbuterol}} is a growth-promoting compound {{belonging to}} the β agonist family. It {{is known to have}} the effect of enhancing weight gain and proportion of muscle to fat. However, clenbuterol is known to have a much longer half-life in blood than <b>ractopamine,</b> thus has a greater potential for bioaccumulation [...]|$|E
50|$|In October 2006, <b>ractopamine</b> {{was banned}} in Taiwan {{along with other}} beta-adrenergic agonists. In August 2007, the Department of Health {{announced}} that it was setting a limit on the level of residual <b>ractopamine</b> in meat products, effectively replacing the ban. This proved controversial, spurring protests from pig farmers in Taiwan, and the ban was retained.|$|E
50|$|Colorado State University Professor of Animal Science Temple Grandin, {{an expert}} on animal welfare, says that she has {{personally}} seen harmful effects of <b>ractopamine</b> on feedlot animals, such as cattle with stiff, sore, and lame limbs and symptoms of heat stress, and has stated that some cattle have lost feet due to extreme <b>ractopamine</b> overdoses. She also asserts that meat from ractopamine-treated animals is tougher.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ractopamine</b> is {{safe for}} {{finishing}} pigs heavier than 240 lb when administered {{in the diet}} at concentrations up to 10 ppm and fed for up to 35 days. However, the number of <b>ractopamine</b> hydrochloride-treated animals exhibiting signs of injury increased during the final drive to slaughter. Since the drug was introduced, more than 160,000 pigs taking <b>ractopamine</b> {{were reported to have}} suffered adverse effects, as of March 2011, according to a review of FDA records. The drug has triggered more adverse reports in pigs than any other animal drug on the market. Pigs suffered from hyperactivity, trembling, broken limbs, inability to walk and death, according to FDA reports released under a Freedom of Information Act request.(FDA) ...|$|E
50|$|Some show lambs {{have been}} {{illegally}} given <b>ractopamine,</b> either intentionally or due to accidental contamination of their feed.|$|E
50|$|Skeletal muscle tremor is {{the most}} common adverse effect of beta-agonists, and {{is more likely to be}} seen after oral {{administration}} than after inhalation. Tremor results from an imbalance between fast- and slow-twitch muscle groups of the extremities, and its severity varies greatly between individuals. No such effects were recorded at the NOEL determined in the toxicological studies conducted in laboratory animals given <b>ractopamine</b> or in the study in humans on cardiovascular effects of <b>ractopamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Canada, <b>ractopamine</b> is {{only allowed}} in meal or pellet feed for {{finishing}} barrows and gilts, confined finishing cattle, and finishing heavy turkeys.|$|E
50|$|Lin {{objected to}} the use of <b>ractopamine</b> in beef, and engaged in discussions and protests about the additive's use in United States beef imports to Taiwan. She {{proposed}} a related amendment grant the legislature the right to review safety levels for pesticide and drug residue in food. After the Codex Alimentarius Commission revised standards for <b>ractopamine</b> use, Lin advised against loosening Taiwanese regulations. After a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy surfaced in the United States in April, Lin proposed a ban on American beef imports in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|On 7 December 2012, the {{prohibition}} went into force, and pork and beef export to Russia required submission of compliance certificates confirming absence of <b>ractopamine</b> in exported meat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ractopamine</b> {{has been}} banned in Taiwan since 2006. In {{the summer of}} 2007, two US {{shipments}} including ractopamine-laced pork were rejected by Taiwan's health authorities, while the Taiwan government had been considering lifting the ban on such imports. This resulted in mass protests in the capital city, Taipei, by swine farmers insisting that the ban remain in place. Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou (侯勝茂) declared {{there would be no}} lifting of the ban unless related laws were amended. In August 2012, Taiwan's legislature passed amendments to the food safety act allowing <b>ractopamine</b> in beef.|$|E
5000|$|Chen {{believes}} {{that the use of}} <b>ractopamine</b> and other additives is questionable and not fully endorsed by scientific research, and that US beef imports to Taiwan found to include <b>ractopamine</b> should not be accepted. She is active in raising awareness for other food safety concerns, among them nitrate and radiation contamination. Chen has warned against cigarette consumption on public health and environmental grounds. She opposed the reclassification of scrap metal as non-hazardous material proposed in 2013, citing a health scare similar to food scandal that received widespread attention that year.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, the Central News Agency {{reported}} that {{large quantities of}} beef imported from the US were being rejected every month due to residual <b>ractopamine</b> having been detected during inspection.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Malaysian Food Act 1983 and Regulations (as of 5 January 2010), <b>ractopamine</b> {{is allowed}} in pig muscle and fat (MRL of 10 ppb), pig liver (MRL of 40 ppb) and pig kidney (MRL of 90 ppb). [...] <b>Ractopamine</b> is allowed as its {{half-life}} is lower, leading to reduced residues in the food, and the dose required to affect humans {{is much higher}} than other beta agonists. [...] On 30 December 2008, the Malaysian Veterinary Services Department quarantined 10 of the 656 pig farms in Malaysia, as the livestock were found to contain the banned chemical.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} food additive, <b>ractopamine</b> {{added to}} feed can be {{distributed}} via the blood to the muscle tissues, where {{it serves as a}} full agonist at mouse (not necessarily human) TAAR1. It is also an agonist at beta-adrenergic receptors. A cascade of events will then be initiated to increase protein synthesis, which results in increased muscle fiber size. <b>Ractopamine</b> is known to increase the rate of weight gain, improve feed efficiency, and increase carcass leanness in finishing swine. Its use in finishing swine yields about three kilograms of additional lean pork and improves feed efficiency by 10%.|$|E
50|$|In July 2007, {{officials}} of the People's Republic of China seized US-produced pork for containing <b>ractopamine</b> residues. Further shipments of ractopamine-fed pork were seized in September, though this time they were Canadian in origin.|$|E
50|$|Japan, {{which had}} {{permitted}} its feed additive use {{at least until}} 2009, and South Korea only allow import of meat with <b>ractopamine</b> residues up to the maximum residue limit (MRL), but do not permit its use in beef production.|$|E
50|$|Dose-dependent {{changes of}} {{heart rate and}} cardiac output are {{observed}} within the first hour after administration of <b>ractopamine</b> and gradually return to baseline values. The systolic blood pressure will also increase in a dose-dependent manner, while the diastolic pressure remains unchanged.|$|E
50|$|The {{status of}} United States beef imports {{has been an}} issue in Taiwan-United States relations. Controversy has {{centered}} on cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; commonly known as mad cow disease), {{and the use of}} <b>ractopamine</b> as an additive in feeds.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{farmers in}} Liu's home {{district}} raise pigs. To help them, {{he has spoken}} out against [...] "free economic pilot zones" [...] that he believe hurts Taiwan's agricultural sector. Liu has repeatedly attempted to amend environmental laws in Taiwan. His proposed changes include developing a system to track pollutant emissions, and asking the Environmental Protection Administration to specifically track air quality in high-risk areas, such as in temples in which incense is burned. Liu has specifically focused on passing legislation related to harmful particulates in the air. He has also participated in environmental protests, and have provided a platform for environmental groups to criticize industrial companies such as Formosa Petrochemical Corporation. On the subject of United States beef imports in Taiwan, Liu repeatedly stated throughout his first term in office that he is {{against the use of}} <b>ractopamine</b> in animal feed and does not wish for the government to lift the ban on <b>ractopamine</b> by executive order, but only by legislative consent. In 2012, he suggested that military personnel switch to eating pork instead of beef due to the <b>ractopamine</b> issue, a stance that was ridiculed online and which the military described as excessive.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} {{his tenure}} as head of the COA, Peng has written for the Taipei Times on the subject of agriculture. He is against the {{construction}} of housing on agricultural land, as well as the use of <b>ractopamine</b> in livestock.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012, the Taiwanese {{government}} {{announced that it}} was moving toward conditionally unbanning <b>ractopamine.</b> While the drug would be granted a maximum residual level for beef, it would remain banned for pork, and the ban on the import of internal organs of cattle would remain in place.|$|E
50|$|Mutation {{studies in}} prokaryotes and eukaryotes show that <b>ractopamine</b> is not mutagenic. However, {{the results of}} several in vitro studies, {{including}} chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, are positive. The positive genotoxic results are explained with limited evidence {{to be due to}} a secondary auto-oxidative mechanism from ractopamine-catechol-producing reactive intermediates.|$|E
50|$|Restlessness, apprehension, {{and anxiety}} were {{reported}} effects after {{the use of}} various beta-agonists, particularly after oral or parenteral treatment. In pilot clinical trials with <b>ractopamine,</b> four patients showed little evidence for central nervous system stimulation. It is unclear whether long-term treatment with these drugs results {{in the development of}} tolerance to these adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|The determinative {{procedure}} {{for the analysis}} of <b>ractopamine</b> residues in tissue can be performed, using liver or muscle as the target tissues, by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The confirmatory method include reversed-phase HPLC/electrospray ionization triple tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. The limit of quantification of the drug using this LC/MS instrument was shown to be 1 ng/g.|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the Democratic Progressive Party, won {{election}} to the Legislative Yuan in 2004 {{as a representative of}} Yunlin County. Chen frequently criticized legislative gridlock, and, in January 2007, found himself in a physical altercation with fellow legislator Chen Chao-jung. Chen Hsien-chung was often involved in budget discussions, and was also known for his opposition to the use of <b>ractopamine</b> in pork products. Chen lost to Chang Chia-chun in the legislative elections of 2008.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2006, he disputed {{a report}} by Consumer Reports in which 83% of {{chickens}} they tested were infected with campylobacter and/or salmonella bacteria, noting that the sample of 500 chickens tested was [...] "very small." [...] In February 2007, Richard Raymond ordered stepped-up inspections at some meat and poultry plants where the threat of E. coli is high or past visits found unsafe practices. On the subject of China's banning of pork containing <b>ractopamine,</b> {{he said that he}} hoped Beijing could change its stance if the Codex Alimentarius Commission, an international food safety body, could endorse tolerance levels for it.|$|E
