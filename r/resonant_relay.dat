40|$|Abstract—Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) {{present a}} variety of new {{research}} challenges. Recently a magneto-inductive (MI) waveguide technique has been proposed to over-come the very harsh propagation conditions in WUSNs. In this approach, several <b>resonant</b> <b>relay</b> circuits are deployed between the two nodes to be connected. This technique allows for an extension of the transmission range, which can be quite limited, if relays are not deployed. In this paper, channel and noise models for MI-WUSNs using MI-waveguides are developed. Results of a numeri-cal evaluation of the channel capacity under practical constraints are provided and the influence of the system parameters on the performance is discussed. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a {{wireless sensor network}} that uses inductive near-field coupling for wireless powering or communication, or for both. The severely limited range of an inductively coupled source-destination pair can be improved using <b>resonant</b> <b>relay</b> devices, which are purely passive in nature. Utilization of such magneto-inductive relays has only been studied for regular network topologies, allowing simplified assumptions on the mutual antenna couplings. In this work we present an analysis of magneto-inductive passive relaying in arbitrarily arranged networks. We find that the resulting channel has characteristics similar to multipath fading: the channel power gain is governed by a non-coherent sum of phasors, resulting in increased frequency selectivity. We propose and study two strategies to increase the channel power gain of random relay networks: i) deactivation of individual relays by open-circuit switching and ii) frequency tuning. The presented results show that both methods improve the utilization of available passive relays, leading to reliable and significant performance gains. Comment: 6 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Abstract—The {{magnetic}} induction (MI) -based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) use the novel MI waveguide technique to establish long range and low cost wireless communications in harsh underground environments, which enable a large variety of novel and important applications. One {{of the main}} research challenges is the theoretical study of the channel and network capacities in these networks. Compared to the traditional wireless networks, both the channel and network capacities of MI-based WUSNs have significant di↵erent characteristics due to the completely di↵erent signal propagation techniques and network geometric structure. Moreover, the usage of multiple <b>resonant</b> MI <b>relay</b> coils in MI-based WUSNs brings more reliability concerns. In this paper, mathematical models are developed to evaluate the channel capacity, network capacity, and the reliability of MI-based WUSNs. Specifically, the closed-form expression for the channel capacity in MI-based WUSNs is first derived to capture the e↵ects of multiple system parameters. Then the network capacity scaling laws of MI-based WUSNs are investigated under di↵erent deployment strategies. Finally, the system reliability of MI-based WUSNs {{in terms of the}} channel capacity and network capacity is discussed. The results of this paper provide principles and guidelines for the design and deployment of MI-based WUSNs. I...|$|R
