5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E

Throughout its preservation career (starting from 1974), the engine has been painted all-over black with some details picked out in white or yellow (such as handrails {{and the staff}} exchanger horn, welded in the <b>raised</b> <b>position)</b> to meet modern safety standards.|$|E
25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski on the snow. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. It was much more expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E

500|$|After the ship's {{return from}} its cruise, a conference was convened aboard Argus on 19 May to {{consider}} revised landing arrangements. It {{was decided that}} a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered palisades were also needed {{on the side of}} the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier [...] later in the year and Argus arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten Parnall Panther spotter and reconnaissance aircraft and three Fairey IIIC reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> and [...] of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.|$|E

2500|$|The hamlet {{is first}} {{recorded}} {{some time after}} 1350 and before 1540. Brothertoft hamlet is mentioned in the Diocesan Return of 1563 (Deanery of Holland, parish of Kirton,) as having ten households. William Marrat, a local historian writing in 1814, noted that the traditional belief for {{the origins of the}} village name lay in a grant being awarded to two brothers in order that they could [...] "inclose" [...] (that is, separate and cultivate) the area from the surrounding fenland. The word toft is thought to come from the Danish occupiers of Lincolnshire in ancient times and has the meaning of homestead or enclosure. Hence the place name of Brother-Toft. In an addendum Marrat wrote that the place had been a vaccaria (or vaccary - literally, a cow shed) of the abbey at Swineshead and had once been called Toft because of it relatively <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> above the fens. There are records of receipts which were probably from the area in the Swineshead entries of the Valor Ecclesiasticus. These are not definitive as another historian of the period, Pishey Thompson, pointed out that Toft was used as a name both for Brothertoft and Fishtoft in the late fourteenth century. The <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> did not exclude the area from flooding and, for example, in 1763 the villagers were forced to live in the upper stories of buildings due to the amount of water ingress.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{after the}} hammer strikes the string, the action must avoid an {{unwanted}} second blow, which could easily {{result from the}} hammer {{bouncing up and down}} within the space confining it. In Cristofori's action, this was accomplished by two means. By lifting the intermediate lever with a jack that disengages in its highest position, the Cristofori action made it possible for the hammer to fall (after its initial blow) to a position considerably lower than the highest position to which the key had lifted it. By itself, this mechanism greatly reduces the chance of an unwanted second blow. In addition, the Cristofori action also included a check (also called [...] "back check"; M) that catches the hammer and holds it in a partially <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> until the player releases the key; the check also helped to prevent unwanted second blows.|$|E
2500|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduces}} [...] "Pro Mode" [...] to the Rock Band franchise {{for both}} guitar and bass players, where players finger specific strings and frets instead of colored buttons in Easy to Medium mode, while on Expert mode players {{are required to}} play the actual guitar chords and solos, note for note. [...] Two completely new guitar controllers were developed for use in this mode - both of them legitimate MIDI guitars. The first one MadCatz created {{was based on the}} bass version of the Fender Mustang, featuring 105 buttons each representing every spot possible on the neck up to 17 frets, and a [...] "string box" [...] where the player strums strings, it was made of plastic and can be a step up from the legacy five lane controllers. [...] The second takes an authentic, actual Squier Stratocaster guitar by Fender, the complete guitar with strings and up to the standard 22 frets, added a [...] "string box" [...] near the strumming area for hit detection, and rebuilt the neck to have a fret-sensing feature in order to tell the game where the player's fingers are on the fret board. [...] There is also a [...] "mute bar" [...] built into the guitar which can be raised or lowered; in the <b>raised</b> <b>position</b> the strings of the guitar are softly muted so as to not ring out. [...] This mute bar is what allows the string box to detect and translate individual string hits for the game. [...] In the lowered position, the guitar strings wont be muted and therefore lets the strings ring out for normal guitar playing outside of the Rock Band game. [...] Tuning this specialized guitar is not necessary for playing Rock Band, as for the game the guitar functions in MIDI mode and the guitar's sound comes from sound files of the actual guitar playing in the songs painstakingly designed from audio master stems of each song for the game. [...] Both of these officially made MIDI guitars utilize Pro Mode, allowing for accurate fingering while playing with the added effect of learning how to play the song for real on guitar, either alone or with friends playing the song with you on any other instrument or controller, even online. [...] Of the two Pro guitars, only the MadCatz Mustang model - with 105 buttons - was capable of playing [...] "legacy" [...] (5-lane) guitar or bass charts. The Mustang was the first available unit, with the Squier becoming available in March 2011.|$|E

Finally, the technical difficulties of performing these measurements in individuals with inadequate acoustic windows cannot be ignored, although it was not necessary to exclude any participant for this reason. All ultrasonographic measurements were made by experienced sonographers (VZ, LB, CV).|$|R

60|$|That {{kinetic energy}} {{appears to be}} {{imparted}} by impact {{is a fact of}} daily and hourly experience: we see bodies set in motion by bodies, already in motion, which seem to come in contact with them. It is a truth which could have been learned by nothing but experience, and which cannot be explained, but must be taken as an ultimate fact about which, explicable or inexplicable, there can be no doubt. Strictly speaking, we have no direct apprehension of any other cause of motion. But experience furnishes innumerable examples of the production of kinetic energy in a body previously at rest, when no impact is discernible as the cause of that energy. In all such cases, the presence of a second body is a necessary condition; and the amount of kinetic energy, which its presence enables the first to gain, is strictly dependent on the relative positions of the two. Hence the phrase energy of position, which is frequently used as equivalent to potential energy. If a stone is picked up and held, say, six feet above the ground, it has potential energy, because, if let go, it will immediately begin to move towards the earth; and this energy may be said to be energy of position, because it depends upon the relative position of the earth and the stone. The stone is solicited to move but cannot, so long as the muscular strength of the holder prevents the solicitation from taking effect. The stone, therefore, has potential energy, which becomes kinetic if it is let go, and the amount of that kinetic energy which will be developed before it strikes the earth depends on its position--on the fact that it is, say, six feet off the earth, neither more nor less. Moreover, it can be proved that the raiser of the stone had to exert as much energy in order to place it in its position, as it will develop in falling. Hence the energy which was exerted, and apparently exhausted, in raising the stone, is potentially in the stone, in its <b>raised</b> <b>position,</b> and will manifest itself when the stone is set free. Thus the energy, withdrawn from the general stock to raise the stone, is returned when it falls, and there is no change in the total amount. Energy, as a whole, is conserved.|$|E
