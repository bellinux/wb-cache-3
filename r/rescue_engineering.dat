By stopping the search as soon as possible, we promote efficiency by freeing up sensors and operators to perform other tasks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) is an {{integrated}} multi-agency response which {{is beyond the}} capability of normal rescue arrangements, and involves the location, rescue and initial medical stabilisation of victims trapped in confined spaces following a structural collapse. New Zealand has in place a heavy rescue USAR capability that meets international standards, with specific arrangements for responding {{to a range of}} emergency events including earthquake. Engineers represent one of the key specialist skills inputs into USAR, providing a range of advice and input to the USAR Task Forces that are conducting rescue operations. Although a small group of dedicated and capable structural, civil and geotechnical engineers have become operationally involved in USAR in New Zealand over the past eight years, there is a pressing need to broaden this capability in order to provide the required level of support for the specialist rescue technicians. This paper summarises the USAR arrangements in place in New Zealand, with particular reference to post-earthquake situations. The new strategy for the development of New Zealand’s <b>rescue</b> <b>engineering</b> capability and ongoing engagement of engineers is outlined. ...|$|E

We introduce the AIMMS /LGO software implementation to analyze and solve such models. A list of illustrative applications of global optimization (including LGO applications) is provided, with further topical references. Decision-Making and Optimization In today’s competitive global economy, government organizations and private businesses all aim for efficient operations that deliver high quality products and services. This demands prudent, effective and timely decisions in an increasingly complex and dynamically changing environment. To illustrate this point, one can think of decisions related to agricultural planning, biotechnology, data analysis, distribution of goods and resources, emergency and <b>rescue</b> operations, <b>engineering</b> systems design, environmental management, financial planning, food processing, health care management, inventory control, manpower and resource allocation, manufacturing of goods, military operations, production process control, risk management, sequencing and scheduling of operations, telecommunications, traffic control, and many other areas.

SecMe increase the level of security but cause interferences and restrictions for customers (e. g. privacy). This study identifies the interferences and analyzes the acceptance with an empirical survey of customers. A composite indicator for the acceptance of different SecMe is developed and integrated into a risk management framework for multi-criteria decision analysis achieving the right balance of risk reduction, costs, and social acceptance.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, implementation, and validation {{of a system}} that enables a micro air vehicle to autonomously explore and map unstructured and unknown indoor environments. Such a vehicle would be of considerable use in many real-world applications such as search and <b>rescue,</b> civil <b>engineering</b> inspection, and a host of military tasks where it is dangerous or difficult to send people. While mapping and exploration capabilities are common for ground vehicles today, air vehicles seeking to achieve these capabilities face unique challenges. While there has been recent progress toward sensing, control, and navigation suites for GPS-denied flight, there have been few demonstrations of stable, goal-directed flight in real environments. The main focus of this research is the development of real-time state estimation techniques that allow our quadrotor helicopter to fly autonomously in indoor, GPS-denied environments. Accomplishing this feat required the development of a large integrated system that brought together many components into a cohesive package. As such, the primary contribution is the development of the complete working system. I show experimental results that illustrate the MAV's ability to navigate accurately in unknown environments, and demonstrate that our algorithms enable the MAV to operate autonomously in a variety of indoor environments. by Abraham Galton Bachrach.

This proves the forcible entry tools {{play a significant role in}} fire fighting and rescue. Therefore, the fire brigade and rescue departments should equip with efficient forcible entry tools for rescue as soon as possible. Status of the domestic forcible entry equipments Forcible entry is one of the primary means of rescue in fires, traffic accidents as well as building collapses and other disaster scenes. It often must be achieved by means of forcible entry to rescue the trapped people. At present, forcible entry equipments of domestic and abroad can be divided into manual, electric, pneumatic, hydraulic, chemical and other types. Manual rescue tools can be implemented relatively simpler rescue operation, meanwhile, maneuver, hydraulic and pneumati...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{promotes a}} focus shift from automation extending human capabilities to automation partnering with the human. Highly automated systems {{tend to be}} incompatible with humans, leading to degradations in performance {{that may lead to}} serious problems in high-risk professional domains, such as the Navy and Urban Search and Rescue. This dissertation shows how an electronic partner (ePartner) can act as task allocator and coordination facilitator to substantially improve the human-automation teamwork in these high-risk professional domains. Adaptive automation concerns the dynamic allocation of tasks between the human and the automation, based on ePartner’s proposal or decision. The effects of adaptive automation using the object-oriented task model and the hybrid triggering mechanism have been investigated with Navy officers. The results revealed a large performance improvement, especially in the more complex condition. This latter finding makes adaptive automation a likely candidate to incorporate in future combat management systems as military scenarios are expected to become complex (asymmetrical) while manning reduction initiatives stress the military system. Observability displays are proposed to supports the coordination process while working in a distributed setting. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated that observability displays improve backing-up behavior, performance, and resilience while coordinating activities compared with conventional communication technologies. These results clearly show the power of observability displays as a mean to support the team process between human actors and have the potential to support Urban Search & <b>Rescue</b> missions.
