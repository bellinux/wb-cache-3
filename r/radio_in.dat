5|$|The Broadcasting Act 1990 led to {{the brief}} decline of UK pirate radio by {{encouraging}} diversity in radio and opening up the development of commercial radio. Many pirate radio stations such as the London-based dance music station Kiss FM applied for licenses to the new Radio Authority and went legitimate. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasts has since increased, partly because many non-licensed broadcasters believed that the 1990 Act had actually undermined community-based stations and small scale radio entrepreneurs. Of the pirate radio stations that gained a license in the 1990s, such as Kiss FM, FTP in Bristol, WNK <b>Radio</b> <b>in</b> Haringey and KFM <b>Radio</b> <b>in</b> Stockport, only a few, such as Sunrise <b>Radio</b> <b>in</b> London, remained {{in the hands of}} the original owners. Most have become significantly more mainstream and target a broad audience as a result of commercial pressures to achieve greater audience numbers and a particular audience type sought by advertisers.|$|E

Although Brother Justin shares traits with Father Coughlin, an Irish Catholic priest who broadcast his sermons over the <b>radio</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, the writers never tried to retell that particular story.|$|E
