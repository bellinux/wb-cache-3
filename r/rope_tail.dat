On all sailing ships built before about the 19th century, the stays were of natural cords. These lines were looped {{around the top of}} each section of the wooden masts using a spliced loop or seized loop in their ends. During the 16th century some riggers began to attach stays by splicing or seizing only a small loop into the end of the stay then passing the <b>rope's</b> <b>tail</b> around the mast and back through the small loop, like a slip-knot. To prevent this from slipping tightly around the mast when in use, a strong bulge was built into the standing part of the rope that could not fit through the small loop. This bulge was called a mouse or stay mouse.|$|R
50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the <b>tail</b> <b>ropes</b> and so on. Because drum hoists do not have <b>tail</b> <b>ropes,</b> the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare anaesthetic recoveries without assistance (group NA) to a head and tail rope-assisted technique (group A) after emergency abdominal surgery in horses. Additionally, possible risk factors for the quality of recovery (S: safe, NS: non-safe) were investigated and possible complications associated to the head and <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> technique recorded. For that purpose 200 anaesthetic protocols (100 NA, 100 A) from horses that all received a standardised medetomidine-isoflurane balanced anaesthesia regime and medetomidine in combination with morphine for recovery were analysed retrospectively. No significant difference regarding recovery score was detected between NA and A horses. Fatalitalities (3 / 100 in each group) were similarly distributed between groups. However, in group NA only one horse died because of trauma during recovery. The other two horses died before attempting to stand up. All 3 horses that died in group A were euthanized because of trauma. Hypoxemia (defined as arterial oxygen partial pressure < 60 mmHg) during anaesthesia was a risk factor for non-safe recoveries. No influence was detected for age, weight, duration of general anaesthesia, reason of colic surgery, recovery technique (A, NA), hypotension during anaesthesia, time in lateral recumbency, time in sternal recumbency and time until standing. Several technical complications (material fail, twisting of ropes, halters slipping off and loss of ropes) were observed using the head and <b>tail</b> <b>ropes,</b> probably being partially responsible for the unexpectedly high number of dangerous and fatal recoveries observed in group A. The present study could not demonstrate that the head and <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> technique can reduce fatalities or improve anaesthetic recovery scores after emergency abdominal surgery in horses.

50|$|The Prusik is tied by {{wrapping}} the prusik loop (see Double fisherman's knot) around the rope {{a number of}} times, usually 3-5 times depending on the materials, and then back through itself, forming a barrel around the <b>rope</b> with a <b>tail</b> hanging out the middle. When the tail is weighted, the turns tighten and make {{a bend in the}} rope. When weight is removed, the loop can be moved along the rope by placing a hand directly on the barrel and pushing. Breaking the Prusik free from the rope after it has been weighted can be difficult, however, and is easiest done by pushing the bow, the loop of cord which runs from the top wrap over the knot to the bottom wrap, along the tail a little. This unwinds the wrap to loosen the grip of the hitch, and makes movement easier.|$|R

The other engine was at Percy Main, hauling the empty wagons from the staiths. From Prospect Hill to Percy Main and from Percy Main to the staiths the loaded wagons ran by gravity, unwinding as they descended a <b>tail</b> <b>rope</b> from the drum of the engine, to bring hack the empty wagons. The remainder of the line from Seghill to Holywell was worked by locomotives; those used at first were the Samson and the John, both built by Timothy Hackworth.|$|R
5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize <b>tail</b> <b>ropes</b> and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|R

For many years, the sculpture was located close to downtown {{at the corner of}} Chester Avenue and E. 66th Street on a site provided by Roy Kuhn and the Kinco-Balin Corporation. The sculpture stands over forty feet tall and is enclosed with a wrought iron fence forty feet by fifty feet.The sculpture is composed of twenty tons of steel (plate, channels and I-beams), two tons of polypropylene <b>rope</b> (the <b>tail),</b> fiber glass (the bowties), a ton of cedar (the handle), assorted bearings (for the wheels and mouth mechanism,) television sets (the eyes,) industrial epoxy paints and the various electrical components which power the piece. The sculpture is set on four concrete foundations and surrounded by a wrought iron fence five feet tall. The top of the fence is lined with double entrendres of political cliches. The Mayor of Cleveland, Michael R. White, opposed the erection of the sculpture for purely aesthetic reasons ("I 've seen it and I don't like it...." [...] The Plain Dealer, Feb. 19, 1994.) This opposition created difficulty in obtaining the required building permits from the City's Building Department. Ultimately the threat of a Federal lawsuit persuaded City officials to process Lawless' building permits. The sculpture stood on private land for the last thirteen years and was privately funded. Currently, the work resides near the Monte Ahuja College of Business at Cleveland State University, 18th Street and Chester Avenue in downtown Cleveland, Ohio.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} keep pace with the modern oil {{transport}} trends, the Indian ports are also developing terminal facilities for Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC). A conceptual design methodology for marine oil terminal (MOT) including mooring system for large oil tankers has been evolved. The orientation of the MOT and mooring arrangements for 200000 DWT oil tanker were determined considering the environmental conditions prevailed at the site. Water flow velocity played an important role in the orientation of the MOT. Quick Fender Selection Method (QFSM) has been considered for the selection of fender system and it was found that supercone fenders of 2 m height or equivalent type of fenders were suitable for the oil tanker. The mooring arrangements comprising of steel <b>ropes</b> with nylon <b>tails,</b> sustained the effect of high winds of 60 knots associated with currents and waves. Finally, simulation of moored ship motions for moderate environmental conditions i. e., wind speed of 30 knots, current speed of 4 knots and 1 m wave height was carried out using quasi-static approach. The ship motions in six degrees of freedom were found within the permissible limit for safe cargo handling operation.

40|$|Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) {{have been}} {{identified}} as Arctic ecosystem sentinels because they are broadly dispersed, high trophic feeders and are likely to be negatively impacted by climate change. They are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound to enact key biological activities such as forage for prey, communicate with conspecifics and navigate. Therefore, understanding how noise might affect their sensory ecology is a priority to encourage their survival and address the broader potential acoustic impacts within the Arctic. Ocean noise levels are increasing in the Arctic due to an increase in human activities, which are related to the interests in Arctic resources and the opening of the Northwest Passage. This is of concern because several beluga populations are endangered and considered strategic stocks. Their hearing sensitivities are unknown.

40|$|Filamentary {{structures}} are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, yet their formation, internal structure, and longevity {{have not been}} studied in detail. We report the results from a comprehensive numerical study that investigates the characteristics, formation, and evolution of filaments arising from magnetohydrodynamic interactions between supersonic winds and dense clouds. Here we improve on previous simulations by utilising sharper density contrasts and higher numerical resolutions. By following multiple density tracers, we find that material in the envelopes of the clouds is removed and deposited downstream to form filamentary tails, while the cores of the clouds serve as footpoints and late-stage outer layers of these tails. Aspect ratios > 12, subsonic velocity dispersions ~ 0. 1 - 0. 3 of the wind sound speed, and magnetic field amplifications ~ 100 {{are found to be}} characteristic of these filaments. We also report the effects of different magnetic field strengths and orientations. The magnetic field strength regulates vorticity production: sinuous filamentary towers arise in non-magnetic environments, while strong magnetic fields inhibit small-scale perturbations at boundary layers making tails less turbulent. Magnetic field components aligned with the direction of the flow favour the formation of pressure-confined flux <b>ropes</b> inside the <b>tails,</b> whilst transverse components tend to form current sheets. Softening the equation of state to nearly isothermal leads to suppression of dynamical instabilities and further collimation of the tail. Towards the final stages of the evolution, we find that small cloudlets and distorted filaments survive the break-up of the clouds and become entrained in the winds, reaching velocities ~ 0. 1 of the wind speed.

40|$|On August 22, 2001 all 4 Cluster {{spacecraft}} nearly simultaneously penetrated {{a magnetic}} flux <b>rope</b> in the <b>tail.</b> The flux <b>rope</b> encounter {{took place in}} the central plasma sheet, Beta(sub i) approx. 1 - 2, near the leading edge of a bursty bulk flow. The "time-of-flight" of the flux rope across the 4 spacecraft yielded V(sub x) approx. 700 km/s and a diameter of approx. 1 R(sub e). The speed at which the flux rope moved over the spacecraft is in close agreement with the Cluster plasma measurements. The magnetic field profiles measured at each spacecraft were first modeled separately using the Lepping-Burlaga force-free flux rope model. The results indicated that the center of the flux rope passed northward (above) s/c 3, but southward (below) of s/c 1, 2 and 4. The peak electric currents along the central axis of the flux rope predicted by these single-s/c models were approx. 15 - 19 nA/sq m. The 4 -spacecraft Cluster magnetic field measurements provide a second means to determine the electric current density without any assumption regarding flux rope structure. The current profile determined using the curlometer technique was qualitatively similar to those determined by modeling the individual spacecraft magnetic field observations and yielded a peak current density of 17 nA/m 2 near the central axis of the rope. However, the curlometer results also showed that the flux rope was not force-free with the component of the current density perpendicular to the magnetic field exceeding the parallel component over the forward half of the rope, perhaps due to the pressure gradients generated by the collision of the BBF with the inner magnetosphere. Hence, while the single-spacecraft models are very successful in fitting flux rope magnetic field and current variations, they do not provide a stringent test of the force-free condition...|$|R
60|$|In {{the summer}} and fall sometimes, {{hundreds}} of blackfish (the Social Whale, Globicephalus Melas of De Kay; called also Black Whale-fish, Howling Whale, Bottlehead, etc.), fifteen feet or more in length, are driven ashore in a single school here. I witnessed such a scene in July, 1855. A carpenter who was working at the lighthouse arriving early in the morning remarked {{that he did not know}} but he had lost fifty dollars by coming to his work; for as he came along the Bay side he heard them driving a school of blackfish ashore, and he had debated with himself whether he should not go and join them and take his share, but had concluded to come to his work. After breakfast I came over to this place, about two miles distant, and near the beach met some of the fishermen returning from their chase. Looking up and down the shore, I could see about a mile south some large black masses on the sand, which I knew must be blackfish, and a man or two about them. As I walked along towards them I soon came to a huge carcass whose head was gone and whose blubber had been stripped off some weeks before; the tide was just beginning to move it, and the stench compelled me to go a long way round. When I came to Great Hollow I found a fisherman and some boys on the watch, and counted about thirty blackfish, just killed, with many lance wounds, and the water was more or less bloody around. They were partly on shore and partly in the water, held by a <b>rope</b> round their <b>tails</b> till the tide should leave them. A boat had been somewhat stove by the tail of one. They were a smooth shining black, like India-rubber, and had remarkably simple and lumpish forms for animated creatures, with a blunt round snout or head, whale-like, and simple stiff-looking flippers. The largest were about fifteen feet long, but one or two were only five feet long, and still without teeth. The fisherman slashed one with his jackknife, to show me how thick the blubber was,--about three inches; and as I passed my finger through the cut it was covered thick with oil. The blubber looked like pork, and this man said that when they were trying it the boys would sometimes come round with a piece of bread in one hand, and take a piece of blubber in the other to eat with it, preferring it to pork scraps. He also cut into the flesh beneath, which was firm and red like beef, and he said that for his part he preferred it when fresh to beef. It is stated that in 1812 blackfish were used as food by the poor of Bretagne. They were waiting for the tide to leave these fishes high and dry, that they might strip off the blubber and carry it to their try-works in their boats, where they try it on the beach. They get commonly a barrel of oil, worth fifteen or twenty dollars, to a fish. There were many lances and harpoons in the boats,--much slenderer instruments than I had expected. An old man came along the beach with a horse and wagon distributing the dinners of the fishermen, which their wives had put up in little pails and jugs, and which he had collected in the Pond Village, and for this service, I suppose, he received a share of the oil. If one could not tell his own pail, he took the first he came to.|$|R
