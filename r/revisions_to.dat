Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the tariff question.|$|E

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the work had been dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's <b>revisions</b> <b>to</b> the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
