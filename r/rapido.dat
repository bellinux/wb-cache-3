5|$|To divert German {{troops from}} the Anzio {{landings}} (Operation Shingle), the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and Frosinone before 22 January, D-Day for the operation. To provide a reserve for the army group, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area. The division {{became part of the}} ad hoc New Zealand Corps after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the Volturno River around the village of Raviscanina. Arriving on 22 January, it moved forward to an assembly area at Stazione di Toro on 6 February. The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line. Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the Gari river, opposite Sant'Angelo. On 15 February, the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station. There was only enough space for a two-company advance, so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine-gunned and mortared the area to their front to create the impression of a larger attack. The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke. The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the <b>Rapido</b> in the late afternoon. Div Cav moved out of the line to Monte Trocchio on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment from the British 78th Division. On 15 March, the Monte Cassino assault resumed, and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari-Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke. The regiment pulled out of the line on 20 March, taking up the new left flank of New Zealand Division along the Gari River and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion.|$|E

25|$|Yearly {{passenger}} {{levels on}} Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during World War II. Following the war {{the growth of}} air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of mode share for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s {{it was obvious to}} both Canadian National Railway (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. The CP sought to divest itself of its trains but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing the CP to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80% of losses. CN, being a Crown corporation at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as Red, White, and Blue fares, new equipment such as scenic dome cars and rail diesel cars, and services such as <b>Rapido</b> and the UAC TurboTrain trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.|$|E

25|$|The 4th Division, {{suffering}} {{heavy losses}} in Tunisia, was rested for the Sicilian campaign but in late August Hawkesworth {{took over as}} GOC of the 46th Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation that had seen service in Tunisia alongside his 4th Division, after the division's former GOC, Major General Harold Freeman-Attwood was relieved and arrested for a security violation. The 46th Division {{took part in the}} Allied invasion of Italy on 9 September as part of the British X Corps, under Lieutenant General Richard McCreery, then serving under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's US Fifth Army and, repelling numerous fierce counterattacks, suffered very heavy casualties (including Hawkesworth's senior brigade commander, Brigadier M. A. James of the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade). After the capture of Naples in early October the division crossed the Volturno Line, with X Corps forming the left flank of the Fifth Army's advance to the Winter Line (also known as the Gustav Line). During the First Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944 the division made an assault crossing of the Garigliano river. Lack of assault boats and heavy German resistance condemned it to failure, with heavy losses, mainly to the 128th (Hampshire) Brigade. The 46th Division's failure was to have serious repercussions for the US 36th (Texas) Division, {{to the right of the}} 46th, when it attempted to cross the <b>Rapido</b> River a few days later. After holding the line for the next few weeks, in March the division was relieved by Hawkesworth's old command, the 4th Division (now commanded by Major General Dudley Ward), and withdrawn to Egypt and Palestine to rest and refit, having sustained more than 5,000 casualties since landing at Salerno some six months prior.|$|E

500|$|The first {{prototype}} development began in 1925. [...] Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory (Fábrica de Artillería Trubia), in Asturias, the tank was {{powered by a}} four-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 40/50 engine, the same engine the Spanish Army's military trucks had been equipped with since 1915. Given the Spanish Army's opinion that the FT was limited in firepower, the Trubia tank featured a special turret. The turret was designed in two articulated halves, which could traverse independently, each armed with a machine gun. Theoretically, {{if one of the}} machine guns jammed, the tank would still have another one to defend itself with. Furthermore, the vehicle's hull was provided with firing ports, to allow the crew to fire from within the tank. [...] This prototype was put through a series of tests, and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank, leading to an improved Trubia tank design, known as the Modelo Trubia 75HP, tipo <b>rápido,</b> serie A (Model Trubia 75hp, fast tank, series A).|$|E

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a qualidade da bebida de café obtida de frutos cereja submetidos a diferentes práticas de manejo pós-colheita, considerando-se infecções iniciadas na planta e persistentes durante o tempo de exposição às fontes infectantes. Admitiu-se que os grãos de cereja recolhidos na planta têm máximo potencial de qualidade da bebida, avaliada por meio de testes <b>rápidos</b> e análise sensorial. Foram adotados oito tratamentos, formados pela combinação de quatro manejos pós-colheita e frutos de café com e sem desinfecção por cloreto de benzalcônio. A qualidade da bebida de grãos de frutos cereja não foi prejudicada pelo manejo pós-colheita, mesmo sob exposição às infecções por até 12 horas após a derriça. Os testes <b>rápidos</b> não se correlacionaram com a análise sensorial da bebida, e o teste da condutividade elétrica foi mais sensível que o da lixiviação de potássio. Ambos indicaram alterações nos grãos de frutos expostos às infecções após seis horas da colheita. A desinfecção {{superficial}} dos frutos foi eficiente até a primeira hora após a imersão, diminuindo o número de frutos infectados por Cladosporium sp., Penicillum sp. e Alternaria sp. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate {{the quality of the}} coffee drink from fruits with different post-harvest management practices, considering the initial plant disease infection and during the coffee fruit exposition period. The following basic assumptions were defined: the harvested grain from the plant has higher coffee fruit drink potential quality, and the quality can be evaluated using fast tests and sensorial analysis. Eight treatments were established based on the post-harvest management with and without benzalcone chloride disinfection. The coffee fruit drink quality was not affected by the post-harvest management, including the treatment with 12 hours grain exposition after harvest. The fast tests were not correlated with the coffee drink sensorial analysis. The electric conductivity test was more sensitive than the potassium lixiviation test, and the grain modification occurred after six hours of fruit exposition.
