Thus the aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using glassy wastes as friction material in automotive brakes and, moreover, to assess whether this revalorization technique of <b>ultimate</b> <b>wastes</b> is both economical viable and environmentally friendly. Specific mechanical properties (friction, wear rate etc) were measured and appeared to be better than those of conventional commercial brake pads. To assess the environmental impact of these composite materials, risk assessment studies were conducted to evaluate the remobilization of hazardous species such as heavy metals that are concentrated in the wastes. Leaching tests were conducted to simulate the effects of weathering. The alteration solutions were analyzed by ICP-MS to evaluate the dissolution rate of the wastes matrix and the amount of heavy metals released.

The processing of the used fuel is governed by high standards of criticality-safety, and strong expectations on the quality of end-products. From the received used fuel assemblies, the plutonium and the uranium are extracted for further energy production purposes within the years following the reprocessing. Furthermore, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>waste</b> – fission products and minor actinides on the one hand, and hulls and end-pieces on the other hand – is adequately packaged for long term disposal.

Given the variety of the handled nuclear materials, as well as the time scales at stake, the importance given to some radionuclides, and hence to the associated nuclear data, can also be specific to the AREVA NC La Hague plant.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{biological}} upgrading of recycled paper sludge (RPS) was developed {{based on the}} enzymatic hydrolysis of major sludge components (cellulose and xylan) with commercial enzymes and fermentation of the resulting sugars into ethanol or lactic acid with adequate microbial strains. The process was implemented performing both steps sequentially (SHF) or simultaneously (SSF). Cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of RPS were completely converted by enzymatic hydrolysis (using Celluclast® 1. 5 L with Novozym® 188) into the constitutive glucose and xylose. Ethanol was produced from the RPS hydrolysate by the yeast Pichia stipitis CBS 5773. A slightly higher conversion yield was attained on SHF process, corresponding to an ethanol concentration of 19. 6 g L- 1, but 179 hours were needed. The SSF process was completed after 48 hours of incubation allowing the production of 18. 6 g L- 1 of ethanol from 178. 6 g L- 1 of dried RPS, corresponding to an overall conversion yield of 51 % of the available carbohydrates on the initial substrate.

40|$|Abstract“Nuclear {{energy is}} part of a {{sustainable}} energy future” is a conclusion which is increasingly reached by a variety of energy scenario studies by world-renown institutions such as the IAEA, OECD/IEA & OECD/NEA, World Energy Council, and also reached by different national energy assessment reports. Nuclear does own various unique features that make this energy technology a prime candidate to fulfil a large part of our energy needs, beyond today;s use of nuclear energy for our electricity needs. The previous ‘wave’ of nuclear energy deployment since the 1970 s was, and still is, governed by the use of 235 U as main driver to spur this deployment of nuclear energy with gradually the introduction of the U/Pu - cycle in the thermal neutron spectrum reactor park (essentially LWR-technology). Technological progress and good economics of the U/Pu-cycle and especially the economic competitiveness of the LWR's have made this U/Pu -cycle essentially the standard worldwide. Fast spectrum reactors (FRs) haven’t yet been developed at sufficient large and industrial scale to make full benefit of the U/Pu-cycle and there are no prospects that the world would massively turn to such FRs in the immediate future. On the verge of a second wave of nuclear deployment, increasing interest is and has to be given to synergies between various nuclear reactor technologies and especially the global nuclear fuel cycle as enabler towards sustainable nuclear energy deployment. Those synergies aim at a reduced reliance on natural uranium resources, continued good economic competitiveness of nuclear energy in local markets, safe and non-proliferant use of nuclear energy, and a reduction of <b>ultimate</b> <b>wastes</b> to be disposed of. This paper provides an overview of various avenues towards sustainable nuclear energy deployment and perspectives from the nuclear industry leader AREVA...|$|R
40|$|The minor {{actinides}} (Pu, Np, Am), which {{occur as}} decay products in nuclear reactors, {{are the most}} important nuclides determining the long-time risk of final disposal. Therefore after separation from the fission products the minor actinides must be finally disposed of in a safe matrix or they must be further processed as fuel. In this work, it was investigated whether these actinides can be finally disposed of as a stable component in ThO_ 2 -based ceramic. In the experimental work Ce was used as a simulator for these actinides. The source material of (Th_xCe_ 1 _-_x) O_y was made of Th and Ce nitrates by treatment with ammonia gas (co-precipitation). Compacts were produced from this powder after processing (drying, milling, calcination etc.) by a uniaxial hydraulic press under special conditions such as a pressure of 20 - 80 kN (175 - 900 MPa). According to a sintering program, the compacts were sintered in a furnace at 1500 - 1600 C. BET, DTA-TG, SEM-EDX, XRD and chemical analyses were carried out to characterise the source materials and the ceramic products. The density of the compacts was determined geometrically and that of the final products by Archimedes' method. According to the experimental results, the ceramic products (<b>ultimate</b> <b>waste</b> disposal materials) can be produced with a relative density of 80 - 95 % of the theoretical density depending on the preparation conditions of the source material.

40|$|Nuclear {{power has}} {{demonstrated}} {{over the last}} 30 years its capacity to produce base-load electricity at a low, predictable and stable cost due to the very low economic dependence {{on the price of}} uranium. However the management of used nuclear fuel remains the “Achilles’ Heel” of this energy source since the storage of used nuclear fuel is increasing as evidenced by the following number with 2, 000 tons of UNF produced each year by the 104 US nuclear reactor units which equates to a total of 62, 000 spent fuel assemblies stored in dry cask and 88, 000 stored in pools. Two options adopted by several countries will be presented. The first one adopted by Europe, Japan and Russia consists of recycling the used nuclear fuel after irradiation in a nuclear reactor. Ninety six percent of uranium and plutonium contained in the spent fuel could be reused to produce electricity and are worth recycling. The separation of uranium and plutonium from the wastes is realized through the industrial PUREX process {{so that they can be}} recycled for re-use in a nuclear reactor as a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. The second option undertaken by Finland, Sweden and the United States implies the direct disposal of used nuclear fuel into a geologic formation. One has to remind that only 30 % of the worldwide used nuclear fuel are currently recycled, the larger part being stored (90 % in pool) waiting for scientific or political decisions. A third option is emerging with a closed fuel cycle which will improve the global sustainability of nuclear energy. This option will not only decrease the volume amount of nuclear waste but also the long-term radiotoxicity of the final waste, as well as improving the long-term safety and the heat-loading of the final repository.

However, considering the extensive time scale, scenarios of barrier failures and ground water intrusion are a necessary part of the safety assessment.

In this work, a method has been developed for the study of homogeneous α-radiolysis under final repository conditions, with the intention to determine the effect of dissolved bromide on the radiolytic yield of oxygen.

40|$|A {{system to}} turn a {{potentially}} harmful stream of solid waste into a set of substreams with either commercial value or highly concentrated residual streams is presented. The waste which is considered is metal impregnated (in particular Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) treated) wood waste and timber, such as telephone poles, railway sleepers, timber from landscape and cooling towers, wooden silos, hop-poles, cable drums and wooden playground equipment. These waste streams sum up to several 100, 000 tons of material per year currently to be dumped in every major country of the European Community (EC). Technologies {{need to be developed}} to reduce this CCA treated wood waste, such that all of the metals are contained in a marketable product stream, and the pyrolysis gases and/or pyrolysis liquid are used to their maximum potential with respect to energy recuperation. Pyrolysing the CCA treated wood waste may be a good solution to the growing disposal problem since low temperatures and no oxidising agents are used, which result in lower loss of metals compared to combustion. An experimental labscale pyrolysis system has been developed to study the influence of the pyrolysis temperature and the duration of the pyrolysis process on the release of metals and the mass reduction. The macrodistribution and microdistribution of the metals in the solid pyrolysis residue is studied using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDXA). Furthermore, a complete mass balance is calculated over the pyrolysis system. Based on these results a semi-industrial pyrolysis system (pilot plant scale) has been developed consisting of three stages: grinding, packed bed pyrolysis and metal separation. Special types of equipment have been developed to carry out the three stages. A new grinding system has been developed, based on a crushing mechanism rather than a cutting mechanism. The crushed wood is introduced by means of a screw feeding system into a reaction column. In this pyrolysis reactor the wood is heated by subjecting it to a flow of hot gases. This causes an adiabatic pyrolysis, which results in volatilisation of the volatile compounds whereas the mineral compounds (containing the metals) remain entrapped in a coal-type residue which is very rich in carbon. The condensable compounds in the pyrolysis gas condense while leaving the reaction zone due to the inverse temperature gradient. The pyrolysis gas leaving the reactor is used as fuel for the hot gas generator. The charcoal which is extracted {{at the bottom of the}} reactor, is cooled, compressed, removed and stored, ready to feed the subsequent stage. A specially developed grinder is used to remove the metal particles from the charcoal and the separation between metal and charcoal particles is accomplished in a pneumatic centrifuge as a result of the difference in density.

The survey by means of ultrasonic wave analysis is particularly appropriate for these purposes since it provides information on the zone left undisturbed by the boreholes. The main objective behind this paper is to describe a recent in situ experiment (called EZ-A) conducted in Opalinus clay at the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory in Switzerland (Bossart et al., 2002). This in situ experimental campaign successfully studied the possibility of improving the properties of rocks forming the EDZ (Excavation Damaged Zone). The experiments consisted of three stages: the first entailed locating the EDZ from the existence of gallery EZ-A at the Mont Terri laboratory; the second traced evolution of the EDZ arising from a 20 -cm thick and 150 -cm deep slot excavation at the EZ-A gallery floor; and the third stage focused on P-wave velocity evolution surrounding the slot during a pressure loading performed at the slot walls, which serves to characterize EDZ evolution in the slot. These three stages were carried out by applying the seismic technique of tomography and then recording wave propagations during the excavation and reloading stages. The velocity before and after slot excavation reloading, along with the survey during slot excavation, showed a decrease in P-wave velocity underneath the slot floor down to a 0. 2 m depth. Reloading clearly improves P-wave propagation along the sidewall and slightly decreases these same characteristics under the slot...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{solid wastes}} (MSW) with {{elevated}} concentrations of radioactive cesium (rad-Cs hereafter) have been generated {{in some areas}} of Japan {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (F 1 hereafter) accident. Both recycling and final disposal of the contaminated MSW have become a difficult problem in the affected areas, resulting in accumulation of treated residues in the treatment facilities. The rad-Cs in MSW, especially fly ash, often showed a high leaching rate. Extraction of contaminated MSW with water or hot oxalic acid followed by selective removal of rad-Cs from the extract using ferrocyanide (Fer hereafter) coprecipitation technique could be an <b>ultimate</b> solution for <b>waste</b> volume reduction. The MSW extracts contain various metal components as well as chelating reagents like oxalic acid, and are often very saline. The composition of the extract varies widely depending on waste sources, applied treatment techniques, and rad-Cs extraction method etc. The applicability of the Fer coprecipitation technique had to be tested and validated before it could be applied for actual treatment. In this work, we applied the Fer technique and observed removal of cesium (Cs) from water and oxalic acid extracts (all spiked with rad-Cs tracer or stable Cs) of various MSW samples collected from uncontaminated areas. Finally, the Fer technique was applied on site for removal of rad-Cs in the extracts of contaminated MSW. By modifying coprecipitation conditions according to solution matrix, Cs removal rates of higher than 95 % could be obtained...|$|R
