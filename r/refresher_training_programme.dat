40|$|BHUTAN "It is {{recommended}} that the training of retailers {{become a part of}} the overall human resource development of Bhutan and that the Research and Extension Division of the Department of Agriculture maintain the lead role in this, while also paying attention to plant nutrition management and the traditional nutrient recycling methods. This division should receive adequate assistance from the various commodity boards and rural financial institutions. "INDONESIA "It {{is recommended}} that the allocation of national funds (US$ 25 000 to 40 000 a year) continues to be available for a number of years for the retailer training activities of the Directorate General of Domestic Trade, Ministry of Trade and continues to be given directly to their offices in the provinces. The overall guidance should remain with the Directorate for Supply and Distribution of Agriculture within this Directorate General, while interdepartmental collaboration with related agencies from agriculture, cooperatives, industry and finance should be maintained. Most retailers have already attended these training courses, but about ten courses with forty participants each should still be conducted annually. ""It is recommended once the remaining retailers have been trained to give refresher courses for the upgrading of the skills and knowledge of key trainers and organizers. "It is recommended to upgrade the handbooks and reproduce them in a sufficient number of copies to cater for existing retailers". NEPAL "It is recommended to pay close attention to the development of privatisation in the fertilizer sector and to adjust the retailer training programme. The Agricultural Inputs Corporation has now ample experience and capability for the training of retailers and should maintain this. Closer links with the agricultural research and extension sector should be maintained in order to keep the training programme up to date. To sustain the retailers training programme it is recommended to allocate national funds (US$ 25 000 per year) which is a small fraction of the funds used for fertilizer imports, for the improvement of fertilizer use efficiency through retailers training. "SRI LANKA "It is recommended to give a certain policy priority to continue with the retailers training programme as the skill, management and infrastructure are available. The training efforts should be coordinated by a relevant government department guaranteeing the quality of the technical messages while due to the privatisation process of the fertilizer sector private companies could carry out their own training programmes. It is recommended to allocate about US$ 20 000 per year to this training programme (a small fraction of the funds for the fertilizer imports). "THAILAND "It {{is recommended that}} the office for Agricultural Inputs Development of the Department of Agricultural Extension sets up six regional information centres for fertilizer and related inputs which would ensure that the training courses and material used would have a high degree of local relevance. There should be a shift to a <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> <b>programme</b> once most retailers have been trained while the present system of paying fees for the course should be maintained...|$|E

Participants were given exposure to outreach activities in an eye camp and a satellite eye centre resembling a district hospital. The PMOAs found the training to be useful and it was seen that areas like patient counselling, instrument and equipment maintenance, and assistance in the operation theatre for newer surgical procedures which were lacking in the basic training were fulfilled in this <b>training</b> <b>programme.</b> Regional Institutes of Ophthalmology, upgraded medical colleges, and other eye-care institutions which have facilities and manpower could organise similar refresher and continuing education programmes for PMOAs {{so that they could}} be utilised more efficiently in the blindness-control activities in the country...|$|R

40|$|Objectives]To {{evaluate}} the long-term effectiveness of 15 -min refresher basic life support (BLS) training following 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training. [Methods]After the 45 -min chest compression-only BLS training, {{the participants were}} randomly assigned to either the <b>refresher</b> BLS <b>training</b> group, which received a 15 -min <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> 6 months after the initial <b>training</b> (<b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group), or to the control group, which did not receive <b>refresher</b> <b>training.</b> Participants’ resuscitation skills were evaluated by a 2 -min case-based scenario test 1 year after the initial training. The primary outcome measure was the number of appropriate chest compressions during a 2 -min test period. [Results] 140 participants were enrolled and 112 of them completed this study. The number of appropriate chest compressions performed during the 2 -min test period was significantly greater in the <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group (68. 9 ± 72. 3) than in the control group (36. 3 ± 50. 8,p = 0. 009). Time without chest compressions was significantly shorter in the <b>refresher</b> <b>training</b> group (16. 1 ± 2. 1 s versus 26. 9 ± 3. 7 s, p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences in}} time to chest compression (29. 6 ± 16. 7 s versus 34. 4 ± 17. 8 s, p = 0. 172) and AED use between the groups. [Conclusions]A short-time <b>refresher</b> BLS <b>training</b> program 6 months after the initial training can help trainees retain chest compression skills for up to 1 year. Repeated BLS training, even if very short, would be adopted to keep acquired CPR quality optimal (UMIN-CTR UMIN 000004101) ...|$|R
