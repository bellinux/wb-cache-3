5000|$|Extensive {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} {{possibilities}} for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, designation fee, search fee and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing [...] and <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict grace periods. These grace periods have now {{been replaced by the}} application of further processing [...] and, if the further processing time limit is missed, <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing.|$|E

50|$|The first Huguenot {{rebellion}} {{was triggered}} by the <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> Catholic <b>rights</b> in Huguenot Béarn by Louis XIII in 1617, and the military annexation of Béarn to France in 1620, with the occupation of Pau in October 1620. The government {{was replaced by a}} French-style parliament in which only Catholics could sit.|$|R
50|$|After the German {{annexation}} of Lorraine in 1871, Luxembourgish steel products {{were subject to}} intense competition. Germany's suppression <b>of</b> customs <b>rights</b> in 1873 and overproduction provoked an economic downturn amplified {{by the arrival of}} British cast iron. The <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> customs <b>rights</b> in 1879 {{put an end to this}} crisis. From then onwards, cartels were formed with a view to regulating the steel market. In 1879, a Lorraine-Luxembourgish iron cartel (Lothringisch-Luxemburgisches Roheisensyndikat) was formed, and in 1889 a steel cartel, the Lothringisch-Luxemburgischer Stahlwerksverband.|$|R

Shortly after, he joined UCO Bank on 16 April 1971 and resigned on 16 September 1987 to dedicate his full-time attention to serve CPI(M). He married Rina Deb on 27 November 1977. She also worked in UCO Bank, and they have a daughter named Riddhi.|$|R
5000|$|The {{restitutio in integrum}} or <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> {{under the}} European Patent Convention (EPC) {{is a means of}} redress {{available}} to an applicant or patent proprietor who has failed to meet a time limit in spite of exercising [...] "all due care required by the circumstances". The legal basis for this means of redress is provided in [...] If the request for restitutio in integrum is accepted, the applicant or patentee is re-established in its rights, as if the time limit had been duly met.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} changes, was to allow the excuse of the failure to observe the 12 month {{priority}} period. If this period is missed, this failure can be remedied by a request for <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> filed within 2 months of the expiry of the priority period (in most other cases, the request for re-establishment must be filed within two months of {{the removal of the}} impediment to completing the act in question on time, up to a maximum of 12 months [...] ). This is provided that the failure to the observe the original period was despite the applicant having taken all due care (i.e. the applicant has a legitimate reason for missing the deadline). There is some uncertainty as to whether this is an aggregate time limit or a unitary time limit, which can make difference of up to several days as to when it expires.|$|E
40|$|Since the Republican Regime was {{definitively}} {{installed in}} France (1875), four categories of French nationals {{have been subject}} to discrimination inscribed in nationality law: French women who married foreigners, Algerian Muslims, naturalized citizens and Jews. Although the Republic recognized them as French, they did not always have rights equal to other French nationals. Today such discrimination has disappeared, yet two of these groups–the Jews and the Algerian Muslims–preserve the trace, the memory, the suffering and the lived experience of past discrimination, despite <b>re-establishment</b> <b>of</b> their <b>rights</b> and sometimes recognition or reparation for their loss. This article attempts to understand why. In these two cases, a second event–the discourse of de Gaulle in 1967 and the reform of nationality laws in 1993 –reactivated the painful past and provoked disidentification. This second event occurred during a time of forma...|$|R
