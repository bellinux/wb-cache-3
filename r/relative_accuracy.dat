25|$|Pure {{pigments}} reflect {{light in}} a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display. However, by making careful measurements of pigments, close approximations can be made. The Munsell Color System provides a good conceptual explanation of what is missing. Munsell devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or lightness), and chroma. Computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and lightness can be reproduced with <b>relative</b> <b>accuracy.</b> However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.|$|E

25|$|L. sericata is an {{important}} species to forensic entomologists. Like most calliphorids, L. sericata has been heavily studied and its lifecycle and habits are well documented. Accordingly, the stage of its development on a corpse {{is used to calculate}} a minimum post mortem interval, {{so that it can be}} used to aid in determining the time of death of the victim. The presence or absence of L. sericata can provide information about the conditions of the corpse. If the insects seem to be on the path of their normal development, the corpse likely has been undisturbed. If, however, the insect shows signs of a disturbed lifecycle, or is absent from a decaying body, this suggests post mortem tampering with the body. Because L. sericata is one of the first insects to colonize a corpse, it is preferred to many other species in determining an approximate time of colonization. Developmental progress is determined with <b>relative</b> <b>accuracy</b> by measuring the length and weight of larval lifecycles.|$|E

This paper discusses autonomous relative navigation performance for formations in eccentric, medium and high altitude Earth-orbits using Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and intersatellite range measurements. The performance of several candidate relative navigation approaches is evaluated.

A <b>relative</b> navigation position <b>accuracy</b> of 0. 5 meters root-mean-square (RMS) can be achieved for formations in medium-attitude eccentric orbits that can continuously track at least one GPS signal.
