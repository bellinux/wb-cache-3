40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> {{satisfaction}} and compliance is examined {{in terms of}} specificity and predictive value. Satisfaction {{is assumed to be}} a determinant of compliance, especially if both concepts are measured at the same level of specificity (i. e., a dental level). A total of 176 subjects reported their satisfaction with dental visits and the dental practice, their dental compliance and their general tendency to comply. The results show a <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> satisfaction and compliance and that compliance can be predicted by satisfaction. Surprisingly, the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> dental satisfaction and general compliance is stronger than the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> dental satisfaction and dental compliance. This finding {{can be explained by the}} possible <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> different levels of compliance and the complexity of the concept dental compliance. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the role of}} {{traditional}} family values (familism) on the processes associated with coping with parent-child conflict among Mexican and Mexican American college students. It was hypothesized that traditional family values would moderate: 1) the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> parent-child conflict and appraisals of threat and, 2) the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> threat appraisals and psychological distress. Two additional hypotheses tested the mediating effects of threat on the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> parent-child conflict and psychological distress and the mediating effects of coping on the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> threat and psychological distress. Data were obtained from college students in El Paso, TX (n = 196) and Ciudad Juarez, MX (n = 199). Self-report measures {{were used to assess}} traditional family attitudes, general levels of parent-child conflict, threat appraisals, coping styles, and psychological distress. As predicted, familism moderated the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> conflict severity and threat appraisals. Specifically, the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> parent-child conflict and threat appraisals was stronger at high levels of familism than at low levels of familism. However, familism did not moderate the <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> threat and distress. Study findings suggest the need to assess familism among Mexican and Mexican American young adults because of its important implications for psychological distress...|$|R
