The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, {{as a function of}} the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.|$|E

30|$|For instance, in the {{pioneering}} work[1], the Markov chain {{used to analyze}} the network is the composition of a random walk and a counter-like sub-chain. It can be observed that counter-like and random walk sub-chains present a very local and regular connectivity structure. By local, we mean that every state connects to a small neighborhood of states. Regularity implies that states connect to 1 -hop neighbors in a similar fashion. For instance, in counter-like sub-chains, states connect to the state corresponding to a <b>reset</b> <b>counter</b> and the state associated with an incremented or decremented value (possibly plus a self-loop). As a result, the overall graph is regular and local. This property is instrumental towards having an efficient compression in the wavelet domain, meaning that {{only a limited number of}} notable substructures is needed to model the temporal evolution of the state of the network.|$|E

5000|$|Counters are {{primarily}} used for counting {{items such as}} cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck. There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a <b>reset.</b> Down <b>counters</b> count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon <b>reset.</b> Up/Down <b>counters</b> count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.|$|R

50|$|This ensures that, in any terrain, {{the player}} will not {{experience}} {{more than one}} random encounter every eight steps. A game {{with this type of}} system can sometimes be taken advantage of by initiating some action that will <b>reset</b> the <b>counter</b> (pausing, opening a menu, saving), especially when using an emulator. This is a popular trick in speedruns to skip time-consuming or dangerous battles or {{it can be used to}} ensure that each battle results in a rare or valuable encounter.|$|R
30|$|We {{take the}} ceiling (⌈y⌉ the minimum integer ≤y) because ωi,k is the dynamic {{coefficient}} {{of the dynamic}} weight and must be an integer, because the dynamic weight specifies the number of packets the scheduler is allowed to transmit from the queue in one <b>counter</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|R
50|$|Significant {{functionality}} {{is available}} at the lower Stop and Shutoff energy modes. The Stop Mode includes analog comparators, watchdog timers, pulse counters, I2C links, and external interrupts.

30|$|Excessive allocation: as {{static weight}} {{assignment}} schemes {{are unaware of}} the current network conditions, {{in the case of}} excessive allocation, a node is given transmission opportunities typically at the cost of suppressing other nodes even if it has no packets to transmit. This causes the channel resources to be wasted. The severity of this situation can be identified by keeping a counter for the number of slots each node wastes. A dynamic weighting scheme which tries to alleviate this problem should periodically measure the amount of waste caused by the most recent weight assignments and <b>reset</b> those <b>counters.</b>|$|R

After that, the dorje <b>counter</b> is <b>reset.</b> These <b>counters</b> are placed at different points on the mala depending on tradition, sometimes at the 10th, 21st or 25th bead from the Guru bead.

40|$|In this example, we {{show how}} you can use NISC [4] to read the values of {{switches}} and control LEDs of Xilinx Virtex- 4 Video Starter Kit [1]. The Video Starter Kit board has five buttons (called north, south, west, east) where next to each there is an LED (called led_north, led_south, led_west, led_east). Also, there are four other LEDs on board (led 0, led 1, led 2, led 3). In this simple application, NISC counts from 0 to 16 in a loop and shows the binary numbers on the four LEDs. At any point during the execution, the user can press east, center, and west buttons to <b>reset</b> the <b>counter</b> to 0001, 0010, and 0100, respectively. The south button stops the count down and terminates the program. The north button resets the NISC to rerun the application. To allow the user to see the values on the LED, the counter must wait {{at least for a}} fraction of a second after each update. Figure 1 - Push-buttons and LEDs on Xilinx Video Starter Kit Board To implement this application, we can use any NISC with an output data register (called exernalOutputReg) and an Interrupt Unit (IU). The IU is needed for the part of the specification that requires <b>resetting</b> the <b>counter</b> to specific values as user pushes the buttons. We connect the on-board switches to the interrupt lines of a NISC component and its external output to the LEDs on board. In FPGAs, this is done through defining constraint files. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of a general-purpose NISC connected to on-board LEDs and switches...|$|R

The transition probabilities are equal in those last two expressions.|$|R

30|$|We {{measure the}} {{short-term}} fairness horizon in our simulations {{using the following}} procedure: we keep a throughput counter for each node; this counter records the total throughput that the node has gained until the current time in the simulation. Using these throughput values, we repeatedly check for the Jain’s index of the network as the simulation continues. If the network achieves a Jain’s index of 0.95, we record the number of completed transmissions per node until that moment as the short-term fairness horizon. At this moment, we <b>reset</b> the <b>counters</b> and again wait for the network to reach a fairness index of 0.95. We sample the short-term fairness horizon 50 times by repeating this procedure and take the average of these values.|$|R
50|$|For a given {{capacitor}} charging current, the amplitude of the output waveform will decrease linearly with frequency.
