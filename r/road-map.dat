25|$|This 15th edition had no general index, {{which had}} been {{a feature of the}} Britannica since its 7th edition; even in the 2nd edition, {{individual}} long articles had their own indices. The idea of Mortimer J. Adler was that the Propædia and the Micropædia could serve the role of an index. More generally, Dr. Adler felt that the Britannica should not merely serve as a reference work, but also aspire to be a categorization of omne scibile (everything knowable), to fulfill Francis Bacon's grand conception of epistemology. Thus, the Propædia was intended to be the <b>road-map</b> of all knowledge, within which every fact, technique, and theory could be organized.|$|E
25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} to pass up a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a <b>road-map</b> as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its fall that allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} our preliminary experience using a <b>road-mapping</b> {{procedure that}} involves combining preacquired CTA with real-time fluoroscopy. This maneuver facilitates navigation in supra-aortic vessels from the arch to skull base levels. It requires less contrast than {{is used for}} traditional <b>road-mapping</b> while potentially reducing the hazard of thromboembolic events associated with direct catheterization. The accuracy of registration between the 2 volume datasets seems satisfactory for clinical practice. ABBREVIATIONS: AP anteroposterior; CTA CT angiography; 3 DRA 3 D rotation angiography; MIP maximum intensity projection. Traditional <b>road-mapping,</b> involving the superimpositionof digital subtraction of the contrast-filled vessel lumen on fluoroscopy, provides good spatial resolution and contrast for real-time images. It also lowers the risk of inadvertent events {{when compared with the}} direct catheterization of vessels, in which the manipulation of wires and catheters distally some-times causes vasospasm, dissection, and dislodgement of plaques because of an uncertain spatial relationship between the devices and the vessel walls...|$|R

2500|$|The {{genocide}} {{took place}} {{in the context of the}} Rwandan Civil War, a conflict beginning in 1990 between the Hutu-led government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which largely consisted of Tutsi refugees whose families had fled to Uganda after the 1959 Hutu revolt against colonial rule. Waves of Hutu violence against the RPF and Tutsi followed Rwandan independence in 1962. International pressure on the Hutu government of Juvénal Habyarimana resulted in a ceasefire in 1993, with a <b>road-map</b> to implement the Arusha Accords, which would create a power-sharing government with the RPF. This agreement was not acceptable to a number of conservative Hutu, including members of the Akazu, who viewed it as conceding to enemy demands. The RPF military campaign intensified support for the so-called [...] "Hutu Power" [...] ideology, which portrayed the RPF as an alien force who were non-Christian, intent on reinstating the Tutsi monarchy and enslaving Hutus. Many Hutus reacted to this prospect with extreme opposition. In the lead-up to the genocide the number of machetes imported into Rwanda increased.|$|E
