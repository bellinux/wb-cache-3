25|$|The {{first two}} are {{individual}} utilities that allow a user {{to take control}} of a remote computer over the network. In case of <b>Remote</b> <b>Assistance,</b> the remote user needs to receive an invitation and the control is cooperative. In case of RDC, however, the remote user opens a new session on the remote computer and has every power granted by its user account's rights and restrictions. Fast User Switching allows users to switch between user accounts on the local computer without quitting software and logging out. Fast User Switching is part of Winlogon and uses RDS to accomplish its switching feature. Third-party developers have also created client software for RDS. For example, rdesktop supports Unix platforms.|$|E

Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a [...] "task-oriented" [...] Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's [...]NET Passport services, modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and <b>Remote</b> <b>Assistance</b> functionality.|$|E

2500|$|Although RDS is shipped {{with most}} editions of all {{versions}} of Windows NT since Windows 2000, its functionality differs in each version.

Windows Server allows two users to connect at the same time. This licensing scheme, called [...] "Remote Desktop for Administration", facilitates administration of unattended or headless computers. Only by acquiring additional licenses (in addition to that of Windows) can a computer running Windows Server service multiple remote users at one time and achieve virtual desktop infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Remote {{collaborative}} systems {{allow people}} at remote locations {{to accomplish a}} task as a team. One unique and critical challenge for these systems is to support communication of spatial information, as people at remote locations cannot anchor their conversation by directly referencing objects in the same spatial environment. We focus {{on the task of}} indoor navigation assistance to highlight this challenge, and propose a general framework that allows two or more persons at remote locations to better communicate and make spatial inferences. We show how schematic representations and augmented reality tools can be combined to help them establish anchors that allow them to both see and refer to the same locations, such that the users can develop a richer representation of the spatial environment. The tools can also provide guidance on actions and facilitate spatial inferences. We demonstrate this idea using a version of <b>remote</b> spatial <b>assistance</b> to a local user who navigates in an unfamiliar indoor environment. The system aims at efficiently connecting the local user and the remote expert to collaboratively infer and develop a spatial plan, locate and correct the position of the local user without the use of a GPS system, and provide spatial guidance using landmarks developed by the pair of users. The system demonstrates the combination of an autonomous system and human computation system. Implication to future development of such systems for <b>remote</b> spatial <b>assistance</b> is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Service-based {{systems that}} are {{dynamically}} composed at run time to provide complex, adaptive functionality are currently {{one of the main}} development paradigms in software engineering. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) delivered by these systems remains an important concern, and needs to be managed in an equally adaptive and predictable way. To address this need, we introduce a novel, tool-supported framework for the development of adaptive service-based systems called QoSMOS (QoS Management and Optimisation of Service-based systems). QoSMOS can be used to develop service-based systems that achieve their QoS requirements through dynamically adapting to changes in the system state, environment and workload. QoSMOS service-based systems translate high-level QoS requirements specified by their administrators into probabilistic temporal logic formulae, which are then formally and automatically analysed to identify and enforce optimal system configurations. The QoSMOS self-adaptation mechanism can handle reliability- and performance-related QoS requirements, and can be integrated into newly developed solutions or legacy systems. The effectiveness and scalability of the approach are validated using simulations and a set of experiments based on an implementation of an adaptive service-based system for <b>remote</b> medical <b>assistance...</b>|$|R
