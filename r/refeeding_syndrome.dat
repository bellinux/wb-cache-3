25|$|Starving {{patients}} can be treated, but {{this must be}} done cautiously to avoid <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Rest and warmth must be provided and maintained.

The quantity of food can be increased over time. Proteins may be administered intravenously to {{raise the level of}} serum proteins.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, {{nutritional}} status {{can be assessed}} by measuring the concentration of transthyretin in the blood. In theory, other transport proteins such as albumin or transferrin could be used, but transthyretin is preferred because of its shorter half-life, although this means that its concentration more closely reflects recent dietary intake rather than overall {{nutritional status}}. Transthyretin concentration {{has been shown to}} be a good indicator of whether or not a malnourished patient will develop <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> upon commencement of refeeding, via either the enteral, parenteral or oral routes.|$|E
2500|$|AN {{has a high}} {{mortality}} and patients admitted in a severely ill state to medical units are at particularly high risk.

The MARSIPAN guidelines recommend that medical and psychiatric experts work together in managing severely ill people with AN.|$|E
2500|$|The rate of refeeding can be {{difficult}} to establish, because the fear of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> (RFS) can lead to underfeeding. [...] It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels, [...] is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present. [...] In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur. [...] Recommendations on energy requirements vary, from 5â€“10 kCal/Kg/day in the most medically compromised patients, who appear to have the highest risk of RFS to 1900 Kcal/day ...|$|E
2500|$|In medicine, {{phosphate}} deficiency syndrome {{may be caused}} by malnutrition, by failure to absorb phosphate, and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood (such as in [...] <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> after malnutrition) or pass too much of it into the urine. All are characterised by hypophosphatemia, which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells. Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP. Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.|$|E

50|$|Any {{individual}} {{who has had}} negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.|$|E

50|$|<b>Refeeding</b> <b>{{syndrome}}</b> is a syndrome {{consisting of}} metabolic disturbances that {{occur as a}} result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved, severely malnourished or metabolically stressed due to severe illness. When too much food and/or liquid nutrition supplement is consumed during the initial four to seven days of refeeding this triggers synthesis of glycogen, fat and protein in cells, to the detriment of serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Cardiac, pulmonary and neurological symptoms can be signs of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The low serum minerals, if severe enough, can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> can {{be fatal}} if not {{recognized}} and treated properly. An awareness of the condition and a high index of suspicion are {{required in order to}} make the diagnosis. The electrolyte disturbances of the <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> can occur within the first few days of refeeding. Close monitoring of blood biochemistry is therefore necessary in the early refeeding period. In critically ill patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit, if phosphate drops to below 0.65 mmol from a previously normal level within three days of starting enteral or parenteral nutrition, caloric intake should be reduced to 480 kcals per day for at least two days whilst electrolytes are replaced. Prescribing thiamine, vitamin B complex (strong) and a multivitamin and mineral preparation is recommended. Biochemistry should be monitored regularly until it is stable. Although clinical trials are lacking in patients other than those admitted to an intensive care, it is commonly recommended that energy intake should remain lower than that normally required for the first 3-5 days of treatment of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Patients who have been starved for some time often experience gastrointestinal disturbance during refeeding, in particular colicky abdominal pain, reflux symptoms, nausea, and early satiety.|$|E
50|$|In {{those who}} are {{severely}} malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself {{a couple of days}} after eating with heart failure, dysrhythmias and confusion that can result in death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> - This {{causes a}} demand for {{phosphate}} in cells due to the action of hexokinase, an enzyme that attaches phosphate to glucose to begin metabolism of glucose. Also, production of ATP when cells are fed and recharge their energy supplies requires phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Other {{complications}} {{are either}} related to catheter insertion, or metabolic, including <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Catheter complications include pneumothorax, accidental arterial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The complication rate {{at the time}} of insertion should be less than 5%. Catheter-related infections may be minimised by appropriate choice of catheter and insertion technique. Metabolic complications include the <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> characterised by hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. Hyperglycemia is common at the start of therapy, but can be treated with insulin added to the TPN solution. Hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Liver dysfunction can be limited to a reversible cholestatic jaundice and to fatty infiltration (demonstrated by elevated transaminases). Severe hepatic dysfunction is a rare complication. Overall, patients receiving TPN have a higher rate of infectious complications. This can be related to hyperglycemia.|$|E
50|$|Anorexia is a {{relatively}} common condition that can lead patients to have dangerous electrolyte imbalances, leading to acquired long QT syndrome which can result in sudden cardiac death. This can develop over a prolonged period of time, and the risk is further heightened when feeding resumes {{after a period of}} abstaining from consumption. Care must be taken under such circumstances to avoid potentially fatal complications of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|Experiments in mice {{have shown}} that dietary valine is {{essential}} for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. Dietary valine restriction selectively depletes long-term repopulating Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) in mouse Bone Marrow (BM). Successful stem cell transplantation was achieved in mice without irradiation after 3 weeks on a -Val diet. Long term survival of the transplanted mice was achieved when valine was returned to the diet gradually over a 2 week period to avoid <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} {{for people to}} gather and {{redistribute}} the food, but some could not resist eating straight away, which caused some people to get sick and vomit, (and some died) a result that fatty food can have in starved bodies known as <b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> On the other hand, distribution sometimes took as long as ten days, resulting in some getting the food only after the liberation. Nevertheless, many lives were saved, and it gave hope and {{the feeling that the}} war would soon be over.|$|E

50|$|Fog fever {{refers to}} cattle <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> which is {{clinically}} named Acute bovine pulmonary emphysema and edema (ABPEE) and Bovine atypical interstitial pneumonia. This veterinary disease in adult cattle follows an abrupt move from feedlot (dried feed indoors) to 'foggage pasture' (fast growing, lush pasture, with high protein levels). Clinical signs begin within 1 to 14 days and death may follow within 2 to 4 days. The condition can affect up to 50% of the herd, and around 30% of affected cattle may die as a result. This metabolic nutritional-respiratory disturbance {{has also been}} reported in other ruminants (red deer) and {{on a wide variety}} of grasses, alfalfa, rape, kale, and turnip tops.|$|E
5000|$|Hypophosphatemia is an {{electrolyte}} {{disturbance in}} which there is an abnormally low level of phosphate in the blood. The condition has many causes, but is most commonly seen when malnourished patients (especially chronic alcoholics) are given large amounts of carbohydrates, which creates a high phosphorus demand by cells, removing phosphate from the blood (<b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Because a decrease in phosphate in the blood is sometimes associated with an increase in phosphate in the urine, the terms hypophosphatemia and [...] "phosphaturia" [...] are occasionally used interchangeably; however, this is improper since there exist many causes of hypophosphatemia besides overexcretion and phosphaturia, and in fact the most common causes of hypophosphatemia are not associated with phosphaturia.|$|E
50|$|During refeeding, insulin {{secretion}} resumes {{in response}} to increased blood sugar, resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires phosphates, magnesium and potassium which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the basal metabolic rate. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the serum electrolytes, including phosphorus and magnesium. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B1 vitamin thiamine may fall. Cardiac arrhythmias {{are the most common}} cause of death from <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome,</b> with other significant risks including confusion, coma and convulsions and cardiac failure.|$|E
5000|$|Though traditionally, the {{prognosis}} is considered poor, a good functional recovery is possible. All patients {{at risk of}} developing <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> should have their electrolytes closely monitored, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, glucose and phosphate. Recent data indicate that {{the prognosis}} of critically ill patients may even be better than what is generally considered, despite severe initial clinical manifestations and a tendency by the intensivists to underestimate a possible favorable evolution.While some patients die, most survive and of the survivors, approximately one-third recover; one-third are disabled but are able to live independently; one-third are severely disabled. [...] Permanent disabilities range from minor tremors and ataxia to signs of severe brain damage, such as spastic quadriparesis and locked-in syndrome. Some improvements may be seen {{over the course of}} the first several months after the condition stabilizes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{describes}} {{a constellation of}} metabolic disturbances that occur {{as a result of}} reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved or severely malnourished. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications. We reviewed literature on <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the associated electrolyte abnormalities, fluid disturbances, and associated complications. In addition to assessing scientific literature, we also considered clinical experience and judgment in developing recommendations for prevention and treatment of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The most important steps are to identify patients at risk for developing <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome,</b> institute nutrition support cautiously, and correct and supplement electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies to avoid <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We provide suggestions for the prevention of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> and suggestions for treatment of electrolyte disturbances and complications in patients who develop <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome,</b> according to evidence in the literature, the pathophysiology of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and clinical experience and judgment.

40|$|Aim: Limited {{research}} {{exists on}} how consistently dietitians are identifying <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk in hospitalised patients. We aimed {{to describe how}} consistent Australian and New Zealand dietitians are at identifying <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk and compare their responses to the application of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> guidelines and patients' electrolyte levels and supplementation provided. Methods Dietitians from Australia and New Zealand were invited to complete an online survey. The survey inquired about demographics and asked respondents to classify the level of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk (i. e. none, some, high) in 13 case studies. Electrolytes and supplementation data were sourced from electronic patient records. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were conducted. Results: Two hundred and ninety-nine eligible people responded (33 Â± 9 years, 95 %F, 48 % had â‰¥ 7 years of dietetic experience, 91 % working clinically, 87 % Australian). Respondents' answers were generally consistent and dietitians often reported {{the same level of}} <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk as the application of NICE guidelines and patient electrolytes (49 â€“ 98 %). Respondents requested feedback on their responses, more detailed case information, and commented on factors that may influence their risk identification, including subsequent medical management and route of nutritional delivery. Conclusions: Dietitians were generally consistent in the identification of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk. Dietitians often reported similar levels of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk to those found with the application of refeeding guidelines and patient electrolytes and supplementation treatment. Evaluation of practice was valued by dietitians. Enhancing the evidence on which guidelines are based may improve translatability of guidelines to practice. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{potentially}} fatal shift of fluids and electrolytes {{that may occur}} after reintroducing nutrition in a malnourished patient. Its incidence in internal medicine patients is not known. We aimed at determining the incidence in a heterogeneous group of patients acutely admitted to a department of internal medicine. All patients acutely admitted {{to the department of}} internal medicine of a teaching community hospital in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, between 22 February 2011 and 29 April 2011, were included. We applied the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria for determining people at risk of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> and took hypophosphataemia as the main indicator for the presence of this syndrome. Of 178 patients included in the study, 97 (54 %) were considered to be at risk of developing <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 14 patients actually developed the syndrome (14 % of patients at risk and 8 % of study population). Patients with a malignancy or previous malignancy were at increased risk of developing <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> (p < 0. 05). Measurement of muscle strength over time was not associated with the occurrence of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire score had a positive and negative predictive value of 13 % and 95 % respectively. The incidence of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> was relatively high in patients acutely admitted to the department of internal medicine.

40|$|The <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{potentially}} lethal complication of refeeding {{in patients who}} are severely malnourished from whatever cause. Too rapid refeeding, particularly with carbohydrate may precipitate a number of metabolic and pathophysiological complications, which may adversely affect the cardiac, respiratory, haematological, hepatic and neuromuscular systems leading to clinical complications and even death. We aimed to review {{the development of the}} <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> in a variety of situations and, from this and the literature, devise guidelines to prevent and treat the condition. We report seven cases illustrating different aspects of the <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the measures used to treat it.

40|$|Background: Limited {{research}} exists concerning how {{consistently and}} accurately student and newly-graduated dietitians are identifying <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk in hospitalised patients. The present study aimed {{to determine the}} consistency of students' and newly-graduated dietitians' classification of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk, as well as agreement with the application of comparison tools such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, patients' electrolytes and supplementation, and clinical dietitians previously surveyed. Methods: Recently-graduated and final-year Griffith University dietetics students were invited to complete an online survey. The survey questioned demographics and asked respondents to classify the level of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk (i. e. none, some, high, unsure) in 13 case studies. Electrolytes and supplementation data were sourced from electronic patient records. Chi-squared tests, t-tests and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Fifty-three eligible people responded [n = 53 of 112, mean (SD) age 26 (4) years, 89 % female, 34 % graduates]. Respondents' answers were generally more consistent {{and more likely to}} agree with comparison tools when two tools showed the same level of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk (49 â€“ 98 %, Î² = 0. 626 â€“ 1. 0994, P 0. 05). Conclusions: Students' and new graduates' identification of <b>refeeding</b> <b>syndrome</b> risk improved when there was consistency between guidelines, electrolytes and dietitians' responses. More research is needed to improve the evidence behind refeeding guidelines, with the aim of enhancing the accuracy and consistency of assessment.
