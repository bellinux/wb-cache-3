Sucrose, glucose and maltose (3 % and 6 %) with abscisic acid (20, 40, 60 μM) were screened for optimal combination with respect to embryo maturation.

The <b>VV</b> <b>lines</b> with a white and translucent tissue phenotype showed the best maturation capacity on 3 % sucrose or 3 % maltose with 20 or 40 μM ABA.

VV first started on RTL Klub in 2002. At the same time the rival TV channel (TV2) purchased the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the successful Big Brother format. The 1st seasons of the 2 shows had similar ratings but BB was slightly ahead. Since the 2nd season VV crashed the rival format so BB moved to the late night time slot and died quietly.

After the 3rd season <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> ended RTL Klub had the format rested for 6 years. In 2010 they relaunched the format with some changes. VV4 was followed by VV5 in 2011. VV6 started in Winter 2014 on RTL II and the channel continues it with a 7th season in Autumn. RTL Klub sold the format <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> to Czech Republic and Slovakia where the show was called Vyvolení. The Czech VV had 3 seasons while the Slovak had 2.

However, characterization <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> vascularization in restenotic arteries with primary lesions is still missing. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the response <b>of</b> adventitial <b>VV</b> to vascular injury resulting from balloon angioplasty in diseased arteries. Methods: Primary atherosclerotic-like lesions were {{induced by the}} placement of an absorbable thread surrounding the carotid artery of New Zealand rabbits. Four weeks following double-injury induced that was induced by secondary balloon dilation, three-dimensional patterns <b>of</b> adventitial <b>VV</b> were reconstructed; the number, density, and endothelial surface <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> were quantified using micro-computed tomography. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed {{in order to examine}} the development of intimal hyperplasia. Results: Results from our study suggest that double injured arteries have a greater number <b>of</b> <b>VV,</b> increased luminal surface, and an elevation in the intima/media ratio (I/M), along with an accumulation of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the intima, as compared to sham or single injury arteries. I/M and the number <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> were positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 82, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Extensive adventitial VV neovascularization occurs in injured arteries after balloon angioplasty, which is associated with intimal hyperplasia. Quantitative assessment <b>of</b> adventitial <b>VV</b> response may provide insight into the basic biological process of postangioplasty restenosis...|$|R

The aim was to estimate whether the familial transmission <b>of</b> <b>VVs</b> is related to disease in biological and/or adoptive parents. Study Design: The Swedish Multi-Generation Register and the Swedish Patient Register were used to follow all Swedish-born adoptees (born 1932 through 2004) that could be linked to both their biological and their adoptive parents (n = 80, 214; 50 % females). The risk <b>of</b> <b>VVs</b> was estimated in adoptees with at least 1 biological parent with VVs, but no adoptive parent with VVs (n = 187) compared with adoptees without a biological or adoptive parent with VVs (n = 1, 758). The risk <b>of</b> <b>VVs</b> was also determined in adoptees with at least 1 adoptive parent, but no biological parent with VVs (n = 87), and in adoptees with both biological and adoptive parents affected (n = 21). Results: Adoptees from an affected biological parent, but no adoptive parent, {{were more likely to}} have VVs than adoptees from an unaffected biological or adoptive parent (standard incidence ratio [SIR] = 2. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 91 - 2. 55).

To test this hypothesis, we modeled the lung computationally as a symmetrically bifurcating airway tree terminating in elastic units. Each airway was fully open or completely closed, at any point in time, according to its pressure history. The model is able to accurately mimic previous experimental measurements showing that the lungs of mice injured by acid aspiration are better recruited after 60 min <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> than CV. The model also shows that recruitment/derecruitment dynamics contribute to the relative efficacy <b>of</b> <b>VV,</b> provided lung units open more rapidly than they close once a critical opening or closing pressure threshold has been crossed. We conclude that the dynamics of recruitment and derecruitment in the lung may be important factors responsible for the benefits <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> compared with CV...|$|R

The {{extraction}} behaviors <b>of</b> <b>V(V)</b> {{along with}} Cr(VI) {{by a few}} of pure imidazolium-based hydrophobic ionic liquids have been investigated. Among these hydrophobic ionic liquids, [C(8) mim][PF 6] exhibits a special extraction for V(V) while a weak extraction for Cr(VI). The extraction behavior <b>of</b> <b>V(V)</b> by [C(8) mim][PF 6] was particularly studied. The extraction <b>of</b> <b>V(V)</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the acidity of the aqueous phase, and the maximum separation factor between V and Cr (beta(V/Cr)) was calculated to be 100. 6 in case of pH 3. 5. The most probable extraction mechanism <b>of</b> <b>V(V)</b> has been proposed to be the anion exchange between the main species HV 10 O 273 - and PF 6 -. Furthermore, V(V) in IL phase can be quantitatively stripped by KPF 6 solution under the basic condition (C-OH(-) = 1 mol/l). Recycle test indicates that the extraction capacity shows no apparent decline until the 9 th continuous extraction-stripping cycle. The result also provides a new approach for the preparation of a novel ionic liquid with metal oxo-anions as counter anion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease {{that leads to}} several acute cardiovascular complications with poor prognosis. For decades, {{the role of the}} adventitial vasa vasorum (VV) in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis has received broad attention. The presence <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> neovascularization precedes the apparent symptoms <b>of</b> clinical atherosclerosis. <b>VV</b> also mediates inflammatory cell infiltration, intimal thickening, intraplaque hemorrhage, and subsequent atherothrombosis that results in stroke or myocardial infarction. Intraplaque neovessels originating from VV can be immature and hence susceptible to leakage, and are thus regarded as the leading cause of intraplaque hemorrhage. Evidence supports VV as a new surrogate target of atherosclerosis evaluation and treatment. This review provides an overview into the relationship between VV and atherosclerosis, including the anatomy and function <b>of</b> <b>VV,</b> the stimuli <b>of</b> <b>VV</b> neovascularization, and the available underlying mechanisms that lead to poor prognosis.
