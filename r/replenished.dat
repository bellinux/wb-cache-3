5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be <b>replenished</b> by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E
5|$|Different {{parts of}} each unit can be damaged, {{and the success}} of each attack depends on the units' stats as well as maneuvers. Several ground units are also present on the grid map, and can only be {{destroyed}} by bombers. The level of fuel and amount of ammunition of each unit are limited and must be <b>replenished</b> when necessary.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of Qi-replenishing and Yin-nourishing in {{inhibiting}} tumor metastasis. Methods: Fifty mice were randomly divided into <b>replenishing</b> Qi group, <b>replenishing</b> Yin group, <b>replenishing</b> Qi and Yin group, chemotherapy group and control group. Models of Lewis lung cancer and B 16 melanoma were observed in vivo. The tumor weight inhibiting rate, metastatic lung tumor, concentrations of t-PA and TXB 2 in tumor tissue and IL- 2 and TNF-α in spleen were observed. Results: The tumor weight inhibiting rates of <b>replenishing</b> Qi and Yin group for Lewis lung cancer and B 16 melanoma were both 42. 9 ％. <b>Replenishing</b> Qi and Yin could decrease the contents of TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α, and increase the levels of IL- 2 and TNF-α. Conclusion: <b>Replenishing</b> Qi and Yin can promote the healthy energy to inhibiting tumor metastasis...|$|R

5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be <b>replenished</b> by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water <b>replenished</b> much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{studies have}} {{established}} that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the austral summer confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical and isotropical nature. It is <b>replenished</b> perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the replenishment routing problems of one supplier who can <b>replenish</b> {{only one of}} multiple retailers per period, while different retailers need different periodical replenishment. For simple cases satisfying certain conditions, we obtain the simple routing by which the supplier can <b>replenish</b> each retailer periodically so that shortage will not occur. For complicated cases, using number theory, especially the Chinese remainder theorem, we present an algorithm to calculate a feasible routing so that the supplier can <b>replenish</b> the selected retailers on the selected periods without shortages. ...|$|R
5|$|Mathematical models {{show that}} the E ring is unstable, with a {{lifespan}} between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly <b>replenished.</b> Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s some suspected that Enceladus is {{the main source of}} particles for the ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Sora, {{along with}} his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which {{increase}} as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various sections that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be <b>replenished</b> by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP meter determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be <b>replenished</b> by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until someone heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play {{from the beginning of}} an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall; green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new items.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a number of lives upon {{starting}} the game, and should they die a gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place as long as the player has lives left. Health can be <b>replenished</b> by collecting food scattered throughout the castle, however it will constantly drop the more the player moves, thus the player may eventually lose a life from starvation if they have not escaped the castle in time.|$|E

5|$|The {{rearward}} {{of the two}} ports {{was fitted}} with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by unmanned Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station <b>replenished,</b> helped ensure that the crew were always {{able to carry out}} useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition <b>replenished</b> their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by Kaiser had been largely ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.|$|E
5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly <b>replenished,</b> possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E
25|$|Because railway dining {{cars were}} not yet in common use, {{railroad}} timetables included water, rest, and meal stops.

5|$|For combat, {{the player}} may use fists, {{explosive}} land mines and thermal detonators, {{as well as}} blasters and other ranged weapons. All player weapons except the fist require ammunition, which can be collected in power-ups. All weapons, again {{with the exception of}} the fist, have a secondary mode which makes it have a different effect than in primary mode. The player has health and shields which are damaged by enemy attacks and some environmental hazards, and may be <b>replenished</b> through power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and the original, , are {{identical}} in gameplay and plot. The {{game is a}} first-person shooter with portions of vehicular combat taking place from a third-person perspective. The plot follows the player character and protagonist Master Chief, a supersoldier, as he fights the alien Covenant on the mysterious ancient ringworld Halo. Players are equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage; players also have health {{that can only be}} <b>replenished</b> by health packs scattered across the game's levels. A variety of human and alien weapons and vehicles can be used.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group of hunters on their journey south for the summer. The hunters carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight people had to be buried. Belcourt and six of the hunters travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run out. With his medicine supplies <b>replenished,</b> the missionary {{headed back to the}} encampment of hunters before returning to his mission.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently <b>replenished</b> by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not <b>replenished</b> her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row 2 is {{a mobile}} tie-in action game {{developed}} by G5 Entertainment {{and published by}} THQ Wireless to accompany the Saints Row 2 console game. It was released in October 2008. The game follows {{the story of the}} series where the player returns from jail and fights to protect and expand his gang's territory. The player can steal, carjack, mug, shoot, stab, and kill computer players. There are special minigames for robbing, stealing, and carjacking. Completing missions earns money to be spent towards <b>replenished</b> supplies and player upgrades. Reviewers contended that the game was too large for the small screen, which exacerbated difficult driving controls.|$|E
