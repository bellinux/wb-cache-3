Secondary outcome measures included serum phenobarbital concentrations, number of patients progressing <b>from</b> <b>seizures</b> to status epilepticus, and length of hospital stay. Data collection occurred for 6 months prior and 12 months following protocol implementation. Adherence of 80 % within 12 months was partially achieved in patients diagnosed in our hospital; in pretreated patients, adherence was not achieved. Maximum phenobarbital concentrations were decreased (56. 8 vs 41. 0 µg/mL), fewer patients progressed <b>from</b> <b>seizures</b> to status epilepticus (46 % vs 36 %), and hospital length of stay decreased by 9. 7 days in survivors.

40|$|The {{ability of}} U.

City of Amsterdam that is now on appeal. If upheld, future cultural exchanges may be seriously curtailed; in fact, there is evidence that the case has already had a chilling effect on the willingness of foreign lenders to permit their works of art to travel to the United States. The case in question involves works of art lent by the city of Amsterdam to two U. S. museums that, {{under the terms of the}} 1965 Immunity <b>from</b> <b>Seizure</b> Act, were protected <b>from</b> <b>seizure</b> while in the United States. At issue in the case is a separate statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, under which foreign governmental entities whose property is at any time in the United States are immune from suit here unless the property involves a violation of international law and commercial activity. The District Court held that the Immunity <b>from</b> <b>Seizure</b> Act only protects works of art from seizure; it does not preclude suits for damages against the owners; and that the loan of art works to U. S. museums is commercial activity as that term is used in the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. In order to assure continued cultural exchanges, legislation is needed that will extend the Immunity <b>from</b> <b>Seizure</b> Act to protect a foreign owner from any suit based on the presence of artwork in the United States that has received protection under the Act.

Significant post-ictal hyper-prolactinemia, with a peak at 20 minutes and a fall towards baseline by 1 hour, was found after complex partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and after bilateral, unmodified ECT, but not after hysterical pseudoepileptic seizures or in stressed, non-epileptic controls. A proportionate increase in peak prolactin levels of at least thrice baseline values was found to best differentiate genuine <b>seizures</b> <b>from</b> pseudoepileptic <b>seizures.</b> Postictal hyperprolactinemia is a sensitive biochemical marker of a genuine seizure and of potential use in the differentiation of epileptic <b>from</b> hysterical pseudoepileptic <b>seizures...</b>|$|R
