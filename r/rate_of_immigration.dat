5|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> from Europe grew steeply {{after the}} Civil War, and Manhattan {{became the first}} stop for {{millions}} seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, Port Huron became incorporated. Its {{population}} grew rapidly after the 1850s due a high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> {{attracted by the}} successful shipbuilding and lumber trade. In 1859 the city had a total of 4.031 residents; 1855 were of foreign birth or their children. By 1870, Port Huron's population exceeded that of surrounding villages. In 1871, the State Supreme Court designated Port Huron as the county seat.|$|E

25|$|Petitions {{to secure}} a charter for the college from the state {{legislature}} were denied in 1847 {{for a variety of}} reasons, including anti-Catholicism {{on the part of some}} legislators. The increased <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> from Ireland during the famine years roused resistance from some residents of Massachusetts. Initially, Holy Cross diplomas were signed by the president of Georgetown University. After repeated denials, a charter was finally granted on March 24, 1865, by Governor John Albion Andrew.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War (1861–1865), {{the city}} was {{affected}} by its history of strong commercial ties to the South; before the war, half of its exports were related to cotton, including textiles from upstate mills. Together with its growing immigrant population, which was angry about conscription, sympathies among residents were divided for both the Union and Confederacy at the outbreak of war. Tensions related to the war culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863 by ethnic white immigrants, who attacked black neighborhood and abolitionist homes. Many blacks left the city and moved to Brooklyn. After the Civil War, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> from Europe grew steeply, and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new and better life in the United States, a role acknowledged by {{the dedication of the}} Statue of Liberty in 1886.|$|E

He continued to support the transcontinental railway and lamented the slow progress of the decision on a site for the federal capital, and supported a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> and the watering down of the Immigration Restriction Act. In 1908, he introduced the Commonwealth Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill, which permitted special reserve funds for banks to assist shareholders during a financial crisis, and in 1910 followed with the similar Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill. He complained of the difficulty of passing private senators' bills, and at the 1913 election he retired, suffering from ill health.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991 the Economic Council of Canada {{found that}} periods of {{immigration}} were not {{directly linked to}} periods of high growth. They noted that [...] "a historical perspective gives little or no support {{to the view that}} immigration is needed for economic prosperity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times when net immigration was nil or negative. Later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, clearly, there is no long-term correlation." [...] However, the same report found that a high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> was good for Canada's future, and recommended expanding immigration rates to bring Canada's population to 100 million. A University of Montreal study published in 2002 by professor Marc Termote used different methods and studied different countries and concluded that immigration has no statistically significant impact to the per capita income of a country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Immigration and {{recruitment}} {{were examined in}} six colonies of Yellow-bellied Marmots (Marmota flaviventris) for 220 colony-years. Recruitment occurred significantly more often than <b>immigration.</b> <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> {{and recruitment}} were not significantly correlated among colonies nor were either {{significantly related to the}} area of the colony. The <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigration</b> and recruitment did not differ when the population density of resident females was below the mean, but recruitment was significantly more likely when the population density was above the mean. Immigration was more likely to occur when population density was below the mean, but recruitment did not significantly vary with population density. Recruits were two-years-old whereas immigrants averaged 2. 82 -years-old. Of 32 yearling females who were potential immigrants to a site, only three became resident and the remaining were transients or peripherals. Two peripheral yearlings and six of 29 peripheral adults eventually became immigrants. Yearlings {{were more likely to be}} immigrants if the adult resident females were non-reproductive and if there were no philopatric yearlings present. Immigration and recruitment occurred in the same colony in the same year only eight times. Fitness of adult females is enhanced by recruiting daughters into matrilines consisting <b>of</b> mother:daughter:sister groups. <b>Immigration</b> occurs when empty space is available and there are insufficient recruits to occupy all available space.
