40|$|The {{release of}} heavy metals from {{uncovered}} and nickel-covered brass pumps has been evaluated by ICP-MS analysis in both simple ultrapure water and 3 % acetic acid solution (mimic of neutral and acid edible liquids, respectively), following a procedure {{similar to that}} recommended by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) International, Test Procedure P 203. The results found highlight that the main release regards zinc, copper and lead, i. e. the three major metals present in brass alloys. The first contact of brass surfaces with the extraction solvent leads to an extensive Pb release which is comparable with that observed for Cu and Zn. Subsequent washings reduce markedly the Pb release, thus rising in evidence a progressive surface passivation. In particular, the Pb release found after four repeated washings turns out to approach the limit set by both Italian and USA governments for liquids used for food purposes when determined in neutral media, while it remains quite higher when evaluated in acid media.

40|$|AbstractFull scale {{demonstration}} projects {{are the key}} to gaining policy acceptance for CCS. They also form the vital first step towards reducing the cost of clean power: only when a project is built can engineers examine it and identify improvements and savings opportunities. A number of projects are currently in development for coal CCS, but carbon capture on gas is also important if the world is to make the depth of cuts in emissions required by the current scientific consensus. Shell and SSE plan to deliver the world's first full scale CCS project on gas in Scotland. Up to 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions could be captured over a 10 -year period from flue-gas from a 400 MW combined cycle gas turbine at the existing Peterhead Power Station in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and then transported by pipeline and stored, approximately 100 km offshore in the depleted Goldeneye gas reservoir, at a depth of more than 2 km under the floor of the North Sea. This would provide enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of 500, 000 homes per year.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{exposure}} to hand-arm vibration in tiller users, Forty users of tiller in northeastern provinces of Iran were examined to measure hand-arm vibration parameters such as root mean square acceleration (RMS), total equivalent acceleration, Vibration Dose Value (VDV) and crest factor in three directions (x, y, and z) and various operating modes for comparing them with the <b>relevant</b> <b>permitted</b> standard levels. The hand-arm vibration measurement was done according to the standards ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2. The obtained results indicated that the exposure level in three modes of rota-tilling, transportation and idling were equal to 16. 95, 14. 16 and 8. 65 m/s 2, respectively. In all measurement modes, the exposure to vibration in the direction x was greater than that of y and z. Moreover, the average crest factor was calculated less than six. The highest vibration dose values were measured in rota-tilling mode when the tiller was in 2 nd  gear (60. 76 m/s 1. 75) and 1 st gear (56. 83 m/s 1. 75). The results indicated that the permitted working time was only few seconds and there was a risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The present study emphasizes on the need for interventional and control managerial measures to eliminate or reduce hand-arm vibration transmitted to the tiller users' hands for avoiding major problems such as musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and  premature fatigue. In this regard, further studies are required to identify vibration sources in different types of tillers. </p...|$|R

As such links are primarily generated from queries made of a few general keywords that do not emphasize named entities, they point to Web pages containing additional information rather than to Web pages dealing with the same story.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} role of {{research}} and development (R&D) spillovers on the incentives to link emissions trading schemes (ETSs) under different timings with respect to the determination of the emissions reduction target (ERT) and to the linking decision. When countries decide upon linking their ETSs prior to setting their ERTs, the permit importing country may not consent to link in the absence of R&D spillovers. The reason is that the other country strategically decreases its ERT to increase its revenues from permit trading, thereby increasing the costs for the permit importing country. However, in the presence of R&D spillovers, the permit importing country benefits from higher R&D spillovers and from lower environmental damage under linking relative to autarky and is therefore willing to link. When countries determine their ERTs prior to the linking decision, {{the role of}} R&D spillovers on the linking decision reverses. In the absence of R&D spillovers, both countries unambiguously are willing to link their ETSs due to the efficiency gains from trade. However, if R&D spillovers are <b>relevant,</b> the <b>permit</b> exporting country may be worse off under linking because its R&D spillovers deteriorate due to lower abatement effort by the other country. Hence, there is a trade-off between the efficiency gains from trade and the reduced R&D spillovers, causing the permit exporting country to reject linking if the spillover effect is sufficiently large...|$|R

40|$|Techniques which {{estimate}} {{the rate of}} aqueous flow generally {{require the use of}} tracer substances. Determination of the distribution of the tracer in the <b>relevant</b> body compartments <b>permits</b> calculation of the rate of flow within the limits of accuracy of the method used. The underlying theory, as well as the advantages and limitations of methods employing systemic, topical, intracameral, and intravitreal administration of tracer substances are reviewed. Since these methods all assume that the rate of aqueous secretion is constant, yet the presence of a diurnal rhythm of flow has been demonstrated in both rabbits and humans, a compartmental model of a circadian system based upon the vitreous depot technique is presented. This model estimates {{the degree to which a}} continuously changing rate of aqueous flow limits the ability to determine aqueous flow rate accurately by this particular method and illustrates this limitation, which is common to all tracer methods. The ability to {{estimate the}} rate at which aqueous humor is secreted by the ciliary epithelium has been a necessary tool in gaining knowledge about ocular physiology and has been important in the development of effective agents in the treatment of glaucoma. Techniques which estimate the rate of aqueous flow generally require the use of tracer substances.
