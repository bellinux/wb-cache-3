40|$|The {{oxidative}} folding {{of proteins}} consists of conformational folding and disulfide-bond reactions. These two processes are coupled significantly in folding-coupled <b>regeneration</b> <b>steps,</b> {{in which a}} single chemical reaction (the "forward" reaction) converts a conformationally unstable precursor species into a conformationally stable, disulfide-protected successor species. Two limiting-case mechanisms for folding-coupled <b>regeneration</b> <b>steps</b> are described. In the folded-precursor mechanism, the precursor species is preferentially folded {{at the moment of}} the forward reaction. The (transient) native structure increases the effective concentrations of the reactive thiol and disulfide groups, thus favoring the forward reaction. By contrast, in the quasi-stochastic mechanism, the forward reaction occurs quasi-stochastically in an unfolded precursor; i. e., reactive groups encounter each other with a probability determined primarily by loop entropy, albeit modified by conformational biases in the unfolded state. The resulting successor species is initially unfolded, and its folding competes with backward chemical reactions to the unfolded precursors. The folded-precursor and quasi-stochastic mechanisms may be distinguished experimentally by the dependence of their kinetics on factors affecting the rates of thiol [...] disulfide exchange and conformational (un) folding. Experimental data and structural and biochemical arguments suggest that the quasi-stochastic mechanism is more plausible than the folded-precursor mechanism for most proteins...|$|R

An aqueous ammonia-based solution captures CO{sub 2 } from simulated flue gas in an absorber and releases a nearly pure stream of CO{sub 2 } in the regenerator. After the regeneration, the solution of ammonium compounds is recycled to the absorber. The design of a continuous flow unit was based on earlier exploratory results from a semi-batch reactor, where a CO{sub 2 } and N{sub 2 } simulated flue gas mixture flowed through a well-mixed batch of ammonia-based solution. During the semi-batch tests, the solution was cycled between absorption and <b>regeneration</b> <b>steps</b> to measure the carrying capacity of the solution at various initial ammonia concentrations and temperatures.
