The roof was reinforced with large timber joints, and could have supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city. Getting the bombards onto the roof may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399.|$|E
5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others {{did the same with}} a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative.|$|E

5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
25|$|The 13th century also {{witnessed}} the Crown of Aragon, centred in Spain's north east, expand its <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> {{islands in the}} Mediterranean, to Sicily and even Athens. Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established. The Black Death of 1348 and 1349 devastated Spain.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{extensive}} <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and its {{intensive use}} by the local urban population, the Mumbai Suburban Railway suffers {{from some of the}} most severe overcrowding in the world. Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 9-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of 1,700. This has resulted in what is known as Super-Dense Crush Load of 14 to 16 standing passengers per square metre of floor space.|$|E

As with the United States, the block airs in Canada, Australia, Russia, Brazil {{and the rest}} of Latin America. Other Cartoon Network markets choose not to air it due to local market conditions, licensing programs to other broadcasters or government content restrictions or regulations – such as Ofcom in the United Kingdom. In those markets, where regulation issues arise, the block is licensed to other networks or television stations instead.|$|E
25|$|While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires {{competed with}} one another for power and prestige, Mesoamerica {{can be said to}} have had five major civilizations: the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Mexica and the Maya. These civilizations (with the {{exception}} of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> Mesoamerica—and beyond—like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these civilizations over the span of 4,000 years. Many made war with them, but almost all peoples found themselves within one of their spheres of influence.|$|E
25|$|Weaving is the {{technique}} of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to {{move up and down}} a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand to pick up the next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> his or her body for the next bell.|$|E

500|$|Innis was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, entitled The Penetrative Powers of the Price System, must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement. The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which [...] "threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication". Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.|$|E

He has served in the Legislative Yuan since 1976 and as the President of the Legislative Yuan since 1999. As President of the Legislative Yuan, he was seen as being a conciliatory leader, avoiding the heated rhetoric to <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> the political divide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{movement}} in Nazi Germany did <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> enemy lines during the Second World War, as anti-smoking groups quickly lost popular support. By {{the end of}} the Second World War, American cigarette manufacturers quickly reentered the German black market. Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent, and leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were assassinated. As part of the Marshall Plan, the United States shipped free tobacco to Germany; with 24,000 tons in 1948 and 69,000tons in 1949. Per capita yearly cigarette consumption in post-war Germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, anti-smoking campaigns in Germany were unable to exceed the effectiveness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939–41 and German tobacco health research was described by Robert N. Proctor as [...] "muted".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, the University of South Carolina {{expanded}} its <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> {{the state by}} establishing branch campuses {{under the auspices of}} the University of South Carolina System. [...] Clemson, having obtained university status in 1964, established a branch campus in Sumter and formed a two-year transfer partnership with Greenville Technical College. [...] House Speaker Sol Blatt was alarmed by the spread of Clemson and declared that South Carolina [...] "should build as many two-year colleges over the state as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people." [...] Accordingly, the University of South Carolina began a new wave of expansion across the state and was aided by the fact that the Clemson Sumter extension suffered from low enrollment. In 1973, Sumter officials negotiated an agreement between USC and Clemson for the school to join the USC branch system.|$|E

2500|$|This, and {{his support}} of British Israelism, has often led people to {{consider}} him as a racist; however, some have noted that Parham {{was the first to}} <b>reach</b> <b>across</b> racial lines to African Americans and Mexican Americans and included them in the young Pentecostal movement. He preached in black churches and invited Lucy Farrow, the black woman whom he had sent to Los Angeles, to preach at the Houston [...] "Apostolic Faith Movement" [...] Camp Meeting, at which he and W. Fay Carrothers were in charge, in August, 1906, as eyewitness Howard A. Goss recounts in his wife's book, The Winds of God, [...] "Fresh from the revival in Los Angeles, Sister Lucy Farrow returned to attend this Camp Meeting. [...] Although a Negro, she was received as a messenger from the Lord to us, even in the deep south of Texas." [...] In the context of the early 20th century, Parham's views on race reflected those of his time, but he was willing at times to defy those social mores when it was not a popular thing to do.|$|E
