50|$|The {{building}} comprises seven sections, each containing {{seven or}} eight stalls, making a total of 52. Each section forms a major space or room in the building and is bounded by <b>radial</b> <b>brick</b> fire walls, by faceted inner and outer walls, by a concrete floor with rails and pits and covered by a trussed roof. Each locomotive stall forms a shed for a single engine. Storage roads radiate from a central point.|$|E
50|$|Distinguished by {{a towering}} 180-foot-high <b>radial</b> <b>brick</b> smokestack, the university's Central Steam Power Plant generates an annual steam output greater than 943 billion BTUs and {{provides}} campus buildings with {{a portion of}} their heat, hot water, and electricity needs. Nearly 90 percent of campus buildings are connected to the plant through an extensive network of underground tunnels—the main access point is on the Drillfield—and more than 6 mi of steam lines and piping provide heat to more than 6.8 million square feet of campus buildings. Only personnel with confined-space training are permitted to enter the tunnel system, comprising 2.76 mi of inaccessible tunnel and 11.07 mi of piping; 3.78 mi of direct-bury piping in the ground; and 2.2 mi of accessible tunnel and 12.27 mi of piping.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{sections}} to the building, counting the clock tower. The two-story main block {{has a low}} hip roof with the clock tower rising from the southeast corner. Two wings with a tiled hip roof project from {{either side of the}} main block. All are of brick laid in common bond on a granite foundation; at the roofline is a roll molding of terra cotta.On the east (front) facade of the main block are three two-story round-arched window openings, filled in near the top where a new floor was later added. They are outlined in terra cotta in a stylized vine pattern, bordered by pearl, egg-and-dart and anthemion molding. Spacing them are four round medallions made of two rings of raised <b>radial</b> <b>brick</b> and a raised ring of fasces molding. Above is a course of terra cotta round-arched corbel table topped by egg-and-dart, a frieze with cherubs and projecting leaf molding. The level above has a series of small rectangular windows, three above each arch and one above each medallion. At the roofline is a cornice similar to the one below but more intricate, with carved modillions, a fluted frieze and wide carved cyma molding. The west facade is similar, although smaller windows and awnings have been added.|$|E
50|$|For their renowned {{draining}} system, Lothal engineers provided corbelled roofs, and {{an apron}} of kiln-fired bricks over the brick {{face of the}} platform where the sewerage entered the cesspool. Wooden screens inserted in grooves in the side drain walls held back solid waste. The well is built of <b>radial</b> <b>bricks,</b> 2.4 m in diameter and 6.7 m deep. It had an immaculate network of underground drains, silting chambers and cesspools, and inspection chambers for solid waste. The extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets, organisation of housing and baths. On average, the main sewer is 20 - 46 cm in depth, with outer dimensions of 86 × 68 × 33 cm (34 × 27 × 13 in). Lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks, designed with care in regards to thickness of structures. They were used as headers and stretchers in same and alternate layers. Archaeologists estimate that in most cases, the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides, in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of Lothal scale of 25 mm.|$|R
25|$|At the Timurid {{capital of}} Samarkand, nobles and rulers in the 14th and 15th centuries began {{building}} tombs with double-shelled domes containing cylindrical masonry drums between the shells. In the Gur-e Amir, built by Timur around 1404, a timber framework {{on the inner}} dome supports the outer, bulbous dome. Radial tie-bars {{at the base of}} the bulbous dome provide additional structural support. Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by iron cramps were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums. <b>Radial</b> sections of <b>brick</b> walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century.|$|R
