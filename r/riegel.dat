5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry <b>Riegel</b> and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E

[...] Lom ultimately caught up with <b>Riegels</b> at Cal's own six-inch line. The play was described at the time as follows:"Down the field raced <b>Riegels,</b> the white lines passing beneath his feet, his mind concentrated upon outrunning the Georgia Tech team. Lom gradually overtook him. Once it looked as if Lom were going to make a flying tackle of his teammate, as he was within diving distance, but he evidently expected to turn <b>Riegels</b> around. Not until <b>Riegels</b> reached the 1-foot mark did Lom overtake him. Lom then pulled <b>Riegels</b> by the shoulders and motioned toward the opposite goal. <b>Riegels</b> stopped, and at that instant two Georgia Tech players tackled him and threw him over the goal-line. The referee called the ball down at the place where <b>Riegels</b> had been stopped by his teammate."Recovering the ball inside their own one-yard line, the Cal Bears opted to punt on first down.

[...] <b>Riegels</b> was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. <b>Riegels</b> once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me.
