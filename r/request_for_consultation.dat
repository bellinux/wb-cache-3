40|$|Background: Consultation {{of experts}} in the {{internal}} medicine or surgery subspecialties is needed in the hospitalized population according to decisions of the house staff. Sometimes the referrals are not justified, consuming time and money without {{a significant change in}} the patient outcome. Objectives: The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate justification of consecutive referrals of hospitalized patients for gastroenterology consultation. Materials and Methods: <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation</b> was deemed not justified when {{at least one of the}} following parameters was found: No contribution to case management, discharge before consultation, cancellation at the last minute, and a recommendation for ambulatory management or surgery. Results: In August-September 2006, there were 232 requests for gastroenterology consultations. Of them 127 (54. 7 &#x 0025;) were men. The average age was 64. 13 &# 177; 20. 33 years. Ninety-four (40. 2 &#x 0025;) of the cases had been hospitalized because of other reasons than the consultation issue. Consultation was not justified in 60 patients (25. 9 &#x 0025;). Ambulatory management was a possibility in 151 cases (65. 0 &#x 0025;).

40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the analysis of}} the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation</b> of information and data on industrial emissions made publicly available on the web site of the Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea on integrated pollution prevention and control from large industrial installations, the so called “AIA Portal”. As a matter of fact, a huge amount of information on national industrial plants is already available on internet, although it is usually proposed as textual documentation or images. Thus, {{it is not possible to}} access all the relevant information through interoperability systems and also to retrieval relevant information for decision making purposes as well as rising of awareness on environmental issue. Moreover, since in Italy the number of institutional and private subjects involved in the management of the public information on industrial emissions is substantial, the access to the information is provided on internet web sites according to different criteria; thus, at present it is not structurally homogeneous and comparable. To overcome the mentioned difficulties in the case of the Coordinating Committee for the implementation of the Agreement for the industrial area in Taranto and Statte, operating before the IPPC permit granting procedures of the relevant installation located in the area, a big effort was devoted to elaborate and to validate data and information on characterization of soil, ground water aquifer and coastal sea at disposal of different subjects to derive a global perspective for decision making purposes.

AimTo make care access easier for heavy disabilities patients in nursing homes or at home with chronic wounds. MethodThe members of TLM Pl@ies chronic team are specialist doctors and nurses for wounds. On request, the occupational therapist or dietician involve in the consultation (multidisciplinary approach). A secure videoconference (web) is used. ResultsSince July 2014, over 100 teleconsultations have been done. Targeted population is constituted by patients:– whose access to care is decreased due to moving difficulties;– of which the health care team is crossing difficulties in the care process (wound care but also disability, nutrition [...] ). Seventy percent of requests come from the nursing home, 30 % from homes (pressure ulcers stages 3 and 4, arterial ulcers, venous or mixed). Middle age: 78 years (20 – 101 years). Only 3 patients refused. Time to organize the teleconsultation is on average 13 days. Consultations last on average 25  minutes. In 30 % of cases the teleconsultation is extended by a real live training time for the nurse at home guided by the TLM Pl@ies chroniques team. We evaluate professional satisfaction and technical satisfaction.

40|$|GOALS OF WORK: Professional care {{providers}} need a substantial basis {{of competence and}} expertise to provide appropriate palliative care. Little {{is known about the}} problems professionals experience in their palliative care provision in daily practice or {{about the nature of the}} advice and support they request from experts. Our aim was to investigate the extent to which professionals requested assistance from palliative care consultation teams and the reasons behind these requests to trace any gaps they experience in the provision of palliative care. METHODS: As part of a large national palliative care development programme, we studied <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation</b> made by professional {{care providers}} over a 2 -year period. The <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation</b> were recorded on a specially developed standard registration form and classified according to 11 domains relevant to palliative care. MAIN RESULTS: Professional care providers requested 4351 consultations on account of 8413 specific problems in 11 quality-of-life and quality-of-care domains. The distribution of problems over these domains was unbalanced: 42. 2 % of the specific problems were physical, while the percentages of psychological, pharmacological and organizational problems were 7. 7, 12. 5 and 12. 8 %, respectively. In contrast, issues of a spiritual nature or concerned with daily functioning were raised infrequently (1. 1 and 0. 9 %). Details of the specific problems in all the domains are described in the text and tables.

Setting {{and participants}} Randomly selected physicians throughout the United States who practice in internal medicine, oncology, and critical care. Main measurements Sociodemographic characteristics, training {{in medicine and}} ethics, and practice characteristics; types of ethical problems that prompt <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation,</b> and factors triggering consultation requests. Results Of 344 responding physicians, 190 (55. 2 %) reported requesting ethics consultations. Most commonly these were for ethical dilemmas related to end-of-life decision making, patient autonomy issues, and conflict. The most common triggers that led to consultation requests were wanting help resolving a conflict; wanting assistance with interactions with a difficult family, patient, or surrogate; wanting help with making a decision or planning care; and emotional triggers. Physicians who were ethnically in the minority, practiced in communities under 500, 000 population, or who were trained in the United States {{were more likely to}} request consultations to resolve conflict. Conclusions Conflicts and other emotionally charged concerns more commonly trigger consultation requests than other cognitively based concerns. When consulting, ethicists need to be prepared to mediate conflicts and handle sometimes difficult emotional situations. The data suggest that ethics consultants might serve clinicians well by consulting on a more proactive basis to avoid conflicts and by educating clinicians to develop mediation skills...|$|R

40|$|Mental health nursing {{roles in}} Consultation-Liaison (CL {{psychiatry}} and emergency departments are rapidly developing within Australia since the mainstreaming {{of mental health}} services within the general health-care system. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these positions have been initiated and developed in relative isolation and with little formalized support. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of these roles and the nurses who occupy them is limited. A survey was developed and distributed to gather information on CL nurses in Australia. The survey was aimed at CL nurses working in a range of settings and included questions relating to demographics, qualifications, experience, clinical practice, organizational structure, education, clinical supervision, education and training and work satisfaction. This, the first of a two-part paper, will present the key findings relating to demographics and characteristics of the role.

This paper evaluates {{the implementation of a}} stepped care programme for depression in primary care and secondary care. Theory and methods: We developed a stepped care algorithm for diagnostics and treatment of depression, supported by a liaison-consultation function. In a 2 ½ year study with pre-post design in a pilot region, adherence to the protocol was assessed by interviewing 28 caregivers of 235 patients with mild, moderate, or severe major depression. Consultation and referral patterns between primary and secondary care were analysed. Results: Adherence of general practitioners and consultant caregivers to the stepped care protocol proved to be 96 %. The percentage of patients referred for depression to secondary care decreased significantly from 26 % to 21 % (p= 0. 0180). In the post-period more patients received treatment in primary care and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation</b> became more concordant with the stepped care protocol. Conclusions: Implementation of a stepped care programme is feasible in a primary and secondary care setting and is associated with less referrals.

Design: Prospective collection of data on hospital epidemiology consultations over a 3 -year period (1995 - 1997). Time spent per consultation and activities of infection control practitioners were not recorded. Setting: A 1, 040 -bed tertiary-care university hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. Results: Between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, the HE received 1, 660 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation.</b> Advice or action was sought in the following areas: epidemiology (27. 5 % of requests); quality assurance, including antibiotic utilization and technology assessment (24. 8 %); infection control and practice guidelines (22. 5 %); disinfection and sterilization (11. 6 %); clinical infectious diseases (13. 4 %). During 1997, 35 % of epidemiology consults were related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 5. 8 % to tuberculosis. Public or private hospitals not affiliated with UHZ requested 40 % of all consults. Conclusions: This study shows that HEs are involved in many different activities. Only 27. 5 % of hospital epidemiology consultations were directly related to issues of epidemiology. Practical knowledge of the methodologies for continuous quality improvement and assessment of various new technologies is important for HEs.

40|$|Diagnostic reports {{prepared}} by a university clinic {{for children with}} learning disabilities were evaluated by the teachers of these children. Sixty-one percent felt the findings were appli-cable to instruction in the classroom. Thirty-nine percent rated the reports not pertinent to the child's educational program Emphasis on educational deficits enhanced the usefulness of the reports. The responses were analyzed, and recommendations for improving the effective-ness of diagnostic reporting were proposed. A child with learning disabilities is identified and differentiated from other children by the many contradictions he exhibits in his behavior. This child is most frequently described as one whose learning pattern shows discrepancies. The discrepancies may be between his cognitive ability., as measured by intelligence tests, and his school performance. Or they may be be-tween any of several areas of functioning: motor, behavioral, perceptual, or academic. A definition of learning disabilities formu-lated by Task Force II describes these children. (Bateman and Schiefelbush, in press) : Children with learning disabilities are those (1) who have educationally significant dis-crepancies among their sensory-motor, per-ceptual, cognitive, academic, or related developmental levels which interfere with the performance of educational tasks; (2) {{who may or may not}} show demonstrable deviation in central nervous system func-tioning; and (3) whose disabilities are not secondary to general mental retardation, sensory deprivation or serious emotional disturbance.

RESULTS [...] Use of the domiciliary consultation service in the Northern region declined by 53 % between 1984 - 5 and 1988 - 9, considerably in excess of the national rate of decline of 27 %, and expenditure on the service was reduced, after allowing for inflation, by 604, 000 pounds, or 38 %, in real terms. Most consultants and general practitioners used the service sparingly whereas a small proportion used it heavily; a few specific consultants and general practitioners were responsible for a relatively high rate of domiciliary consultations. Contrary to the original definition of domiciliary consultation, the general practitioner accompanied the consultant on only one occasion in 17 and, in one specialty examined (paediatrics) patients who received domiciliary consultations seemed to have minor medical problems. CONCLUSIONS [...] Peer review examination of the pattern of practice in the domiciliary consultation service proved effective in rationalising use of the service, although a substantial minority of consultants and general practitioners continued to use the service heavily. The place of the service in modern clinical practice would benefit from a national review...|$|R
40|$|One hundred ten litigants {{who were}} suing for {{emotional}} damages were {{assessed by the}} author for medical-legal reasons. Most of the plaintiffs were involved in motor vehicle accidents and suffered from "whiplash " injuries. Semi-structured interviews were used to reach criteria based on DSM-Ill-R diagnoses. <b>Requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultation,</b> on average, came 25 months after the patient's accident. Approximately 70 percent of patients had evidence for continuing physical injuries {{to account for the}} physical and emotional symptoms. The most common DSM-Ill-R diagnoses were psychiatric condition affecting physical illness (N = 56), major depression (N = 27), and somatoform disorder (N = 12). Alternative diagnoses relating the effect of the accident on the patient's life included: emotional reaction to physical condition (N = 29), difficulty coping with developmental tasks (N = 20), severe depression (N = 20), aggravation of normal premorbid personality (N = 18), aggravation of abnormal premorbid personality (N = 14), phobia (N = 7), no permanent effect (N = 12), and independent illness (N = 2). Severe emotional problems and disability are common among litigants. The causes of their suffering are more complex and less poorly understood than is assumed from the pejorative labels that are sometimes applied. Lawyers and the courts need the help of psychiatrists to understand this suffering. Empirical data such as these may lead to better classification systems and improve our understanding and treatment of these patients. Lawyers frequently ask psychiatrists to assess clients to report on the emotional and psychiatrist consequences of a trau-matic injury that is leading to a litigation claim. This can occur when the client believes that (s) he has suffered a physical or emotional injury due to someone else's unintentional negligence or fault...|$|R
5000|$|Bird was vain, with a {{tendency}} to self-promotion, and his driving ambition occasionally led him into conflict with others. He {{was involved in a}} number of very public disputes in contemporary medical journals, including the dispute with the Pulvermacher Company and a dispute over the development of the stethoscope. However, he was said to give his patients his undivided attention and a complete commitment to their welfare. He was a fine speaker, a good lecturer and an eloquent debater.Diagnosed with heart disease by his brother in 1848 or 1849, Bird was forced to stop work. By 1850, however, he was again working as hard as ever and had extended his practice so much that he needed to move to a larger house in Russell Square. But in 1851, acute rheumatism led Bird to take an extended holiday with his wife in Tenby, where he pursued investigations in botany, marine fauna and cave life as pastimes. These long summer breaks were repeated in 1852 and 1853 at Torquay and Tenby. Even on holiday, his fame caused him to receive many <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>consultations.</b> In 1853, he purchased an estate, St Cuthbert, for his retirement in Tunbridge Wells, but it needed some work, and he could not leave London until June 1854. Meanwhile, he continued to see patients, but only in his house, despite seriously deteriorating health. He died on 27 October 1854 at St Cuthbert from a urinary tract infection and suffering from kidney stones. His early death at 39 may have been due to a combination of lifelong frail health and overwork, which Bird himself knew to be destroying him. [...] He is buried in Woodbury Park Cemetery, Tunbridge Wells.|$|R
