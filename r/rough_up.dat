5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> their crews. Learning from these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{tampering}} {{has always}} been a feature of the sport.

This sort of ball tampering is against the spirit of the game and {{has always been}} against the rules. Despite this, it has always gone on with limited sanction, and {{it can be difficult to}} spot.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} the ball affects {{deliveries}} for a batsman. Even a new cricket ball is not perfectly spherical, but in two parts stitched {{together to form a}} seam. How a ball moves depends in part on how much air resistance there is to different parts of the ball, and therefore to what degree the ball has deteriorated. A cricket team will normally seek, for example, to polish one side of the ball and <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> the other side. The resulting variation in air resistance on the ball can have a marked effect.|$|E
500|$|Billboard magazine's Jason Lipshutz {{described}} {{that the}} record [...] "succeeds in mixing its safer stylistic choices with its relatively bold ideas". BBC Music's Matthew Horton {{said that the}} captivating album showcases the singer's knack for songs with chart potential, while noting the incorporation of rock and soul styles. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe felt Mars [...] "is trying to <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> his image a bit" [...] as it is undeniable in [...] "his strong, if sometimes oddly lyrically aggressive, second album". Ryan Reed, writing in Paste, gave Unorthodox Jukebox a 7/10 rating, confessing that [...] "Mars still plays the sweetheart card well, but he's proven himself way more interesting as a badass".|$|E
500|$|Mount Cleveland is [...] wide at {{its base}} and roughly [...] in volume. The volcano's slope {{increases}} markedly with height, from 19° at its lower flanks to 35° near its summit. Like many other Aleutian volcanoes, Cleveland's flanks are especially <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> to , covered by multiple overlapping lava flows and debris fans that form an apron around the mountain. Lava flows are always built on top of debris flows {{as a result of}} the snow melt caused by the emission of heat just before an eruption. The flows are generally short, under , and thin, less than [...] thick, and are somewhat vegetated. Although Mount Cleveland is the tallest mountain in the group, it is rarely completely snowed in because of its constant activity disrupts snowfall. A lack of extant erosion shows that Mount Cleveland is likely a Holocene volcano, forming within the last 10,000 years. All known events have occurred at Mount Cleveland's summit vent, but there are at least five small andesite to dacite volcanic domes on the lower flanks. At times Cleveland has had a summit lava dome. The volcano has no caldera.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1985, the tag team of Arn Anderson and Ole Anderson began aiding Flair (whom {{they claimed}} as a [...] "cousin") in attacks against Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and Sam Houston. A few weeks later, the Andersons {{interrupted}} Houston's match against Tully Blanchard {{and the three}} villains combined to <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> the youngster. Shortly thereafter, Flair, Blanchard and the Andersons formalized their alliance, calling themselves The Four Horsemen, with Blanchard's manager J.J. Dillon also coming on board.

2500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics, {{based on an}} aggregate score of 68/100 from Metacritic. Allmusic writer David Jeffries gave it 3 out of 5 stars and viewed it as a [...] "porno-style album", stating [...] "Limited and a little patched together, but if cheap thrills are what you’re after, this one puts the dirty back in dirty south". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin viewed its [...] "R heavy" [...] material as a weakness, but gave the album a B+ rating and praised Ludacris's lyricism, writing [...] "Ludacris remains an underrated lyricist with unparalleled verbal dexterity. His liquid flow crams {{an awful lot of}} polysyllabic words into even the tawdriest sex jam, and no rapper alive conveys joy as effortlessly or infectiously". Giving it 2½ out of 4 stars, Los Angeles Times critic August Brown called Battle of the Sexes [...] "another welcome occasion to listen to Luda enjoying the real love of his life -- the sound of his own voice", and described its music as [...] "fizzy pillow talk and respectfully tawdry club fodder". Despite viewing Ludacris's lyrics as from the male perspective, USA Todays Elysa Gardner commended him for his humor and wrote that the album is [...] "more appealing, and more artful, when Ludacris directs his crude, breezy rhymes where they're best suited: into unabashed displays of loopy lust and boneheaded bravado". XXL writer Rondell Conway gave Battle of the Sexes an XL rating and shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Luda may not have evened the playing field, but he certainly created an excellent musical forum for the sexes to air out their differences". Newsdays Glenn Gamboa gave the album a B rating and commended Ludacris for his musical balance, writing [...] "Not only does Luda know when a song needs an R crooner or a female voice, he knows when he needs to speed up a flow or <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> a rhyme".|$|E
2500|$|Rookie Phillies pitcher Marty Bystrom {{was sent}} out by manager Dallas Green to face veteran Nolan Ryan. [...] The rookie {{gave up a}} run {{in the first inning}} but then held the Astros at bay until the sixth inning. [...] The Astros lead did not last long as Bob Boone hit a two-out single giving the Phillies the lead in the second. [...] The Astros tied the game in the sixth with an Alan Ashby single that brought home Denny Walling. [...] Houston took a 5 – 2 lead in the seventh, but the Phillies came back in the eighth with a single by Larry Bowa, a ground ball that [...] Ryan was not able to handle thus killing a chance for a double play, then a {{textbook}} but by Greg Gross to load the bases. Ryan had pitch great ball in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh innings striking out six and holding the Phillies to just the two runs they had scored in the second. [...] Now it was Ryan versus Rose. With the count 3–2, Rose fouled on off. [...] Ryan then threw a costly ball four that allowed Bowa to score. [...] Rose had won the battle and Ryan was pulled for Joe Sambito. The Phillies scored on a force at second leaving men on the corners and one out. Ken Forsch was brought in by Astros manager Bill Virdon to face Schmidt. [...] Forsch struck out Schmidt for the second out of the inning. Forsch gave up a single letting another run score to tie the game 55. Manny Trillo the shocked the Astros and their fans when he tripled to left scoring two runs and giving the Phillies a 75 lead. The Astros came back in the eighth to <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> Tug McGraw for four single and two runs that were scored with two-outs. With the game tied 77 the two teams went to extra innings for the fourth straight game. The winner would advance to the World Series. Garry Maddox had the hit of his career when he doubled in Del Unser with one out to give the Phillies an 87 lead. That would be all they needed as the Astros failed to score {{in the bottom of the}} tenth.|$|E

60|$|We had {{for next}} day {{to look forward to}} the longest and hardest ride of the journey in, and {{in order to make it}} and reach a good camping site I got up at three o'clock in the morning to rout {{everybody}} out. It was pitch dark until we kindled fires. Then everybody rustled to such purpose that we were ready to start before dawn, and had to wait a little for light enough to see where we were going. This procedure tickled Romer immensely. I believed he imagined he was in a pioneer caravan. The gray breaking of dawn, the coming of brighter light, the rose and silver of the rising sun, and the riding in its face, with the air so tangy and nipping, were circumstances that inspired me as the adventurous start pleased Romer. The brush and cactus-lined road was <b>rough,</b> <b>up</b> hill and down, with ever increasing indications that it was seldom used. From the tops of high points I could see black foothills, round, cone-shaped, flat-topped, all leading the gaze toward the great yellow and red wall of the mesa, with its fringed borderline, wild and beckoning.|$|E
60|$|The {{energetic}} young Mr. Cashell snorted within, and Shaynor settled {{himself up}} in his chair over which he had thrown a staring red, black, and yellow Austrian jute blanket, rather like a table-cover. I cast about, amid patent medicine pamphlets, for something to read, but finding little, returned to the manufacture of the new drink. The Italian warehouse took down its game and went to bed. Across the street blank shutters flung back the gaslight in cold smears; the dried pavement seemed to <b>rough</b> <b>up</b> in goose-flesh under the scouring of the savage wind, and we could hear, long ere he passed, the policeman flapping his arms to keep himself warm. Within, the flavours of cardamoms and chloric-ether disputed those of the pastilles and a score of drugs and perfume and soap scents. Our electric lights, set low down in the windows before the tunbellied Rosamund jars, flung inward three monstrous daubs of red, blue, and green, that broke into kaleidoscopic lights on the facetted knobs of the drug-drawers, the cut-glass scent flagons, and the bulbs of the sparklet bottles. They flushed the white-tiled floor in gorgeous patches; splashed along the nickel-silver counter-rails, and turned the polished mahogany counter- panels to the likeness of intricate grained marbles--slabs of porphyry and malachite. Mr. Shaynor unlocked a drawer, and ere he began to write, took out a meagre bundle of letters. From my place by the stove, I could see the scalloped edges of the paper with a flaring monogram {{in the corner and}} could even smell the reek of chypre. At each page he turned toward the toilet-water lady of the advertisement and devoured her with over-luminous eyes. He had drawn the Austrian blanket over his shoulders, and among those warring lights he looked more than ever the incarnation of a drugged moth--a tiger-moth as I thought.|$|E
