40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a one-period optimal reinsurance design model with n <b>reinsurers</b> and an insurer. For very general {{preferences of the}} insurer, we obtain that there exists a very intuitive pricing formula for all <b>reinsurers</b> that use a distortion premium principle. The insurer determines its optimal risk that it wants to reinsure via this pricing formula. This risk it wants to reinsure is then shared by the <b>reinsurers</b> via tranching. The optimal ceded loss functions among multiple <b>reinsurers</b> are derived explicitly under the additional assumptions that the insurer’s preferences are given by an inverse-S shaped distortion risk measure and that the <b>reinsurer’s</b> premium principles are some functions of the Conditional Value-at-Risk. We also demonstrate that under some prescribed conditions, it is never optimal for the insurer to cede its risk to more than two <b>reinsurers...</b>|$|R

Our empirical {{results show that}} the overall demand for reinsurance of converting insurers is not statistically different after the conversion. Furthermore, we find that converting insurers decrease the demand for reinsurance from non-affiliated <b>reinsurers,</b> but increase the demand for reinsurance from affiliated <b>reinsurers</b> after the conversion. One possible explanation is that converting insurers may treat reinsurance to affiliated <b>reinsurers</b> as risk retention rather than risk transfer so that they can reduce reinsurance cost. Another interesting finding is that converting insurers increase demand for reinsurance from non-affiliated <b>reinsurers</b> before conversion.

25|$|Reinsurance {{companies}} are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, {{allowing them to}} reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses.

The reinsurance contract may oblige the <b>reinsurer</b> to accept reinsurance of all contracts within the scope (known as [...] "obligatory" [...] reinsurance), or it may allow the insurer to choose which risks it wants to cede, with the <b>reinsurer</b> obliged to accept such risks (known as [...] "facultative-obligatory" [...] or [...] "fac oblig" [...] reinsurance).|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{financial}} cost from the 9/11 attacks fell on <b>reinsurers</b> (that further spread the risk assumed by primary insurers). Unable to accurately model or price terrorism exposures, <b>reinsurers</b> largely withdrew from the market for terrorism coverage. Without reinsurance, primary insurers were then compelled to exclude terrorism. Most state insurance regulators approved terrorism exclusions for use by primary insurers.|$|R
50|$|Pool Re was {{established}} following {{a series of}} terrorist incidents in the early 1990s in London and elsewhere in England related {{to the situation in}} Northern Ireland at that time. The cost of these losses caused insurers and <b>reinsurers</b> to consider ceasing to provide terrorism cover for commercial properties because of the high potential cost of losses and the lack of any reliable method of estimating what the future loss experience might be. Insurers depend on <b>reinsurers</b> for financial protection when very large claims occur and, accordingly, both insurers and <b>reinsurers</b> decided they could no longer provide terrorism cover using traditional methods. A withdrawal of terrorism insurance that left areas of business unprotected would potentially have had serious consequences for the UK economy. It became necessary, therefore, to devise a new mechanism for providing this type of cover, without leaving insurers or <b>reinsurers</b> open to substantial losses for which there was no reliable method of calculating accurate premiums.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{governance}} effect insurance/cedent companies {{can have on}} society, re insurers can indirectly have societal impact as well, due to <b>reinsurer</b> underwriting and claims philosophies imposed on those underlying carriers which affects how the cedents offer coverage in the market.

40|$|Purpose – Using a game-theoretic {{model of}} {{insurance}} markets, Powers and Shubik in 2001 derived a mathematical expression for the optimal number of <b>reinsurers</b> {{for a given}} number of primary insurers. Subsequently in 2005, Powers and Shubik showed analytically that, for large numbers of primary insurers, this expression is effectively a “square-root rule”, i. e. the optimal number of <b>reinsurers</b> in a market is given asymptotically by the square root {{of the total number}} of primary insurers. In this paper, we test the accuracy of the square-root rule empirically. Design/methodology/approach – The numbers of primary insurers and <b>reinsurers</b> existing in a range of 18 - 20 different national insurance markets over a period of 11 years are used. Findings – The empirical results are consistent with the square-root rule. In addition, we find that the number of <b>reinsurers</b> may also be associated with the market's willingness to pay for risk. When the market's perception of risk is high, there is a greater supply of reinsurance to provide capacity to primary insurers. Originality/value – An empirical model is presented that deals explicitly with the number of insurers and <b>reinsurers</b> in a market. This is of value to government policymakers and insurance regulators. Game theory, Insurance, Reinsurance...|$|R

50|$|Many {{reinsurance}} placements are not {{placed with}} a single <b>reinsurer</b> but are shared between a number of reinsurers. For example, a $30,000,000 excess of $20,000,000 layer may be shared by 30 or more reinsurers. The <b>reinsurer</b> who sets the terms (premium and contract conditions) for the reinsurance contract is called the lead reinsurer; the other companies subscribing to the contract are called following reinsurers.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of treaty reinsurance, {{proportional}} and non-proportional, which are detailed below.

40|$|We {{identify}} a new benefit of index or parametric triggers. Asymmetric information between <b>reinsurers</b> on an insurer's risk affects {{competition in the}} reinsurance market: <b>reinsurers</b> are subject to adverse selection, since only high-risk insurers may find it optimal to change <b>reinsurers.</b> The result is high reinsurance premiums and cross-subsidization of high-risk insurers by low-risk insurers. A contract with a parametric or index trigger (such as a catastrophe bond) is insensitive to information asymmetry and therefore alters the equilibrium in the reinsurance market. Provided that basis risk is not too high, the introduction of contracts with parametric or index triggers provides low-risk insurers with an alternative to reinsurance contracts, and therefore leads to less cross-subsidization in the reinsurance market.

40|$|This Article {{makes the}} case for a {{decentralized}} risk management strategy for identifying and defusing future bubble markets. It suggests how the government can enlist private 2 ̆ 2 gatekeeper guarantors 2 ̆ 2 to provide integrated insurance and monitoring roles to complement the government’s management of systemic risks. It proposes the enactment of a federal mandate that systemically significant financial entities (or participants in systemically significant financial sectors) secure private guarantees to cover a percentage of their potential liabilities (above a loss threshold). Gatekeeper guarantors would act as “circuit breakers” of systemic risk by serving as self-interested monitors of risk taking and tying clients’ coverage to ongoing constraints on risk taking. Gatekeeper guarantors would serve as “bailout buffers” by providing financial backing in the event of defaults and thereby mitigating the government’s potential liability exposure. This expansive role would come with government oversight to ensure that gatekeeper guarantors satisfy reserve requirements, so that they can credibly serve as sea walls in the face of future financial tsunamis. This Article will illustrate the potential for decentralized risk management by showing how a mandate for private reinsurance (or its functional equivalent) may reduce systemic risks in the over-the-counter derivatives market. <b>Reinsurers</b> would bear a percentage of derivative participants’ liability, which would incentivize <b>reinsurers</b> to charge premiums reflecting their risk assessments and to monitor and condition clients’ liability exposure. The repeat-player status of <b>reinsurers</b> would position them to force derivatives’ participants to change their risk exposure as market conditions unfold. <b>Reinsurers</b> would have leverage to push insured parties to demand disclosures from counter-parties, thereby heightening transparency and reducing risks for their clients and the market as a whole.
