5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did not face any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more conservative than Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue of his campaign, where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in defense spending during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> win election to a third Senate term, and also the only <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic political machine, and several labor unions.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} the 32nd Governor of Kentucky and was later elected by the state {{legislature}} as a U.S. senator from that state. The first <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> serve as governor of Kentucky, Bradley {{became known as the}} father of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|Warner {{was quite}} moderate, {{especially}} in comparison <b>to</b> most <b>Republican</b> Senators from the South. He {{was among the}} minority of <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> support gun control laws. He voted for the Brady Bill and, in 1999, {{was one of only}} five <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote to close the so-called gun show loophole. In 2004 Warner was one of three <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> sponsor an amendment by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that sought to provide for a 10-year extension of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|R
50|$|Duncan {{was among}} only six <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote against {{funding for the}} Iraq War on May 24, 2007. Duncan voted, along with three other <b>Republicans,</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008 on July 12, 2007.|$|R
5|$|In 1995 he was {{the only}} <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> vote to limit tax cuts to {{individuals}} with incomes of less than one million dollars. He voted against CAFTA.

5|$|Louie Broady Nunn (March 8, 1924– January 29, 2004) was the 52nd {{governor}} of Kentucky. His election in 1967 {{made him the}} first <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> hold that office {{since the end of}} Simeon Willis' term in 1947, and the last to hold the position until the election of Ernie Fletcher in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Since West Virginia {{became a}} state on June 20, 1863, {{it has had}} 34 {{attorneys}} general, of whom 33 men have held the office (the inaugural attorney general, Aquilla B. Caldwell of Ohio County, served two nonconsecutive terms). Caldwell was the first <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> hold the office, and Joseph Sprigg of Hampshire County was the first Democrat. Darrell McGraw, who held the position from 1993–2013, is the longest-serving attorney general and served the most consecutive terms, being elected to the office five times. The current attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, began his term on January 14, 2013 and is the first <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> hold the office in 80 years since Howard B. Lee in 1933 and the first from Jefferson County. Six attorneys general have served as Governor of West Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Case often {{sided with}} Republicans on major tax legislation. He {{was one of}} only 34 Democrats (who sided with 196 <b>Republicans)</b> <b>to</b> support {{reducing}} the estate tax.

5|$|In 1964, Jones' {{political}} career began with his election as a <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> the West Virginia House of Delegates. He {{was the youngest}} person ever elected to that body. In 1966, he {{was chosen as the}} Republican floor leader in the House. In 1968, Jones announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat, despite facing no opposition. Among the factors influencing his decision was his perception of corruption in state politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{was elected}} as a <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district. After serving two terms there and making an {{impression}} as a rising political figure, {{he was elected}} U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986. He {{became one of the}} senators entangled in the Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s, but survived it and was re-elected in 1992 and 1998.|$|E
5|$|In {{the special}} {{election}} held on January 19, 2010, Republican State Senator Scott Brown defeated Democratic State Attorney General Martha Coakley in an upset victory.

5|$|It was a {{long time}} after the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> become governor. The {{following}} 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling for a total of 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating James D. Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M. Rainach in Louisiana ended the once mighty hold of segregation over politics.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1953, Nunn {{declared}} as a Republican {{candidate for}} county judge and was ultimately the only <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> declare. In the Democratic primary, {{one of the}} challengers charged that the incumbent had used his office for personal gain. In {{the wake of the}} investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn, who defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378, becoming the first Republican elected county judge {{in the history of the}} heavily Democratic county.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1946, Vermont Governor Mortimer R. Proctor {{appointed}} Flanders to the U.S. Senate as a <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> {{complete the}} term of Republican Senator Warren Austin. Austin had just been appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman as Ambassador to the United Nations. Flanders's appointment gave him seniority over the freshman Senators who would be elected four days later on November 5. Flanders ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.|$|E
50|$|He {{supports}} {{affirmative action}} and gun control, {{and was one of}} only two <b>Republicans</b> <b>to</b> vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (which prevents firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for crimes committed with their products).

5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, {{although}} the wording of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one <b>Republican)</b> <b>to</b> examine the election results.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{individuals}} have held {{the office of}} governor of Washington since the state's admission to the Union, with Arthur B. Langlie serving non-consecutive terms. Langlie and Daniel J. Evans are the state's only three term governors. Populist Party candidate John Rankin Rogers is the only non-Democratic or Republican nominee to win office. The current governor is Jay Inslee, who took office on January 16, 2013 and was re-elected in 2016; his term will expire on January 13, 2021. The last <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> hold the office was John Spellman in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Democratic {{governor}} Bill Ritter named Marostica, a <b>Republican,</b> <b>to</b> {{the post}} of {{executive director of the}} Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, replacing Don Elliman, who Ritter had tapped as Colorado's chief operating officer. Marostica resigned his House seat to take the position, and handed control of his development company to his partner and son in order to avoid conflicts of interest, Marostica named opening Asian markets to Colorado exports as a priority for his time in the new position, in addition to encouraging new venture capital investment and retaining existing major employers despite the late-2000s recession. Marostica was replaced in the House by small business owner Brian DelGrosso, and on the legislature's Joint Budget Committee by the more conservative Rep. Kent Lambert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought {{essential}} for a <b>Republican</b> <b>to</b> win the White House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.|$|E
