40|$|AbstractWith {{the great}} demand for online courses, {{there is a}} great {{necessity}} to determine the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies of teachers who plan to deliver online courses. Several authors of different countries and many of these scholars emphasis on these <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies in many aspects describe the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies of online instructors. Thus, {{it is important to be}} aware of the studies done abroad to develop or determine the new <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies in Turkish setting. This study aims at gathering the findings and suggestions of these studies and depicting the common <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies.

40|$|ABSTRACT Developments in {{computer-mediated}} communications are {{not only}} providing new opportunities for educators but also changing <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies in learning and teaching environments. Experts agree that teaching online requires different <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies. The literature includes several studies on <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies for online teaching. However, as Le Boterf underlines, <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies largely depend on context. This survey study intends to identify <b>roles,</b> competencies <b>and</b> resources for online teaching in Turkey by asking online mentors of Anadolu University {{what they think about}} the roles they should perform and the competencies and resources they should possess in order to teach online successfully. Results have shown that the participant Turkish online mentors agree on the significance of the assessor, the content expert and process facilitator roles; on the other hand, they indicate lower level of necessity for the material producer <b>and</b> the administrator <b>roles.</b> Results have also revealed lack of design competencies among online mentors. Overall, the study has supported Le Boterf’s claim about importance of context on identification of <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> competencies...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Larkin and Gould’s (1999) {{activity}} theory methodology for defining work-related <b>roles,</b> <b>and</b> Burns’ (1963) analysis of organismic organizational form are merged into {{a model that}} describes associate <b>and</b> leadership <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> relationships in virtual organizations. The effects {{of a lack of}} a shared physical space and face-to-face social interaction, a continual need for learning and collaboration, and the temporalities that characterize <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> relationships in virtual organizations will be explored. This exploration will focus on the challenges that virtual workspace effects have created for two current leaders of virtual organizations. The acquisition and use of leadership power to meet these challenges will be discussed. Gifford and Enyedy’s (1999) {{activity theory}}, as well as interview data from six educators, will be used as a basis for drawing parallels between associate <b>and</b> leadership <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> relationships in virtual organizations and learner <b>and</b> instructor <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> relationships in virtual learning communities. These parallels will be extrapolated into a tentative model for pedagogical leadership in virtual learning environments...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} impact of a {{refresher}} training provided to pediatric nurses on the realization of their <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions in their nursing practices. Materials and Methods: The study was planned as a single-group research with a pretest and posttest, and conducted over the period of June 2012 -January 2014 in the children’s units of all the state hospitals in Northern Cyprus. All nurses (n= 85) working in these units volunteering {{to participate in the study}} were recruited. The refresher training program on the <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions of pediatric nurses was carried out four days a week for two weeks. The mean scores on the pediatric nurses’ implementation of <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions inventory that was administered prior to and following the program were used to assess the realization of the nurses’ <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions. Results: The pediatric nurses’ implementation of their <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions showed a significant improvement following the program. It was determined that the nurse’s age had an impact on the subscale of the <b>role</b> of communicator <b>and</b> cooperator, and that the position of the nurse had an impact on the subscale of the role of counselor. Conclusion: The results indicated that a program of regular and planned refresher training for pediatric nurses increased their awareness about the implementation of their <b>roles</b> <b>and</b> functions and consequently produced the potential of a positive impact on the nursing practice...|$|R

Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E

5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force.

In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) <b>role</b> <b>and</b> redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
