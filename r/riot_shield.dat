50|$|<b>Riot</b> <b>shields</b> are {{lightweight}} {{protection devices}} deployed by police and some military organizations. <b>Riot</b> <b>shields</b> are almost exclusively {{long enough to}} cover an average-sized man {{from the top of}} the head to the knees. Some <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> are designed to be bullet resistant against low-velocity handgun and shotgun ammunition; however, most are not. They are generally intended to be used in riot control, to protect the user from shrapnel, thrown projectiles, and splash from various weapons such as a Molotov cocktail. They can also be used as short-ranged melee weapons to push back rioters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Riot</b> <b>shields</b> {{are used}} in almost every country with a {{standardized}} police force and are produced by many companies. Most <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> are constructed from transparent, high-impact polycarbonate to enable the bearer to see incoming thrown objects, so the shield can quickly be positioned to deflect {{them away from the}} user's body.|$|R

5000|$|Shields for {{protection}} from armed attack are still used by many police forces around the world. These modern shields are usually intended for two broadly distinct purposes. The first type, <b>riot</b> <b>shields,</b> are used for riot control and {{can be made from}} metal or polymers such as polycarbonate Lexan or Makrolon or boPET Mylar or Eyes. These typically offer protection from relatively large and low velocity projectiles, such as rocks and bottles, as well as blows from fists or clubs. Synthetic <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> are normally transparent, allowing full use of the shield without obstructing vision. Similarly, metal <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> often have a small window at eye level for this purpose. These <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> are most commonly used to block and push back crowds when the users stand in a [...] "wall" [...] to block protesters, and to protect against shrapnel, projectiles, molotov cocktails, and during hand-to-hand combat.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{television}} series 'Elementary', a sonic <b>riot</b> <b>shield</b> that vibrates {{at the same}} frequency of lung tissue {{is used in the}} episode [...] "Evidence of Things Not Seen" [...] to disrupt the breathing of the victims murdered {{at the beginning of the}} episode in order to allow the killer to get close to them before shooting them.|$|E
50|$|The Watch's largest Troll officer, Bluejohn is {{a gentle}} and {{retiring}} troll. He {{is so big}} that he is used as the <b>riot</b> <b>shield</b> {{for the rest of}} the Watch officers and he is often used during crowd control. This is because, wherever he is sent, he is the crowd. His name is taken from a type of fluorite found in Derbyshire, England.|$|E

50|$|The tactic {{involves}} {{police officers}} charging at {{a crowd of}} people with batons and in some cases, <b>riot</b> <b>shields.</b> They run at the crowd hitting people with their batons, and in some situations use <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> to push them away. Baton charging is designed to cause pain or fear of pain, in the hope that they would be compelled {{to move away from the}} scene, dispersing the crowd.|$|R

This level of protection allows officers {{to deal with a}} variety of violent situations, including riots, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. Some PSU teams are also dual-trained as first-line responders for CBRN incidents and carry relevant detection kit as well as major incident equipment.|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers will sometimes use the side grip to shoot while holding a <b>riot</b> <b>shield</b> or ballistic shield with their other hand. Because the shield limits {{the field of}} view, lifting and tilting the gun may make the sights more visible under these circumstances. Some shooters with issues of ocular dominance will tilt the gun at a 15 to 45 degree angle {{in order to take}} advantage of their better eye; the gun held in the left hand and the sights aligned to the right eye, for example.|$|E

50|$|The {{player can}} walk, jump, shoot and move behind a column or large furniture, which allows both hiding and dodging {{shots from the}} guards, which can't be {{neutralized}} definitively, only stunned {{for a few seconds}} using the gun or pressing a door against them. They are alerted by sounds or with the Brothers entering their field of vision, and then either hide, call for help or fire against the player.

5000|$|In March 1991, {{the police}} report {{suggested}} additional contributing internal police factors: squeezed overtime budgets {{which led to the}} initial deployment of 2,000 men, insufficient given the number of demonstrators; a lack of <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> (400 [...] "short" [...] <b>riot</b> <b>shields</b> were available); and erratic or poor-quality radio, with a lag of up to five minutes in the computerised switching of radio messages during the evening West End rioting. Prime Minister Thatcher was at a conference of the Conservative Party Council in Cheltenham. The poll tax was the focus of the conference; as coverage of the demonstrations unfolded, speculation developed for the first time about Thatcher's position as leader.|$|R
