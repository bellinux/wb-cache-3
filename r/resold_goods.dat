5000|$|The Godahl Store was {{completed}} in August 1894 and stocked groceries, dry goods, and tools. [...] It bought local produce and <b>resold</b> <b>goods</b> acquired in St. James and La Salle. [...] In 1895 a warehouse was added to store hardware like nails and fencing, and the following year the main building was expanded with an addition wrapping around the north side and rear.|$|E
50|$|The law was {{altered to}} allow such exports {{a few years}} later. Many large {{companies}} have had to make files to track their <b>resold</b> <b>goods</b> to avoid penalty. The charge was for rape kits, finger print imaging kits, finger printing powder kits, and other evidence collecting products, etc. The effects were not sold directly to China, but were resold without the explicit knowledge of Carrington. Paper handling and documentation were handled badly by Carrington. However, under the law this circumstance was not an exception and a guilty plea was submitted.|$|E
25|$|In practice, Muhammad Ali's {{land reform}} {{amounted}} to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn <b>resold</b> Egyptian <b>goods,</b> within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of long staple cotton, a new cash crop. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the corvée, or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.|$|R

They lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{for five years}} and, on because of Edward's health they moved to Woodville, Mississippi in 1854, after her husband was hired {{to work as a}} {{machinist}} of the railroad. The failing health of her husband and the needs of seven children prompted her to find work, and she opened a general store in 1855. She exchanged cotton and other products for supplies, and she <b>resold</b> the <b>goods</b> from her store. She also hired young women to work as army hat milliners at a her factory.|$|R
5000|$|In {{charge of}} {{supplies}} {{such as food}} and drink, clothing, bedding, candles, the purser was originally known as [...] "the clerk of burser." [...] They would usually charge the supplier a 5% commission for making a purchase and it is recorded they charged a considerable markup when they <b>resold</b> the <b>goods</b> to the crew. The purser was not in charge of pay, {{but he had to}} track it closely since the crew had to pay for all their supplies, and it was the purser's job to deduct those expenses from their wages. The purser bought everything (except food and drink) on credit, acting almost as a private merchant. In addition to his official responsibilities, it was customary for the purser to act as a literal private merchant for luxuries such as tobacco and to be the crew's banker.|$|R
5000|$|Juan Fuentes Echeverría was a Spanish {{immigrant}} who settled in Rosario in 1868. Fuentes first {{worked as a}} farmer in the neighboring province of Entre Ríos, and later as a dishwasher in Rosario. Eventually {{he was able to}} buy a horse-driven cart that he used primarily for scrap metal, which he bought and <b>resold</b> for a <b>good</b> profit. He eventually became a landowner, a stockbreeder and {{a major player in the}} agricultural boom of Argentina as a consequence of the high demand for grain in Europe during and after World War I. Immigration to Argentina soon resulted in a shortage of living space, and in the early twenties real estate suddenly became a good business opportunity. Juan Fuentes took advantage of the opportunity, purchasing a lot in the heart of the city's commercial district where he planned to erect the tallest structure in Rosario, a building that would be a reflection of his success.|$|R
