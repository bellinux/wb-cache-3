40|$|Abstract This work {{explored}} a risk-based arsenic (As) <b>regulation</b> <b>in</b> farmed pond {{water by}} ingesting tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in blackfoot disease hyper-endemic areas and discussed a rational As <b>regulation</b> <b>in</b> pond water. Monte Carlo {{analysis was used}} to propagate the parameter uncertainty and to assess probabilistically regulation risks. A dynamic scheme of groundwater man-agement was proposed that curves of utilization ratios against As concentrations in groundwater were established based on the risk-based regulation. The 5 th to 95 th per-centiles of risks range from 3. 5 9 10 - 7 to 6. 0 9 10 - 5 via ingesting the farmed tilapia under the current As <b>regulation</b> <b>in</b> farmed pond water in Taiwan, 50 lg/L. To compare to inorganic As <b>regulation</b> <b>in</b> drinking water, the current As <b>regulation</b> <b>in</b> farmed pond water does not pose a great threat to human health, but it is unsafe. Therefore, this study suggests that the <b>regulation</b> of As <b>in</b> farmed pond water is revised to be 25 lg/L...|$|R

However, {{in the practice of}} state administration, Constitutional Court has tested Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 4 / 2009 and Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 4 / 2008. The problems that will be studied are: First, why did Constitutional Court test the two Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Laws (Perppu) above? Second, what is the legal status of both Laws (Perppu) after being tasted? This study is a juridical study using case approach method. The resources of this study consist of primary and secondary legal materials including legislations and Constitutional Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision concerning the problems being studied. The result of the study can be concluded as follows: First, Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Law (Perppu) can cause the emergence of legal norms since its authorization and its power is ans powerful as law. Because it can generate legitimate norm as Law (UU), Constitutional Court may test whether its material is contrary to 1945 Constitution (UUD 1945). Second, the legal status of Constitutional Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision on the proposal of testing the two Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Law (Perppu) is legitimate because in testing the two Government <b>Regulation</b> <b>in</b> Lieu of Law (Perppu), Constitutional Court has not tested the main case filed by the petitioner as he or she is not eligible in legal standing to file for petition.
