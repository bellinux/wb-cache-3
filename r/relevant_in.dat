5|$|Conflicto y armonías de las razas en América 1883, {{deals with}} race issues in Latin America {{in the late}} 1800s. While {{situations}} in the book remain particular to the time period and location, race issues and conflicts of races are still prevalent and enable the book to be <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> the present day.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may also be <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E

It is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. It makes Annual Reports to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.|$|R

5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of {{bacteria in the}} laboratory is particularly <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by the}} bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.|$|E

5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle {{marks the}} formal {{division between the}} first and second parts of the small intestine, the duodenum and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, which is <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> clinical medicine as it may determine the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} no therapeutic approaches targeting CASS4, {{and in the}} absence of a catalytic domain and no extracellular moieties, it may be challenging to generate such an agent. However, CASS4 may ultimately be <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> clinical practice as a possible marker to assess prognosis and outcome in cases of NSCLC (and possibly other types of cancer). At present, its greatest clinical value is likely to be as a predictive variant for severity and onset of Alzheimer's disease and cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> this usage.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more <b>relevant</b> <b>in</b> Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
