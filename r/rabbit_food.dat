The {{degradation of}} PAHs (initial concentration 1 g of total PAHs kg⁻¹ dry soil) was assessed applying bioaugmentation with the white-rot fungi Trametes versicolor and biostimulation using compost of the source-selected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and <b>rabbit</b> <b>food</b> as organic co-substrates. The process performance during 30 days of incubation was evaluated through different analyses including: dynamic respiration index (DRI), cumulative oxygen consumption during 5 days (AT₅), enzymatic activity, and fungal biomass.

Nine male Landrace 55 -day-old rabbits were sorted into three groups of three rabbits each, which had access to fresh aguamiel, boiled aguamiel and water instead of aguamiel. Commercial <b>rabbit</b> <b>food</b> was supplied ad libitum to each experimental unit. Fresh aguamiel promoted weight increases of about 13 % by the seventh week. Haemoglobin counts increased by 4. 5 % and 9 % when rabbits were fed with fresh and boiled aguamiel, respectively. Haematocrit counts increased from 2. 6 % to 5. 3 %. Mean corpuscular volume did not show a change. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin significantly increased up to 12 % above that previously reported on rabbits. Observed Fe (fixed to transferrin), transferrin and ferritin content increased slightly when fresh aguamiel was included in the diet, as compared to the control. In bone, Fe increased 79. 3 % (boiled aguamiel) while P increased 23. 6 % (fresh aguamiel). In antioxidant activity determination, the aguamiel showed 20 % with respect to that found in coffee and/or grape juice (commercial beverages with a high antioxidant capability), 226. 2 µmol gallic acid equivalent and 35. 1 mg ascorbic acid in 250 mL, respectively.

40|$|Growth for Pistillaria micans was {{greatest}} at 25 ˚C while maximum {{and minimum}} temperatures for vegetative growth were about 30 °and 10 ° respective 1 y. Under slightly anaerobic conditions, the optimum temperature was somewhere between 15 ˚C and 20 ˚C. Changing the photoperiod (continuous dark or alternating light/dark) after 8 days {{did not produce}} changes in growth. Relative humidity {{had little or no}} effect on growth or reproduction. Pistillaria micans was unable to tolerate acidic conditions and growth was favored neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7. 1 - 7. 5). Light was inhibitory to fruit body production and a minimum of 48 hours in continuous darkness was required tor basidiocarp development. Fruit body production was specifically inhibited in the blue region (395 nm). When the blue light region was omitted, (as in red light, in NUV light, and in dark treatments), fruit body production was stimulated in the-near-ultraviolet region (313 nm). Growth occurred when dextrose, fructose, sucrose, galactose, soluble starch, cellulose was the sole carbon source. The best growth occurred when sucrose was the sole carbon source while growth on galactose was significantly poor. No growth occurred when ammonium sulfate or potassium nitrate was the sole nitrogen source, while growth was slight on asparagine and glycine. Casein hydrolysate, urea and peptone were good nitrogen sources. Vegetative growth occurred on the following media: <b>rabbit</b> <b>food</b> agar (RF), corn meal+malt and yeast extract (CMMY), corn meal, oat agar, Hau leaves in agar, V- 8, corn meal+yeast extract + dextrose (CMYD), potato dextrose agar (PDA), Blakeslee's malt extract (ME(Bl.)), and Czapek agar.

40|$|Background: The non-random {{distribution}} of anopheline larvae in natural habitats suggests that gravid females discriminate between habitats of different quality. Whilst {{physical and chemical}} cues used by Culex and Aedes vector mosquitoes for selecting an oviposition site have been extensively studied, those for Anopheles remain poorly explored. Here the habitat selection by Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s. l.), the principal African malaria vector, was investigated when presented {{with a choice of}} two infusions made from <b>rabbit</b> <b>food</b> pellets, or soil. Methods: Natural colonization and larval survival was evaluated in artificial ponds filled randomly with either infusion. Dual-choice, egg-count bioassays evaluated the responses of caged gravid females to (1) two- to six-day old infusions versus lake water; (2) autoclaved versus non-autoclaved soil infusions; and assessed (3) the olfactory memory of gravid females conditioned in pellet infusion as larvae. Results: Wild Anopheles exclusively colonized ponds with soil infusion and avoided those with pellet infusion. When the individual infusions were tested in comparison with lake water, caged An. gambiae sensu stricto (s. s.) showed a dose response: females increasingly avoided the pellet infusion with increasing infusion age (six-day versus lake water: odds ratio (OR) 0. 22; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 1 - 0. 5) and showed increasing preference to lay eggs as soil infusion age increased (six-day versus lake water: OR 2. 1; 95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 3). Larvae survived in soil infusions equally well as in lake water but died in pellet infusions. Anopheles gambiae s. s. preferred to lay eggs in the non-autoclaved soil (OR 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 8 - 3. 7) compared with autoclaved soil. There was no change in the avoidance of pellet infusion by individuals reared in the infusion compared with those reared in lake water. Conclusion: Wild and caged An. gambiae s. l. females discriminate between potential aquatic habitats for oviposition. These choices benefit the survival of the offspring. Although the study was not designed to distinguish between stimuli that acted over a distance or on contact, it could be demonstrated that the choice of habitat is mediated by chemical cues based on both preference and avoidance. These cues, if identified, might be developed for ‘push-pull’ strategies to improve malaria vector monitoring and control...|$|E

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} in Egypt. The exact etiology of the disease is still vague. However, Oxidative modifications of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) have been proposed to play a critical role in atherogenesis. Antioxidants have been proposed, therefore, to have a possible role in protection and/or prevention of atherosclerosis. The pineal gland hormone, melatonin, have been reported as an antioxidant. Recently melatonin has been proposed to interfere with one of the chain of events in the onset of atherosclerosis, that is, the formation of adhesion molecules. To test the role of melatonin in amelioration of atherogenesis, this work was designed to study the atherosclerosis-. related microscopic changes in the aorta of melatonin treated, high cholesterol fed rabbits. Thirty adult male rabbits were used throughout this work. The animals were fed a standard <b>rabbit</b> <b>food</b> free from cholesterol and antioxidants. The rabbits were divided into three groups each of 10 animals: Control (A) group, was raised on the ordinary diet alone for 6 weeks. Atherosclerotic induced, non treated (B) group was raised on the ordinary diet mixed with 1 % cholesterol powder for a period of 6 weeks. Atherosclerotic induced, melatonin treated (C) group was raised on the ordinary diet mixed with 1 % cholesterol powder and drenched 4. 2 mg melatonin dissolved in saline solution daily at night for 6 weeks. The drug was given through naso-gastric tube under light ether anesthesia Paraffin sections of both control and experimental groups were prepared on the same slide. The sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, orcein; or periodic acid Schiff (PAS). The endothelial thickness, relative collagen, elastic fibers, smooth muscle fibers and glycosaminoglycan content in control and experimental groups were evaluated by computerized image analyzer. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out using Microsoft Excel 2000. The results revealed that the melatonin has antiatherosclerotic effects in experimental atherosclerosis in the rabbit aorta. Melatonin significantly reduced specific atherosclerotic lesions like fibrosis, smooth muscle atrophy, and decreased elastic fiber content in thoracic aortic wall. In conclusion, melatonin may be of value in the management of atherosclerosis by reducing its complications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Long-term {{records of}} the number of food {{approaches}} per 30 min were obtained from 16 rabbits in constant light and after blinding. Optic nerve sectioning usually resulted in a shortening of the free-running period (&tau;; mean reduction =- 0. 26 hr) of the oscillator governing the <b>rabbit’s</b> <b>food</b> intake pattern. Subsequent resection of both superior cervical ganglia always reduced this &tau; (mean =- 0. 41 hr), and it could be further shortened (mean =- 0. 24 hr) by chronic administration of melatonin. These observations led to experiments in which the food intake of 15 blinded rabbits was recorded before and after pinealectomy. This always resulted in a lengthening of &tau; (mean = + 0. 27 hr), which was never seen after subtotal or sham pinealectomy in 10 other blinded animals (mean =- 0. 05 hr). Sympathectomy also reduced &tau; (mean =- 0. 50 hr) in the pinealectomized rabbits, whereas it induced a smaller reduction (mean =- 0. 29 hr) after sham pinealectomy. These results, together with previous observations on the effect of sympathectomy on the retinal "dark " discharge and on the influence of the latter upon the food intake pattern, indicate that the cervical sympathetic nerves may form part of three feedback loops for the rabbit’s central circadian system. These have separate postganglionic pathways; there are also differences in the circadian phasing of their activities and in their effects on &tau;.
