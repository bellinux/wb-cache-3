In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E
5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|J Duncan M Derrett, a {{professor}} of Oriental Laws, states that chapter 2.8 of the text discusses three kinds of constitutions and <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> the king should delegate large responsibilities to their ministers, a system that implied that the kingdom was virtually ruled through the ministers. The Manasollasa gives a significant role to an astrologer in the council of advisors to the king who would forecast the auspicious time to respond to an attack, which Hartmut Scharfe, {{a professor}} of Indo-European Studies, states proved disastrous during Muslim and foreign invasion of the Deccan peninsula.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E

5|$|The Mayor of London {{published}} a long-term {{vision for the}} London Overground in February 2012. It <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> all London suburban rail services should eventually be devolved to TfL and that suburban services currently provided by Southeastern be devolved before 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. Southeastern's suburban services include the route between Victoria and Orpington via Herne Hill. TfL had {{announced that it would}} bid in late 2012 to have more involvement in these services after the expiration of Southeastern's franchise in early 2014, but the DfT announced in March 2013 that Southeastern's franchise was being extended until mid-2018.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> both {{adults and}} {{children}} reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries (cavities in the teeth). These recommendations {{were based on the}} totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E

5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González <b>recommends</b> <b>that</b> the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
