50|$|Due to a {{built-in}} time delay the Lerøyosen mines were not active when the German warships passed over them. However {{by the time}} the supply fleet of the German forces in the Bergen area started coming into Lerøyosen late in the evening the mines were ready. The first ship to hit the mines was the 4,297 ton supply ship Sao Paulo, which sank with a great loss of both lives and materiel at 2300hrs, 9 April. As the <b>mine</b> <b>barrier</b> had now been discovered the Kriegsmarine needed to sweep the Lerøyosen but had no dedicated minesweepers in the area. In an improvised reaction to the mines the invaders sent out the naval trawlers Schiff 9 and Cremon, together with two launches from the depot ship Karl Peters.The improvised minesweeper force entered the <b>mine</b> <b>barrier</b> in the evening of 10 April and began clearing the mines. At 1925hrs Schiff 9 struck a mine and went down in between one and two minutes. At 19.30 hours as Cremon tried to rescue survivors she too blew up together with one of the two launches.|$|R

50|$|In March 1917, after Germany {{initiated}} its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, Roosevelt asked Wilson {{for permission}} to fit the naval fleet out for war; the request was denied. He became an enthusiastic advocate of the submarine and of means to combat the German submarine menace to Allied shipping: he proposed building a <b>mine</b> <b>barrier</b> across the North Sea from Norway to Scotland. In 1918, he visited Britain and France to inspect American naval facilities. Roosevelt wanted to provide arms to the merchant marine; knowing that a sale of arms was prohibited, he asked Wilson for approval to lease the arms to the mariners. Wilson ultimately approved this by executive order, and a precedent was set for Roosevelt to take similar action in 1940.|$|R
50|$|Naval mines {{were also}} used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid {{approximately}} 15 km outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated controlled mines were used to create an inner <b>mine</b> <b>barrier</b> to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with 200 m separation between rows and 60 m between mines in a row. Controlled mines required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.|$|R
50|$|In 1942 {{the main}} focus of the war at sea was on the anti-submarine warfare. Finnish and German naval forces tried to prevent Soviet {{submarines}} from gaining access to the Baltic Sea. However, the <b>mine</b> <b>barrier</b> had proven to be insufficient to completely stop Soviet submarines activities. The Soviet subs sank 18 ships, seven of which were Finnish. 12 Soviet submarines were also sunk - three by Finnish submarines. The next step in submarine warfare was to completely block the Gulf of Finland with anti-submarine nets between Naissaar and Porkkala. This was done immediately after the ice cover melted on the sea. That barrier with its accompanying minefields effectively contained Soviet Naval vessels to {{the eastern part of the}} Gulf of Finland until the autumn of 1944, when the Soviets were able to use Finnish coastal seaways to circumvent the barrier.|$|R

To counter this, the German and Finnish navies dropped 2,400 mines, adding to the 600 already in the sea lanes outside Tallinn. German artillery was set up at Juminda peninsula and Finnish and German torpedo boats were put on alert. The Soviet evacuation consisted of 160 ships, which carried 28,000 people (including the Communist leadership and their families, army and navy personnel, and 10,000 Estonians) and 66000 ST of materiel. The evacuation began on the night of 27 August, {{at the same time as}} the first German troops entered the city. During embarkation the ships were under constant attack by German bombers and artillery, which continued as the armada reached the heavily mined Juminda peninsula. At midnight on 28 August the armada ran into the minefields while being attacked by Finnish and German torpedo boats. Casualties were heavy, with 65 of the 160 ships lost, and several more damaged. Of the 28,000 evacuees, 16,000 perished.

The main functions of the naval force are the preparation and organisation of the defence of the territorial waters and coastal line, ensuring the maritime security, communications and sea traffic in the territorial waters and co-operation with NATO and the navies of other friendly countries around. In case of a crisis situation the Merevägi {{must be ready to}} defend sea approaches, harbour areas, sea lines of communication and to co-operate with the coalition units. The Merevägi includes units of patrol ships, minesweepers, a frigate and coast guard units, necessary to ensure the security of maritime communications lines and to establish and clear <b>mine</b> <b>barriers.</b> The majority of the naval forces are situated at the Miinisadam naval base. The current structure operates the Mineships Division which also includes a divers group. In addition there are the Naval Academy, Naval Base at Miinisadam and the Naval Headquarters which are situated in Tallinn. Since 1995 numerous mine clearance operations have been carried out in Estonian waters in close co-operation with other navies of the Baltic Sea region in order to find and dispose ordnance and contribute to safe seagoing. In 2007 the Merevägi mineships fleet was modernized and equipped with the Sandown class minehunters. In 2010, according to the long-term defence development plan, it was announced that the Merevägi will receive some new capabilities. Of those new warfare capabilities the procurement of multirole fast patrol boats will be the priority.
