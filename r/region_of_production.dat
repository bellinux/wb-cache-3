2500|$|At {{least from}} a modern point of view, the Southern Italian red-figure vase {{paintings}} represent the only <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> that reaches Attic standards of artistic quality. After the Attic vases, the South Italian ones (including those from Sicily), {{are the most}} thoroughly researched. In contrastic to their Attic counterparts, they were mostly produced for local markets. Only few pieces have been found outside Southern Italy and Sicily. The first workshops were founded in the mid-5th century BC by Attic potters. Soon, local craftsmen were trained and the thematic and formal dependence on Attic vases overcome. Towards {{the end of the}} century, the distinctive [...] "ornate style" [...] and [...] "plain style" [...] developed in Apulia. Especially the ornate style was adopted by other mainland schools, but without reaching the same quality.|$|E
2500|$|Pu'er {{traditionally}} {{begins as}} a raw product known as [...] "rough" [...] máochá (毛茶) and can be sold in this form or pressed {{into a number of}} shapes and sold as [...] "raw" [...] shēngchá (生茶). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The wòduī (渥堆) fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory :206 [...] created a new type of pu'er tea. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into [...] "ripe" [...] shúchá (熟茶) which is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes. The fermentation process was adopted at the Menghai Tea Factory shortly after and technically developed there. The legitimacy of shúchá is disputed by some traditionalists in contrast to aged teas. All types of pu'er can be stored to mature before consumption, which is why it is commonly labelled with the year and <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} commodity for Oaxaca was cochineal red dye. Cochineal's commodity chain {{is an interesting}} one, with indigenous peasants in the remote areas of Oaxaca ultimately linked to Amsterdam and London commodity exchanges and the European production of luxury cloth. The most extensive scholarly work on Oaxaca's eighteenth-century economy deals with the nexus between the local crown officials (alcaldes mayores), merchant investors (aviadores), the repartimiento (forced labor), and indigenous products, particularly cochineal. The rich, color-fast red dye produced from insects, was harvested from nopal cacti. Cochineal was a high value, low volume product that became the second most valuable Mexican export after silver. Although it could be produced elsewhere in central and southern Mexico, its main <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> was Oaxaca. For the indigenous in Oaxaca, cochineal {{was the only one}} [...] "with which the [...] maintain themselves and pay their debts" [...] but it also had other advantages for them. Producing cochineal was time-consuming labor, but it was not particularly difficult and could be done by the elderly, women, and children. It was also important to households and communities because it initially did not require the indigenous to displace their existing crops or migrate elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Surrey's most {{significant}} source of prosperity in the later Middle Ages was the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> woollen cloth, which emerged during that period as England's main export industry. The county was an early centre of English textile manufacturing, benefiting from the presence of deposits of fuller's earth, the rare mineral composite important {{in the process of}} finishing cloth, around Reigate and Nutfield. The industry in Surrey was focused on Guildford, which gave its name to a variety of cloth, gilforte, which was exported widely across Europe and the Middle East and imitated by manufacturers elsewhere in Europe.

Peru and Ecuador, the countries of origin of this species, showed the greatest diversity, and Spain and Madeira (Portugal) showed the least, probably due to genetics bottlenecks resulting from limited introduction. Cultivars from California showed high values for several genetic diversity measures, likely due to their diverse origins.

5000|$|The {{first few}} coffee plants were {{introduced}} to the country and soils of Laos by French colonists around 1915. After trial and error of trying to harvest coffee beans in the north, the French realized that southern Laos was ideal for plantations. Millions of years ago there was a volcanic eruption in the south, causing the southern soils to contain rich minerals ideal for coffee production. The south is also where the Bolaven Plateau is, which remains as Laos’ primary <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E

40|$|Global {{consumption}} of farming commodities {{is an important}} driver of water demand in <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This {{is the case in}} Brazil, which has {{emerged as one of the}} main producers of globally traded farming commodities. Traditional methods to assess environmental implications of this demand rely on international trade material flows at country resolution; we argue for the need of finer scales that capture spatial heterogeneity in environmental variables in the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and that account for differential sourcing within the borders of a country <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> To illustrate this, we obtain virtual water flows from Brazilian municipalities to countries of consumption, by allocating high-resolution water footprints of sugarcane and soy production to spatially-explicit material trade flows. We found that this approach results in differences of virtual water use estimations of over 20 % when compared to approaches that disregard spatial heterogeneity in sourcing patterns, for three of the main consumers of the analysed crops. This discrepancy against methods using national resolution in trade flows is determined by national heterogeneity in water resources, and differential sourcing. To illustrate the practical implications of this approach, we relate virtual water flows to water stress, identifying where global demand for water coincides with high levels of water stress. For instance, the virtual water flows for Brazilian sugarcane sourced by China were disproportionally less associated to areas with higher water stress when compared to those of the EU, due to EU's much higher reliance on sugarcane from water scarce areas in Northeast Brazil. Our findings indicate that the policy relevance of current assessments of virtual water flows that rely on trade data aggregated at the national level may be hampered, as they do not capture the spatial heterogeneity in water resources, water use and water management options. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

In this paper we attempted to measure the perfor-mance of 21 livestock modal production systems, in their cow-calf phase. We measured the performance of these systems, considering husbandry and production variables. The proposed approach is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). We used unitary input DEA model, with apparent input orientation, together with the efficiency measurements generated by the inverted DEA frontier. We identified five modal pro-duction systems typologies, using the isoefficiency layers approach. The results showed that the knowledge and the processes management are the most important factors for improving the efficiency <b>of</b> beef cattle <b>production</b> systems...|$|R
