25|$|Today, {{students}} at UC Berkeley are {{generally considered to}} be less politically active than their predecessors, and far more liberal than the surrounding city of Berkeley. In a poll conducted in 2005, 51% of Berkeley freshmen considered themselves liberal, 37% considered themselves moderate, and 12% identified as conservative. 43.8% have no religious preference compared to a national average of 17.6%. In 1982, 20.8% identified as conservative, 32.9% identified as liberals, and 46.4% identified as moderate. Although Republicans are in the minority, the Berkeley College <b>Republicans</b> <b>is</b> the largest political organization on campus. Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of nine to one, leading to some conservative student criticism of the faculty for teaching with a liberal bias.|$|E
500|$|Boortz {{criticizes the}} major parties saying [...] "I believe that the {{principal}} difference between the Democrats and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>is</b> that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do." [...] He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make {{up the majority of}} his listeners and callers.|$|E

Baldwin was joined by Bob Barr, Alan Keyes and Tom Tancredo at the [...] "Rally Against Illegal Immigration" [...] during {{the first day of the}} convention. Later in August, Baldwin campaigned in Spartanburg, South Carolina where he criticized both parties' presidential nominees as [...] "globalists". He declared his opposition to the Federal Reserve, which he stated has [...] "subjugated" [...] the nation to [...] "foreign dependence". He railed against the use of the National Guard in the Iraq War remarking that the forces should be used to [...] "repel" [...] the [...] "invasion" [...] of illegal aliens from the southern border, and described the United Nations as [...] "a sinister organization run by Marxists, socialists and communists." [...] Baldwin criticized both major parties for not cutting spending stating that [...] "the only difference between Democrats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>is</b> Democrats want to tax and spend and Republicans want to borrow and spend." [...] He promised that slashing spending would be a priority in his administration.|$|E

2500|$|A central {{argument}} made by Australian <b>republicans</b> <b>is</b> that, as Australia is {{an independent}} country, it is inappropriate for Australia to share the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom. Republicans argue that the Australian monarch is not Australian and, as such, {{a person who is}} a national of another country cannot adequately represent Australia, either to itself or {{to the rest of the}} world. Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan stated that [...] "so long as we retain the existing system our head of state is determined for us essentially by the parliament at Westminster". As Australian Republican Movement member Frank Cassidy put it in a speech on the issue: [...] "In short, we want a resident for President." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 134. You {{think at}} first that this is remarkably like the course of republican reformations in the present day? But {{there is a wide}} difference. In the first place, the palaces and towers are not thrown down in mere spite or desire of ruin, but after quite {{definite}} experience of their danger to the State, and positive dejection of boiling lead and wooden logs from their machicolations upon the heads below. In the second place, nothing is thrown down without complete certainty {{on the part of the}} overthrowers that they are able, and willing, to build as good or better things instead; which, if any like conviction exist in the minds of modern <b>republicans,</b> <b>is</b> a wofully ill- founded one: and lastly, these abolitions of private wealth were coincident with a widely spreading disposition to undertake, as I have above noticed, works of public utility, from which no dividends were to be received by any of the shareholders; and for the execution of which the builders received no commission on the cost, but payment at the rate of so much a day, carefully adjusted to the exertion of real power and intelligence.|$|E
60|$|But this {{is going}} too far, the reader will object! There must be concessions, there must be conformities, just as {{there must be some}} {{impurity}} in the water we drink and flaws in the beauty we give our hearts to, and that, no doubt, is true. It is no reason why we should drink sewage and kneel to grossness and base stupidity. To endure the worst because we cannot have the best is surely the last word of folly. Our business as New <b>Republicans</b> <b>is</b> not to waste our lives in the pursuit of an unattainable chemical purity, but to clear the air as much as possible. Practical ethics is, after all, a quantitative science. In the reality of life there are few absolute cases, and it is foolish to forego a great end for a small concession. But to suffer so much Royalty and Privilege as an Englishman has to do before he may make any effectual figure in public life is not a small concession. By the time you have purchased power you may find you have given up everything that made power worth having. It would be a small concession, I admit, a mere personal self-sacrifice, to pretend loyalty, kneel and kiss hands, assist at Coronation mummeries, {{and all the rest of}} it, in order, let us say, to accomplish some great improvement in the schools of the country, were it not for the fact that all these things must be done in the sight of the young, that you cannot kneel to the King without presenting a kneeling example to the people, without becoming as good a teacher of servility as though you were servile to the marrow. There lies the trouble. By virtue of this reaction it is that the shams and ceremonies we may fancy mere curious survivals, mere kinks and tortuosities, cloaks and accessories to-day, will, if we are silent and acquiescent, be halfway to reality again in the course of a generation. To our children they are not evidently shams; they are powerful working suggestions. Human institutions are things of life, and whatever weed of falsity lies still rooted in the ground has the promise and potency of growth. It will tend perpetually, according to its nature, to recover its old influence over the imagination, the thoughts, and acts of our children.|$|E
6000|$|The {{election}} in November {{turns on the}} single and simple question, Whether we shall consent to the indefinite multiplication of them; and the only party which stands plainly and unequivocally pledged against such a policy, nay, which is not either openly or impliedly in favor of it,--is the Republican party. We are of those who at first regretted that another candidate was not nominated at Chicago; but we confess that we have ceased to regret it, for the magnanimity of Mr. Seward since {{the result of the}} Convention was known has been a greater ornament to him and a greater honor to his party than his election to the Presidency would have been. We should have been pleased with Mr. Seward's nomination, for the very reason we have seen assigned for passing him by,--that he represented the most advanced doctrines of his party. He, more than any other man, combined in himself the moralist's oppugnancy to Slavery as a fact, the thinker's resentment of it as a theory, and the statist's distrust of it as a policy,--thus summing up the three efficient causes that have chiefly aroused and concentrated the antagonism of the Free States. Not a brilliant man, he has that best gift of Nature, which brilliant men commonly lack, of being always able to do his best; and the very misrepresentation of his opinions which was resorted to in order to neutralize the effect of his speeches in the Senate and elsewhere was the best testimony to their power. Safe from the prevailing epidemic of Congressional eloquence {{as if he had been}} inoculated for it early in his career, he addresses himself to the reason, and what he says sticks. It was assumed that his nomination would have embittered the contest and tainted the Republican creed with radicalism; but we doubt it. We cannot think that a party gains by not hitting its hardest, or by sugaring its opinions. Republicanism is not a conspiracy to obtain office under false pretences. It has a definite aim, an earnest purpose, and the unflinching tenacity of profound conviction. It was not called into being by a desire to reform the pecuniary corruptions of the party now in power. Mr. Bell or Mr. Breckinridge would do that, for no one doubts their honor or their honesty. It is not unanimous about the Tariff, about State-Rights, about many other questions of policy. What unites the <b>Republicans</b> <b>is</b> a common faith in the early principles and practice of the Republic, a common persuasion that slavery, as it cannot but be the natural foe of the one, has been the chief debaser of the other, and a common resolve to resist its encroachments everywhen and everywhere. They see no reason to fear that the Constitution, which has shown such pliant tenacity under the warps and twistings of a forty-years' pro-slavery pressure, should be in danger of breaking, if bent backward again gently to its original rectitude of fibre. [...] "All forms of human government," [...] says Machiavelli, [...] "have, like men, their natural term, and those only are long-lived which possess in themselves the power of returning to the principles on which they were originally founded." ...|$|E
