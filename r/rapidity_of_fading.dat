40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we review the most {{peculiar}} and interesting information-theoretic and communications features <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels. We first describe the statistical models <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels which are frequently {{used in the}} analysis and design of communication systems. Next, {{we focus on the}} information theory <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels, by emphasizing capacity as the most important performance measure. Both single-user and multiuser transmission are examined. Further, we describe how the structure <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels impacts code design, and finally overview equalization <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> multipath channels.
