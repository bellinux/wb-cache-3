5000|$|Meeting up with Cordelia at Margo's party, Angel {{explains}} that [...] "there's not actually a cure" [...] for vampirism. In fact, {{before the year}} is out he discovers that there exists at least two cures, a Mohra demon's Blood of Eternity ("I Will Remember You") and a summoning ritual <b>recorded</b> in the <b>scrolls</b> of Aberjian ("To Shanshu in L.A."). Cordelia herself, in varying states of consciousness and corporeality, {{is an integral part}} of Angel's life for the rest of the series.|$|R
40|$|Presentation on Ryukyuan scrolls commemorating {{diplomatic}} processions. When an embassy {{from the}} Ryukyu Kingdom traveled up to Edo, it visited the shogun’s castle {{two or three}} times. Each time they {{went up to the}} castle, the ambassadors and their entourage of roughly 70 to 170 members of the Ryukyuan scholar-aristocracy paraded through the streets of Edo, wearing impressive court costume, carrying colorful banners, and playing Ryukyuan music. The spectacle was <b>recorded</b> in <b>scroll</b> paintings like the two we have on display in the exhibit, of which roughly 100 are extant today. Over the course of the 17 th-early 19 th centuries, numerous woodblock printed books about Ryukyu were published as well, roughly 90 titles in all, each of which might have been published in initial print runs of as many as one or two thousand copies...|$|R
50|$|Margins are an {{important}} method of organizing the written word, and have a long history. In ancient Egypt, writing was <b>recorded</b> on papyrus <b>scrolls.</b> Egyptian papyrus scrolls could reach up to 30 meters in length, and contained text organized in columns laid out {{from left to right}} along the scroll. Columns were referred to as pagina (or pages) and were separated by margins, so that scrolls could be unrolled horizontally, uncovering individual sections one by one. Thus, in papyrus scrolls margins performed the function of visually signaling to readers when to stop reading and move down to the next line of text.|$|R
40|$|Table grid user {{interface}} element with a vertical scrollbar {{is a standard}} way of working with database table records. There are two basic operations each grid should support: <b>scrolling</b> <b>records</b> with vertical scrollbar and positioning to a record with a given primary key. This paper addresses the case {{when the number of}} records is so large that it is not feasible to load them all into memory, and database functions like "select [...] offset" work insufficiently fast and put undue load on RDBMS. Our main idea is to use only queries that involve index lookup (a O(Log(N) -fast operation) and to use statistic properties of hypergeometric distribution to "guess" primary keys of records given their ordinal numbers. The proposed method allows us to implement a grid with O(Log(N)) -fast scrolling and positioning performance. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, in Russia...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} Showa period, he {{converted}} to Japanese-style painting, and studied under Terasaki Kogyo. After Terasaki died he studied Nanga南画 (南画) under Komuro Suiun小室翠雲 (小室翠雲). He joined the waka poetry coterie [...] "Aogaki" [...] in 1927, and drew cover illustrations for their coterie magazine for years. His first exhibition Kishū-ji Angya Nikki Emaki 紀州路行脚日記絵巻 (紀州路行脚日記絵巻) (The picture <b>scroll</b> <b>recording</b> a journey in Wakayama) {{was held at}} Shirakiya department store, Tokyo in 1934. The picture scroll is possessed by Museum of Modern Art, Wakayama. His second exhibition, Nanki Wakayama gaito Kijin-den gakan 南紀若山街頭奇人伝画巻 (南紀若山街頭奇人伝画巻) , was held in 1936 and his third exhibition, Hyoryu ibun ekotoba 漂流異聞絵詞 (漂流異聞絵詞), was held in 1938. Shown in 1940, his fourth exhibition, entitled Manyo-shu ga sen万葉集画撰 (万葉集画撰), featured depictions of the Waka poetry from Man'yōshū, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, and is considered his most important set of work.|$|R
5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on {{the site where the}} Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would <b>record</b> them on <b>scrolls</b> of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|R
50|$|Port Ushimado was {{a famous}} port till the early modern era. It served {{messengers}} from Korea to the Tokugawa Shogunate. The port is today a good spot for sightseeing and sailing. Osafune was famous {{for the production of}} katana in the 12th century under the name of Bizen Osafune (Osafune, Bizen Province). Fukuoka District, which flourished as a trade center and later a political center along the Seto Inland Sea until the beginning of the Edo period, served by the Yoshii River and the Seto Inland Sea, is also included {{as a part of the}} city. The Fukuoka Market (Fukuoka no Ichi) was <b>recorded</b> in the <b>scroll</b> Ippen Shonin Emaki, drawn in the 13th century. At the end of the Kamakura period a castle was built in Fukuoka. In the middle Muromachi period, the daimyō who governed Bizen province took this castle as their site, rebuilt and fortified it more than before. Because the Yoshii river changed its course and most of Fukuoka including the castle sank under the river, the castle was abandoned.|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{painting}} was long {{thought to have been}} painted by Gu Kaizhi, {{the painting}} is not signed or sealed by the artist, and there is no record of Gu Kaizhi having painted such a painting in his biography or in any work which is contemporaneous with his life. [...] The earliest mention of the painting is by the Song Dynasty painter and poet, Mi Fu (1051–1107), who records in his History of Painting (compiled 1103) that the Admonitions Scroll was in the collection of a palace eunuch by the name of Liu Youfang. [...] Crucially, he also attributes the painting to Gu Kaizhi, {{but it is not clear}} whether this attribution was based on documentary evidence or whether this was simply his opinion based on the style of the painting. [...] The next reference to the painting occurs in the Xuanhe Painting Manual, which is a catalogue of paintings in the collection of Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1126) that was compiled in 1120. [...] The manual <b>records</b> the Admonitions <b>Scroll</b> as one of nine paintings in the imperial collection by Gu Kaizhi. [...] This imperial authentication of the painting meant that no-one seriously doubted that the Admonitions Scroll was a work by Gu Kaizhi until modern times.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} 3 centuries B.C.E., the scroll {{gradually}} {{began to be}} replaced by the codex. Rather than storing text on one long, continuous piece of whatever papyrus, the codex was constructed of individual pieces of parchment, bound together on one side. Now that each page was separated physically from all the rest, margins became less necessary in distinguishing {{the beginning and end of}} the text-block. However, they took on a new role. Before the codex, commentaries about a text were usually <b>recorded</b> on separate <b>scrolls.</b> With the advent of the codex, margins (having been largely stripped of their original function) became extra space which could be used to incorporate commentaries next to the original text. Extra text and images included in the margins of codices are called marginalia. Scholarly commentaries included in margins next to their source text are known as scholia. However, this was not the only purpose margins served in the codex. Even when no commentaries were added, most books continued to leave space around the text-block on all sides of each page. This marginal space served several practical purposes. Leaving blank space around text protects the typeblock by giving the reader somewhere to put his or her thumbs while holding the book. In addition, that blank space serves an important role in reading and understanding text. The exact effect of margins on legibility has been debated, but some scholars contend that without empty space to offset text, the task of reading could take more than twice as long. Finally, margins serve an aesthetic function by framing text inside a blank border.|$|R
40|$|Speed-Dependent Automatic Zooming (SDAZ) is an {{exciting}} new navigation technique that couples the user's rate of motion through an information space with the zoom level. The faster a user scrolls in the document, the 'higher' they fly above the work surface. At present, there are few guidelines for the calibration of SDAZ. Previous work by Igarashi & Hinckley (2000) and Cockburn & Savage (2003) fails to give values for predefined constants governing their automatic zooming behaviour. The absence of formal guidelines means that SDAZ implementers are forced to adjust {{the properties of the}} automatic zooming by trial and error. This thesis aids calibration by identifying the low-level components of SDAZ. Base calibration settings for these components are then established using a formal evaluation <b>recording</b> participants' comfortable <b>scrolling</b> rates at different magnification levels. To ease our experiments with SDAZ calibration, we implemented a new system that provides a comprehensive graphical user interface for customising SDAZ behaviour. The system was designed to simplify future extensions [...] -for example new components such as interaction techniques and methods to render information can easily be added with little modification to existing code. This system was used to configure three SDAZ interfaces: a text document browser, a flat map browser and a multi-scale globe browser. The three calibrated SDAZ interfaces were evaluated against three equivalent interfaces with rate-based scrolling and manual zooming. The evaluation showed that SDAZ is 10 % faster for acquiring targets in a map than rate-based scrolling with manual zooming, and SDAZ is 4 % faster for acquiring targets in a text document. Participants also preferred using automatic zooming over manual zooming. No difference was found for the globe browser for acquisition time or preference. However, in all interfaces participants commented that automatic zooming was less physically and mentally draining than manual zooming...|$|R
2500|$|Tryon now spent {{eighteen}} {{months away from}} ships. Aside from time on half pay on leave, he attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth to study steam technology. In August 1867 while touring Norway on a fishing expedition, he received a recall and appointment as 'additional captain' to [...] Octavia was the flagship of the East India Station commanded by Commodore Leopold Heath. Tryon was attached to Octavia, but his duties were to act as transport officer at Annesley Bay, {{which was to be}} used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir Robert Napier's expedition to Magdala in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to Zoulla in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships' steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships, and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a <b>scroll</b> <b>recording</b> the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign. He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.|$|R
