5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
5|$|James Beckwourth {{opened the}} Beckwourth Trail over Beckwourth Pass in 1851, {{crossing}} the Sierra Nevada {{at a lower}} elevation than the existing Donner Pass route of the California Trail. This split from the Truckee Route of the California Trail near Reno and roughly followed the present SR 70 to Quincy, but, rather than passing through the Feather River Canyon, it followed Oroville-Quincy Highway along ridges to Bidwell's Bar. A company was incorporated on July 23, 1855 to build the Quincy and Spanish Ranch Wagon Road, which bypassed the older trail from Quincy west to Spanish Ranch and began collecting tolls in November. The Pioneer Wagon Road, another toll road, was built in 1856 and 1857, continuing the improvements southwest to Buckeye (just before the Butte County line). An 1866 law authorized Plumas County to improve the portion from Quincy east to Beckwourth. The county also improved the road east from Beckwourth over the pass {{as part of the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Clover</b> Wagon Road, which began at Genesee and was completed in the 1870s.|$|E

40|$|Zinc as a {{nutrition}} {{element is}} required to plants in small quantities to maintain normal functions of metabolism mechanisms. Our work analyses the efficiency of <b>red</b> <b>clovers</b> “Arimaičiai” for cleaning zinc from the soil contaminated with zinc under laboratory conditions. Seeds were sown in three differently polluted soils: clean soil, once contaminated with zinc and periodically contaminated with zinc soil. Zinc concentration in one time contaminated soil was 45 mg/kg. After 6 months of phytoremediation, the remained zinc concentration in the soil was 3 times lower comparing with the initial concentration. It was also determined that under such conditions, the uptake of <b>red</b> <b>clovers</b> made approximately 65 % of zinc. Permanent soil contamination with zinc increased concentration before phytoremediation up to 80 mg/kg. After 6 months of phytoremediation, zinc concentration {{was determined to be}} 1. 9 times lower. Otherwise, the soil was permanently contaminated with larger zinc quantities and after application of which reached 300 mg/kg. In this case, following half a year of phytoremediation, zinc concentration in the soil was 1. 7 times lower comparing with the initial concentration after contamination. It was determined that the uptake of <b>red</b> <b>clovers</b> made approximately 17 % of zinc. Article in Lithuanian</p...|$|R

25|$|Poland {{was largely}} an agrarian society {{throughout}} the Middle Ages {{and into the}} 19th century. Polish farmers were mostly peasants, ruled by Polish nobility that owned their land and restricted their political and economic freedoms. Peasants were disallowed from trading, and typically would have to sell their livestock to the nobility, who in turn would function as middlemen in economic life. Commercial farming did not exist, and frequent uprisings by the peasants were suppressed harshly, both by the nobility and the foreign powers occupying Poland. A number of agricultural reforms were introduced in the mid-19th century to Poland, first in German Poland, and later eastern parts of the country. The agricultural technologies originated in Britain and were carried eastward by conversing traders and merchants; Poland gained these secrets in the most developed regions first, and through successful implementation, areas that adopted them boomed. The introduction of a four-crop rotation system tripled the output of Poland's farmlands and created a surplus of agricultural labor in Poland. Prior to this, polish peasants continued Medieval Era practice of three field rotation, losing one year of productive growing time to replenish soil nutrients. Instead of leaving a field fallow, or without any plants for a season, the introduction of turnips and especially <b>red</b> <b>clover</b> allowed Polish fields to maximize nutrients by green manure. <b>Red</b> <b>clover</b> was especially popular because it fed cattle as grazing land, giving the extra benefit of more robust livestock raising in Poland.|$|E
25|$|Phytoestrogens mainly {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} {{substituted}} natural phenolic compounds: the coumestans, prenylflavonoids and isoflavones are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in soy and <b>red</b> <b>clover.</b> Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids. Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of Fusarium, especially common on cereal grains, but also occurring elsewhere, e.g. on various forages. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.|$|E

500|$|In 1854, Darwin {{began to}} work {{full-time}} {{on the origin of}} species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as Fabaceae, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to empirical research on orchids. Despite delays caused by recurring illness, he made progress on writing his planned [...] "Big Book" [...] on evolution, but when Alfred Russel Wallace's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of [...] "intercrossing", and noted: [...] "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them". He introduced his new concept, the process of coevolution, describing the co-adaptation of bumblebees and <b>red</b> <b>clover,</b> and speculating [...] "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.|$|E

2500|$|Optimal meadow vole habitat {{consists}} of moist, dense grassland with {{substantial amounts of}} plant litter.

30|$|The {{result of}} the present study on the fate of wild sorghum seed after 18 and 24  months of burial was in {{agreement}} with the results of Jacques et al. (1974) who did similar study in Kansas. They found that only few seeds of cultivated sorghum remained viable after four months of burial regardless of the burial depth, but some shatter cane seeds were able to survive for three years mostly from deeper burial depths (30  cm to 38  cm). The result was also intermediate between the results of Burnside et al. (1996) and Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000). Burnside et al. (1996) found little viability in weedy sorghum seed after five years of burial, but they also observed 1 % germinated after 17  years of burial in eastern Nebraska. Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000) reported more than 80 % mortality in weedy sorghum seed within three months after burial (between November and March) in Nebraska because of winter cold. However, such kind of winter environment of the temperate regions does not exist in most sorghum growing regions of Sub-Sahara Africa including Ethiopia. The observation that an increase in depth of burial increases longevity was in agreement with the previous reports in sorghum (Jacques et al. 1974), crimson and <b>red</b> <b>clovers</b> (Rampton and Ching 1970), in jointed goat grass (Donald and Zimdahl 1987), in wild oat (Miller and Nalewaja 1990), and in Amaranthus retroflexus seeds (Omami et al. 1999), to mention a few. This may be due mainly to the unavailability of suitable conditions for germination such as a decrease in oxygen content with increase in depth. In addition, seeds near the surface of the soil are more liable to natural predators and greater fluctuation in environmental conditions, which may contribute to faster rate of decay (Chantre et al. 2008).|$|R
