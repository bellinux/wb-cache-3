The plant pathogen, Pantoea stewartii, uses QS to form Stewart’s Wilt and leaf-blight disease in corn. P. stewartii uses the enzyme EsaI to produce 3 -oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone, an autoinducer. The autoinducer is formed in a reaction between S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 3 -oxohexanoyl ACP. Inhibition of EsaI could, in principle, reduce virulence and prevent Stewart’s Wilt in corn. However, 3 -oxohexanoyl ACP is unstable {{and difficult to}} synthesize, thus making it challenging to study EsaI and its activity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Because breath holding causes {{arterial}} pCO 2 to increase, we {{used it to}} {{test the}} hypothesis that in panic disorder (PD) a biological suffocation monitor is pathologically sensitive. METHOD: Nineteen patients with PD, 17 with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and 22 normal controls took deep breaths on signal and held them until a <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> was given 30 seconds later. This was repeated 12 times separated by 60 -second normal breathing periods. RESULTS: PD patients reported having had in the past more symptoms of shortness of breath when anxious, and more frequent frightening suffocation experiences than the other groups. However, increases in self-rated anxiety between periods of normal breathing and periods of breath holding were similar in all three groups. Skin conductance, blood pressure, and T-wave amplitude reactions to breath holdings were also similar, but heart rate acceleration upon taking a deep breath was greater in GAD patients. Before and after individual breath holdings, end-tidal pCO 2 was lower in PD patients than in normal controls; GAD patients were intermediate. Inspiratory flow rate did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our physiological results provide no direct support for an overly sensitive suffocation alarm system in PD. Lower pCO 2 may be due to anxiety causing hyperventilation in patients prone to panic...|$|E

The present article addresses this issue by considering the dynamics of an inverted laminar dihedral (“V”) ﬂame spreading in an open geometry when this ﬂame is submitted to equivalence ratio modulations. The problem is investigated with numerical simulations by ﬁrst establishing a steady state ﬂame which then evolves in a uniform ﬂow transporting a ﬁxed level of equivalence ratio perturbations. The ﬂame features wrinkles of increasing amplitude locking on the convected composition perturbations. The wrinkling amplitude grows with distance from the injector. For sufﬁciently large wrinkle amplitudes, the ﬂame interacts with the fresh mixture outer boundary, giving rise to sudden disruptions of the ﬂame sheet. The rapid burning of fresh mixture pockets generates a nonlinear heat <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> with abrupt changes in the waveform. It is found that high levels of modulation induce axial velocity perturbations, which in turn interact with the ﬂame and modify the response.

A simple model is devised on this basis to distinguish regimes corresponding to weak and strong interactions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Although the {{dopamine}} D 2 receptor (DRD 2) {{has been}} a main target of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia, the standard treatment does not offer sufficient relief of symptoms to 20 %– 30 % of patients suffering from this disorder. Moreover, over 80 % of patients experience relapsed psychotic episodes within five years following treatment initiation. These data strongly suggest that the continuous blockade of DRD 2 by antipsychotic(s) could eventually fail to control the psychosis in some point during long-term treatment, even if such treatment has successfully provided symptomatic improvement for the first-episode psychosis, or stability for the subsequent chronic stage. Dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP) is historically known as a by-product of antipsychotic treatment in the manner of tardive dyskinesia or transient rebound psychosis. Numerous data in psychopharmacological studies suggest that the up-regulation of DRD 2, caused by antipsychotic(s), is likely the mechanism underlying the development of the dopamine supersensitivity state. However, regardless of evolving notions of dopamine signaling, particularly dopamine <b>release,</b> <b>signal</b> transduction, and receptor recycling, most of this research has been conducted and discussed from the standpoint of disease etiology or action mechanism of the antipsychotic, not of DSP. Hence, the mechanism of the DRD...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWhen {{cells are}} {{activated}} by calcium-mobilizing agonists at low, physiological concentrations, the resulting calcium signals generally {{take the form}} of repetitive regenerative discharges of stored calcium, termed calcium oscillations [1]. These intracellular calcium oscillations have long fascinated biologists as a mode of digitized intracellular signaling. Recent work has highlighted the role of calcium influx as an essential component of calcium oscillations [2]. This influx occurs through a process known as store-operated calcium entry, which is initiated by calcium sensor proteins, STIM 1 and STIM 2, in the endoplasmic reticulum [3]. STIM 2 is activated by changes in endoplasmic reticulum calcium near the resting level, whereas a threshold of calcium depletion is required for STIM 1 activation [4]. Here we show that, surprisingly, it is STIM 1 and not STIM 2 that is exclusively involved in calcium entry during calcium oscillations. The implication is that each oscillation produces a transient drop in endoplasmic reticulum calcium and that this drop is sufficient to transiently activate STIM 1. This transient activation of STIM 1 can be observed in some cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This arrangement nicely provides a clearly defined and unambiguous signaling system, translating a digital calcium <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> into calcium influx that can signal to downstream effectors...|$|E
40|$|The amplitudes of the {{conductivity}} transients in photoexcited purple membranes {{were studied}} {{as a function}} of the energy of the actinic flash to determine the optical cross section of the process giving rise to the conductivity transient. Heating of the solution by the absorbed light causes an additional conductivity change and serves as an internal actinometer; the experiment directly yields the ratio of the cross section of ion release/uptake to that for light absorption. In effect, this counts the number of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) molecules involved in the conductivity transient per photon absorbed. At pH 7 in 0. 4 - 0. 5 M NaCl, where the conductivity signals are dominated by nonproton ions, the ratio is between 3 and 4, i. e., excitation of any one of several chromophores generates the same ion <b>release</b> <b>signal.</b> The simplest interpretation is that at pH 7 cooperative conformational changes cause a transient change in the surface charge distribution near all the affected bR molecules, resulting in the transient release of numerous counterions. As a comparison, at pH 4 where the signals are due to protons alone, the cross section data indicate that only a single bR molecule is involved in the proton movements. In this case, the results also show that the sum of the primary forward and reverse quantum yields (for the reactions: bR [...] K) is 0. 88 +/- 0. 09...|$|E

40|$|Most adult {{mammalian}} skeletal muscles contain {{only one}} isoform of ryanodine receptor (RyR 1), whereas neonatal muscles contain two isoforms (RyR 1 and RyR 3). Membrane depolarization fails to evoke calcium release in muscle cells lacking RyR 1, demonstrating {{an essential role}} for this isoform in excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast, the role of RyR 3 is unknown. We studied the participation of RyR 3 in calcium release in wild type (containing both RyR 1 and RyR 3 isoforms) and RyR 3 -/- (containing only RyR 1) myotubes in {{the presence or absence}} of imperatoxin A (IpTxa), a high-affinity agonist of ryanodine receptors. IpTxa significantly increased the amplitude and the rate of release only in wild-type myotubes. Calcium currents, recorded simultaneously with the transients, were not altered with IpTxa treatment. [(3) H]ryanodine binding to RyR 1 or RyR 3 was significantly increased in the presence of IpTxa. Additionally, IpTxa modified the gating and conductance level of single RyR 1 or RyR 3 channels when studied in lipid bilayers. Our data show that IpTxa can interact with both RyRs and that RyR 3 is functional in myotubes and it can amplify the calcium <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> initiated by RyR 1, perhaps through a calcium-induced mechanism. In addition, our data indicate that when RyR 3 -/- myotubes are voltage-clamped, the effect of IpTxa is not detected because RyR 1 s are under the control of the dihydropyridine receptor...|$|E

In recent years, EM-CCDs, SCDs and CMOS sensors have been used, or baselined, for missions in which the detection of X-ray and visible photons are key to the science goals of the mission. When placed in orbit, silicon-based detectors will suffer radiation damage {{as a consequence of}} the harsh space radiation environment, creating traps in the silicon. The radiation-induced traps will capture and <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> electrons, effectively “smearing” the image. Without correction, this smearing of the image would have major consequences on the science goals of the missions. Fitting to observed results, through careful planning of observation strategies while the radiation dose received remains low in the early stages of the mission, has previously been used to correct against the radiation damage effects. As the science goals becoming increasingly demanding, however, the correction algorithms require greater accuracy and a more physical approach is required, removing the effects of the radiation damage by modelling the trap capture and release mechanisms to a high level of detail. The drive for increasingly accurate trap parameters has led to the development of new methods of characterisation of traps in the silicon, measuring the trap properties and their effects to the single-trap level in situ.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} implicated Ca 2 + fluxes {{in the control}} of {{apoptosis}} but their exact roles in regulating the process remain obscure. Because Ca 2 + {{can serve as a}} signal for cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria, we hypothesized that alterations in intracellular Ca 2 + compartmentalization might serve as a <b>release</b> <b>signal</b> in whole cells undergoing apoptosis. Exposure of human PC- 3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells to staurosporine or DNA damaging agent (doxorubicin) but not to anti-Fas antibody led to early release of Ca 2 + from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent accumulation of Ca 2 + within mitochondria. Both events were blocked in cells stably transfected with Bcl- 2 but were not affected by treatment with the pancaspase inhibitor, zVADfmk. The effects of staurosporine were associated with re-localization of Bax from the cytosol to both endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial membranes. Neither ER Ca 2 + pool depletion nor mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake were observed in DU- 145 cells that possess a frameshift mutation in the Bax gene unless wild-type Bax was restored via adenoviral gene transfer. Cytochrome c release and downstream features of apoptosis were attenuated by treatment with an inhibitor of mitochondria) Ca 2 + uptake (RU- 360). Although, direct pharmacological ER Ca 2 + pool emptying in cells treated with thapsigargin did not lead to early cytochrome c release, pretreatment of cells with staurosporine dramatically sensitized mitochondria to thapsigargin-induced cytochrome c release. Together, our data demonstrate that ER-to-mitochondrial Ca 2 + fluxes promote cytochrome c release and apoptosis in cells exposed to some (but not all) pro-apoptosic stimuli. ...|$|E

The proposed signal model can be used to support decision-making in optimising preventive maintenance: at a component level, estimates of the underlying failure distribution can be used to identify the critical signal that would trigger maintenance of the individual component; at a multi-component system level, accurate estimates of the component underlying lifetimes are important when making general maintenance decisions.

40|$|The central vacuole is {{the largest}} Ca 2 + store in a mature plant cell. Ca 2 + release from this store {{contributes}} to Ca 2 +-mediated intracellular signalling {{in a variety of}} physiological responses. However, the routes for vacuolar Ca 2 + release are not well characterized. To date, at least two voltage-dependent and two ligand-gated Ca 2 +-permeable channels have been reported in plant vacuoles. However, the so-called VVCa (vacuolar voltage-gated Ca 2 +) channel most probably is not a separate channel but is identical to another voltage-dependent channel—the so-called SV (slow vacuolar) channel. Studies {{in the last few years}} have added a new dimension to our knowledge of SV channel-mediated ion transport and the mechanisms of its regulation by multiple natural factors. Recently, the SV channel was identified as the product of the TPC 1 gene in Arabidopsis. In contrast, the TPC 1 channel from other species was thought to be localized in the plasma membrane. A re-evaluation of this work under the assumption that the TPC 1 channel is generally a vacuolar channel provides interesting insights into the physiological function of the TPC 1 / SV channel. Considerably less is known about vacuolar Ca 2 + channels that are supposed to be activated by inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate or cADP ribose. The major problems are controversial reports about functional characteristics, and a remarkable lack of homologues of animal ligand-gated Ca 2 + channels in higher plants.

Since limited data exist regarding killing by colistin at different initial inocula (CFUo), we evaluated killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by colistin at several CFUo and developed a mechanism-based mathematical model accommodating a range of CFUo. In vitro time-kill experiments were performed using ≥ 8 concentrations up to 64 × the MIC of colistin against P. aeruginosa PAO 1 and two clinical P. aeruginosa isolates at CFUo of 106, 108, and 109 CFU/ml. Serial samples up to 24 h were simultaneously modeled in the NONMEM VI (results shown) and S-ADAPT software programs. The mathematical model was prospectively “validated” by additional time-kill studies assessing the effect of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + on killing of PAO 1 by colistin. Against PAO 1, killing of the susceptible population was 23 -fold slower at the 109 CFUo and 6 -fold slower at the 108 CFUo than at the 106 CFUo. The model comprised three populations with different second-order killing rate constants (5. 72, 0. 369, and 0. 00210 liters/h/mg).
