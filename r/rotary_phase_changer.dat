50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>phase</b> converter, {{abbreviated}} RPC, is {{an electrical}} machine that converts power from one polyphase system (including frequency) to another, converting through rotary motion.

Kandó's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the <b>rotary</b> <b>phase</b> converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.|$|R

Five European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden), where electricity is three-phase AC as 50 Hz, have standardised on single-phase AC at 15 kV 16⅔ Hz for railway electrification; phase converters are, therefore, used to change both phases and frequency.

40|$|In this work, an {{improved}} hybrid MoM/FDTD algorithm for modeling low to ultra high field MRI RF coil/sample interactions has been proposed.

In view of this, a Huygen 2 ̆ 7 s equivalent surface method has been proposed to effectively bridge MoM and FDTD. In the improved hybrid MoM/FDTD algorithm, staircasing errors are eliminated, and most importantly the complex coil/tissue interactions are explicitly accounted for.

40|$|Most public {{utilities}} depend {{on electric power}} to function, so it is paramount that a constant power source is available. These {{public utilities}} get their supply from the public mains {{and in the case}} where the public mains fails a back-up power source is necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the public utilities. Switching the public utilities from the mains to the back-up power creates a period of time when the utilities will be without power and the longer the time delay the lesser the efficiency of the public utilities. The stress of manual switching also makes the utilities inefficient. Examples of these public utilities are street lights, traffic lights, water pumps and traffic sign indicators. A device that completely eliminates the stress of manually switching public utilities from the mains supply to the back-up supply is the Automatic Mains and <b>Phase</b> <b>Changer</b> (AMPC). It also greatly reduces the power outage time delay experience during the switching.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this work is to {{effectively}} implement the ε-constraint method for producing Pareto optimal solutions for optimizing three objective functions, simultaneously, incorporating a Rotary Hybrid Flow Controller (RHFC) as an energy flow controller. The RHFC is a hybrid compensator composed of a <b>Rotary</b> <b>Phase</b> Shifting Transformer (RPST), a multimodule Thyristor-Switched Series Capacitor (TSSC), a multimodule Thyristor-Switched Series Reactor (TSSR) and a Mechanically-switched Shunt Capacitor (MSC). In this paper, a multi-objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is applied to optimally locate RHFC to improve the power system operation. Fuzzy decision-making is utilized in terms of optimal location processing, according to the best compromise among the Pareto optimal solutions. The optimal location and OPF model are implemented in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software in order to optimize total fuel cost, power loss and system loadability, as objective functions, simultaneously. Simulations are performed on IEEE 30 -bus and 118 -bus test systems to determine optimal parameters {{and the location of}} RHFC. Furthermore, in order to highlight the ability of RHFC, the results are compared to a Phase Shifting Transformer (PST) and a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) from economical and technical points of view...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new power flow model for rotary power flow controller (RPFC). RPFC injects a series voltage into {{the transmission line}} and provides series compensation and phase shifting simultaneously. Therefore, {{it is able to}} control the transmission line impedance and the active power flow through it. An RPFC is composed mainly of two <b>rotary</b> <b>phase</b> shifting transformers (RPST) and two conventional (series and shunt) transformers. Structurally, an RPST consists of two windings (stator and rotor windings). The rotor windings of the two RPSTs are connected in parallel and their stator windings are in series. The injected voltage is proportional to the vector sum of the stator voltages and so its amplitude and angle are affected by the rotor position of the two RPSTs. This paper, describes the steady state operation and single-phase equivalent circuit of the RPFC. Also in this paper, a new power flow model, based on power injection model of flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) controllers, suitable for the power flow analysis is introduced. Proposed model is used to solve optimal power flow (OPF) problem in IEEE standard test systems incorporating RPFC and the optimal settings and location of the RPFC is determined...|$|R

40|$|Radiofrequency (RF) coils {{for use in}} MRI {{can have}} a {{significant}} effect on both the signal-to-noise-ratio of MR images and the specific absorption rate inside the biological sample. In the past, prototypes were constructed and tested to investigate the performance of the RF coils and often required several iterations to achieve an acceptable result. However, with the advancement in computational electromagnetic techniques, RF coil modelling has now become the modus operandi of coil design because it can produce accurate numerical results, thus reducing the time and effort spent in designing and prototyping RF coils. Two hybrid methods -method of moments (MoM) /finite difference time domain (FDTD) and MoM/finite element method (FEM) - for RF coil modelling are presented herein. The paper provides a brief overview of FDTD, FEM and MoM. It discusses the hybridisation of these methods and how they are integrated to form versatile techniques. The numerical results obtained from these hybrid methods are compared with experimental results from prototype coils over a range of operating frequencies. The methods are then applied to the design of a new type of phased-array coil - the <b>rotary</b> <b>phased</b> array. From these comparisons, it can be seen that the numerical methods provide a useful aid for the design and optimisation of RF coils for use in MRI. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
