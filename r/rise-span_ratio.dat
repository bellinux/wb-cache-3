With the increase of <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio,</b> buckling loads of arches under vertical load uniformly distributed along the horizontal line get bigger and bigger {{compared with those of}} vertical load uniformly distributed along the axis. With increase of <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio,</b> the buckling loads of hingeless and two-hinged arch increase after decrease, then decrease. The buckling load of three-hinged arch decreases after increases. When <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is small, support condition has a great influence on out-of-plane buckling. The parabolic arch is better than circular arch in out-of-plane stability and economy. But circular arch is better than parabolic arch in manufacture...|$|E

The out-of-plane {{secondary}} bifurcation buckling load-displacement equilibrium {{paths of}} the elastic circle pipe arch {{with and without}} out-of-plane brace {{at the top of}} the arch are traced using a new numerical tracing strategy. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling loads of the arch with the same sections and different rise-span ratios are obtained under the concentrated load {{at the top of the}} arch and the full span uniformly distributed load, which are compared with out-of-plane linear buckling load and in-plane primary buckling load. The calculation results show: for the same section circle pipe arches without the out-of-plane brace and under the concentrated load at the top the arch, the out-of-plane secondary buckling load is always less than the in-plane primary buckling load and the out-of-plane buckling will occur before the in-plane primary buckling. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling load of the arch with 0. 2 <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is the biggest. The bigger the <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is, the bigger the difference between out-of-plane and in-plane buckling load. When the arch is subjected to full span uniformly distributed load, the out-of-plane buckling will also occur before the in-plane primary buckling and the out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling load of the arch with 0. 4 <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is the biggest.

Characteristics of wind {{pressure}} distributions over the spherical shell with 3 / 4 <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> {{have been investigated}} based on the data obtained from a wind tunnel experiment. A discussion of the spectral characteristics including shape of {{wind pressure}} spectra, reduced frequency corresponding to the peak spectral amplitude, and spectral slope in high frequency range is also made.

Though spectral patterns change from place to place, standard normalized spectra associated with various zones of spherical shell could be appropriately classified based on identical spectral characteristics. On this basis, an empirical spectral equation is figured out including three parts which represent the contribution of approach turbulence, turbulence induced by separation on the top of spherical shell and wake turbulence respectively.

The most loaded sections of each arch are strengthened in 7 different ways: by attaching non-prestressed glass fiber-reinforced-polymer (GFRP) and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates, by attaching prestressed GFRP and CFRP laminates, with steel reinforcement bars and by attaching prestressed GFRP and CFRP laminates to the reinforced arch. Efficiency rates of various strengthening types are compared {{and also the}} use of design resistance is estimated. The span of arches is assumed constant – 42 m. The arches are subjected to snow load and wind load.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{load-carrying}} capacity latticed shells, an innovative optimum method {{based on the}} concept of compression line is proposed in this paper. The basic principle of this method is using the character without moment in compression line. The arc line which forms the contour line of sphere and latticed shell structures is substituted by compression line in this method. Then the latticed shell structures are in the state of compression, and the influence of bending stress reduces greatly. As a result, the load-carrying capacity of the latticed shell structure is increased. Through the geometrical nonlinear analysis of a sunflower-patterned single-layer latticed shell structure with a span of 48 m, it is found that the load-carrying capacity of the single-layer latticed shell structure can be improved by 5. 48 %. Furthermore, the results of 84 structural analyses of single-layer or double-layer sphere and cylinder latticed shell structures show that the optimum method is right and effective. And especially, it is applicable to single-layer latticed shell structure with <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 / 5 with the max improvement 6. 4 % of load-carrying capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexibility}} coefficient is popularly used {{to implement the}} macroevaluation of shape, safety, and economy for arch dam. However, the description of {{flexibility coefficient}} has not drawn a widely consensus all the time. Based on {{a large number of}} relative instance data, the relationship between influencing factor and flexibility coefficient is analyzed by means of partial least-squares regression. The partial least-squares regression equation of flexibility coefficient in certain height range between 30 [*]m and 70 [*]m is established. Regressive precision and equation stability are further investigated. The analytical model of statistical flexibility coefficient is provided. The flexibility coefficient criterion is determined preliminarily to evaluate the shape of low- and medium-sized arch dam. A case study is finally presented to illustrate the potential engineering application. According to the analysis result of partial least-squares regression, it is shown that there is strong relationship between flexibility coefficient and average thickness of dam, thickness-height ratio of crown cantilever, arc height ratio, and dam height, but the effect of <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is little relatively. The considered factors in the proposed model are more comprehensive, and the applied scope is clearer than that of the traditional calculation methods.

40|$|Copyright © 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd. A {{radially}} retractable {{roof structure}} {{based on the}} concept of the hybrid grid shell is proposed in this paper. The single-layer steel trusses of the radially foldable bar structure are diagonally stiffened by cables, which leads to a single-layer lattice shell with triangular mesh. Then comparison between the static behavior between the retractable hybrid grid shell and the corresponding foldable bar shell with quadrangular mesh is discussed. Moreover, the effects of different structural parameters, such as the rise-to-span ratio, the bar cross section area and the pre-stress of the cables, on the structural behaviors are investigated. The results show that prestressed cables can strengthen the foldable bar shell with quadrangular mesh. Higher structural stiffness is anticipated by introducing cables into the hybrid system. When the <b>rise-span</b> <b>ratio</b> is equal to 0. 2, where the joint displacement reaches the minimal value, the structure shape of the hyrbid grid shell approaches the reasonable arch axis. The increase of the section of steel bars contributes a lot to the integrity stiffness of the structure. Increasing cable sections would enhance the structure stiffness, but it contributes little to axial forces in structural members. And the level of cable prestress has slight influence on the joint displacements and member forces. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
