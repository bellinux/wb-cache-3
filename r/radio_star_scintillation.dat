40|$|Three {{observations}} of <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> intensity fluctuations at UHF are reported for HF ionospheric modification experiments {{carried out at}} the Arecibo Observatory. Two observations at 430 MHz and one at 1400 MHz suggest that the the thin phase screen theory is a good approximation to the observed power spectra. It is noted, however, that the theory has to be extended to include antenna filtering. This type of filtering is important for UHF <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> <b>scintillations</b> since the antenna usually has a narrow beamwidth. HF power densities of less than 37 microwatts/sq m incident on the ionosphere give rise to electron density irregularities larger than 13 % of the ambient density (at 260 km) having scale sizes of approximately 510 m perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. The irregularities are found to form within 20 - 25 s after the HF power is turned on. The drift velocities of the irregularities can be estimated from the observed power spectra...|$|R
40|$|KENT 1 has {{reported}} {{a series of}} observations on the 40 Mc. /s. transmissions from Sputnik 1 made at Cambridge during October 1957. He found that the transmissions always underwent rapid fading (scintillation) when the satellite was north of Cambridge but only occasionally when south of Cambridge. He concluded that the scintillations were due to ionospheric irregularities which are north of the observing station but not south of it. Further, since the southward extent of the scintillation region was greater for satellite passes {{to the west of}} Cambridge than to the east, he postulated that the density of the irregularities is controlled by the magnetic rather than geographic latitude (Cambridge 2 ̆ 7 s declination is about - 9 °). Mawdsley 2 objected to Kent 2 ̆ 7 s seemingly arbitrary assumption that the irregularities do not occur south of the observer, on the grounds that <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> <b>scintillations</b> are observed at lower latitudes than that of Cambridge. He suggested an alternative interpretation of Kent 2 ̆ 7 s results in terms of preferential forward scattering by the irregularities, assumed to be field aligned, when the line of sight from the observer to the source is normal to the field lines. Afterwards, Bain 3 and Frihagen and Tröin 4, working at Slough and Kjeller respectively, observed scintillations when the satellite under observation was south of the observing station. However, they both found that the scintillation activity increased for geomagnetic latitudes greater than that of Cambridge, that is, 55 °. This led Frihagen and Tröin to support Kent 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation. It is the purpose of this communication to point out the existence of further pieces of evidence which support Kent 2 ̆ 7 s point of view rather than Mawdsley 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{scientific}} topics in Equatorial Aeronomy is related to Spread-F. It includes all our efforts to understand the physical mechanisms responsible {{for the existence of}} ionospheric F-region irregularities, the spread of the traces in a night-time equatorial ionogram – hence its name – and all other manifestations of the same. It was observed {{for the first time as}} an abnormal ionogram in Huancayo, about 70 years ago. But only recently are we coming to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for its occurrence and its capricious day to day variability. Several additional techniques have been used to reveal the spatial and temporal characteristics of the F-region irregularities responsible for the phenomenon. Among them we have, in chronological order, <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> <b>scintillations,</b> trans-equatorial <b>radio</b> propagation, satellite scintillations, radar backscatter, satellite and rocket in situ measurements, airglow, total electron content techniques using the propagation of satellite radio signals and, recently, radar imaging techniques. Theoretical efforts are as old as the observations. Nevertheless, 32 years after their discovery, Jicamarca radar observations showed that none of the theories that had been put forward could explain them completely. The observations showed that irregularities were detected at altitudes that were stable according to the mechanisms proposed. A breakthrough came a few years later, again from Jicamarca, by showing that some of the "stable" regions had become unstable by the non-linear propagation of the irregularities from the unstable to the stable region of the ionosphere in the form of bubbles of low density plasma. A problem remained, however; the primary instability mechanism proposed, an extended (generalized) Rayleigh-Taylor instability, was too slow to explain the rapid development seen by the observations. Gravity waves in the neutral background have been proposed as a seeding mechanism to form irregularities from which the instability would grow, but the former are difficult to observe as a controlling parameter. Their actual role still needs to be determined. More recently, radar observations again have shown the existence of horizontal plasma drift velocities counter streaming the neutral wind at the steep bottom of the F-region which produces a fast growing instability from which a generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability can grow. The mechanisms proposed would explain the rapid development of the large and medium scale irregularities that have been observed, including some seen only by radars. Nevertheless, a proper quantitative theoretical mechanism that would explain how these irregularities break into the very important meter scale ones, responsible for the radar echoes, needs to be developed. This paper makes a selective historical review of the observations and proposed theories since the phenomenon was discovered to our current understanding...|$|R
40|$|HF-waves {{incident}} on an overdense (HF-frequency < penetration frequency) ionosphere {{are known to}} produce large scale electron density irregularities. It is predicted that similar irregularities are formed during underdense HF-modification. The propagation of UHF radio waves originating from <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> {{will be affected by}} such irregularities in the ionosphere. The interest in a scintillation experiment is twofold. One may obtain information on the electron density irregularies and one may learn about the propagation of radio waves through such a perturbed medium. A thin screen (diffractive) theory is derived which allows to draw conclusions on the electron density irregularities from the intensity fluctuations measured on the ground if the phase perturbations are much less than one radian. Since <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> suitable for <b>scintillation</b> measurements at UHF are very faint an antenna with a large collection area is required. The observations reported in this dissertation were performed with the 300 m diameter spherical reflector of the Arecibo Observatory. Successful observations were performed at 430 MHz and at 1400 MHz. Intensity fluctuations at such high frequencies measured with a large antenna suffer severe filtering in the thin phase screen regime. The theory presented in this dissertation includes these filtering effects. Many observations agree with the predictions of that theory. Some observations indicate that refraction effects have to be included to explain the data. HF-induced electron density irregularities were only observed during overdense heating. Several attempts to detect irregularities at an observing frequency of 430 MHz during underdense heating (HF-frequencies 1. 1 to 2 times penetration frequency) failed. All the measurements reported in this dissertation are therefore during overdense heating except for the measurement on the 22 September 1980 whichs shows a transition from underdense to overdense HF-modification. Attempts were made to measure electron density irregularities at an observing frequency of 2380 MHz due to overdense heating but the fluctuations were too weak to be discriminated against instrumental uncertainties. The formation time for the irregularities after the HF-power was turned on was (TURN) 25 seconds. Their lifetime after the HF-power was turned off was on the order of hours. The electron density perturbations appear to exceed 1 % at times. One observation on 11 / 12 September 1980 reveals that the density perturbation actually corresponds to a depletion...|$|R

In this work, an obtainable accuracy of the orientation angles between GCRF and ICRF frames was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. If the uncertainties in the <b>radio</b> <b>star</b> positions obtained by VLBI are in the range of 0. 1 - 4 mas and those obtained by Gaia are in the range of 0. 005 - 0. 4 mas, the orientation angle uncertainties are 0. 018 - 0. 72 mas if 46 <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> are used, 0. 013 - 0. 51 mas if 92 <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> are used, and 0. 010 - 0. 41 ~mas if 138 <b>radio</b> <b>stars</b> are used.
