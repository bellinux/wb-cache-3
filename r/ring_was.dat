5|$|Doug <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> {{a member}} of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team which toured England in 1948. Bradman's men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this {{unprecedented}} feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} processes {{that occur in}} planetary <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The theoretical arguments leading {{to the conclusion that}} Saturn's <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> solid particles in nonuniform rotation are summarized, and the optical depth, thickness, and particle size of the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The influence of nearby satellites on the <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> analyzed, and asymmetries in the <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> briefly discussed. What is known of the rings of Uranus and of Jupiter's <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> summarized. Some of the dynamical processes and influences that are expected to be incorporated in more advanced theories of planetary <b>rings</b> <b>are</b> reviewed in detail, including radiation drag, plasma drag, interparticle collisions and viscosity, resonances with external satellites, shepherd satellites and moonlets. Finally, the orbital evolution of the shepherd satellites caused by the <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> estimated...|$|R
25|$|A {{division}} <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a field. A prominent {{example of a}} division <b>ring</b> that <b>is</b> not a field <b>is</b> the <b>ring</b> of quaternions. Any centralizer in a division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> also a division ring. In particular, {{the center of a}} division <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a field. It turned out that every finite domain (in particular finite division <b>ring)</b> <b>is</b> a field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).|$|R
5|$|For {{the entire}} tour, Ring took 60 {{first-class}} wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, {{the most expensive}} among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed {{to have a new}} ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests—more frequently than usual—fast bowling dominated over spin, and <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only Bill Johnston bowled more overs, and <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> used to relieve the workload on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a batting average of 16.66 during the tour, and a top-score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E

40|$|It {{was shown}} by Bergman that the Jacobson radical of a Z-graded <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous. This paper {{shows that the}} {{analogous}} result holds for nil rings, namely, that the nil radical of a Z-graded <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous. It is obvious that a subring of a nil <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> nil, but generally a subring of a Jacobson radical <b>ring</b> need not <b>be</b> a Jacobson radical ring. In this paper it is shown that every subring which is generated by homogeneous elements in a graded Jacobson radical <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> always a Jacobson radical <b>ring.</b> It <b>is</b> also observed that a ring whose all subrings <b>are</b> Jacobson radical <b>rings</b> <b>is</b> nil.

5|$|The λ <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> {{one of two}} rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, {{between it and the}} shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> chosen for his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the {{captaincy}} of Hassett. It proved not much happier than his 1948 experience, though in a less strong side his eventual wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947–48 season that preceded the tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120). Fellow leg spinner McCool and off spinner Ian Johnsonwho had been regular Test players since World War IIwere the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the four}} Tests, and being severely attacked in the previous match at Headingley, Johnson was dropped in favour of leg spinner Doug Ring. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon with Ring not required to bowl, as the pacemen made light work of the hosts. <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> economical in the second innings, taking 1/44 from 28 overs as Australia sealed the series 40 with another innings victory.|$|E

5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} <b>ring</b> <b>was</b> a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring.

Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E
5|$|During {{an archaeological}} dig on Hatteras Island in 1998, archaeologists {{discovered}} a 10-carat gold English signet ring from the 16th century, among other artifacts.

5|$|During the Australian {{summer of}} 194748, Johnston played {{in four of}} the five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He was a major part in Australia's 40 series win; the second highest wicket-taker with 16 scalps, Johnston had the best bowling average of 11.37. Ray Lindwall led the wicket-takers with 18. As a result, Johnston was {{selected}} for the 1948 tour of England. During the trip, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring who was a teammate in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As <b>Ring</b> <b>was</b> a leg spinner, he and Johnston were in direct competition for a place in the playing XI.|$|E
