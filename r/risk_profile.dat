40|$|The <b>risk</b> <b>profiling</b> {{process is}} one of the most under-utilised assets the {{financial}} planning profession has at its disposal. This paper presents a novel approach to <b>risk</b> <b>profiling,</b> which is based on the application of the psychology literature to develop an empirical <b>risk</b> <b>profiling</b> system. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for considering the <b>risk</b> <b>profiling</b> system by applying the literature from self-control, optimism, financial literacy, and risk tolerance, to a <b>risk</b> <b>profiling</b> system. This paper discusses how understanding client levels of self-control can impact ‘stickability’ to a financial plan, and how prior knowledge of optimism, financial literacy and risk tolerance can enable financial planners to have more engaging discussions and design more tailored financial plans for their clients. This is the first stage of the research project, with the second stage the development and testing of a <b>risk</b> <b>profiling</b> system based on the theory within this paper.

25|$|Since Metchnikoff, {{advances}} in science have uncovered {{that the process}} of pathogenic inhibition is more complex than simply increasing the acidity in the colon, as the probiotic bacteria produce bacteriocins, bacterial synthesized proteins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria. In the case of L. bulgaricus this bacteriocin is called bulgaricin. Also there is a complex interplay between the probiotic bacteria and the body's immune system in the large intestine, where the good bacteria stimulate the body's own immune system to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria. For example, in a controlled study, 61 elderly volunteers, after 6 months of a daily dose of L. bulgaricus, responded to the intake of probiotic with an increase in the percentage of NK cells, an improvement in the parameters defining the immune <b>risk</b> <b>profile</b> (IRP), and an increase in the T cell subsets that are less differentiated.

This is demonstrated through the prominence assigned to ERM within organizations and the resources devoted to building ERM capabilities. In a 2008 survey by Towers Perrin, at most life insurance companies, responsibility for ERM resides within the C-suite. Most often, the chief risk officer (CRO) or {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) is in charge of ERM, and these individuals typically report directly to the chief executive officer. From their vantage point, the CRO and CFO are able to look across the organization and develop a perspective on the <b>risk</b> <b>profile</b> of the firm and how that profile matches its risk appetite. They act as drivers to improve skills, tools and processes for evaluating risks and to weigh various actions to manage those exposures. Companies are also actively enhancing their ERM tools and capabilities. Three quarters of responding companies said they have tools for specifically monitoring and managing enterprise-wide risk. These tools are used primarily for identifying and measuring risk and for management decision making. Respondents also reported that they have made good progress in building their ERM capabilities in certain areas.|$|E

Methods: Between 1990 and 1999, 7290 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation in 42 institutions entered a formal outcomes study. Changing survival, causes of death, and patient <b>risk</b> <b>profiles</b> were analyzed. Multivariable risk-factor equations were applied to a single institution (300 primary heart transplants) to examine differences in risk-adjusted expected versus observed actuarial outcomes over time. Results: Overall survival in the 42 institutions improved during the decade (P =. 02). One- and 3 -year cardiac transplant research database survival was as follows: era 1 (1990 - 1992), 84 % and 76 %, respectively; era 2 (1993 - 1995), 85 % and 79 %, respectively; and era 3 (1996 - 1999), 85 % and 79 %, respectively. Causes of death changed over time. Pretransplantation <b>risk</b> <b>profiles</b> increased over time (P =. 0001), with increases in reoperations, devices, diabetes, severely ill recipients, pulmonary vascular resistance, sensitization, ischemic times, donor age, and donor inotropic support. Three-year actuarial survival in a single institution was 3 % less than risk-adjusted predicted survival in era 1, 1 % higher than predicted in era 2, and 7 % higher than predicted in era 3. Conclusions: Survival after cardiac transplantation is gradually improving, despite increasing <b>risk</b> <b>profiles.</b> Further improvement requires periodic re-evaluation of <b>risk</b> <b>profiles</b> and causes of death to target areas of surveillance, therapy, and research. By using these methods, progress at individual institutions can be assessed in a time-related, risk-adjusted manner that also reflects changing institutional experience, expertise, or both.
