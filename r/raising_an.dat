5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Its primary focus is an impact of ASD {{diagnosis}} on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child and secondary it also introduces {{the basic principles}} of intervention, which are broadly used in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Literature review part of this thesis defines current approach of ASD. It also describes the impact of impairments in communication, social interaction and imagination on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Important principles of intervention in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with this diagnosis, which are individualization, structuralization, visualization and motivation, are presented there as well. The second part of this thesis presents a proposal for qualitative research that aims to point out differences between how mothers and fathers accept the diagnosis, perceive the impact on family relationships and use the principles of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Proposed research should provide hypotheses which would serve as a foundation for future research...|$|R

5|$|Founder Steve Ells {{attended}} the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, {{he became a}} line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.|$|E

5|$|Originally Mary {{believed}} that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) {{and his former}} peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or {{the validity of the}} Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband. The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent. Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations. Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer. The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven. Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins. On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James. Moray was made regent, while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Hulao (虎牢之戰) on 28 May 621 was {{a decisive}} {{victory for the}} Tang Dynasty prince Li Shimin, through which {{he was able to}} subdue two rival warlords, Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong. It is the major and final battle during the Luoyang-Hulao {{campaign}} between Tang, Zheng and Xia. The battle was fought at the strategically important Hulao Pass, east of Luoyang. Li Shimin led a siege on the city of Luoyang, seat of the self-declared emperor Wang Shichong, who solicited help from Dou Jiande from the east. However, Dou Jiande delayed and when he finally arrived, Li Shimin brought forces to meet the new threat. Li Shimin's army avoided conflict until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted and then led a cavalry charge, breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande. Afterwards, Wang Shichong, seeing no other choice, surrendered Luoyang, and both his and Dou Jiande's states were absorbed by the Tang. Dou Jiande was later executed, resulting in some of his followers, led by Liu Heita, <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> unsuccessful rebellion against the Tang. Hulao marked the decisive turning point in the civil wars that followed the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, after which the eventual victory of the Tang was never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E

5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E
