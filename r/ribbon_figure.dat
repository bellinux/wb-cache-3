50|$|Quarter-sawn boards {{have greater}} {{stability}} {{of form and}} size with less cupping, shrinkage across the width, shake and splitting, and other good qualities. In some woods, such as oak, the grain produces a decorative effect which shows a prominent ray fleck and sapele is likely to produce a <b>ribbon</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E
40|$|A 73 -year-old woman {{presented}} with 6 weeks of pro-gressive confusion and visual hallucinations. On ex-amination, she had moderately impaired attention, concentration, and memory; mild left hemiparesis; dysmetria; and visual and sensory neglect. No my-oclonus was observed. MRI showed restricted dif-fusion along the right hemispheric cortical <b>ribbon</b> (<b>figure</b> 1). Periodic sharp waves were lateralized {{to the right}} hemisphere on EEG (figure 2 A). Protein 14 – 3 - 3 was detected in the CSF. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) was confirmed by brain bi-opsy (figure 2 B). Although CJD is typically associated with diffuse cerebral pathology, 1 it can present with unilateral neurologic symptoms and concordant MRI and EEG findings...|$|E
50|$|This is a {{traditional}} dance that was danced only men in 25 July {{in honor of the}} apostle James since 1652, and that the settlers religious evangelizers taught in the Christian faith in devotion to God. Years later was in honor of the Lord of Chapel. The name of contradanza comes from the use of two rose sticks (rosa gallica) that have colored <b>ribbons</b> with <b>figures</b> that become the rhythm of the dance steps.|$|R
25|$|St. Peter and St. Paul's {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied churches in Lithuania. The main author of the decor plan is not known. It could be the founder Pac, monks of the Lateran, or Italian artists. No {{documents}} survive to explain the ideas behind the decorations, therefore various art historians attempted to find one central theme: Pac's life and Polish–Lithuanian relations, teachings of Saint Augustine, Baroque theater, etc. Art historian Birutė Rūta Vitkauskienė identified several main themes of the decor: structure of the Church as proclaimed at the Council of Trent with Saint Peter as the founding rock, early Christian martyrs representing Pac's interest in knighthood and ladyship, themes relevant to the Canons Regular of the Lateran, and themes inherited from previous churches (painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and altar of Five Wounds of Christ). The decor combines a great variety of symbols, from local (patron of Vilnius Saint Christopher) to Italian saints (Fidelis of Como), from specific saints to allegories of virtues. There are many decorative elements – floral (acanthus, sunflowers, rues, fruits), various objects (military weapons, household tools, liturgical implements, shells, <b>ribbons),</b> <b>figures</b> (puttos, angels, soldiers), fantastical creatures (demons, dragons, centaurs), Pac's coat of arms, masks making various expressions – but they are individualized, rarely repeating. The architects and sculptors borrowed ideas from other churches in Poland (Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków, Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral) and Italy (St. Peter's Basilica, Church of the Gesù).|$|R

The {{absolute}} {{value of the}} Fermi level was then evaluated for all data points collected on the right <b>ribbon</b> (see <b>Figure</b> 1), giving {{absolute value}}s between 200 and 350 meV. It corresponds to a doping level between 3 × 1012 and 9 × 1012 cm- 2 {{with an average of}} 6 × 1012 cm- 2. We have not checked directly on the same ribbon but transport measurements performed on few similar ones [28] gave a hole concentration of 5 × 1012 cm- 2. According to the work of [37] such concentration is also in excellent agreement with the G and 2 D band positions.|$|R
50|$|The domains founds in Long chain fatty acyl CoA {{synthetase}} {{are shown}} {{both in the}} enzyme view (figure 6) and sequence view (figure 7). LC-FACS has five domains. After searching 1v26 in Entrez, {{the location of the}} 5 domains was shown and was used to create figure 6 and 7. The <b>ribbons</b> colors in <b>figure</b> 6 correspond to the colors of the figure 7.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Arthur M. Lesk and {{co-workers}} first enabled automatic generation of ribbon diagrams through a computational implementation that uses Protein Data Bank files as input. This conceptually simple algorithm fit cubic polynomial B-spline curves to the peptide planes. Most modern graphics systems provide either B-splines or Hermite splines {{as a basic}} drawing primitive. One type of spline implementation passes through each Cα guide point, producing an exact but choppy curve. Both hand-drawn and most computer ribbons (such as those shown here) are smoothed over about 4 successive guide points (usually the peptide midpoint), to produce a more visually pleasing and understandable representation. In order to give the right radius for helical spirals while preserving smooth β-strands, the splines can be modified by offsets proportional to local curvature, as first developed by Mike Carson for his <b>Ribbons</b> program (<b>figure</b> at right) and later adapted by other molecular graphics software, such as the open-source Mage program for kinemage graphics that produced the ribbon image at top right (other examples: 1xk8 trimer and DNA polymerase).|$|R
40|$|Supplemental Figures S 1 and S 2 are {{the control}} {{experiments}} {{for the two}} sine wave technology. They are essential to validate {{the use of the}} technique for investigating release kinetics and in particular for demonstrating the nonlinear release component is related to vesicle fusion. These figures are essentially the controls for Figures 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the main text. Supplemental Figure S 3 uses a mathematical model, also used in Figure 8 of the text, to corroborate both the methodology used and the underlying conclusions drawn from the data. Movie S 1 (also called Supplemental Figure S 4) is the movie illustrating the methodology used to quantify the immunocytochemistry. This movie is available with the article online. Supplemental Figure S 5 also validates the immunohistochemistry methodology used for identifying <b>ribbon</b> synapses. Supplemental <b>Figure</b> S 6 provides the raw data examples of release rates measured between high and low frequency cells and also the effects of different internal calcium buffers on release rates for individual cells. Supplemental Figure S 7 provides calcium imaging data for a cell that with small stimulations did not show superlinear relase and with larger stimulations did...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the usual}} cloudless, dazzling, Californian summer day, {{tempered}} with the asperity of the northwest trades that Miss Tish, looking through her window towards the rose-embowered gateway of the seminary, saw an extraordinary figure advancing up the avenue. It {{was that of a}} man slightly past middle age, yet erect and jaunty, whose costume recalled the early water-color portraits of her own youthful days. His tightly buttoned blue frock coat with gilt buttons was opened far enough across the chest to allow the expanding of a frilled shirt, black stock, and nankeen waistcoat, and his immaculate white trousers were smartly strapped over his smart varnished boots. A white bell-crowned hat, carried in his hand to permit the wiping of his forehead with a silk handkerchief, and a gold-headed walking stick hooked over his arm, completed this singular equipment. He was followed, a few paces in the rear, by a negro carrying an enormous bouquet, and a number of small boxes and parcels tied up with <b>ribbons.</b> As the <b>figure</b> paused before the door, Miss Tish gasped, and cast a quick restraining glance around the classroom. But it was too late; a dozen pairs of blue, black, round, inquiring, or mischievous eyes were already dancing and gloating over the bizarre stranger through the window.|$|R
