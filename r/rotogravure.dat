25|$|Boardman's three pence <b>rotogravure</b> series began monthly {{production}} in February 1948. Issues were twelve pages long and used both {{front and back}} covers as story pages. They were printed in three colours (generally black, white, and red or green) on clay coated paper and saddle-stitched at the spine. In American publishing, they most closely resemble Will Eisner's Spirit Sunday newspaper inserts. Mildly inspired by Alex Raymond, Denis and Colin filled the first seven issues with the adventures of detective Roy Carson and adventure/science fiction hero Swift Morgan alternately. Although titles changed with each issue, numbering remained consistent to the entire series. Issue eight saw the addition of Lennart Ek's Buffalo Bill reprinted from a Swiss source but always repackaged by Denis. Eventually, Denis would create some original Buffalo Bill stories for the series but his involvement with other projects for Boardman caused the reprint content of the <b>rotogravure</b> series to increase. Still holding the rights to material from Quality Comics, Blackhawk (at least sixteen issues) and the Spirit (probably only two issues) {{were added to the}} rotation of titles. These reprints were always repackaged by Denis McLoughlin. The twelve-page <b>rotogravure</b> format lasted for 44 issues until October 1951. In February 1953, the series numbering continued but with color covers and black & white interiors until probably sometime in 1954. It seems possible that number 61, featuring Blackhawk, was the last issue. Rebound newsagent returns of the <b>rotogravure</b> series were released as Super Colour Annuals (there were three, 1949–1951).|$|E

2500|$|On 29 September, at McCartney's The Mill studio, McCartney, Starr, Hudson, Emerick and Paul Wright {{worked on}} the track [...] "La De Da", which McCartney contributed bass and backing vocals to. This session was filmed by Grakal, and {{excerpts}} were later featured in the music video for the song. Also recorded was a new bass track for [...] "What in the... World" [...] replacing the placeholder bass track from a July session. Upon hearing a playback of the track, McCartney remarked [...] "Whoo ... Rich! Sounds kinda Beatle-ish!" [...] to which Starr replied [...] "I know! That's what I said to Mark months ago". McCartney, now looking at Starr, told him [...] "You are a fucking Beatle!" [...] On 15 October, the same day Starr was in Paris to watch McCartney's daughter Stella's fashion show, string overdubs were added on to [...] "I'm Yours" [...] and [...] "King of Broken Hearts" [...] at AIR Studios, located in London. Starr returned to Los Angeles on 1 November to add overdubs to the latest recorded material, and on 3 November, he recorded [...] "I Was Walkin'". On 4 November, [...] "The Puppet Song" [...] was recorded. The song had originated from a comment by Starr ("Put the puppet to bed"), and would be renamed to [...] "Puppet". On 6 November, [...] "Sometimes" [...] was recorded, which contained a riff taken from Ringo's <b>Rotogravures</b> (1976) [...] "Cryin'".|$|R

500|$|Starr {{was another}} admirer of the song, {{describing}} {{it in an}} NME interview as [...] "a big ballady thing" [...] and a track [...] "I've always loved". In April 1976, John Lennon and Paul McCartney had each agreed to donate a song {{and participate in the}} sessions for Ringo's <b>Rotogravure,</b> Starr's first album on Atlantic Records and Polydor. While he had been Starr's most frequent collaborator out of all of Starr's former bandmates after the Beatles' break-up, Harrison was unable to attend the sessions, since he was under pressure to deliver his first Dark Horse Records album, after being waylaid by hepatitis. Starr instead received his permission to record [...] "When Every Song Is Sung", now titled [...] "I'll Still Love You". Ringo's <b>Rotogravure</b> thereby became the second album by an ex-Beatle, after Starr's Ringo in 1973, to feature compositions by all four former members of the band.|$|E
500|$|Ringo's <b>Rotogravure</b> {{was issued}} on 17 September 1976 in Britain and {{ten days later}} in the United States, with [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] sequenced as the second track on side two of the LP. The US release coincided with {{heightened}} speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} Beatles reunion, following promoter Sid Bernstein's offer of $230 million for a single concert by the group. While Starr was often asked about his former bandmates' contributions to the album, he was frustrated by the media's preference for discussing the Beatles. Starr also dismissed the idea that Harrison's non-appearance on [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] was to avoid <b>Rotogravure</b> being seen as a work by [...] "The New Beatles'", as one interviewer had suggested. Although it was not selected for release as a single, Starr made a promotional film for the song, along with two other tracks from the album. The film clip, which was rarely seen at the time, shows Starr and a woman dancing together in a park in Hamburg.|$|E
500|$|Writing more recently, Robert Rodriguez {{describes}} [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] {{as one of}} {{the highlights}} of Ringo's <b>Rotogravure,</b> and evidence that [...] "when it came to George, Ringo was the recipient of his strongest giveaways". In his book on Harrison, for the Praeger Singer-Songwriter Collection, Ian Inglis writes dismissively of Starr's [...] "boisterous shouts" [...] of [...] "Yes I will" [...] and finds Mardin's production similarly unsuitable. Inglis laments that Harrison never revisited the song himself, adding: [...] "It has the potential, lyrically and musically, to become one of his loveliest creations. As it stands, it is an unfinished masterpiece." [...] In Simon Leng's estimation, [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] is among Harrison's finest love songs and it [...] "deserved better" [...] than the [...] "sub-Spector production" [...] of Starr's version. Alan Clayson similarly describes it as a Harrison composition that [...] " [...] every musical and lyrical qualification required of an evergreen like 'Yesterday' or his own 'Something'", yet the song received [...] "its burial" [...] beside the [...] "makeweight bagatelles" [...] on side two of <b>Rotogravure.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Still Love You" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} English {{musician}} George Harrison and first released in 1976 by his former Beatles bandmate Ringo Starr. Produced by Arif Mardin, the track appeared on Starr's debut album for Atlantic Records and Polydor, Ringo's <b>Rotogravure.</b> The composition had a long recording history before then, having been written in 1970 as [...] "Whenever", after which it was copyrighted with the title [...] "When Every Song Is Sung".|$|E
500|$|In November 1976 Starr {{appeared}} as a guest at the Band's farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary The Last Waltz. Also in 1976, Starr issued Ringo's <b>Rotogravure,</b> the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet <b>Rotogravure</b> and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, [...] "A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll" [...] (number 26) and a cover of [...] "Hey! Baby" [...] (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr's formula; {{the result was a}} curious blend of disco and 1970s pop, titled Ringo the 4th (1977). The album was a commercial disaster, failing to chart in the UK and peaking at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released Bad Boy, which reached a disappointing number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Starr {{has said}} that his {{favourite}} drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on Ringo and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For Ringo's <b>Rotogravure</b> in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as [...] "Thunder" [...] and Keltner as [...] "Lightnin'".|$|E
500|$|The <b>Rotogravure</b> {{sessions}} {{took place}} between April and July 1976, mostly at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. Arif Mardin produced the album, since Richard Perry, Starr's usual producer, was committed to another project. The musicians on [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] included pianist Jane Getz and a rhythm section comprising Starr and Jim Keltner (both on drums) and Voormann (on bass). Lon Van Eaton, a former Apple Records signing, played lead guitar on the track.|$|E
500|$|Together with John Lennon and Paul McCartney's {{respective}} contributions, the song's inclusion on <b>Rotogravure</b> {{marked the}} second occasion when Starr's former bandmates had each supplied {{a song for}} one of his albums, after Ringo in 1973. While Starr's rendition is often held in low regard, some commentators consider [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] to be one of Harrison's finest love songs and on a par with [...] "Something". Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "an unfinished masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|The ruling set {{new legal}} {{precedents}} {{and was a}} personal blow for Harrison, who admitted he was too [...] "paranoid" [...] to write anything new for some time afterwards. Early reaction {{in the music industry}} saw Little Richard claim for breach of copyright in a track recorded by the Beatles in 1964 for the Beatles for Sale album, as well as Ringo Starr credit songwriter Clifford T. Ward as the inspiration for his Ringo's <b>Rotogravure</b> song [...] "Lady Gaye". In the UK, the corresponding damages suit, brought by Peter Maurice Music, was swiftly settled out of court in July 1977.|$|E
500|$|As {{with its}} parent album, [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics. In {{one of the}} more favourable reviews, Ray Coleman of Melody Maker admired <b>Rotogravure</b> as [...] "a pleasing album of uncomplicated pop music" [...] and added that the song was [...] "simplicity itself", likening it to [...] "Something". Less impressed, Bob Woffinden of the NME said: [...] "'I'll Still Love You' is a song Harrison wrote some years back. Lyrics are dreadful, but the melody's quite pretty." [...] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner described the contributions from Starr's former bandmates as [...] "sound more like throwaways", in contrast with their [...] "inspired work" [...] on Ringo. Schaffner lamented that the treatment of [...] "I'll Still Love You" [...] was almost a [...] "Harrison parody", complete with Van Eaton's [...] "fluid imitation" [...] of the guitarist's playing style.|$|E
500|$|During {{the main}} {{sessions}} for All Things Must Pass, Harrison taped or routined early versions of [...] "You", [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "When Every Song Is Sung". Harrison offered these three songs to Ronnie Spector in February 1971 for her proposed (and soon abandoned) solo album on Apple Records. After releasing his own versions of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "You" [...] between 1973 and 1975, he offered [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] (since retitled [...] "I'll Still Love You") to former bandmate Ringo Starr for his 1976 album Ringo's <b>Rotogravure.</b> [...] "Woman Don't You Cry for Me", written in December 1969 {{as his first}} slide-guitar composition, was another song that Harrison revisited on Thirty Three & 1/3. Harrison included [...] "I Live for You" [...] as the only all-new bonus track on the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass. [...] "Down to the River" [...] remained unused until he reworked it as [...] "Rocking Chair in Hawaii" [...] for his final studio album, the posthumously released Brainwashed (2002).|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} high price, the comic {{was an immediate}} success; released on 14April 1950, and despite government paper quotas, the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. [...] Eight of its twenty pages were presented in four-colour <b>rotogravure.</b> [...] Eagle was designed to entertain and educate its readers; although a typical issue might contain such characters as Cavendish Brown, Harris Tweed, Jack O'Lantern, Storm Nelson and Luck of the Legion, it also included a special news section, a sports page, and school stories. [...] Each issue also featured a centre-spread full-colour cutaway illustration {{of a piece of}} machinery—the first detailed {{the inner workings of the}} British Rail 18000 locomotive. [...] Such high quality strips as Riders of the Range and P.C.49 helped ensure a weekly circulation of almost a million copies, but it was the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, which most captivated readers. [...] Created by Hampson—now a full-time staff artist with his own team—Dan Dare was the UK's first science-fiction comic strip of any significance. [...] Readers were thrilled by the square-jawed British spaceman's weekly exploits, and his struggles with The Mekon.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's {{only child}} with Ono, Sean, {{was born on}} 9 October 1975 (his thirty-fifth birthday), and he took {{on the role of}} househusband, {{beginning}} what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry during which he gave all his attention to his family. Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote [...] "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" [...] for Starr's Ringo's <b>Rotogravure</b> (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, [...] "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby {{as much as we can}} until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family." [...] During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed [...] "mad stuff", all of which would be published posthumously.|$|E
500|$|In October {{that year}} Morris sold The Anvil—by then selling about 3,560copies monthly—for £1,250, plus a £200 annual {{contract}} {{to continue as}} editor. [...] Morris wanted to produce a comic the pages {{of which would be}} filled with role models whose behaviour and moral outlook he felt was socially desirable. [...] Foreigners would not be depicted as either enemies or villains, and at least one child in any group of children would be from an ethnic minority. [...] Religious values would not be imposed upon the reader, although their underlying moral tones would be made obvious on each page. [...] These were innovative but somewhat risky ideas, as nothing similar existed in the market, [...] and Hulton therefore commissioned extensive research into the new comic, which by then, inspired by the design of her church lectern, had been christened Eagle by Hampson's wife. [...] Layout and typography were designed by Morris's friend, Ruari McLean, assisted by Charles Green, and faced with an initial print run of 1million copies, Aintree printer Eric Bemrose designed and built a new ten-unit <b>rotogravure</b> machine in about twelve weeks. [...] The comic was heavily publicised before its release; copies were mailed direct to several hundred thousand people who worked with children, and a [...] "Hunt the Eagle" [...] scheme was launched, whereby large papier-mâché golden eagles were set on top of several Humber Hawk cars, and toured across the UK. [...] Those who spotted an eagle were offered tokens worth 3d, which could be exchanged at newsagents for a free copy of Eagle.|$|E
