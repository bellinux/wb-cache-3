500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

When Murder Inc. arrives, their van reads: [...] "We <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> anybody $1.00. Midgets— price. Japs—FREE." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' she said, 'there's THAT to consider.' This {{brought the}} {{conversation}} to a close. Gudrun, almost angrily, took up her rubber and began to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> part of her drawing. Ursula stitched absorbedly.|$|E

6000|$|Bessie {{gave the}} kiss promptly, whispering, {{as she did}} so, 'I was so angry I <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> that picture with the turpentine. You aren't angry, are you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Bill; [...] "and there'd allus be {{something}} left {{to remind me}} of a very queer time, provided he lives to get out of it, which is doubtful. Cuttle-ink won't <b>rub</b> <b>out,</b> I'll warrant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to me," [...] she replied, {{leaning on}} him. [...] "I {{have no memory}} of you I would <b>rub</b> <b>out,</b> no, not the unhappiest one, for it was you, and that makes it dear. All memories, however sad, of loved ones become sweet, don't they, when we get far enough away from them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty fierce," [...] Jim agreed. [...] "A bush-fire's a big thing, but it doesn't grip {{you like}} the break up of the ice. When the river bursts the jam, the floes grind the rocks smooth and <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the pines. You can hear the wreck drive down the channel a day's journey off." ...|$|E

6000|$|Bessie {{gave the}} kiss promptly, whispering, {{as she did}} so, [...] "I was so angry I <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> that picture with the turpentine. You aren't angry, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{remembered that}} the {{handkerchief}} had last been used to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the fouled breach of a gun. The girl looked at the blur of red and black which resulted from my efforts, and frowned, then broke out into a rippling laugh. [...] "Beatrice said your ways were refreshingly primitive, and I think she was right," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|Seaforth {{appeared}} to check a groan. [...] "There {{are things that}} one can never quite <b>rub</b> <b>out.</b> I was twenty-three then, and now when it is five years ago, and she is alone in that horrible city, I must keep silent still. Harry, it's almost unendurable, but, because I must tell that story, to speak now would be to throw my last chance away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now,” said he, “you can <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the tally--all but one mark. I {{have paid}} you for {{fourteen}} loads, {{and you have}} wheeled in fifteen; so you have one mark {{to go to the}} new tally. You can go round to the shed, and find a wet cloth, and wipe out your marks clean, and then make one again, and leave it there for to-morrow.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing to show {{which way}} Wandle's gone," [...] he reported. [...] "Somebody's been {{along with a}} bob-sled not long ago and <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> his tracks. Anyhow, I'll take the shorter fork." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{the boys}} took the basket, and, {{after they had}} <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> the tally, they went and sat down by their sand-garden, and began to eat the bread and cheese very happily together.|$|R

6000|$|A little twinkle {{crept into}} Desmond's eyes. [...] "I {{never heard him}} called {{anything}} of that kind before. Lister, you see, is an unlicked colt, and nobody could have said very much to his credit until lately. Still, {{he seems to be}} making an effort to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> certain defects in his character, and if Miss Ratcliffe can only keep it up they may get along tolerably well together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To work in {{the schools}} after that I {{had to give up}} my business, of course. There was only one teacher who ever taught me anything; the others all seemed fools. This man would come and <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> what you'd done with his sleeve. I used to cry with rage--but I told him I could only learn from him, and he was so {{astonished}} that he got me into his class." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound the girls!" [...] said Bartley, [...] "there's always {{something}} {{the matter with}} them." [...] He rubbed {{his hand over his}} forehead, as if to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the dull pain there. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I must go to work myself, then." [...] He rose, and took hold of the lapels of his coat, to pull it off; but something in Bird's look arrested him. [...] "What is it?" [...] he asked.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{nutritional}} intake is {{an important}} aspect of the care of older people, particularly for those at risk of malnutrition. Current practice for monitoring food intake relies on hand written food charts that have several inadequacies. We describe the design and validation of a tool for computer-assisted visual assessment of patient food and nutrient intake. To estimate food consumption, the application compares the pixels the user <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> against predefined graphical masks. Weight of food consumed is calculated as a percentage of pixels <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> against pixels in the mask. Results suggest that the application may be a useful tool for the conservative assessment of nutritional intake in hospitals...|$|R
6000|$|So that evening, when Bob and Marianne {{had dropped}} in as usual, {{and while the}} {{customary}} work of drawing and <b>rubbing</b> <b>out</b> {{was going on at}} Mrs. Crowfield's sofa, I produced my paper and read as follows:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Alexis Taylor {{released}} a solo album in 2008 entitled <b>Rubbed</b> <b>Out,</b> which saw him focusing {{more on the}} fundamental sounds used by Hot Chip leading to a more downtempo and bluesy album than Taylor's works with Hot Chip.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it. It is her dear, impulsive, affectionate way. I knew {{it without}} asking, but I {{wanted to hear}} you say it. The petted wife knows she is loved, but she makes her husband tell her so every day, just for the joy of hearing it.... She used the pen this time. That is better; the pencil-marks could <b>rub</b> <b>out,</b> and I should grieve for that. Did you suggest that she use the pen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other man}} grew a trifle uneasy under his gaze. [...] "Of course," [...] he said, [...] "your word {{will do for}} me. Still, she was here, you see--and it's {{difficult}} to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> a lie with that much behind it. I'm afraid you'll find it stick to you both like glue, especially as her employers turned the girl out immediately. Anyway, I'll do what I can for you, and now about that other car-load and the cattle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} have," [...] {{retorted}} Valentine. [...] "Take another bit; the Academy grants supplementary chalk to ignorant students, who dig their {{lines on the}} paper, instead of drawing them. Now, break off a bit of that bread-crumb, and <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> what you have done. 'Buy a penny loaf, and rub it all out,' as Mr. Fuseli {{once said to me}} in the Schools of the Royal Academy, when I showed him my first drawing, and was excessively conceited about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wish to hurt you, Nat, {{but you see}} I can't {{afford to}} lose my money, so I guess we won't be {{partners}} any longer;" [...] and with that Tommy <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> the sign, [...] "T. Bangs & Co." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will wait; {{but as for}} the <b>rubbing</b> <b>out</b> of the mark, I take it {{that will}} be {{altogether}} beyond me. Do you think, Mrs. Fenwick, that no woman should ever, under any circumstances, marry one man when she loves another?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] Sam Hicks said, [...] "I vote we mount our {{horses and}} go right at them. I would rather {{do that and}} get <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> in a fair fight than lie here until they crawl up and finish us." ...|$|R
60|$|His arm {{touched her}} {{shoulder}} while he wrote. She colored a little, {{and glanced at}} him, playfully affecting to look very proud of his sentence of approval--then hurriedly resumed her drawing as their eyes met. He {{was sent back to}} his place by Valentine before he could write anything more. She took some of the bread-crumb near her to <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> what he had written--hesitated as her hand approached the lines--colored more deeply than before, and went on with her drawing, leaving the letters beneath it to remain just as young Thorpe had traced them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aweel, {{it may be}} sae; but we canna howk fort enow--we hae nae shules, {{for they}} hae taen them a' awa--and it's like some o' them will {{be sent back to}} fling the earth into the hole, and mak a' things trig again. But an ye'll sit down wi' me a while in the wood, I'se satisfy your honour that ye hae just lighted on the only man in the country that could hae tauld about Malcolm Misticot and his hidden treasure--But first we'll <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the letters on this board, for fear it tell tales." ...|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{the very}} same fact--that we use the right hand alone in writing--made the letters run the {{opposite}} way in the end; and the change {{was due to the}} use of ink and other pigments for staining papyrus, parchment, or paper. If the hand in this case moved from right to left it would of course smear what it had already written; and to prevent such untidy smudging of the words, the order of writing was reversed from left rightward. The use of wax tablets also, no doubt, helped forward the revolution, for in this case, too, the hand would cover and <b>rub</b> <b>out</b> the words written.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{must take}} care of the names, old lady,' said Mr Boffin. 'We must {{take care of}} the names. They shan't be <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> in our time, nor yet, if we can help it, in the time after us. Poor little children!' ...|$|R
60|$|When I told him, he laughed. In {{the same}} odd way, yet {{with the same}} rapidity, he then {{produced}} singly, and <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> singly, the letters forming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also read; and he laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like a prince, man," [...] said Inglis. [...] "Evandale {{is the man}} {{on earth}} whom he hates worst, and he fears him, besides, about some law business; and were he once <b>rubbed</b> <b>out</b> of the way, all, he thinks, will be his own." ...|$|R
