The word soaring is also used for the sport. which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers {{in the rest of}} the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney, {{the creator}} of the {{concepts}} for Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad, always had a strong fondness for trains. As a young boy, he wanted to become a train engineer like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who told him stories about his experiences driving main-line trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As a teenager, he obtained a news butcher job on the Missouri Pacific Railway, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. Many years later, after co-founding the Walt Disney Company with his older brother Roy O. Disney, he started playing polo. Fractured vertebrae and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer <b>recreational</b> <b>activity.</b> Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in model trains after purchasing several Lionel train sets.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} how much self-determination persons with intellectual disabilities living in group-homes have when it comes to <b>recreational</b> <b>activities.</b> We studied what the <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> looked like, if there was any self-determination concerning <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> and which factors influenced self-determination for persons with intellectual disabilities. We used qualitative interviews with persons with intellectual disabilities, next of kin and personnel at group-homes. The result has been analyzed from earlier research, central concepts as self-determination and <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> and the theory of empowerment. The most important results that emerged in our study were; that <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> for persons with intellectual disabilities varied substantially, that there is a large number of to <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> available and no one seemed directly displeased with their <b>recreational</b> <b>activities.</b> Organized <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> mostly took place in segregated environments. This circumstance led to discussions within the interview-groups. The interviewed persons were of the opinion that there existed self-determination concerning <b>recreational</b> <b>activities,</b> however, there were many factors influencing the degree of self-determination. These factors were; the level of intellectual disability, the personnel at group-homes, organisation and personnel-resources, economy and public communications...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if having the ability to swim effects one's overall quality of life and water recreational participation. Subjects were 46 residents from TODCO senior housing that ranged in age from 65 to 93 years old. The mean age was 72. 3 years old. Their overall quality of life was measured using Ferrans' and Powers' Quality of Life Index. Participants were also asked about swimming ability and what water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> they have participated in the past and what water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> they were currently participating in. The results indicated that the ability to swim did not effect one's quality of life. There was a significant difference between the number of water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> that swimmers participated in compared to those participated in by non-swimmers. Swimmers reported that they participated in more water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> than non-swimmers. The findings suggest that being able to swim allows one to be able to participate in more water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
30|$|Behind {{the idea}} of {{widening}} children’s perspectives, some professionals specifically mentioned {{the inability of the}} educational system to stem the production of inequalities.

In this perspective, the institutional triangle is acknowledged: home, school and <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> all form places for educational experiences.|$|R
