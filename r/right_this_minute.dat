500|$|Reviewers {{observed}} that religion plays an influential role in Marty's moral decisions. After Marty takes a forbidden bite from his sister Dara Lynn's chocolate Easter rabbit {{and refuses to}} own up, his mother is disappointed. She tells him: [...] "Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't know who did it, but Jesus knows. And <b>right</b> <b>this</b> <b>minute</b> Jesus is looking down with the saddest eyes on the person who ate that chocolate." [...] Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be [...] "separated forever from God's love." ...|$|E

Come along," [...] cried Bab, bravely, bent on keeping her word, though it looked much harder after the fun was all over than before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not let bygones be bygones, an' {{all of us}} {{join forces}} ag'in' these murderin' heathen? There won't be any {{too many of us}} at best--Red an' Wison seen more'n two thousan' of the man-eatin' devils. They're a-creepin' up on us from behin' <b>right</b> <b>this</b> <b>minute,</b> an' you can lay to that; an' the chances are that they got some special kind o' route into that there cove, an' maybe they're a-watchin' of you right now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing that I haven't {{anything}} in particular to do, I don't know but I will," [...] replied Old Man Coyote, {{who happened to be}} feeling very good-natured. [...] "Many and many a time I have chased Yap-Yap into his house. Seems as if I can hear the rascal scolding me and calling me names <b>right</b> <b>this</b> <b>minute.</b> He used to get me so provoked that it was all I could do to keep from trying to dig him out." ...|$|E

Even at breakfast he thought the whole thing was a grand joke. I suppose <b>right</b> <b>this</b> <b>minute</b> he's going around town boasting about his 'conquest.' You understand--oh, DON'T you understand? I DID keep him away! But I don't see how I can face my school. They say country towns are fine for bringing up boys in, but----I can't believe this is me, lying here and saying this. I don't BELIEVE what happened last night.|$|E

40|$|TutorialOf the {{numerous}} process centrifugal pumps undergoing repair <b>right</b> <b>this</b> very <b>minute,</b> an estimated 90 % have failed randomly before. Some have run just fine {{until the very}} first repair {{two or three years}} after startup, and were never quite the same since after the first repair. Other pumps failed frequently or randomly? perhaps once a year [...] from the time they were originally commissioned. That brings up such questions as: Could it be we don?t really know why many process pumps are failing? Could it be we just don?t give pumps the attention they deserve? Is it because everybody?s priorities are elsewhere? Or are there perhaps elusive failure reasons, i. e., factors overlooked by all parties? Fortunately, improvement is both possible and cost-justified. Allowing repeat failures on process pumps rarely makes economic sense. Simple benefit-to-cost or life cycle analyses will easily demonstrate that the pursuit of remedial action greatly benefits users...|$|R

[...] "She stayed playing with Diana {{more than half an}} hour more'n I gave her leave to; and now she's perched out there on the woodpile talking to Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work. And of course he's listening to her like a perfect ninny. I never saw such an infatuated man. The more she talks and the odder the things she says, the more he's delighted evidently. Anne Shirley, you come <b>right</b> in here <b>this</b> <b>minute,</b> do you hear me!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Montreal-based {{saxophone}} {{player and}} composer Colin Stetsons 2013 album New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light included a song entitled [...] "Part of Me Apart From You". Though not explicitly {{written about the}} 52-hertz whale, when first performing the song live, he remarked on at least several occasions {{that the story of}} the [...] "loneliest whale" [...] resonated deeply with his composition.
