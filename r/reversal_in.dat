5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of Chromosomal translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> mice. These findings later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> humans.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time <b>reversal.</b> <b>In</b> the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|Global dimming is {{the gradual}} {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface that was observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, after discounting an anomaly caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a very slight <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> the overall trend has been observed.|$|E

40|$|What are {{the factors}} that explain <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> the {{implementation}} of structural reforms? Our main hypothesis is that <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> different reforms are driven by different factors. This paper uses new reform indicators and presents novel evidence showing that (a) FDI inflows {{reduce the likelihood of}} privatization reversals, (b) worsened terms of trade increase the probability of external liberalization reversals and (c) labour strikes propel <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> the liberalization of wages and prices...|$|R

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} large difference in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson {{turned her}} {{attention}} to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle <b>reversal,</b> <b>in</b> which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of sexual reproduction process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The November 1959 {{uprising}} and {{the subsequent}} fighting between Hutu and Tutsi began the revolution, but according to Carney it was the Belgian response which ensured that it {{would result in a}} permanent <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> the role of the two groups, with the Hutu emerging in power. The single biggest decision maker in this response was Colonel Guy Logiest, a Belgian army colonel working in the Congo with the Force Publique. Logiest was a personal friend of Ruanda-Urundi governor Jean-Paul Harroy, and had already been asked, {{before the start of the}} revolution, to come to Rwanda to evaluate Belgium's military options in the colony. Following the outbreak of violence, Logiest accelerated his departure from the Congo, arriving in Rwanda on 4 November. Logiest arrived with a number of soldiers and paratroopers and was tasked with re-establishing civil order.|$|E
5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E

5|$|Djokovic and Murray {{appeared}} in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray {{had won the}} last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4–0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him making too many unforced errors.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a <b>reversal</b> <b>in</b> Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E

40|$|E. R. クルチウスによれば、「さかさまの世界」(mundus inversus) というトポスは、ヨーロッパにおいては古代より存在するという。(1) それは文学作品にかぎらず、もっと広く俗謡や絵画などの民衆芸術のなかにも、繰り返し現れている。古代から中世を経て近代に至るまで、幅広く出現したこの「あべこべの世界」 (the world upside-down,topsyturvy world) のイメージは、地理的に見ても、イギリス、フランス、オランダ、ドイツ、イタリア、ロシア、スカンジナヴイア半島など広範な社会に及んでいる。(2) 興味あることには、江戸時代末期の戯作者、鶴屋南北の作品「東海道四谷怪談」や「盟三五大切」にもこの「あべこべの世界」が極めてグロテスクに描かれている。またこれは 16 世紀のドイツに登場したハンス・ザックスの謝肉祭劇にも見られるが、本論文では、主としてイギリスのエリザベス朝からジェイムス一世の時代にかけて活躍したシェイクスピアとベン・ジョンソンの戯曲を中心にこの問題を考えてみたい。""The topos of mundus inversus is {{an ancient}} and wide-spread one, found in popular art and {{literature}} throughout Europe from classical times. The most common image {{is that of a}} global man standing on his head and thrusting his legs upward. Images of the world upside-down are divided into three groups. The first shows cosmic upsets: fish flying in the air,men hunting on horseback across the sea. The second shows <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> the normal relationships between animals and men: an ox cutting up a butcher,an ass riding on his master's back. The third category shows <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> the normal relationships between people. Although the third category is most important {{from the point of view}} of stage comedy, the second one can be used to express the symbolic inversion in human society. We find a variety of <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> man and wife, father and daughter, master and servant relations. KING LEAR is rich <b>in</b> such <b>reversals.</b> But <b>in</b> TWELFTH NIGHT and EPICOENE we find androgynous characters such as Viola-Cesario,and Epicoene. In the Kabuki theater, KAMIKAKETE-SANGO-TAISETSU and SAKURAHIME-AZUMA-BUNSHO written by Tsuruya Nanboku show other kinds of <b>reversals,</b> <b>in</b> which an enemy turns out to be an benefactor,or an heroine of noble birth appears on the scene as a whore. The fact that man can imagine such impossibilities denotes man's remarkable ability. This unique capability of conceiving non-existent worlds is vital to man. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} momentum and <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> international stock market indices.

Positive currency momentum predicts low stock index returns in the future, thereby weakening momentum and strengthening <b>reversals</b> <b>in</b> U. S. dollar-denominated stock index returns. Cross-sectional regression tests involving individual stock indices confirm the portfolio findings. Our results are consistent with a key prediction of recent behavioral theories, that initial momentum should be accompanied by subsequent reversals. ...|$|R
