40|$|Wave packet {{phenomena}} in Rydberg atoms represent {{the scope of}} the present work. In the centre of interest are on the one hand the suppression of dispersion of radial <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets in two-electron atoms {{and on the other hand}} the laser excitation of angular <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets in one-electron atoms. Radial <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets in two-electron atoms can be stabilized against dispersion by applying a suitable laser field which induces Rabi oscillations of the atomic core. This procedure gives rise to slowly decaying but nondispersing radial <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets. Calcium serves as a realistic model for a quantitative investigation of this stabilization effect. The investigation focusses on the spontaneous emission of the core. It shows that stabilized wave packets with low mean principle quantum numbers are practically unaffected by spontaneous decay. In the case of highly excited wave packets, however, the stabilization effect is impaired by the spontaneous emission of the core. Therefore an extension of the original system is proposed and investigated. It rests upon the application of two laser fields driving the core in lambda configuration and thereby inducing Rabi-like oscillations between a stable and a metastable state of the core. In this extended system nondispersing radial <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets can be observed which are practically unaffected by spontaneous decay. Furthermore, the question is addressed whether an angular <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packet can be excited in a one-electron atom by a single laser pulse with suitable frequency, intensity and duration. Hydrogen is used as a realistic model for thorough calculations within the dipole approximation, which is a very rough but for technical reasons inevitable approximation in the present system. The calculations do not indicate any mixing of angular momentum quantum numbers in the case of moderate laser intensities. Therefore an extended excitation scheme, which consists of the application of two consecutive laser pulses, is proposed and investigated. The first laser pulse excites a radial <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packet. The second laser pulse possesses a frequency, which is sufficiently small to induce Raman-like transitions between the Rydberg states even in the case of moderate laser intensities. In this system, the performed calculations within the dipole approximation are completely valid and show mixing of the angular momentum quantum numbers due to the Raman-like transitions.

These observations are a clear signature of the asymmetric localization of electrons recaptured into high-lying Rydberg states after conclusion of the laser pulse and are supported by a semiclassical simulation of argon-OTC laser interaction.

40|$|The revival {{structure}} of Stark wave packets is considered. These wave packets have energies depending on two quantum numbers and {{are characterized by}} two sets of classical periods and revival times. The additional time scales result in revival structures {{different from those of}} free <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets. We show that Stark wave packets can exhibit fractional revivals. We also show that these wave packets exhibit particular features unique to the Stark effect. For instance, the wave functions can be separated into distinct sums over even and odd values of the principal quantum number. These even and odd superpositions interfere in different ways, which results in unexpected periodicities in the interferograms of Stark wave packets. A free <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packet, i. e., one evolving in the absence of external fields, initially follows the motion of a charged particle in a Coulomb field. However, after several cycles it collapses and a cycle of full and fractional revivals and superrevivals commences [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This behavior holds not only for hydrogenic wave packets but also for wave packets in alkali-metal atoms [7], where the energies have quantum defects causing shifts in the classical period and in the revival and superrevival times. Theoretical descriptions of these wave packets as squeezed states are known [8].

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>Rydberg</b> <b>wave</b> packets in NO are investigated in the regime where the electronic period is comparable with the rotational {{motion of the}} molecular ion core. The presence of a rotating molecular core manifests itself in the wave packet dynamics {{as a series of}} peaks separated by the rotational beat period T ROT, but offset by ΔμT ROT, where Δμ is the difference in quantum defect between the two dominant Rydberg series in the superposition. We rationalize this by treating the {{dynamics of}} a wave packet created from a coherent superposition of two interleaved Rydberg series as two separate electron wave packets, which interfere with one another when they overlap spatially. There is a periodic phase difference between the two wave packets that depends on the rotational energy of the core in each Rydberg series and also on the quantum defects. The resulting interference pattern in the Rydberg population manifests itself as peaks in the wave packet spectrum at the stroboscopic period. Copyright 2003 American Institute of Physics.
