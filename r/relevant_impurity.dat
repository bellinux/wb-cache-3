The new high-efficiency XUV overview spectrometer (HEXOS) system covers the wavelength range from 2. 5 to 160 nm, divided into four subsections with some overlapping, thus achieving a complete coverage of prominent spectral lines from the <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> elements. Taking into account spectrometer geometries and detector geometries, toroidal holographic diffraction gratings are numerically optimized to maximize the total throughput while maintaining good spectral resolution. The performance of the spectrometers is tested and optimized by means of ray tracing calculations. In order to prove the potential for line identification as well as the expected levels of signal intensity and noise figures of the new systems, spectra are simulated using the impurity transport code STRAHL. Under typical plasma conditions on W 7 -X the new spectrometers will allow clear identification of all <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> elements in the plasma. The large collected photon flux results in a high accuracy for the measured line intensities, even when operating the spectrometers at spectra rates of 1000 /s.

The two impurity model {{is used as a}} paradigm to understand these effects analytically and in interpreting numerical solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations on fully disordered systems. We focus primarily on the globally particle-hole symmetric model which {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy, and give evidence that a zero-energy delta function exists in the DOS. The anomalous spectral weight at zero energy is seen to arise from resonant impurity states belonging to a particular sublattice, exactly as in the 2 -impurity version of this model.

The spectrum of resonances and the nonlinear I-V curves allow to measure the charging energy and the mean level energy spacing for electrons in the localized state.

40|$|AbstractStringent {{requirements}} {{are in place}} for the evaluation and registration of new compounds with biocidal or pesticidal activities. However, the registration requirements for established compounds from new suppliers or for established compounds produced by a different manufacturing process have been less clear and ambiguity exists as to how ‘equivalence of health hazards’ can unequivocally be demonstrated analytically and by toxicological assays. The case presented in this analysis focuses on the chiral pyrethroid transfluthrin (TFL) synthesized by esterification of an acid chloride and alcoholic moiety. According to any modifications of the process of synthesis and purification, new potentially highly toxic and yet chemically reactive impurities in low concentrations (< 0. 1 %) may be formed. Amongst these, that with the structural alert ‘organic acid anhydride’ was given heightened concern as the most potent putative toxicologically significant impurity. The course taken in this analysis focused on the comparison of reference TFL with commercialized generic TFL from two alternative manufacturing sources in India and China. Despite their apparent high racemic purity, TFLs from generic sources were biologically less effective, genotoxic in the Ames’ assay, demonstrated sensory lung irritation and lung/skin sensitization in specialized bioassays. While the off-patent reference TFL was unequivocally negative in all assays (anhydride content not detectable, LOQ < 0. 01 %), positive results with high batch-to-batch variability were a frequent outcome in generic TFLs. Tier I analytical assays failed to detect this <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> in the absence of impurity-specific optimized analytical procedures. This finding suggests that a well-balanced combined approach of analytical and toxicological assays provides the best means to assure that all critical impurities are identified and accounted for.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of an atomic quantum dot (AQD) coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) via particle exchange and interactions. This is motivated {{by the possibility of}} using such a system as a non-destructive probe of the BEC. A review of the physics of a BEC and <b>relevant</b> <b>impurity</b> models is presented. The collisional blockade regime of the AQD is considered, and the AQD is modelled as a spin- 1 / 2 pseudospin. Having expressed the BEC in terms of number and phase, the semi-classical ground state of the system is determined. The fluctuations in number and phase around this ground state are assumed to be small. Using Fermi's golden rule, the decay rates of the system are calculated. The system dynamics are found to be highly dependent on dimensionality and the coupling between AQD and BEC. Having derived the action for this system, it is found that the small phase fluctuation assumption fails in two dimensions and for certain limits in three dimensions. We attempt to circumvent this difficulty using a canonical transformation. The resulting system is related to a biased spin-boson model. Expressing the pseudospin in terms of Schwinger bosons, the self energy for this system is determined. Green's functions for the system are derived by solving Dyson's equation, and a decay rate is extracted. Determining the spin-spin temporal correlation functions by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation is found to be intractable due to the Schwinger boson number constraint. The possibility of avoiding this problem using the Holstein-Primakoff representation in a large-S generalisation of the AQD states is explored. We find that the pseudospin precession can be controlled by tuning the coupling parameters and the interactions in the BEC. In particular, we found two unexpected regimes where the pseudospin precession can be slowed down to arbitrarily small frequencies. Open Acces...|$|E

It has long been established that water ice is the dominant species within many astrophysical ices. However, other molecules found within astrophysical ices, particularly methanol, can influence the desorption of volatile species from the ice. Here we present a detailed investigation of the adsorption and desorption of methanol-containing ices, showing the effect that methanol has on the trapping and release of volatiles from model interstellar ices. OCS and CO 2 have been used as probe molecules since they have been suggested to reside in water-rich and methanol-rich environments. Experiments show that methanol fundamentally changes the desorption characteristics of both OCS and CO 2, leading to the observation of mainly codesorption of both species with bulk water ice for the tertiary ices and causing a lowering of the temperature of the volcano component of the desorption. In contrast, binary ices are dominated by standard volcano desorption. This observation clearly shows that codepositing astrophysically <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> with water ice, such as methanol, can alter the desorption dynamics of volatiles that become trapped in the pores of the amorphous water ice during the sublimation process. Incorporating experimental data into a simple model to simulate these processes on astrophysical timescales shows that the additional methanol component releases larger amounts of OCS from the ice mantle at lower temperatures and earlier times.

An up-to-date realization of these fixed points is based on cells containing metals of ultra-high purity (6 N or better) and should include a correction for the influence of <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities.</b> Still, chemical analyses of the fixed-point material can show large amounts of oxygen, which had to be neglected so far, {{because of the lack of}} detailed knowledge about it, presuming it could be removed from the cell by applying a vacuum (less than 1 Pa) for a few hours. In this paper we discuss an equilibrium of several forms of oxygen in a fixed-point cell, gaseous in the cell 2 ̆ 019 s atmosphere, dissolved in the fixed-point metal and as oxide in a separate (solid) phase. We will conclude that in many fixed points most of the oxygen is not dissolved in the metal, but bound in oxides of the fixed-point metal as well as oxides of some impurities. To demonstrate the impact that the precipitation of impurity oxides has on thermometry, two indium fixed-point cells were doped with magnesium and chromium, which leave the fixed-point temperature unchanged. Further evidence is drawn from earlier work. All these results support the presumed existence of (at least one) persistent separate oxide phase in the fixed points of indium, tin, zinc and aluminium, which renders them eutectic or peritectic points and is a more likely reason why the oxygen content of a cell does not influence the fixed-point temperature. To complement these studies, thermodynamic calculations show how to treat the equilibrium in the cell quantitatively. Using available chemical data, a list is provided that indicates for each fixed-point metal (including the other metal fixed points of the ITS- 90 : mercury, gold, copper) the impurities that probably build oxides.

40|$|Impurities {{from the}} CCS chain can greatly {{influence}} the physical properties of CO 2. This has important design, safety and cost {{implications for the}} compression, transport and storage of CO 2. There is an urgent need to understand and predict the properties of impure CO 2 to assist with CCS implementation. However, CCS presents demanding modelling requirements. A suitable model must both accurately and robustly predict CO 2 phase behaviour {{over a wide range}} of temperature and pressure, and maintain that predictive power for CO 2 mixtures with numerous, mutually interacting chemical species. A promising technique to address this task is molecular simulation. It offers a molecular approach, with foundations in firmly established physical principles, along with the potential to predict the wide range of physical properties required for CCS. The quality of predictions from molecular simulation depends on accurate force-fields to de- scribe the interactions between CO 2 and other molecules. Unfortunately, there is currently no universally applicable method to obtain force-fields suitable for molecular simulation. In this paper we present two methods of obtaining force-fields: the first being semi-empirical and the second using ab-initio quantum-chemical calculations. In the first approach we optimise the impurity force-field against measurements of the phase and pressure-volume behaviour of CO 2 binary mixtures with N 2, O 2, Ar and H 2. A gradient-free optimiser allows us to use the simulation itself as the underlying model. This leads to accurate and robust predictions under conditions relevant to CCS. In the second approach we use quantum-chemical calculations to produce ab-initio evaluations of the interactions between CO 2 and <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities,</b> taking N 2 as an exemplar. We use a modest number of these calculations to train a machine-learning algorithm, known as a Gaussian process, to describe these data. The resulting model is then able to accurately predict a much broader set of ab-initio force-field calculations at comparatively low numerical cost. Although our method is not yet ready to be implemented in a molecular simulation, we outline the necessary steps here. Such simulations have the potential to deliver first-principles simulation of the thermodynamic properties of impure CO 2, without fitting to experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The {{past two}} decades, {{germanium}} has drawn international attention {{as one of}} the most promising materials to replace silicon in semiconductor applications. Due to important advantages with respect to Si, such as the increased electron and hole mobility, Ge is well on its way to become an important material in future high-speed integrated circuits. Although the interest in this elemental group IV semiconductor is increasing rapidly nowadays, the number of publications about this material is still relatively scarce, especially when compared to Si. The most widely used technique to dope semiconductors is ion implantation, due to its good control of the dopant concentration and profile, and the isotopic purity of the implanted species. However, there is a major lack of knowledge of the fundamental properties of ion implantation in Ge, which has triggered the research presented in this thesis. One of the most important and generally unwanted properties of ion implantation is the creation of damage to the crystal lattice, ranging from simple point defects such as vacancies and self-interstitials, over small and large defect clusters to even fully amorphous layers of material. These structural defects give rise to electronic (deep) levels in the semiconductor band gap, altering the electrical properties of the material, eventually resulting in the degradation of the semiconductor device. During implantation, the energetic ions travel through the host material while losing energy and creating defects, until they come to rest and occupy a certain lattice site within the crystal structure. The exact location of the implanted ions is known to influence the (electrical, optical and magnetic) properties of the doped material to a large extent, which makes it a very important, but barely-studied topic in Ge. It is generally assumed that most impurities simply replace the Ge host atoms - i. e. they are located on a substitutional Ge site - but the lack of accurate results on this issue puts this assumption at least into question. In this work, we present an investigation of these two important ion implantation-related issues in germanium. First of all, we will study the accumulation of, and the recovery from implantation-induced defects in Ge, both from structural and from electrical point of view. Secondly, we present a detailed lattice location study of a number of <b>relevant</b> and interesting <b>impurities</b> in germanium. In chapter 1, the research presented in this thesis is situated in its scientific and technological context. First of all, the status of germanium throughout the semiconductor history is highlighted, starting at the late 40 s, followed by its revival during the past two decades and concluding with the current issues and problems to integrate Ge in the semiconductor technology. Secondly, the most widely used technique to dope semiconductors, i. e. ion implantation, is put forward, emphasizing the different types of implantation-induced defects. We also present an extended overview of the current knowledge of implantation-related damage in Ge. The third section of this chapter contains an overview of the most <b>relevant</b> <b>impurities</b> in Ge, i. e. electrical dopants, isovalent elements, metal impurities and optical dopants. The overall objectives of the thesis are explained in chapter 2. The sample preparation, which includes the ion implantation and the subsequent annealing process, is presented in chapter 3, while chapter 4 contains relevant information about the experimental methods that have been used in this research. First, the techniques to structurally and electrically characterize the implantation-induced damage are introduced - i. e. Rutherford backscattering and channeling spectrometry (RBS/C), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) - followed by emission channeling (EC) and ab initio calculations, which aim at studying the lattice location of implanted impurities. Finally, chapter 5 contains a short summary and a discussion of the results that have been obtained within the framework of this research.

In this paper, we analyse the local migration of carbon that originates from 13 CH 4 injected into these plasmas from the vertical outer target. Notable changes are observed in the local carbon deposition patterns when reversing the magnetic field in the experiments. Kinetic impurity-following simulations are performed using the 3 D ERO code package with 2 D background plasma solutions calculated with the SOLPS 5. 0 code package. The modelling shows that the measured changes are due to the changes in plasma collisionality, dissociation and ionization rates, and E × B drift of the impurities. These conditions affect the direction and rate of impurity migration inside and out of the divertor, having wider consequences on the global migration of impurities in a divertor tokamak. It is further shown, that the migration pathways are largely determined by carbon ions and, hence, <b>relevant</b> for <b>impurities</b> in general. Neutral carbon and hydrocarbons are deposited only in the near vicinity of the injection, where they affect the local re-deposition efficiency. In this limited region, a perturbation of the local plasma conditions by the methane puff appears likely, yielding a significant uncertainty for interpreting the deposition efficiencies.

Averaging over disorder, the static spin susceptibility tensor is evaluated diagrammatically in the mesoscopic (phase-coherent) regime. The disorder-averaged susceptibility leads to a twisted exchange interaction suppressed exponentially with distance, whereas the second-order correlations, which determine the fluctuations (variance) of the RKKY energy, decay with the same power-law as in the clean case. We obtain analytic expressions in the limits of large/small spin orbit interactions and for equal Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings. Beside these limiting cases, we study numerically the variance of the RKKY interaction {{in the presence of}} pure Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our results are <b>relevant</b> for magnetic <b>impurities</b> or nuclear moments embedded in III-V two-dimensional heterostructures or in contact with surface states of metals and metal alloys, which can display a sizable Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{facility was}} constructed {{to study the}} corrosion of alloys in helium containing part per million (ppm) levels of CO, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 as <b>impurities,</b> <b>relevant</b> to the environment in the heat exchanger of the Very High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor. The system provides the capability of exposing multiple specimens in up to seven separate helium environments, simultaneously, for durations of > 1000 h and temperatures up to 1200 deg C. Impurity concentrations are controlled down to 1 ppm accuracy and analyzed using a discharge ionization detector gas chromatograph. The utility and reliability of the facility in quantitatively accounting for the masses of reactants and products involved in the oxidation of alloy 617 at 900 deg C and 1000 deg C in the helium gas containing 15 ppm CO and 1. 5 ppm CO 2 is confirmed by the weight-gain measurements, gas-phase analysis and post-test microstructural analysis...|$|R
40|$|In magnets {{with strong}} quantum fluctuations, {{paramagnetic}} ground states {{with or without}} confinement of spinon excitations can be realized. Here we discuss the physics of the confined phase {{in the vicinity of}} a confinement [...] deconfinement transition: This regime, likely relevant to a multitude of frustrated spin systems, is characterized by multiple length scales: In addition to the magnetic correlation length, a confinement length can be defined, which can be probed, e. g., by local static measurements near non-magnetic impurities. We illustrate the ideas by explicit calculations for dimerized spin chains, but our qualitative results remain valid in higher dimensions as well. In particular, we study crossover from weak to strong confinement visible in the antiferromagnetic polarization cloud around a non-magnetic impurity. We also discuss the effective magnetic interaction between <b>impurities,</b> <b>relevant</b> for impurity-induced magnetic order, and consequences for nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron scattering experiments.

40|$|The {{reintroduction}} of superficially {{porous particles}} {{has resulted in}} a leap forward for the separation performance in liquid chromatography. The underlying reasons for the higher efficiency of columns packed with these particles are discussed. The performance of the newly introduced 5 Î¼m superficially porous particles is evaluated and compared to 2. 7 Î¼m superficially porous and 3. 5 and 5 Î¼m fully porous columns using typical test compounds (alkylphenones) and a <b>relevant</b> pharmaceutical compound (<b>impurity</b> of amoxicillin). The 5 Î¼m superficially porous particles provide a superior kinetic performance compared to both the 3. 5 and 5 Î¼m fully porous particles over the entire relevant range of separation conditions. The performance of the superficially porous particles, however, appears to depend strongly on retention and analyte properties, emphasizing the importance of comparing different columns under realistic conditions (high enough k) and using the compound of interest.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the scattering of a quantum particle with a two-dimensional (2 D) Rashba spin-orbit coupled dispersion off of circularly symmetric potentials. As {{the energy of}} the particle approaches the bottom of the lowest spin-split band, i. e., the van Hove singularity, earlier work has shown that scattering off of an infinite circular barrier exhibits a number of features unusual {{from the point of view}} of conventional 2 D scattering theory: the low-energy S-matrix is independent of the range of the potential, all partial waves contribute equally, the differential cross section becomes increasingly anisotropic and 1 D-like, and the total cross section exhibits quantized plateaus. Via a nonperturbative determination of the T-matrix and an optical theorem which we prove here, we show that this behavior is universal for Rashba scattering off of any circularly symmetric, spin independent, finite-range potential. This is <b>relevant</b> both for <b>impurity</b> scattering in the noninteracting limit as well as for short-range two-particle scattering in the interacting problem.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} verification of the assumption of ideality for mixtures of 22 Ne in 20 Ne by means of binary mixtures, artificially-produced and certified by weighing and whose full isotopic compositions were then measured at KRISS using a mass-spectrometer calibrated with these mixtures. Thermal measurements on the mixtures were performed at INRIM. The assessment of the validity of the ideality condition was critical to the conclusion of a comprehensive study on the effect of neon isotopic composition on the values of its triple point temperature. At KRISS three mixtures were prepared with 22 Ne amount concentrations 22 x = 62 088 (20) 10 ^- 6, 91 678 (22) 10 ^- 6 and 166 025 (26) 10 ^- 6 in 20 Ne, respectively, the intermediate one being very close to the range of ‘natural’ compositions. The thermal measurements were performed in the same INRIM experimental apparatus of previous published studies, with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 30 microK for a single sample and 50 microK for the comparison of sample pairs, using the same model of cryogenic metal sealed cell for each sample. The results, corrected for the measured, low, content of 21 Ne and of <b>relevant</b> chemical <b>impurities</b> (H 2 and N 2) showed an agreement with a theoretical model for the binary mixture assuming ideal behaviour within 10 microK, with a standard uncertainty of uc = 50 microK. These results allowed to construct a ternary mixture model for the actual neon isotopic composition, including 21 Ne, where the IUPAC recommended composition was used as the reference composition, and whose characteristics are discussed in the paper. This also allowed reassigning the T(tp, 90) values to all samples...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} {{for the absence of}} a gap in a class of S= 1 antiferromagnetic exchange models. The spin exchange is long-ranged of the type -(- 1) ^i-j/|i-j|^α where 1 <α< 3. We have shown previously that without the alternating factor the model for α= 2 (S= 1 Haldane-Shastry model) has a gap, exponentially decaying correlation functions and exponentially small susceptibility at very low temperatures. In the case of the alternated interaction the stabilizing next nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction changes qualitatively the behavior of the system. We have studied the groundstate and first excited state using a modified Lanczos algorithm for system sizes up to 16 sites. Also, we performed exact diagonalization for systems up to 8 sites and obtained the thermodynamics. The correlation functions decay with distance like a power law. These models define a new class of integer spin chains that do not show a Haldane gap. The results may be <b>relevant</b> to describe <b>impurity</b> spins coupled by a RKKY-interaction through a half-filled conduction-electron band.

40|$|We have derived the {{effective}} low energy Hamiltonian for Zn or Ni substituted high-T_c cuprates from microscopic three-band models {{consisting of the}} most <b>relevant</b> Cu or <b>impurity</b> 3 d and O 2 p orbitals. We find that both scattering potential and hopping integral induced by impurities have a finite range but decay very fast with distance from the impurity. The Zn scattering potential is very strong and attractive for electrons. The Ni scattering potential is much weaker than the Zn case, resulting from the hybridization between Ni ions and O holes. This profound difference is due to neither the electric charge nor d-level location, but rather because of the interplay between the valence state of the impurity and the strong correlation background. It gives a natural account for the unusual effect of Ni and Zn on the reduction of superconducting transition temperature. The interlayer hopping of electrons is highly anisotropic and nonlocal, determined by the in-plane electronic structure. This leads to a quantum interference of states from different sites and affects strongly the scanning tunneling spectrum perpendicular to CuO_ 2 planes.

40|$|Stability {{testing is}} an {{important}} tool to assess the quality of drug substances and products which may vary with time under influence of variety of factors such as temperature, humidity, and light. Stability studies of drugs are designed according to the climatic zones to establish a retest period for active drug substance or a shelf life for the finished product {{as well as to}} recommend the storage conditions. The strict regulatory requirements on designing, performing evaluating stability study to claim the expiry date, and shelf life of drug products are based on a series of regulatory requirements and advisory guidelines that have been developed by regulatory authorities of US, Europe, and Japan which; were harmonized through the development of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) procedures.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} single and multiple impurities on the Zeeman-localized, spin polarized bound states in dilute magnetic semiconductor hybrid system. Such bound states appear whenever a dilute magnetic semiconductor showing giant Zeeman effect is exposed to an external magnetic field showing nanoscale inhomogeneity. We consider the specific example of a superconductor-dilute magnetic semiconductor hybrid, calculate the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the bound states {{in the presence of}} a single impurity, and monitor the evolution of the bound state as a function of the impurity strength and impurity location with respect to the center of the Zeeman trapping potential. Our results have important experimental implications as they predict robust spin textures even for than than ideal samples. We find that for all realistic impurity strengths the Zeeman bound state survives the presence of the impurity. We also {{investigate the}} effect of a large number of impurities and perform ensemble averages with respect to the impurity locations. We find that the spin polarized Zeeman bound states are very robust, and they remain bound to the external field inhomogeneity throughout the experimentally <b>relevant</b> region of <b>impurity</b> concentration and scattering strength.
