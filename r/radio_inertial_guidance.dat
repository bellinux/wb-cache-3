500|$|Joseph Francis Shea (September 5, 1925 [...] February 14, 1999) was an American {{aerospace}} engineer and NASA manager. Born in the New York City borough of the Bronx, he was educated at the University of Michigan, receiving a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics in 1955. After working for Bell Labs on the <b>radio</b> <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> {{system of the}} Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile, {{he was hired by}} NASA in 1961. As Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea {{played a key role in}} shaping the course of the Apollo program, helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting [...] "all up" [...] testing of the Saturn V rocket. While sometimes causing controversy within the agency, Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as [...] "one of the greatest systems engineers of our time".|$|E

50|$|Early R-36s used radio ground {{guidance}} on the reasoning {{that it would}} be more accurate than <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance,</b> however, the engineers eventually scrapped this when they decided that <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> was good enough.|$|R
