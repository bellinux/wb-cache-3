50|$|The {{blood pump}} was {{patented}} in 1855 by Porter and Bradley and was hand operated. A modification first named surgical pump, designed and manufactured by E. E. Allen in 1887, {{was intended for}} direct blood transfusion. Truax, who also distributed and promoted the Allen pump with one roller, developed the first double <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> in 1899. In the following decades, several researchers, including Beck, Van Allen, Bayliss and Müller as well as Henry and Jouvelet, refined the apparatus and recommended the use of roller pumps for blood transfusion and other applications. After further modifications made by DeBakey in 1934, and application of this pump {{in one of the}} first heart-lung machines constructed by Gibbon, DeBakey's name became inseparably attached to this type of pump. For perfusion experiments, an electrically powered <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> was first used by Fleisch in 1935. Today, the <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> is the most frequently used blood pump for cardiopulmonary bypass worldwide, having prevailed against the early pulsatile tube compression pumps and ventricular pumps. In recent years, centrifugal pumps have increasingly competed with roller pumps as systemic blood pumps for cardiopulmonary bypass and have become the preferred arterial pump in a variety of centers. Application of mechanical cardiac assistance has evolved from nonpulsatile <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> support, followed by an era of pulsatile ventricular pumps to the rediscovery of the nonpulsatile flow mode with modern axial flow pumps.|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} {{with the}} hose <b>pumps</b> over the <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is the high}} operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a hose pump if the pumped medium is not abrasive. With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life and chemical compatibility, {{as well as the}} higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that hose <b>pumps</b> had over <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> continues to erode.|$|R
5000|$|The pump console usually {{comprises}} several rotating motor-driven pumps that peristaltically [...] "massage" [...] tubing. This action gently propels {{the blood}} through the tubing. This is {{commonly referred to}} as a <b>roller</b> <b>pump,</b> or peristaltic pump.|$|E
50|$|Many CPB {{circuits}} now {{employ a}} centrifugal pump {{for the maintenance}} and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by centrifugal force. This type of pumping action {{is considered to be}} superior to the action of the <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> by many because it is thought to produce less blood damage (hemolysis, etc.), but mostly due to the centrifugal pump being pressure limited, therefore less likely to rupture the system if a sudden occlusion occurs on the high-pressure line system.|$|E

The pump provided a continuous flow of blood during operations. This, in turn, made open-heart surgery possible.With his mentor, Alton Ochsner, he postulated in 1939 a strong link between smoking and carcinoma of the lung. DeBakey {{was one of the first}} to perform coronary artery bypass surgery, and in 1953 he performed the first successful carotid endarterectomy. A pioneer in the development of an artificial heart, DeBakey was the first to use an external heart pump successfully in a patient - a left ventricular bypass pump.|$|E

40|$|Objective: One of {{the major}} damages caused by {{occlusion}} in <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> is hemolysis. Comparative studies between <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> with non-occlusive adjustments and centrifugal pumps {{have been made in}} recent decades in an attempt to develop new products and adjustments that cause fewer traumas to the figurative elements of blood. Usually the <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> are adjusted by the static method due to concern variables flow that can occur with non-occlusive settings. Excessive slack in the rollers provokes back flow and can provides errors in the calculation of flow by the rotation of the pump, according to the devices added to the circuit and the systemic resistance of the patient. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the back flow caused by two types of <b>roller</b> <b>pumps</b> in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. Methods: Back flow visualization was performed in blood aspirator and cardiotomy reservoir. There were tested two different models of <b>roller</b> <b>pumps,</b> adjusted by drop rate and dynamic calibration. The tests were conducted with silicone tubes of 3 / 8 x 1 / 16 e 1 / 2 x 3 / 32 inches in diameter in water and solution similar to blood. Results: We recorded back flow visually in blood aspirator and in cardiotomy reservoir with their measure of values. The pumps had differences in refluxes measured adjusted by the dynamic calibration method. Pump# 2 presents back flow adjusted fully occluded. Conclusion: The back flow measured in two models of pump present differences (P < 0. 008). The results indicate differences in its characteristics caused by the process of manufacturing, design or possible wear. Non-occlusive adjustments may cause variations in flow with the increase of resistance added to the circuit, with difficulty to fix the flow by increasing the rotation...|$|R

50|$|Isolated limb {{perfusion}} {{was first}} introduced into the clinic by American surgeons from New Orleans in the mid-1950s. The main purpose of the isolated limb perfusion technique is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy, at elevated temperature, to tumour sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage. (Unfortunately, while these approaches can be useful against solitary or limited metastases, they are - by definition - not systemic and therefore do not treat distributed metastases or micrometastases). The flow of blood {{to and from the}} limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet, and anticancer drugs are put directly into the blood of the limb. This allows the person to receive a high dose of drugs in the area where the cancer occurred. The temperature is also increased to 42C causing an increased uptake of the drug by the tumor. The combination of high drug dose and high temperature is toxic systemically, thus the isolation of the limb. Blood flow through the limb is typically achieved using an extracorporeal circuit consisting of cannulae, tubing, peristaltic <b>roller</b> <b>pump,</b> heat exchanger, and pressure monitoring/safety devices. Care must be used in handling the drugs and waste material as they are extremely toxic. Among other types of cancer, isolated limb perfusion has been used to treat in transit metastatic melanoma.|$|E
40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) with a {{centrifugal pump}} requires a certain flow rate; therefore, its application for low body weight infants is frequently accompanied by oxygenator membrane malfunction and/or inadequate perfusion. To prevent low-flow associated complications, we report {{a case in}} which a novel system of dual roller pumps was used. A baby girl with a body mass index 0. 25 m 2, who experienced difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after a Norwood-like operation, required an ECMO. Concerns for the tube lifespan reduction due to <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> friction led to the use of a double <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> circulation. The termination of ECMO during tube exchange is not needed, because circulation is maintained by another <b>roller</b> <b>pump.</b> The novel strategy of ECMO with double roller pumps will allow low perfusion rate to provide adequate circulatory support for low body weight patients...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} potential determinants of drug loss in different ECMO circuits. Methods: Midazolam, morphine, fentanyl, paracetamol, cefazolin, meropenem and vancomycin were injected into three neonatal <b>roller</b> <b>pump,</b> two paediatric <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> and two clinically used neonatal <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> circuits, all with a silicone membrane, and two neonatal centrifugal pump circuits with polypropylene hollow-fibre membranes. Serial blood samples were taken from a post-oxygenator site. Drug recovery was calculated as the ratio between the determined and the theoretical maximum concentration. The latter was obtained by dividing dose by theoretical circuit volume. Results: Average drug recoveries at 180 min in three neonatal silicone membrane <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> circuits were midazolam 0. 62 %, morphine 23. 9 %, fentanyl 0. 35 %, paracetamol 34. 0 %, cefazolin 84. 3 %, meropenem 82. 9 % and vancomycin 67. 8 %. There was a significant correlation between the lipophilicity of the drug expressed as log P {{and the extent of}} drug absorption, p < 0. 001. The recovery of midazolam and fentanyl in centrifugal pump circuits with hollow-fibre membrane oxygenator was significantly higher compared to neonatal <b>roller</b> <b>pump</b> circuits with silicone membranes: midazolam 63. 4 versus 0. 62 %, fentanyl 33. 8 versus 0. 35 %, p < 0. 001. Oxygenator size and used circuits do not significantly affect drug losses. Conclusions: Significant absorption of drugs occurs in the ECMO circuit, correlating with increased lipophilicity of the drug. Centrifugal pump circuits with hollow-fibre membrane oxygenators show less absorption for all drugs, most pronounced for lipophilic drugs. These results suggest that pharmacokinetics and hence optimal doses of these drugs may be altered during ECMO...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveFetal {{cardiac surgery}} is a {{potential}} innovative treatment for certain congenital heart defects that have significant mortality and morbidity in utero or after birth, {{but it has been}} limited by placental dysfunction after fetal cardiac bypass. We have used the TinyPump device for fetal cardiac bypass in sheep fetuses at 90 to 110  days gestation. MethodsTen mixed-breed pregnant ewes were used over a period of 6 months, and 10 fetuses were placed on bypass for 30 minutes. Five fetuses with a mean gestational age of 104 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 1. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the TinyPump device, and 5 fetuses with a mean gestational age of 119 ± 4. 5 days and mean weight of 3. 4 ± 0. 4 kg were placed on bypass using the <b>roller</b> head <b>pump.</b> The fetuses were monitored for up to 3 hours after bypass or until earlier demise. ResultsProgressive respiratory and metabolic acidosis developed in all fetuses. The TinyPump group had a lower gestational age and weight compared with the <b>roller</b> head <b>pump</b> group.

40|$|Electrical failure during {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) {{has previously}} been reported to occur in 1 of every 1500 cases. Most heart-lung machine pump consoles are equipped with built-in battery back-up units. Battery run times of these devices are variable and have not been reported.

This study was designed to examine the run time of a fully charged battery under various conditions of pump speed, pressure loads, pump boot material, multiple pump usage, and battery life. Battery life using a centrifugal pump also was examined. The results of this study show that battery life is affected by pump speed, circuit pressure, boot stiffness, and the number of pumps in service. Centrifugal pumps also show a reduced drain on battery when compared with <b>roller</b> <b>pumps.</b> These elements affect the longevity and performance of the battery.

40|$|ObjectivesUse of extracorporeal {{circuits}} in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis often causes bleeding {{problems and}} hypotension. As shown previously, {{this might be}} caused by activation of blood platelets due to pumping. The present study investigates the mechanism of pump-induced platelet aggregation and its possible prevention. Methods and ResultsContinuous measurement of platelet aggregation in an extracorporeal shunt from a carotid to a femoral artery in rats showed that aggregation during the first 10 minutes of pumping was not reduced by coating the tube with albumin or heparin nor by using dalteparin instead of unfractionated heparin as anticoagulant. Also, pump characteristics seemed unimportant because aggregation could already be elicited by single tube compression with one <b>pump</b> <b>roller.</b> It was calculated that during compression wall shear stress in the tube rises far beyond the values known to induce platelet aggregation, occurring also in clinically used <b>roller</b> <b>pumps.</b> A crucial role for adenosine diphosphate was demonstrated by blockade of platelet adenosine diphosphate-P 2 Y 12 receptors with the clinically used drug clopidogrel (50 mg/kg intravenously, n = 8). This prevented platelet aggregation and the fall of systemic blood pressure (to 71 % ± 12 % in controls, n = 6) during 2 hours of continuous pumping. ConclusionWe conclude that pump-induced platelet aggregation is not caused by factors released from the tube or its coating but is initiated by short bouts of high shear stress, and its continuation is critically dependent on adenosine diphosphate. The latter might have clinical relevance for patients connected to extracorporeal systems...|$|R
