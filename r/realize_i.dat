500|$|Mortimer {{qualified}} for six women's SM10 {{events at the}} 2012 London Paralympics—the 200-metre individual medley, 4 × 100 m freestyle relay 34pts, 4 × 100 m medley relay, 50- and 100-metre freestyle and 100-metre backstroke—and expectations for her were high. On August 30, {{the first day of}} the competition, Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand won the SM10 200-metre individual medley; Mortimer took the silver medal. For a half-hour before the competition, Mortimer was [...] "bawling her eyes out"; she told The Canadian Press, [...] " [...] here and meeting all these people made me <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> am so incredibly grateful for the experience I’ve had as a result of my accident. I don’t know if this was part of the journey I was supposed to walk in life but I wouldn’t take it back for the world". The next day, she won the S10 50-metre freestyle gold medal in a record time of 28.10 seconds. Mortimer's time was [...]07 second faster than her April Trials record, and [...]14 second faster than Pascoe's time; she went into the race [...] "a bit annoyed" [...] and [...] "mad at anyone who was going to take it from me".|$|E

500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{believed}} Nolan and Goyer {{managed to}} [...] "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," [...] and that Nolan takes the series {{out of the}} [...] "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" [...] the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he [...] "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as {{the best of the}} live-action Batman films. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the [...] "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was [...] "the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> was waiting for". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on [...] "the story and character" [...] with less stress on [...] "high-tech action".|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E

500|$|Drawing from synth-pop music, [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{incorporates}} minimalist production elements. with styles commonly seen in {{new wave}} music. Distinguished as the [...] "poppiest" [...] track from Night Time, My Time, its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior {{contributes to the}} public image she is given by the media; during the chorus, she states [...] "I {{just want you to}} <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> blame myself for my reputation." [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] was assumed to have been inspired by the [...] "anthemic pop fizz" [...] from her breakthrough single [...] "Everything Is Embarrassing" [...] from her second extended play Ghost (2012). Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork Media implied that [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long-delayed debut studio album; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project, and added that it [...] "lays out the emotional core" [...] of her process. Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a [...] "socialite [...] Forever 21 model" [...] and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013, which she expected would highlight that her side projects [...] "have {{nothing to do with the}} kind of songs Ferreira writes these days". [...] "I Blame Myself", in addition to the tracks [...] "24 Hours" [...] and [...] "Love in Stereo", blend [...] "tenderized vocal hooks [...] chiming synth melodies", which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music. With his similar observation, Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the [...] "chiming synths" [...] that Martin recognized developed into the [...] "undeniably cathartic" [...] refrain.|$|E

In an interview with MTV T.I. said that he was actually still recording songs for King and said he'll be making music right up to the deadline. On February 6, 2006 T.I. churned out roughly 65 tracks but only selected the hottest joints.
