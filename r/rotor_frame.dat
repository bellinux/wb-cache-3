Stall {{is characterized by a}} decrease in overall pressure rise and nonaxisymmetric throughflow. Compressor stall can lead to surge which is characterized by quasi-axisymmetric fluctuations in mass flow and pressure. Unsteady measurements of the flow field around the compressor rotor are examined. During the stall inception process, initial disturbances were found within the rotor passage near the tip region. As the stall cell develops, blade lift and pressure ratio decrease within the stall cell and increase ahead of the stall cell. The stall inception event, stall-cell development, and stall recovery event were found to be nearly identical for stable rotating stall and surge cases. As the stall cell grows, {{the leading edge of the}} cell will rotate at a higher rate than the trailing edge in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame.</b> The opposite occurs during stall recovery.

40|$|Introduction: There {{are four}} {{principal}} sources of unsteadiness {{in a single}} stage of a turbomachine {{in which there is}} one row of stationary blades (stators) and one row of moving blades (rotors). As shown in Fig. 1. 1, wake/rotor interaction causes unsteadiness because the stator wakes, which one can assume to be approximately steady in the stator frame of reference, are unsteady in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame</b> of reference since the rotor is moving through the wakes and chopping them into pieces. This causes unsteady forces on the rotor blades and generates unsteady pressure waves. Although the stator wakes are generated by viscosity, the subsequent interaction with the rotor blades is primarily an inviscid process and so can be modelled by the inviscid equations of motion. This allows two different approaches in numerical modelling. The first is to perform a full unsteady Navier-Stokes calculation of the stator and rotor blades. The second is to perform an unsteady inviscid calculation for just the rotor blade row, with the wakes being somehow specified as unsteady inflow boundary conditions. This latter approach is computationally much more efficient, but assumes that one is not concerned about the unsteady heat transfer and other viscous effects on the rotor blades. Potential stator/rotor interaction causes unsteadiness {{due to the fact that}} the pressure in the region between the stator and rotor blade rows can be decomposed approximately into a part that is steady and uniform, a part that is non-uniform but steady in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame</b> (due to the lift on the rotor blades) and a part that is non-uniform but steady in the stator frame (due to the lift on the stator blades). As the rotor blades move, the stator trailing edges experience an unsteady pressure due to the non-uniform part that is locked to the rotors, and the rotor leading edges experience an unsteady pressure due to the non-uniform part that is locked to the stators. This is a purely inviscid interaction which is why it is labelled a "potential" interaction. There are again two approaches to modelling this interaction. The first is an unsteady, inviscid calculation of the stator and rotor blade rows. The second is an unsteady, inviscid calculation of just one of the blade rows, either the stator or the rotor, with the unsteady pressure being specified as a boundary condition. The latter approach is more efficient, but unfortunately the situation in which the potential stator/rotor interaction becomes important is when the spacing between the stator and rotor rows is extremely small, and/or there are shock waves moving in the region between them. Consequently, one does not usually know what values to specify as unsteady boundary conditions. The first two sources of unsteadiness were both due to the relative motion of the stator and rotor rows. The remaining two sources are not. The viscous flow past a blunt turbine trailing edge results in vortex shedding, very similar to the Karman vortex street shed behind a cylinder. In fact real wakes lie somewhere between the two idealized limits of a Karman vortex street and a turbulent wake with steady mean velocity profile. It is believed that provided the integrated loss is identical the choice of model does not affect the subsequent interaction with the downstream rotor blade row. However, this is an assumption which needs to be investigated sometime in the future. The importance of vortex shedding lies in the calculation of the average pressure around the blunt trailing edge, which determines the base pressure loss, a significant component of the overall loss. There is also experimental evidence to suggest that the vortex shedding can be greatly amplified under some conditions by the potential stator/rotor interaction. Finally, there can be unsteadiness due to the motion of the stator or rotor blades. The primary concern here is the avoidance of flutter. This is a condition in which a small oscillation of the blade produces an unsteady force and moment on the blade which due to its phase relationship to the motion does work on the blade and so increases the amplitude of the blade's unsteady motion. This can rapidly lead to very large amplitude blade vibrations, and ultimately blade failure.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{manufacture}} of a 26 -bladed 'active' rotor {{that will be used}} for developing an experimental database on turbomachinery aeroservoelastic phenomena, such as flutter and its control. The active rotor has blades made of two stress-bearing composite spars, aerodynamically shaped foam, piezoelectric actuators attached to the spar base and a root which allows the blade to be inserted into the rotor. The thesis analyzed the models developed for the active rotor blade design from previous studies and made suitable refinements in them. The following parameters were obtained - spar dimensions, their location and material, piezoelectric dimensions and material, foam material, and root structure and material. Next, technologies were developed for manufacturing the root and the twisted spar, packaging the piezoelectric actuators using copper-Kapton and bonding them to the spars, and wiring the spars and actuators. However, further investigation is necessary with regards to the issues of foam shaping, spar-foam attachment, and development of accurate leading and trailing edges of the blade. The final step involved testing the blade before and after spar-foam bonding. This required testing on the benchtop to obtain the blade performance limitations, and then testing it in vacuum while spinning inside a spin pit, which was constructed for this purpose. The latter gives the blade performance under rotation. The scope of the thesis is limited to the benchtop tests conducted on the active wired spars. Some of the blade and spin pit wiring issues need to be resolved before conducting the spin tests in vacuum. Also a <b>rotor</b> <b>frame</b> incorporating 26 active blades needs to developed to test under vacuum and in a wind tunnel. The results of the preliminary benchtop tests as well as the blade finite element model predict that the blade performance would be lower than the initial target. Several ways of improving its actuation capability considered were: (a) applying higher voltage with DC offset to the actuators, (b) using multi-wafer actuators, and (c) using active fiber composites. However, these issues need further work. The active rotor, when completed, will serve as a robust tool for aeroservoelastic testing over a significantly larger operating range than is currently possible. by Debashis Sahoo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Rotor {{electromagnetic}} losses can {{be problematic}} in high speed permanent magnet synchronous machines, {{especially when the}} speed or the electrical loading are high and the slotting and winding configuration results in high magnitude asynchronous harmonics. Accurate estimation of these travelling flux harmonics in the initial design stage is essential, as small errors can result in significant errors in the estimated rotor losses, {{which could lead to}} misinformed design decisions. This Thesis makes a number of contributions to the subject of rotor losses in PM machines. It firstly investigates the accuracy of the commonly used current sheet method for estimating losses for each harmonic. In this method, the losses are calculated using a multi-layer model of the machine in which each asynchronous harmonic in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame</b> is represented by current sheet {{on the surface of the}} bore of a slotless stator. The harmonics are calculated using double Fourier transform of flux density data on the surface of the magnet obtained from a number of magnetostatic finite element (FE) solutions at different rotor position. The losses are also calculated using 2 D transient FEA with rotor motion, with appropriate mesh refinement and time step determined based on a mesh and time step dependence study. The results show that the current sheet method accurately calculates the losses in ring magnets if the amplitudes of the harmonics are estimated accurately. Secondly, the Thesis extends 3 analytical methods that have been reported in the literature by Zhu and Howe (1993), Gieras (2004) and et al (2006) to estimate the amplitude of the no-load asynchronous travelling flux density harmonics, the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame.</b> The accuracy of these methods is evaluated by comparison to those calculated using non-linear finite element analysis for variants of a particular machine. The results show that (et al, 2006) complex permeance method provides the closest estimate, when the level of saturation in the machine is negligible. However, if the saturation, of the tooth tip in particular is significant, then all methods underestimate the amplitudes of the harmonics. And accordingly, the estimated rotor losses are grossly underestimated by a factor of 1 : 3 in a machine with heavy tooth tip saturation. Thirdly, the Thesis tackles the problem of losses in a loaded generator with sinusoidal currents. It is shown that the total losses in the machine are dependent on the power factor and the phase angle between the emf and current. The total loss cannot be simply calculated by adding the no-load loss due to magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics and the loss due to stator mmf asynchronous harmonics. This is due to the interaction between the stator mmf harmonics and the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, which need to be added vectorially. This is verified by comparing the results calculated analytically (using the most accurate ’s meth d f calculating no-load harmonics), with those obtained from transient FEA in a machine with no significant saturation. Fourthly, the Thesis investigates rotor losses in a generator with two slots per pole per phase connected to an uncontrolled diode rectifier, considering the two cases of constant current and constant voltage dc link. Two winding and rectifier configurations are considered: a 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase, 6 pulse bridge rectifier and a double 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase rectifier each, connected in series i. e., a 12 pulse rectifier. Both magnet flux tooth ripple and armature reaction stator mmf harmonics are considered in the calculation of rotor loss; the harmonics were added vectorially. It is shown that the machine with double 3 -phase windings and 12 pulse rectifier has considerably lower rotor losses that the machine with one single 3 -phase winding due to cancellation of high order harmonics. Finally, limited studies are performed in the Thesis for the calculation of rotor losses in PMSGs with different slot opening, number of slots per pole and airgap (with magnet thickness adjusted to keep the airgap flux density and emf constant). It is shown that increasing the airgap and reducing slot opening reduced the losses The results plotted in a normalised form of loss per unit rotor surface area are versus the ratios of gap/slot pitch and slot opening divided by pole pitch. These curves are shown to give reasonable quick estimates of rotor losses in machines with different sizes. Also, rotor losses are calculated in three PMSGs with different numbers of slots per pole and winding / rectifier configurations. The results show that the popular 1. 5 slots per pole concentrated winding configuration have considerably higher rotor losses due to the strong second harmonic than the other machines with lap windings. The work in the Thesis was based on two-dimensional calculations, assuming ring magnets. Further work is needed to evaluate the 3 D effect and magnet segmentation...|$|E
40|$|Time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes {{simulations}} {{have been}} carried out to investigate the impact of upstream rotor wakes and tip leakage vortices on the loss of a compressor stator. The objective is to (1) identify the unsteady flow mechanisms responsible for performance changes, (2) quantify these changes, and (3) extract useful design information. There are two generic mechanisms with significant impact on performance: reversible recovery of the energy in the disturbances (beneficial) and non-transitional boundary layer response (detrimental). For both wakes and tip leakage vortices, the impact of these mechanisms can be described in the same two-dimensional terms. In presence of unsteady flow, the efficiency of the design under consideration is 0. 2 points higher than that obtained using a mixing-out steady flow approximation (0. 5 points recovery benefit minus 0. 3 points from boundary layer response). The effects of tip vortices and wakes are of comparable importance. The impact of stator interaction with upstream wakes and vortices depends on the following parameters: axial spacing, loading, aid the frequency of wake fluctuations in the <b>rotor</b> <b>frame.</b> At reduced spacing, this impact becomes significant. For a spacing of 0. 07 chords, stage efficiency is 0. 6 points higher relative to the steady flow (1. 2 points recovery benefit minus 0. 6 points from boundary layer response). About 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 of the efficiency gain observed experimentally {{can be attributed to the}} interaction with upstream wakes and vortices. In the relative frame, wakes fluctuate in time. For fluctuation frequencies between 0. 3 - 0. 8 times the blade passing frequency, recovery does not occur, and there is a significant difference between the effects of fluctuating and steady wakes (with the same ensemble-averaged properties). The most important aspect of the tip vortex is the velocity defect, which is perceived by the stator in the same manner as a wake. A model of recovery and boundary layer response in an embedded stage indicates that a mixing-out steady flow approximation underestimates stage efficiency by 0. 3 - 0. 5 points (for typical designs) and by 0. 6 - 1. 0 points (for closely-spaced blade rows). A region in design space exists where interaction has a beneficial and relatively constant impact on efficiency. Outside this region, interaction benefits rapidly disappear. For a typical blading diffusion factor of 0. 45, the beneficial region is approximately delimited by the de Haller criterion. The detrimental aspects of boundary layer response may be mitigated by (a) selective removal of boundary layer fluid from the suction surface, or (b) tailoring of the blade loading to reduce loss in the front part of the blade.

40|$|The inner {{torque control}} loop for the {{interior}} magnet synchronous motor typically employs wo rpwm current controller in the <b>rotor</b> reference <b>frame.</b> Recently, a new direct torque control schem which operates in the stator reference frame {{has been proposed}} by the authors. It has several advantages such elimination of the mandatory rotor position sensor, stator to rotor transformation and closed-loop pwm current controller networks/software. The elimination of certain hardware/software and of the inevitable delays inherent in these networks potentially results in a much faster dynamic torque response than what is obtained with pwm current control. This paper compares the response times of torque for the two schemes through analysis, modelling and experimental studies, and compares the two strategies of torque control. I...|$|R
