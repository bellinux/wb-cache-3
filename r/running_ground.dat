Three years later, in 1869, the club moved its base to the newly-opened Lillie Bridge Grounds, a few hundred yards north of where Stamford Bridge Stadium is today. Then, in 1870, the brothers James and William Waddell, who had joined LAC as athletes, became treasurer and secretary. Profits soared and in 1877 they secured six and a half acres at Stamford Bridge. The grounds made LAC the premier club of the time. (The brothers fled the country in 1883 and they left the club in debt.) ...|$|R

60|$|As {{for your}} other correspondent, the first {{principle}} of dress that all garments should be {{hung from the}} shoulders and not from the waist {{seems to me to}} be generally approved of, although an 'Old Sailor' declares that no sailors or athletes ever suspend their clothes from the shoulders, but always from the hips. My own recollection of the river and <b>running</b> <b>ground</b> at Oxford--those two homes of Hellenism in our little Gothic town--is that the best runners and rowers (and my own college turned out many) wore always a tight jersey, with short drawers attached to it, the whole costume being woven in one piece. As for sailors it is true, I admit, and the bad custom seems to involve that constant 'hitching up' of the lower garments which, however popular in transpontine dramas, cannot, I think, but be considered an extremely awkward habit; and as all awkwardness comes from discomfort of some kind, I trust that this point in our sailor's dress will be looked to in the coming reform of our navy, for, in spite of all protests, I hope we are about to reform everything, from torpedoes to top-hats, and from crinolettes to cruises.|$|E
60|$|If {{a modern}} {{sculptor}} {{were to come}} and say, 'Very well, but where can one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frock-coats and chimney- pot hats?' I would tell {{him to go to}} the docks of a great city and watch the men loading or unloading the stately ships, working at wheel or windlass, hauling at rope or gangway. I have never watched a man do anything useful who has not been graceful at some moment of his labour; it is only the loafer and the idle saunterer who is as useless and uninteresting to the artist as he is to himself. I would ask the sculptor to go with me to any of your schools or universities, to the <b>running</b> <b>ground</b> and gymnasium, to watch the young men start for a race, hurling quoit or club, kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping, stepping from the boat or bending to the oar, and to carve them; and when he was weary of cities I would ask him to come to your fields and meadows to watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattle driver with lifted lasso. For if a man cannot find the noblest motives for his art in such simple daily things as a woman drawing water from the well or a man leaning with his scythe, he will not find them anywhere at all. Gods and goddesses the Greek carved because he loved them; saint and king the Goth because he believed in them. But you, you do not care much for Greek gods and goddesses, and you are perfectly and entirely right; and you do not think much of kings either, and you are quite right. But what you do love are your own men and women, your own flowers and fields, your own hills and mountains, and these are what your art should represent to you.|$|E

50|$|Ground {{reaction}} forces (GRF) are exerted by {{the ground on}} the body in contact with it and reflect the body’s acceleration. During level <b>running,</b> <b>ground</b> {{reaction forces}} can be dichotomized into vertical ground reaction forces and horizontal ground reaction forces. In the comparison of incline to level running, the terms normal and parallel ground reaction forces are substituted for vertical and horizontal because when running on an incline the latter terms become inaccurate in describing the direction of force application. Measurements are expressed {{as a percentage of}} body weight, where a value of one body weight is the force exerted to support the body when standing. A plot of normal GRF is characterized by its biphasic nature, with an initial impact peak corresponding to the braking portion of the stance phase (heal strike) followed by a larger peak representing the propulsion part of the stance phase (toe off). Typical parallel GRF application during running involves two peaks, one that is negative during breaking and one that is positive during propulsion. Important characteristics of a GRF plot are the magnitude of the peaks (impact and active), the rate of loading, average force, and the total area under the plot.|$|E
40|$|On {{board of}} the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), spores of Bacillus subtilis in monolayers (10 (exp 6) /sample) or multilayers (10 (exp 8) /sample) {{were exposed to the}} space {{environment}} for nearly six years and their survival was analyzed after retrieval. The response to space parameters, such as vacuum (10 (exp - 6) Pa), solar electromagnetic radiation up to the highly energetic vacuum-ultraviolet range 10 (exp 9) J/sq m) and/or cosmic radiation (4. 8 Gy), was studied and compared to the results of a simultaneously <b>running</b> <b>ground</b> control experiment. If shielded against solar ultraviolet (UV) -radiation, up to 80 % of spores in multilayers survive in space. Solar UV-radiation, being the most deleterious parameter of space, reduces survival by 4 orders of magnitude or more. However, up to 10 (exp 4) viable spores were still recovered, even in completely unprotected samples. Substances, such as glucose or buffer salts serve as chemical protectants.

The purpose of this study was to examine the biomechanical role of running poles by comparing normal running to pole <b>running.</b> <b>Ground</b> reaction forces, tibial acceleration, and video data were collected on ten middle-age male recreational runners with a history of knee pain. Subjects ran across a force plate at a constant velocity of 3. 5 - 3. 7 m/s with an accelerometer attached to the anteromedial aspect of the tibia. Hip, knee, and ankle joint range of motion and torque were calculated. Results indicated significant decreases in the average peak propulsive force and impulse, and a significant increase in peak hip joint torque. It was concluded that by providing an outside source of propulsion, running poles may be useful in reducing the risk of injury to runners. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} {{solar panels}} on the International Space Station (ISS) track the Sun through continuous rotating motion enabled by large bearings {{on the main}} truss called solar array alpha rotary joints (SARJs). In late 2007, shortly after installation, the starboard SARJ had become hard to turn {{and had to be}} shut down after exceeding drive current safety limits. The port SARJ, of the same design, had been working well for over 2 years. An exhaustive failure investigation ensued that included multiple extravehicular activities to collect information and samples for engineering forensics, detailed structural and thermal analyses, and a careful review of the build records. The ultimate root cause was determined to be kinematic design vulnerability coupled with inadequate lubrication, and manufacturing flaws; this was corroborated through ground tests, metallurgical studies, and modeling. A highly successful recovery plan was developed and implemented that included replacing worn and damaged components in orbit and applying space-compatible grease to improve lubrication. Beyond the technical aspects, however, lie several key programmatic lessons learned. These lessons, such as <b>running</b> <b>ground</b> tests to intentional failure to experimentally verify failure modes, are reviewed and discussed so they can be applied to future projects to avoid such problems...|$|E
40|$|Peak tibial {{acceleration}} (PTA) {{measured using}} accelerometers {{attached to the}} musculoskeletal system is considered the most effective method of quantifying impact shock magnitude {{as a result of}} footstrike during <b>running.</b> <b>Ground</b> Reaction Forces (GRFs) measured using force plates are also widely used to predict PTA. However it is not clear which is the most effective GRF variable to use. This has led to different variables being reported within biomechanics literature. This study aimed to identify which GRF variable is the most suitable for consistent and accurate prediction of impact shock magnitudes. Thirteen participants (10 male and 3 female) took part in this study. Simultaneous tibial accelerations and GRF information were recorded as participants ran at 4. 0 ms- 1 + 5 % over a force platform. The relationship between various GRF parameters including, average vertical loading rates, peak instantaneous vertical loading rates (PIVLR), event times were compared to tibial shock magnitudes using Pearson correlations. The GRF variables analysed identified that the strongest correlation (r= 0. 469) exists between the PIVLR and the PTA. This study therefore provides evidence that the most effective method of predicting PTA is via the PIVLR. This method does not require identification of a vertical GRF impact peak which is dependent on the individual researcher identifying the peak, and can be identified repeatedly across studie...|$|E
