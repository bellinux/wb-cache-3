5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> indiscriminately {{sometimes}} led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> {{he could}} find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of {{research}} by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E
25|$|Frank Herbert {{used his}} science fiction novels to explore complex ideas {{involving}} philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust {{of his work}} was a fascination {{with the question of}} human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult, something he was very much against.|$|E

25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who are a little weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E
25|$|It was at Cambridge in 1785 that Clarkson {{entered a}} Latin essay {{competition}} {{that was to}} set him on the course {{for most of the}} remainder of his life. The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor Peter Peckard, was Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare ("Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?"), and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the slave trade. He <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> he could on the subject, including the works of Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist, as well as first hand accounts of the African slave trade such as Francis Moore's Travels into the Interior Parts of Africa. Appalled and challenged by what he discovered, Clarkson changed his life. He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.|$|E

All the new fiction. What he didn't like was Bellow, Updike, Cheever, Salinger, Capote, and Mailer. He didn't know how to use them.|$|E

He also championed a brand of anti-semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality."

500|$|Seeing the boy's intelligence, some neighbors {{offered to}} pay Horace's way at Phillips Exeter Academy, but the Greeleys were too proud to accept charity.

500|$|Finkelstein is a sharp {{critic of}} the state of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah, Israeli {{historian}} Avi Shlaim stated that Finkelstein's critique of Israel [...] "is based on an amazing amount of research. He seems to have <b>read</b> <b>everything.</b> He has gone through the reports of Israeli groups, of human rights groups, Human Rights Watch and Peace Now and B'Tselem, all of the reports of Amnesty International. And he deploys all this evidence from Israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of Israeli practices, Israeli violations of human rights of the Palestinians, Israeli house demolitions, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian militants, the cutting down of trees, the building of the wall—the security barrier on the West Bank, which is illegal—the restrictions imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, {{and so on and so}} forth.

[...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I <b>read</b> <b>everything</b> that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script.

[...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense.
