In 1962, a formal proposal was made by local authorities in Split, resulting in Croatian government adopting a framework motorway development plan in 1966.

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} flooding on the <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in Enugu Metropolis was carried out using survey research method. Thirty impact indicators were rated by the respondents against six impact dimensions of population, vulnerability of activities, frequency, intensity, extent and risk. Three null hypotheses were postulated and tested. One sample t-test was used for testing hypothesis one which stated that damages to the <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> resulting from flooding are not significant to warrant mitigation. Since the pvalue = 0. 000 (p< 0. 05), the null hypothesis is rejected. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used for testing hypotheses two and three. A statisticallysignificant impact was recorded in hypothesis two since the calculated p–value (0. 000) was less than 0. 05, (p < 0. 05), indicating high impact of flooding on the socio-economic activities in Enugu urban. Furthermore a statistically significant impact was equally recorded in hypothesis three since thecalculated p–value (0. 000) was less than 0. 05, (p < 0. 05). The implication was that damages to <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> due to flooding have significant impact on the environmental sustainability of the study area. The model generated hadGoodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0. 974; Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0. 951; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0. 949 and Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0. 950; while the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0. 059.
