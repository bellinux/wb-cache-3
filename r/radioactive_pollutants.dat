40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for designing a ground-water-quality monitoring network is developed that links a ground-water pollution-transport simulation model and an optimization model. Tritium is considered as the (<b>radioactive)</b> <b>pollutant.</b> The model is formulated using chance constraints and solved {{by using a}} mixedinteger programming algorithm. It incorporates uncertainties in the prediction of pollutant movement in the saturated zone. Nonlinearities due to the inclusion of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of actual spatial concentrations are accommodated in the optimization model through a piecewise linearization scheme. The design of the optimal monitoring network {{is based on the}} solution of two {{mathematical model}}s: a simulation model for the prediction of <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant</b> transport in the saturated zone, and an optimization model. Constraints of the optimization model are formulated by incorporating results from the prediction-simulation model. The simulation model provides information about pollution transport with respect to time and space. The chance-constrained optimization model solution specifies the optimal location of the monitoring wells subject to the maximum limit on the number of such wells.

40|$|A widely {{applicable}} {{computational model}} of buoyant, bent- over plumes in realistic atmospheres is constructed. To do this, the two-dimensional, time-dependent fluid mechanics equations are numerically integrated, while {{a number of}} important physical ap- proximations serve to keep the approach at a tractable level. A three-dimensional picture of a steady state plume is constructed from a sequence of time-dependent, two-dimensional plume cross sections [...] each cross section of the sequence is spaced progres- sively further downwind as it is advected for a progressively longer time by the prevailing wind. The dynamics of the plume simulations are quite general. The buoyancy sources in the plume include the sensible heat in the plume, the latent heat absorbed or released in plume moisture processes, and the heating of the plume by a <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the plume. The atmospheric state in the simulations is also quite general. Atmospheric var- iables are allowed to be functions of height, and the ambient atmospheric turbulence (also a function of height) is included in the simulations.

[...] The executive summary of the report stated: [...] "An assessment of the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. Most evidence suggests that contamination of groundwater, if it occurs, is most likely to be caused by leakage through the vertical borehole. Contamination of groundwater from the underground hydraulic fracturing process itself (ie the fracturing of the shale) is unlikely. However, surface spills of hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater may affect groundwater, and emissions to air also have the potential to impact on health. Where potential risks have been identified in the literature, the reported problems are typically a result of operational failure and a poor regulatory environment." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{based on the}} solution of optimization models for optimal design of groundwater quality monitoring networks. The optimal monitoring network is time varying as the monitoring wells are installed in stages, considering the transient pollutant transport process. The monitoring locations specified as solution to the optimization model change with time. This ensures additional economy in {{the installation of the}} network, compared to a single stage network design. The optimization model incorporates uncertainties in prediction or estimation of some of the aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity. Advective, dispersive, and radioactive decay processes of transport in a two-dimensional groundwater system are considered. Randomly generated aquifer parameter values are used to simulate different realizations of resulting pollutant plumes incorporating uncertainties in predicting the transport process. The simulated pollutant plume realizations are subsequently utilized to obtain cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of actual concentrations at different spatiotemporal locations. These CDFs are incorporated as an approximated distribution function in the optimization model. These CDFs are used to define chance constraints with associated reliabilities. Both single and multiple objective nonlinear optimization models are developed. Performances of these models are evaluated for different specified values of reliabilities using illustrative problems considering tritium (H 3) as the <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutant.</b> This monitoring network design model is, in general, applicable to other types of pollutants as well...|$|R

40|$|While much of {{the work}} in the public {{understanding}} of science has focused on the public’s appreciation of science and their familiarity with key scientific concepts, understanding the processes involved in learning science has largely been ignored. This article documents a study of how particular members of the public learn about radiation and radioactivity, and proposes a model to describe their learning—the Informal Conceptual Change Model [ICCM]. ICCM is a multidimensional framework that incorporates three theoretical dimensions—the cognitive, conative, and affective. The paper documents each of these dimensions, and then illustrates the model by drawing upon data collected in a case study. The emphasis of the analysis is on understanding how the members of the public living in an area with high levels of background radiation learn about the science of this potential health threat. The summarizing comments examine the need for a greater awareness of the complexities of informal learning. In comparison with radiation doses from radon, the doses to individual members of the public and to the general community from nuclear activities are quite trivial.

40|$|A novel <b>radioactive</b> <b>pollutants</b> remover was rationally {{designed}} and synthesized in this study.

Hydrolyzation of titanium and silicon containing materials were balanced to promote the place-holding of titanium element in the framework. Chemical analysis shows that molecular formula of the product is Na 4 Ti 4 Si 3 O 10 center dot 4. 5 H(2) O and the ratio of Ti/Si of the product synthesized is about 1. 33, which is much higher than the molecular sieves commonly used, such as TS 1, TS 2 and MCM 41. Raman spectrum analysis shows that all of the Ti atoms act as the framework elements to form an open 8 -membered ring pore structure. Na 4 Ti 4 Si 3 O 10 center dot 4. 5 H(2) O shows a quite high Cs+ removing ability even in a lower. pH solution.
