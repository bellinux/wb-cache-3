5|$|The {{inclusion}} of Ohio and New Jersey {{has led some}} to question the validity of <b>rescission</b> of a ratification. The {{inclusion of}} Alabama and Georgia has called that conclusion into question. While there have been Supreme Court cases dealing with ratification issues, this particular question has never been adjudicated.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its <b>rescission.</b> On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's <b>rescission</b> of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E

40|$|Efforts to {{maintain}} balanced budgets lead to substantial pro-cyclicality in states' capital investments, transfers to local governments, and spending {{in areas like}} education and transportation. Reliance on volatile revenue sources predicts relatively severe volatility in these expenditures. States with strict balanced budget requirements must restore fiscal balance faster than those without, leading to <b>rescissions</b> during years in which they face unexpected shocks. I find that these <b>rescissions</b> occur disproportionately in areas with readily deferred projects. Evidence points to the relative strength of public sector union groups as a driver of variation {{in the composition of}} mid-year <b>rescissions</b> across states. ...|$|R
25|$|Although it {{has been}} {{suggested}} otherwise, the right of the court to award damages in lieu of <b>rescission</b> only exists if the right to <b>rescission</b> exists. So in Government of Zanzibar v British Aerospace (Lancaster House) Ltd because it was impossible for the Government to give back its executive jet (counter restitution impossible), it could not ask the court for damages under s 2(2) instead of rescinding its contract.|$|E
25|$|Older {{cases had}} held {{that if a}} {{contract}} had already been performed, or a misrepresentation had become a term of the contract, this would preclude <b>rescission.</b> This inflexible position was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 1, which simply says such bars no longer exist. However, it must still be remembered that one cannot ask both for <b>rescission</b> and for recovery of expectation damages for breach of contract.|$|E
25|$|Anna Christensen {{was born}} in 1936 in Tumba, Sweden. She studied law at Stockholm University and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the Law of Sale of Goods (Studier i Köprätt). Her doctoral thesis dealt {{with some of the}} problems concerning the right to treat a contract as of sale of goods as discharged – the right of <b>rescission</b> – in various situations that may rise in the course of performance. Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the right of <b>rescission</b> which depended on how far performance had proceeded when the question of <b>rescission</b> came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E

25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} right to rescind a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so long as one was not confronted by a bar to <b>rescission,</b> the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to <b>rescission</b> could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about whether it will allow <b>rescission</b> of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed <b>rescission</b> of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no right to rescind. But if there had been, it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E
25|$|Remedies for misrepresentation. <b>Rescission</b> is the {{principal}} remedy and damages are also available if a tort is established. In order to obtain relief, {{there must be a}} positive misrepresentation of law and also, the representee must have been misled by and relied on this misrepresentation:Public Trustee v Taylor.|$|E
40|$|In recents years, some {{executives}} have been permitted by firms to rescind stock option exercise decisions by returning {{the stock to}} the company for a refund of the exercise price. Such <b>rescissions</b> have been widely condemned as weakening incentives. We find that <b>rescissions</b> often deliver the same incentive payoffs as a standard option but at a lower cost. The cost savings arise {{as a consequence of}} the tax treatment of the exercise/rescission decisions under U. S. tax law. The savings are associated positively with stock volatility and the personal/corporate tax rate spread and negatively with interest rates. ...|$|R
50|$|The legislatures of {{some states}} have adopted <b>rescissions</b> of their prior applications. It is not clear from the {{language}} of Article V whether a subsequent vote to rescind an application is permissible. As discussed above, however, if the purpose of Article V is to give state legislatures power over a recalcitrant Congress—and if state lawmakers may indeed limit their applications by specific subject matter—it is possible that federal courts would hold that <b>rescissions</b> of previous applications are likewise valid, {{in order to give}} more meaningful effect to the power which Article V confers upon state legislators.|$|R
50|$|The {{insurers}} {{decided to}} act quickly after they were whacked by some very bad publicity. An investigative report by Reuters {{said that one of}} the nation’s biggest insurers, WellPoint, was targeting women with breast cancer for fraud investigations that could lead to <b>rescissions.</b>|$|R
25|$|When <b>rescission</b> is claimed, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to also claim expectation damages as if the contract were to be performed. Either <b>rescission,</b> or damages as if the contract were still in force, can be claimed, but it would be inconsistent to do both. In Whittington v Seale-Hayne it was held that damages for losses as if the contract were still in force, and to put the claimant in the position as if he had never entered it, could not both be claimed. So where Mr Whittington's prize poultry died on a polluted farm which Seale-Hayne represented was sanitary, Mr Whittington got an indemnity for council rates and repair costs, but not for the loss of profits. At the time it was {{not possible}} to also recoup costs for the dead poultry, but later Hedley Byrne negligence or Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) provided this remedy.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, during Sebelius's {{second term}} in office, {{there was a}} report in the Wichita Eagle that the State of Kansas was {{suspending}} tax refunds and that, {{because of a lack of}} tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not agree with her certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget <b>rescission</b> bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The <b>rescission</b> bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|E
25|$|Misrepresentation means a false {{statement}} of fact made by one party to another party and {{has the effect of}} inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, {{false statement}}s or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of <b>rescission</b> and sometimes damages {{depending on the type of}} misrepresentation.|$|E

25|$|The act's {{provisions}} become effective over time. The {{most significant}} changes, particularly affecting {{the availability and}} terms of insurance become effective January 1, 2014. These include an expansion of Medicaid (at the option of each state) to those without dependent children and subsidized healthcare exchanges. Changes which occur earlier include allowing dependents to remain on their plan until 26, limitations on <b>rescission</b> (dropping insureds when they get sick), removal of lifetime coverage limits, mandates that insurers fully cover certain preventative services, high-risk pools for uninsureds, tax credits for businesses to provide insurance to employees, an insurance company rate review program, and minimum medical loss ratios.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} the New York Arbitration Act of 1920, {{followed}} by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the Federal Arbitration Act). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for <b>rescission</b> which undermined {{the validity of the}} entire contract). Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of interstate commerce, the U.S. Supreme Court reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state legislatures to protect their consumers against powerful corporations.|$|E
25|$|A clear bar to <b>rescission</b> {{is where}} {{unwinding}} a contractual exchange may cause injustice to an innocent third party. This will particularly {{be the case}} where an item has changed hands and then been sold on to a third person. If the first contract is declared void, then the second contract with the third person would also be void, due {{to the principle of}} nemo dat quod non habet. However the equity courts decided that a contract could not be declared void if a third party's rights had intervened, provided the third party had acted in good faith and given consideration (the principle of bona fide purchaser). So in Phillips v Brooks Ltd it was not possible for a jeweller that had been defrauded by a rogue to claim back a ring from the pawn shop where the ring had been sold on.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, in August 1945 President Truman {{asked for}} the {{admission}} of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine but the British maintained limits on Jewish immigration {{in line with the}} 1939 White Paper. The Jewish community rejected the restriction on immigration and organized an armed resistance. These actions and United States pressure to end the anti-immigration policy led to the establishment of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In April 1946, the Committee reached a unanimous decision for the immediate admission of 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe into Palestine, <b>rescission</b> of the white paper restrictions of land sale to Jews, that the country be neither Arab nor Jewish, and the extension of U.N. Trusteeship. U.S. endorsed the Commission findings concerning Jewish immigration and land purchase restrictions, while U.K. conditioned their implementation on U.S. assistance in case of another Arab revolt. In effect the British continued to carry out its White Paper policy.
