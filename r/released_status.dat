5000|$|The {{majority}} upheld Section 2, but did so {{by reading}} it in a more restrictive manner. The provisions at issue required Arizona officers to make a [...] "reasonable attempt" [...] to determine the immigration status of any person stopped, detained, or arrested on a legitimate basis if [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] existed {{that the person is}} an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States. Additionally, any arrestee's immigration status would have to have been determined before they could be <b>released.</b> <b>Status</b> checks would have been made through Immigration and Customs Enforcement and their databases. Listing several examples, Justice Kennedy wrote that Section 2(B) [...] "likely would survive preemption" [...] if it is interpreted only to require state officers to conduct a status check [...] "during the course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been released." [...] Underlining the cautious approach that the majority took to Section 2(B) were Justice Kennedy's final words on the section: [...] "This opinion does not foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect." ...|$|E

Offenders in the JCI group are {{more than twice as}} likely to violently recidivate in the community during a 2 -year follow-up than those who participate in MJTC treatment.

Such a conflict is present almost by design when representatives of Production Control participate in decisions on design changes in late stages of the product development process.

This is probably because several con-texts are mobilised when members of different specialities interpret what is meant by an argument.
