5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> to 1,800 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E
5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, Fokker {{engineers}} {{were working on}} the Fokker-Leimberger, an externally powered 12-barrel Gatling gun in the 7.92×57mm round claimed to be capable of firing over 7200 <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|R
50|$|The samurai {{were armed}} with Enfield and Model 1857 Six Line (Russian) muzzle loading rifles and could fire {{approximately}} one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Their artillery consisted of 28 mountain guns, two field guns, and 30 assorted mortars.|$|R
500|$|Sources {{disagree}} regarding these guns' performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini {{claims that}} they fired [...] armor-piercing (AP) projectiles {{at the rate}} of one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and that they had a muzzle velocity of [...] which gave a maximum range of [...]|$|R
5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a firing rate of about 2 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard. Antiquated Tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.|$|E
5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 <b>Rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>Minute.</b> The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (<b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5000|$|JM is {{an acronym}} for Jumelage de Mitrailleuses (twin machine guns). [...] While the MAC 31 heavy machine guns were of the same caliber (7.5mm) as the GFM guns, they had a longer {{practical}} range 1200 m and a maximum range of 4900 m, with a 500 <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> rate of fire.|$|R
5000|$|The turret was poorly {{configured}} {{to allow}} the human crew to manually load the gun should the autoloader break. In such situations, rate of fire usually slowed to an abysmal one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> as the gunner fumbles with the awkward task of working around the broken machine to load the gun.|$|R
50|$|It {{was capable}} of {{maintaining}} a sustained fire rate of one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> but the weapon could also be rapid fired at an increased rate of one round every six seconds (10 rpm) by a well trained crew. The rapid firing was limited to five rounds, with a mandatory 15 minute cool-off period afterward.|$|R
5|$|Their {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{consisted of}} fourteen 10.5cm C/33 L/65 guns, sixteen 3.7cm L/83 guns, and between ten and twenty 2cm guns. The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> and had an effective ceiling of 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage surface targets, the guns had a maximum range of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective ceiling of 6,800m (22,310ft), though tracers were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft). They had a rate of fire of 30rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. The guns had an actual bore diameter of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). The guns used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore charge in a silk bag and a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). The guns had a rate of fire of 2.5 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. The guns were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E
50|$|The {{automatic}} feeder for the mortar required a three-phase electricity supply {{to power the}} lift, otherwise ammunition had to be passed up. Earlier versions were manually fed using a flywheel. The bunker held 3,944 mortar rounds. A 24 V battery system provided lighting. Bulbs illuminated to show the rate of fire, 40, 60, 80 or 120 <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger caliber cannon during the World Wars has been reversed {{in more recent}} years. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their aging pieces. As it could be towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II-era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much, and can be transported by helicopter—as opposed to the M198, which requires a C-5 or C-17 to airlift. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to —a longer range {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will be capable of firing 10 <b>rounds</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give Zumwalt-class destroyers the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M-198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are far less expensive than a cruise missile, and are therefore a better alternative to many combat situations.|$|E
