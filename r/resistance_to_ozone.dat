5000|$|Silicone rubber (SiR): {{noted for}} their ability to be used over a wide {{temperature}} range and for excellent <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> weathering and aging. Compared with most other sealing elastomers, the physical properties of silicones are poor. Generally, silicone materials are physiologically harmless so they are commonly used {{by the food and drug}} industries. Standard silicones are resistant to water (to 100 °C), aliphatic engine and transmission oils and animal and plant oils and fats. Silicones are generally not resistant to fuels, aromatic mineral oils, steam (short term to 120 °C is possible), silicone oils and greases, acids or alkalis. Fluorosilicone elastomers are far more resistant to oils and fuels. The temperature range of applications is somewhat more restricted.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its resistance to lubricants and greases, and its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based lubricants and greases, many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils and greases and water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD). NBR also has low <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> weathering and aging. HNBR has considerable improvement of the resistance to heat, ozone and aging, and gives it good mechanical properties.|$|E

40|$|Betula platyphylla var. japonica (white birch) has heterophyllous leaves (i. e., {{early and}} late leaves) and is a typical pioneer tree species in {{northern}} Japan. Seedlings of white birch were exposed to ozone during two growing seasons, and measurements were {{carried out in the}} second year. Early leaves did not show an ozone-induced reduction in photosynthesis because of lower stomatal conductance resulting in higher avoidance capacity for ozone-induced stress. Also, an ozone-related increase in leaf nitrogen content may partly contribute to maintain the photosynthetic capacity in early leaves under elevated ozone in autumn. On the other hand, late leaves showed an ozone-induced decline of photosynthesis and early defoliation of leaves occurred. Also, smaller leaf size and higher stomatal density in late leaves were observed under elevated ozone.

The aircraft flight path was chosen so as to fly over the tower site at the Ducke Forest Reserve near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Both turbulence statistics and mean quantities were used to study the budgets of heat, water vapor, ozone, and carbon monoxide. The ozone budget study shows an accumulation rate in the boundary layer of 0. 3 + or - 0. 2 ppbv/h.

The kinetic parameters and thermal decomposition of vulcanized EPDM were studied using thermogravimetric method with various vulcanization systems (efficient, semi-efficient, and conventional vulcanization system) and various carbon black (CB) as filler (50, 60, and 70 phr). Decomposition consist of two stages; the oxidation of EPDM and volatile matter loss then decomposition of EPDM. Kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition were approximated by the Coats Redfern equation. Activation energy and decomposed mass increases with decreasing content of CB.

However, due to its deleterious effects, plant functioning {{is affected by the}} ozone absorbed. It is thus necessary to both predict total ozone deposition to ecosystems and partition the fluxes in stomatal and non-stomatal pathways. The Surfatm-O 3 model was developed to predict ozone deposition to agroecosystems from sowing to harvest, taking into account each deposition pathways during bare soil, growth, maturity, and senescence periods. An additional sink was added during senescence: stomatal deposition for yellow leaves, not able to photosynthesise but transpiring. The model was confronted to measurements performed over three maize crops in different regions of France. Modelled and measured fluxes agreed well for one dataset for any phenological stage, with only 3 % difference over the whole cropping season. A larger discrepancy was found for the two other sites, 16 % and 19 % over the entire study period, especially during bare soil, early growth and senescence. This was attributed to site-specific soil <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> and possible chemical reactions between ozone and volatile organic compounds emitted during late senescence. Considering both night-time and daytime conditions, non-stomatal deposition was the major ozone sink, from 100 % during bare soil period to 70 – 80 % on average during maturity. However, considering only daytime conditions, especially under optimal climatic conditions for plant functioning, stomatal flux could represent 75 % of total ozone flux. This model could improve estimates of crop yield losses and projections of tropospheric ozone budget...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a model for ozone treatment in a dynamic bed of different microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, B. pumilus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aspergillus niger, Eupenicillium cinnamopurpureum) on a heterogeneous matrix (juniper berries, cardamom seeds) initially treated with numerous ozone doses during various contact times was studied. Taking into account various microorganism susceptibility to ozone, it was of great importance to develop a sufficiently effective ozone dose to preserve food products using different strains based on the microbial model. For this purpose, we have chosen the Weibull model to describe the survival curves of different microorganisms. Based on the results of microorganism survival modelling after ozone treatment and considering the least susceptible strains to ozone, we selected the critical ones. Among tested strains, those from genus Bacillus were recognized as the most critical strains. In particular, B. subtilis and B. pumilus possessed the highest <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> treatment because the time needed to achieve the lowest level of its survival was the longest (up to 17. 04 min and 16. 89 min for B. pumilus reduction on juniper berry and cardamom seed matrix, respectively).

40|$|Tropospheric ozone has {{detrimental}} {{effects on the}} health of vegetation and humans. It is also a direct greenhouse gas and plays a role in the chemistry of many other gases. Current measurements and model results show concentrations have increased and this is likely to continue. Thus {{it is important to understand}} how ozone is generated and processed in the atmosphere. New critical levels that use accumulated stomatal uptake rather than atmospheric concentration have recently been set by the UNECE to quantify the effect of ozone on vegetation. There are models available that can estimate the stornatal flux but the non-stomatal component is not well described. The total flux of ozone was measured over grassland in central Scotland during 2001 to 2004 using micrometeorological methods and the uptake by stomata estimated by similarity with the water-vapour flux. The non-stomata 1 component is estimated using Rns = (Rc-l - Rs-l) - 1 where Rns = non-stomatal surface <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> deposition, Rc = total canopy resistance, Rs = stomatal resistance. The dataset is used to examine the processes controlling deposition at this site and a new parameterisation for the non-stornatal component is described. There are two forms of model commonly used to estimate stomatal resistance: Iarvis type multiplicative models, and Ball-Berry photosynthesis based approaches. Both methods are employed to estimate bulk-canopy stomatal conductance and so gap-fill the measured time series. The resulting estimates of Rns were found to decrease with increasing surface temperature, solar radiation, humidity and friction velocity. The response of Rns to these variables was also dependant on surface wetness with deposition being enhanced over wet surfaces compared to dry, upto temperatures of ~ 20 °C. New parameterisations based on these results are developed and implemented in a total-deposition model. The results are compared to the measured data and estimates from both a standard type of model and one utilising an existing parameterisation for Rns based on humidity. The parameterisation was found to improve estimates of total canopy resistance for wet surfaces compared to both the other models, although for dry surfaces it did not perform as well as the humidity based model...|$|E

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} multi-layer scheme {{describing the}} coupled exchange {{of energy and}} CO 2, the emission of isoprene and the dry deposition of ozone is applied to a rain forest canopy in southwest Amazonia. The model was constrained using mean diel cycles of micrometeorological quantities observed during two periods in the wet and dry season 1999. Calculated net fluxes and concentration profiles for both seasonal periods are compared to observations made at two nearby towers. The modeled day- and nighttime thermal stratification of the canopy layer is consistent with observations in dense canopies. The observed and modeled net fluxes above and H 2 O and CO 2 concentration profiles within the canopy show a good agreement. The predicted net carbon sink decreases from 2. 5 t C ha - 1 yr - 1 for wet season conditions to 1 t C ha - 1 yr - 1 for dry season conditions, whereas observed and modeled midday Bowen ratio increases from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The evaluation results confirmed a seasonal variability of leaf physiological parameters, as already suggested in a companion study. The calculated midday canopy net flux of isoprene increased from 7. 1 mg C m - 2 h - 1 during the wet season to 11. 4 mg C m - 2 h - 1 during the late dry season. Applying a constant emission capacity in all canopy layers, resulted in a disagreement between observed and simulated profiles of isoprene concentrations, suggesting a smaller emission capacity of shade adapted leaves and deposition to the soil or leaf surfaces. Assuming a strong light acclimation of emission capacity, equivalent to a 66 % reduction of the standard emission factor for leaves in the lower canopy, resulted in a better agreement of observed and modeled concentration profiles and a 30 % reduction of the canopy net flux compared to model calculations with a constant emission factor. The mean calculated ozone flux for dry season conditions at noontime was ≈ 12 n mol m - 2 s - 1, agreeing well with observed values. The corresponding deposition velocity increased from 0. 8 cm s - 1 to > 1. 6 cm s - 1 in the wet season, {{which can not be}} explained by increased stomatal uptake. Considering reasonable physiological changes in stomatal regulation, the modeled value was not larger than 1. 05 cm s - 1.

This study measured the sustainability of a type of organic photovoltaic (OPV) film (P 3 HT:PC 71 BM) and its anodes (Al and MoO 3) to different levels of ozone environment and investigated the impact of ozone exposure on OPV film and anodes efficiency. The devices were fabricated in a Glove Box under controlled N 2 atmosphere using Spin Coating and Physical Vapor Deposition and exposed to varied ozone concentrations, followed by J-V measurements to determine the Power Conversion Efficiency and Fill Factor. The effects of ozone exposure on the films were compared vs. the effects of exposure on complete devices with anodes (Al and MoO 3). The {{results show that the}} devices decay from normal efficiency (4 %) to 0 % in 12 hours under 300 ppb (ï¿½ 10 %) ozone concentration and decay to 0 % in 6 hours when the ozone concentration was 600 ppb (ï¿½ 10 %), when only the polymer thin films are exposed. This established an inverse linear relationship between the decay rate and ozone exposure at high concentrations on the OPV films. Furthermore, the effect of exposure to ambient ozone concentration on the polymer films, which is 70 ppb (ï¿½ 15 %), was also investigated and the devices were found to decay to 0 % in 28 hours, which is much faster than expected. The decay resistance of complete devices when the polymer films are coated with thermally evaporated anodes (Al and MoO 3) before exposure to 400 ppb ozone concentration was investigated. The average efficiency of the complete device after 2, 6, 10, 15, 28 and 42 hours exposure in 400 ppb ozone environment was 4. 16 % {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 12 %.

It also describes potential new sensitive end points that might be available for ozone epidemiology studies in the near future. - Environ Health Perspect 101 (Suppl 4) : 225 - 230 (1993) ...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric ozone is {{considered}} the most damaging gaseous air pollutant worldwide to which plants are exposed. Tissue injuries, reductions in plant growth and productivity, and changes in crop quality {{are some of the}} effects of ozone on plants. Ozone causes more damage to vegetation than all other air pollutants combined. The economic impacts of ozone on crop growth and productivity continue to be significant. ^ Over the past several decades, researchers have focused on quantifying ozone-related damage on plants and establishing methods to explain plants 2 ̆ 7 reaction <b>to</b> <b>ozone.</b> Increasingly, however, {{it has been shown that}} plant species react <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> in many different ways: some are excessively susceptible and their development suffers or is severely reduced; others adapt themselves to new environmental conditions and become more tolerant. In some cases, certain cultivars even show resistance. ^ The studies presented here focus on the impacts of ozone injury on the development of plants with varying degrees of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> exposure and how growth rate and morphological characteristics affect plant responses <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> at various concentrations. The degree of plant sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> was determined by comparative field studies, or by using open top field chambers where plants were exposed <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> at various concentrations. In addition to crop yield evaluations from plants with differences in response <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> stomatal conductance was measured as a method of determining potential physiological changes. Stomatal density and aperture size were also assessed. ^ The present studies assess the relationship between morphological characteristics of ozone-sensitive and ozone-tolerant genotypes of bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and ozone exposure under different environmental conditions. The results support the expectation that genotypes within same species may show differences in response <b>to</b> <b>ozone.</b> Morphological characteristics, especially that of leaves, seem to influence individual plant responses to various atmospheric treatments. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{environmental}} conditions induce an oxidative stress in plant cells by {{the generation of}} abnormal concentrations of reactive-oxygen intermediates (ROI) such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. To protect themselves against these potentially damaging molecules, plants have evolved several enzymic mechanisms including superoxide dismutases (SODs), peroxidases and catalases. Recent molecular studies in Nicotiana species showed that the genes coding for the different ROI-scavenging enzymes are differentially regulated in response to environmental stress. Transgenic plants which overexpressed SOD genes in chloroplasts are more tolerant to treatment with the superoxide-generating herbicide paraquat and <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> fumigation. Strategies <b>to</b> engineer plants with high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> oxidative stress are discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} better the plant response <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> we isolated and characterized an ozone-sensitive (ozs 1) mutant strain from {{a set of}} T-DNA-tagged Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia. The mutant plants show enhanced sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> desiccation and sulfur dioxide, but have normal sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, low temperature and high light levels. The T-DNA was inserted at a single locus which is linked <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> sensitivity. Identification of the genomic sequences flanking the T-DNA insertion revealed disruption of a gene encoding a transporter-like protein of the tellurite resistance/C 4 -dicarboxylate transporter family. Plants with either of two different T-DNA insertions in this gene were also sensitive <b>to</b> <b>ozone,</b> and these plants failed to complement ozs 1. Transpiration levels, stomatal conductance levels {{and the size of}} stomatal apertures were greater in ozs...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of L 929 murine {{fibroblasts}} <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> {{resulted in}} K+ leakage and inhibition of several enzymes. Most sensitive <b>to</b> <b>ozone</b> exposure were glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. The activities of another cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and {{the activity of}} the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were, initially, not or only slightly affected. The localization of the lysosomal enzymes did not change during ozone exposure. After prolonged exposure complete deterioration of the cells was observed and all enzyme activities declined. The activity of the enzymes was also monitored during ozone exposure of a sonicated cell suspension and it was shown that all these enzymes are in fact susceptible <b>to</b> <b>ozone.</b> These observations clearly demonstrate that, besides the structure and amino acid composition of an enzyme, the localization in the cell {{plays an important role in}} its susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>ozone.</b> The intracellular levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were affected as well.
