40|$|An {{overview}} of current nuclear power generation and fuel cycle strategies in Europe is presented, {{with an emphasis}} on options for the management of separated plutonium in the medium to long term. Countries which have opted for reprocessing of spent fuel have had to contend with increasing inventories of separated plutonium. Of the various potential options for utilisation or disposition of these stockpiles, only light water reactor (LWR) mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel programmes are sufficiently technologically mature to be fully operational in several European countries at present. Such reprocessing-recycling programmes allow for a stabilisation of the overall separated plutonium stocks, but not for a significant reduction in the stockpile. Moreover, the quality of <b>recycled</b> <b>plutonium</b> decreases at each potential step of re-irradiation. Therefore, optimised or new ways of managing the plutonium stocks in the medium to long term are required.

In this process, the NJOY code system is used to generate the 69 group cross sections of WIMS code for the specified energy structure. In addition, the multiplication factor and spectral indices are compared against the results of continuous energy MCNP- 4 C code for evaluating the energy group structure.

40|$|Poster {{presented}} at Idaho National Laboratory for the 2014 Fuel Cycle Technologies Annual Review Meeting. Plutonium is currently used for nuclear energy {{production in the}} form of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in a once-through cycle. The spent fuel from these burnup cycles is then discarded as nuclear waste. MOX fuel burnup, however, transmutes some uranium into additional fissile plutonium, which can be extracted and remixed into new burnable MOX fuel. One can, in principle, repeat this process throughout multiple iterations, extracting more energy from nuclear fuel and diminishing the accumulation of plutonium in nuclear waste stockpiles. While the cost of reprocessing MOX fuel remains constant throughout recycling iterations, the isotopic composition of plutonium will change as fissile isotopes of plutonium are used up during MOX fuel burnup, while fertile isotopes accumulate. This isotopic drift will also change the neutronics properties of the MOX fuel made out of the <b>recycled</b> <b>plutonium,</b> which may limit the number of times one may recycle plutonium in such a fuel cycle. We studied the extent to which plutonium is recyclable in such a manner by running simulations of MOX fuel burnup in a pressurized water reactor using the 2 D neutronics code CASMO- 4 E...|$|E
