The realignment of the Breitenschützing-Schwanenstadt section, including the Römerberg Tunnel, followed in 1997. Three years later, two sections, St. Pölten-Prinzersdorf and Groß Sierning-Pöchlarn, including the Rohr “green” tunnel (that is built {{in order to protect}} the environment), the Wachberg II Tunnel and the Melk Tunnel, were <b>released</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> at 200 km/h.

Since the opening of the Amstetten-St. Peter-Seitenstetten section in 2003, trains can run continuously from Amstetten to St. Valentine at 200 km/h. In 2004, two junctions were built at Wagram and Rohr and finally in 2007 the Enns bypass (St. Valentin-Asten) was opened to traffic. As part of the rebuilding of St. Pölten Hauptbahnhof the double-bore Eisbergbogen tunnels (a single track tunnel for a passing track and a double track tunnel for the two main tracks) was built west of St. Pölten and opened to traffic in 2010.|$|R

In addition to the delivery of products, the line was used for supplies to the factory, especially coal. It also carried workers, similar to the Siemens Railway, which was built in the late 1920s in north-western Berlin.

At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, the station had ticket gates like other stations in the Palatinate. During this time, the railway station was managed by the Zweibrücken operations and construction inspectorate and its tracks were part of the responsibility of the Bahnmeisterei (track master's office) of Albersweiler-St. Johann. After Germany lost the First World War and the French military invaded, the Palatine network south of Maikammer-Kirrweiler was blockaded to passenger traffic on 1 December 1918, but <b>released</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> three days later. The line and Annweiler station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. A year later, the railway workers employed at the railway station were expelled during the operation of the railway by the French military during the occupation of the Palatinate by France. They then returned to work. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Saarbrücken on 1 May 1936 and the Betriebsamtes (RBA) Zweibrücken (operations office of Zweibrücken).|$|R

The lease to the Brooklyn Heights was canceled effective March 1, 1907, after which the Brooklyn Union Elevated operated itself. At the same time, the lease of the ground-level Canarsie Railroad, which was run {{as part of the}} elevated system, was transferred to the Brooklyn Union Elevated.

In response to the attacks on Saigon, elements of 1 ATF redeployed on 5 May, relieving the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade in an area of operations (AO) known as AO Columbus so that it could be <b>released</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> elsewhere, with companies from both battalions deploying to ambush suspected infiltration routes in the expectation of an attack by the 274th Regiment from the Viet Cong 5th Division. Five days later 2 RAR was relieved by 3 RAR, having completed its last major operation before returning to Australia. The Australians waited for the Viet Cong to make their move, but they again proved elusive and contact was only light, and by 10 May just six had been killed and one wounded after 21 days of operations. Having missed the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units as they infiltrated the capital, it was planned that the Australians would be again redeployed on 12 May in order to obstruct the withdrawal of these forces following their defeat in Saigon. The task force would subsequently concentrate astride Route 16 on one of the major north-south supply routes [...] north-east of Saigon, just east of Lai Khe in Binh Duong Province, in a new area of operations known as AO Surfers.

40|$|Component-based Software Engineering (CBSE) is {{currently}} a key paradigm used for developing safety-critical systems. It provides a fundamental means to master systems complexity, by allowing to design systems parts (i. e., components) for reuse and by allowing to develop those parts independently. One of the main challenges of introducing CBSE {{in this area is}} to ensure the integrity of the overall system after building it from individual components, since safety-critical systems require a rigorous development and qualification process to be <b>released</b> <b>for</b> the <b>operation.</b> Although the topic of compositional modelling and verification in the context of component-based systems has been studied intensively in the last decade, there {{is currently}} still a lack of tools and methods that can be applied practically and that consider major related systems quality attributes such as usability and scalability. In this paper, we present a novel approach for design-time modelling and verification of safety-critical systems, based on data semantics of components.

We show that CSP can be successfully applied for the verification of compositions for many types of properties. In our experimental setup we also show how the proposed verification scales with regard to the complexity of different system configurations...|$|R
