50|$|Expressive {{suppression}} is a response-focused emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> (Niedenthal 2006). This strategy {{involves an}} individual voluntarily suppressing their outward emotional expressions. Expressive suppression {{has a direct}} relationship to our emotional experiences and is significant in communication studies. Individuals who suppress their emotions are seeking to control their actions and are seeking to maintain a positive social image (Niedenthal 2006). Expressive suppression involves reducing facial expression and controlling positive and negative feelings of emotion. This type of emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> can have negative emotional and psychological effects on individuals. Emotional suppression reduces expressive behavior significantly. As many researchers have concluded, though emotional suppression decreases outward expressive emotions, it does not decrease our negative feelings and emotional arousal (Niedenthal 2006).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of group training of procedural emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> in cognitive coping of individuals suffering substance abuse. Method: A quasi-experimental design along with pretest-posttest and control group was used for this study. Then, 16 patients suffering substance abuse were selected through convenience sampling and were randomly assigned to two control and experimental groups. The experimental group received 10 sessions of group training of procedural emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> while the control group received no treatment. Both groups before and after the treatment completed the Persian version of cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire (Hasani, 2011). Results: The results showed that group training of e procedural motion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> leads to a reduction in maladaptive strategies such as self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, and other-blame and an increase in adaptive strategies such as refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, and perspective development.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a theoretical and integrative review about parental self-regulation and emotional regulation processes, and its connections with parental coping and temperament.

50|$|SPS-kinase {{reversibly}} phosphorylates a serine residue {{and subsequently}} deactivates SPS, In spinach and maize, {{the site of}} phosphorylation regulation {{has been identified as}} Ser158 and Ser162 respectively. While it is currently unclear if this seryl residue homolog in other plant SPSes is phosphorylated to suppress SPS activity, conservation of the neighboring residues has been observed in other plant species. This conserved sequence may potentially aid in recognition of a regulatory SPS-kinase. Once phosphorylated, the inactivated enzyme can be dephosphorylated and reactivated by SPS-phosphatase. Aside from controlling the levels of sucrose in the cell, regulation via phosphorylation can help the cell adapt to hyperosmotic conditions; in times of osmotic stress, the seryl residue is phosphorylated and enzyme activity decreases. This <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> also controls carbon flux from photosynthesis, as studies indicate the signal transduction pathway responsible for SPS activation responds to light stimulus.|$|E

Informed by the tripartite model of family impact on children’s emotion regulation, direct relations of emotion socialization components (modeling and reactions to the child’s negative emotions) and indirect relations of parental emotion-related beliefs (such as parental emotion regulation self-efficacy) were examined. Data on emotion socialization components and parental beliefs on emotion regulation were collected via self-report.

50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} of T box leader {{is still unclear}} and currently being studied, it has recently been recognized {{as a member of}} an expanding group of RNAs that are phylogenetically conserved across many gram-positive bacteria. They are structurally complex and able to directly sense physiological signals which results in the control of downstream gene expression. This controlling of gene expression is accomplished by transcriptional attenuation—a general transcriptional <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> that senses when an alteration in the rate of transcription is necessary and initiating alteration at a particular site (sometimes preceding one or more genes of an operon). The operons that encode aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, regulated by tRNA-mediated transcriptional attenuation, contain a leader region that specifies a transcript segment that can fold and eventually form a complex set of structures. Two of the most crucial segments to attenuation function as both the terminator and the antiterminator in different regulatory situations.|$|E
50|$|Expressive suppression, as {{an emotion}} <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy,</b> serves {{different}} purposes such as supporting goal pursuits and satisfying hedonic needs (Larsen 2012). Though expressive suppression {{is considered a}} weak influence {{on the experience of}} emotion, it has other functions. Expressive suppression is a goal-oriented strategy which is guided by people’s beliefs and potentially by abstract theories about emotion regulation (Larsen 2012). In a study by Larsen et al. (2012), the researchers looked at the positive association between expressive suppression and depressive symptoms among adults and adolescents which are influenced by parental support and peer victimization. They found a reciprocal relationship between parental support and depressive symptoms. The same was not true for the relationship between peer victimization and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms followed decreased perception of parental support one year later. They found that initial suppression occurred after increases in depressive symptoms one year later, yet depression did not occur after suppression.|$|E
50|$|Expressive {{suppression}} requires self-control. We use self-control when handling our emotion-based expressions in public. It {{is believed}} {{that the use of}} expressive suppression has a negative connection with a human’s well-being (Kühn et al., 2011). Expressive suppression has been found to occur late, after the peripheral physiological response or emotion process is triggered. Künh et al. (2011) compare this strategy to vetoing actions. This type of emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> is considered a method which strongly resists various urges and voluntarily inhibits actions. Kühn et al. (2011) also posited the notion that expression suppression may be internally controlled and that emotional responses are targeted by suppression efforts. One of the characteristics of expressive suppression, a response-based strategy, is that it occurs after an activated response. Larsen et al. (2013) claim expressive suppression {{to be one of the}} less effective emotion regulation strategies. These researchers label expressive suppression as an inhibition to the behavioral display of emotion.|$|E

40|$|There are {{indications}} that children with autism have difficulties with emotion regulation. Therefore, the emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> of children with autism in comparison with typically developing children were the target of this study. Because the development of emotion regulation skills is highly dependent {{on the influence of}} the mother, the empathy of the mother was also examined. The differences in emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> between children with autism and a non-clinical control group and the relationship with the empathy of the mother were tested in a laboratory session at Centre for Autism. The sample consisted of 53 mothers with their children, divided into a clinical group of children with autism (N = 19) and a non-clinical control group (N = 34). The age of the children varied between 41 and 81 months, with a mean of 56. 91 months (SD = 11. 27). To measure the emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies,</b> the children were exposed to an anxiety-provoking situation: the Mechanical Toy Paradigm. The empathy of the mother was determined by the self-assessment questionnaire Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Children with autism showed significantly more avoidance and non-constructive emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> than children in the control group. No difference was found in the use of constructive emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> between children with autism and the control group. Mothers from the clinical group and control group did not differ in the degree of empathy. There was no significant correlation between empathy of the mother and emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> of the child. Conclusion: children with autism have difficulties with regulating their emotions and this was not related to empathy of the mother. There is a need for future research on the behave of improving emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategies</b> for children with autism.

5000|$|As an {{appropriate}} level of expressive suppression {{is important for}} physiological and psychological health, it is equally as important {{for the maintenance of}} social situations. However, excessive use of expressive suppression can negatively affect social interactions. While expressive suppression may seem like an easier way of coping with emotions in society or of becoming more likable in a social environment, it actually alters behavior {{in a way that is}} visible and undesirable to others (Srivastava et al., 2009). [...] Because expressive suppression is an action that occurs in social interactions, it is reasonable that this emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>strategy</b> would have social implications. Specifically, suppression involves three social costs. The act of suppressing facial expressions prohibits others in the social world from gaining information about a suppressor’s emotional state. This can prevent a suppressor from receiving social emotional benefits such as sympathy or sharing in collective positive and negative emotions that “facilitate social bonding” (Srivastava et al., 2009, 895). [...] Secondly, expressive suppression is not always fully successful. If a suppressor accidentally shows signs of concealed feelings, others may perceive that the suppressor is covering up true emotions and may assume that the suppressor is insincere and uninterested in forming legitimate social relationships (Srivastava et al., 2009). [...] Lastly, expressive suppression is hard work and therefore requires more cognitive processing than freely communicating emotions. If a suppressor is unable to devote full attention to social interactions because he/she is using cognitive power to suppress, the suppressor will not be able to remain engaged nor put in the work to maintain relationships (Srivastava et al., 2009).|$|E
