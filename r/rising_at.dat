5|$|Kalam {{was noted}} for his {{integrity}} and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, {{and was in}} the habit of <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> 6:30 or 7 a.m and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.|$|E
5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the local water table, but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number of abandoned resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former Vauclusian spring, the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> Wookey was blocked.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, {{the power}} of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation was <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> the expense of Mary's mother, who {{maintained}} effective control only through the use of French troops. The Protestant Lords invited English troops into Scotland in an attempt to secure Protestantism, and a Huguenot rising in France, called the Tumult of Amboise, in March 1560 made it impossible for the French to send further support. Instead, the Guise brothers sent ambassadors to negotiate a settlement. On 11 June 1560, their sister (Mary's mother) died, and so the question of future Franco-Scots relations was a pressing one. Under the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh, signed by Mary's representatives on 6 July 1560, France and England undertook to withdraw troops from Scotland and France recognised Elizabeth's right to rule England. However, the seventeen-year-old Mary, still in France and grieving for her mother, refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E

25|$|Overlying ice had exerted {{pressure}} on the Earth's surface.

This is important for archaeologists since a site that was coastal in the Nordic Stone Age now is inland and can be dated by its relative distance from the present shore.|$|E

Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> an angle of 49°. This {{would have been an}} elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser’s complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected.|$|E

In Japan and northeastern Asia, the eclipse's end was visible, with the moon <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> sunset. In the Philippines it was observable as a partial lunar eclipse just after sunset.|$|E

After Liu Bei took over Yi Province, Sun Quan asked him to return three commanderies in southern Jing Province – Changsha (長沙), Lingling (零陵) and Guiyang (桂陽) – but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then ordered his general Lü Meng to lead his forces to seize the three commanderies by force. When Liu Bei found out, he returned to Gong'an County and sent Guan Yu to lead an army to stop Lü Meng.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test scores have been <b>rising</b> <b>at</b> an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the Flynn effect in the book The Bell Curve after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists.|$|E
