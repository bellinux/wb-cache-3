5000|$|In the {{interest}} of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. Originally developed for use in race cars {{as a way to}} prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, the system circulated twelve litres of oil between the storage tank mounted inside the right front fender and the engine as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic <b>retorquing</b> of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power-steering-fluid filters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engine was}} a cast iron V8 with single {{overhead}} camshafts operating sodium-filled valves against hardened valve seats on each aluminium alloy cylinder head. Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 {{of which were}} under full load. Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection was standard {{at a time when}} fuel-injected cars were uncommon. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were forged instead of cast. The 6.9 l (6834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was factory-rated at 286 hp (213 kW) with 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. A special version for Australia, based on the North American version, however without catalyst, was rated at 269 hp (198 kW) with 51 kpm (510 N·m) of torque.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} <b>retorque</b> on loosening torque (Lt) of prosthetic screws in implant-supported dentures with different fit levels. Ten mandibular implant-supported dentures were fabricated and then 20 cast models were then prepared using prosthetic structures to create 2 fit levels: passive fit (Pf) and misfit (Mf). Two tightening techniques were also evaluated: initial torque only (T 1); and initial torque and <b>retorque</b> after 10 min (T 2). Gold or titanium screws were used, resulting in 4 groups to each one: Pf/T 1, Pf/T 2, Mf/T 1, Mf/T 2. The Lt was measured 24 h after the tightening torque using digital torque meter. Data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05), separately for each screw material. For titanium screws, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found between Pf/T 1 and Pf/T 2, or between Pf/T 2 and Mf/T 2. However, statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) was found between Pf/T 1 and Mf/T 1, and between Mf/T 1 and Mf/T 2. Mf reduced the Lt using T 1, while and T 2 increased the Lt for Mf. <b>Retorque</b> and fit were shown to have no significant influence on the Lt of the gold screws. <b>Retorque</b> application made insignificant the misfit effect on the Lt of the titanium screws, suggesting that this procedure should be performed routinely during the screw tightening in multi-unit dentures...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of tightening technique and the screw coating on the loosening torque of screws used for Universal Abutment fixation after cyclic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty implants (Titamax Ti Cortical, HE, Neodent) (n= 10) were submerged in acrylic resin and four tightening techniques for Universal Abutment fixation were evaluated: A – torque with 32 Ncm (control); B – torque with 32 Ncm holding the torque meter for 20 seconds; C – torque with 32 Ncm and <b>retorque</b> after 10 minutes; D – torque (32 Ncm) holding the torque meter for 20 seconds and <b>retorque</b> after 10 minutes as initially. Samples were divided into subgroups according to the screw used: conventional titanium screw or diamond like carbon-coated (DLC) screw. Metallic crowns were fabricated for each abutment. Samples were submitted to cyclic loading at 106 cycles and 130 N of force. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5 %). RESULTS. The tightening technique did not show significant influence on the loosening torque of screws (P=. 509). Conventional titanium screws showed significant higher loosening torque values than DLC (P=. 000). CONCLUSION. The use of conventional titanium screw is more important than the tightening techniques employed in this study to provide long-term stability to Universal Abutment screws. [J Adv Prosthodon...|$|R

At the minimum, large sockets and high-capacity torque multipliers are necessary to enable the large nuts retaining the hold-downs to be removed and <b>retorqued</b> to proper specifications.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{etiology}} of screw loosening, several causes are to be considered [8]. Screw-nut systems generally become unstable when the load that {{is applied to the}} system exceeds that of the preload of the screw that causes a clamping force preventing separation of the joint [9]. Preload is proportional to the tightening torque at placement. Hence, tightening torque on the one hand has a significant effect on screw loosening [10]. Embedment relaxation or settling can be overcome by <b>retorquing</b> abutment screws after a certain period of time, increasing joint stability [9, 11]. On the other hand, the magnitude of forces applied to the system is of major influence. The transfer of high forces can be generated by bruxers, through non-occlusal loading or because of a non-passive fit of suprastructures [8, 12 - 15]. Other factors that are of influence of a systems’ resistance to screw loosening include lubrication, screw design, screw material, and surface characteristics [16 - 20]. Especially implant designs with an external hex configuration are prone to abutment screw loosening [21].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Technical {{complications}} such as veneer fractures {{are more}} common in implant-supported than tooth-supported restorations. The underlying causes have not been fully identified. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether misfit between the restoration and the implant may affect the risk of veneer fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty standardized five-unit implant-supported metal-ceramic fixed dental prostheses (FDP) s were manufactured and fixed in acrylic blocks. The test group consisted of ten FDPs fixed with a 150 -μm misfit at the distal abutment. The remaining ten FDPs were fixed without misfit and acted as a control group. All FDPS underwent cyclic loading for a total of 100, 000 cycles at 30 - 300 N. The FDPs were checked for cracks or chip-off fractures regularly. After cyclic load, the <b>retorque</b> value of all abutment screws was checked. RESULTS: Cracks within the veneering porcelain were noted in nine FDPs in the test group and one FDP in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Fractures of the veneering porcelain occurred in three FDPs in the test group. No fractures occurred in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in <b>retorque</b> values neither between the groups nor between different abutment positions in the FDPs. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this in vitro pilot trial, it is suggested that misfit between a restoration and the supporting implant may increase the risk of cracking and/or chipping of the veneering porcelain for metal-ceramic FDPs...|$|R
