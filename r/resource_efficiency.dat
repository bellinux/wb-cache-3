Each residence hall monitors and displays real time and historic electricity and water use. Some dorms also have special lamps which display a color depending on how real time energy use compares to the average historic energy use. The school's Campus Committee on Shareholder Responsibility provides students, faculty, and staff {{with the opportunity to}} make suggestions and decisions on proxy votes. A student board, the Oberlin College Green EDGE Fund, manages a set of accounts to support local sustainability, <b>resource</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and carbon offsetting projects. The Green EDGE Fund, created in 2007, allocates grants for environmental sustainability projects and verifiable carbon offsetting projects within the Oberlin community, as well as loans from a revolving fund for projects at Oberlin College that reduce resource consumption and have calculable financial savings for the college.|$|E

25|$|Even if {{the direct}} and {{indirect}} rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for {{the economy as a}} whole. In particular, this would happen if increased <b>resource</b> <b>efficiency</b> enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of economic growth. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to stagflation (recession and inflation) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.|$|E
2500|$|While {{efficient}} {{energy use}} and <b>resource</b> <b>efficiency</b> are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of coal {{plants in the}} European Union are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%. Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies {{in the range of}} 40–45% at newer plants. However, according to an impact assessment by the European Commission, this is still below the best available technological (BAT) efficiency levels of 46–49%. With gas-fired power plants the average efficiency is 52% compared to 58–59% with best available technology (BAT), and gas and oil boiler plants operate at average 36% efficiency (BAT delivers 47%). According to that same impact assessment by the European Commission, raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants, through the setting of authorisation and permit conditions, to an average generation efficiency of 51.5% in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of [...] of natural gas and [...] of coal.|$|E
2500|$|For cost {{reducing}} <b>resource</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{distinguishing between}} {{direct and indirect}} effects is shown in Figure 1 below. [...] The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and {{measured in terms of}} kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. [...] An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing. [...] This shifts the household budget line rightwards. [...] The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income. [...] The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2. [...] The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. [...] The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. [...] The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, {{it has been estimated that}} there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the spatial pattern {{of land and}} water resources as well as urbanization and their interactions in the Tarim River Basin, Xinjiang, China. In order to do so, we extract the data associated with efficiency of land and water resources and urbanization for the years of 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2008. Specifically the paper investigates {{the extent to which}} agglomeration of population and economic activities varies geographically and interplays with spatial pattern of <b>resources</b> <b>efficiency</b> through computation of Global Moran's I index, Getis-Ord Gi* index and a coordinated development model. The method used provides clear evidence that urbanization, land and water <b>resources</b> <b>efficiency</b> have shown uneven spatial pattern due to oasis distribution, climate, and initial phase of urban development. Some conclusions can be drawn as follows. (1) Agglomeration and dispersion of urbanization are not consistent with those of land and water <b>resources</b> <b>efficiency.</b> (2) Evolution of the hot and cold spots of urbanization, and land and water <b>resources</b> <b>efficiency,</b> in different trajectories, indicate that there are no significant interactions between them. (3) The evidence that numbers of hot and cold spots of the three factors present varying structures reveals the dominance of unequal urban development in the study area. (4) Significant differences are also found between sub-river basins in terms of the three factors, which {{is a reflection of the}} complex physical geography of the area. (5) The degree of coordinated development of cities in the Tarim River Basin is generally low in part as a reflection of difference in spatial patterns of the three factors. It is also shown that the pattern of the degree of coordinated development is relatively stable compared with evolution of hot and cold spots of the three factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} benefits of agricultural co-operatives are well rehearsed and have received significant attention in the literature, especially {{in regard to the}} <b>resource</b> <b>efficiencies</b> flowing from collective action that might be absent from investor-owned firms. This article provides evidence to show how these <b>resource</b> <b>efficiencies</b> might also manifest themselves as environmental advantages, which may not be available through investor-owned firms due to the different purpose of, and motivation for, business activity. Specifically, the article explores how co-operative businesses may deliver climate change benefits by examining case studies of alternative co-operative functions that provide a mix of qualitative and quantitative evidence. Results show that, where co-operative businesses achieve efficiencies through economies of scale, knowledge and skills transfer, sharing of risks and other means, this can also lead to coincidental reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that may not be achieved if investor-owned activity prevails. Whilst coincidental at present, the future exploitation of this phenomenon could lead to valuable market advantage or aid sustainable development policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} <b>resource</b> use <b>efficiency</b> {{of electricity}} generating {{plants in the}} United States under the SO 2 trading regime. <b>Resource</b> use <b>efficiency</b> {{is defined as the}} product of technical efficiency and environmental efficiency, where the latter is the ratio of good output (electricity) to bad output (SO 2) with reference to the best practice firm, i. e., one that is producing an optimal mix of good and bad outputs. This concept of environmental efficiency {{is similar to that of}} output oriented allocative efficiency. Using output distance functions we compare three methods for the calculation of <b>resource</b> use <b>efficiency,</b> namely, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), deterministic parametric programming and nonparametric linear programming. This paper reveals the strengths and weaknesses of these methods for estimating efficiency. Both SFA and linear programming approaches can estimate the efficiency scores. For plants in the dataset the overall geometric mean of the three methods for technical efficiency, environmental <b>efficiency</b> and <b>resource</b> use <b>efficiency</b> is 0. 737, 0. 335 and 0. 248, respectively.
