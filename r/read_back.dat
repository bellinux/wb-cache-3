25|$|The C64 uses a {{somewhat}} complicated memory banking scheme; the normal power-on default {{is to have}} the BASIC ROM mapped in at $A000 and the screen editor/kernal ROM at $E000. Memory underneath the system ROMs can be written to, but not <b>read</b> <b>back</b> without swapping out the ROMs. $1 contains a register with control bits for enabling/disabling the system ROMS as well as the I/O area at $D000. Most software swaps out the BASIC ROM, less often the kernal as the user must then provide his own code for I/O and interrupt handling. The $D000 page contains the I/O registers at power on, it can either be swapped with the character ROM (normally invisible to the CPU) or else simply the bare RAM underneath. If the I/O registers are swapped out, it is also necessary to disable interrupts via a SEI instruction. Theoretically, if all ROMs and the I/O area are swapped out, the entire 64k of system RAM is accessible to software aside from $0/$1 and the color RAM at $D800. If the kernel ROM is swapped out, BASIC will be removed with it and {{it is not possible to}} have BASIC active without the kernel.|$|E

2500|$|References to the {{political}} world of Shakespeare's time are littered throughout this Sonnet. As literary scholar Murray Krieger states [...] "Shakespeare {{is not likely to}} overlook the possibilities of metaphorical extension". The idea of that state is held highly in this sonnet, [...] "primarily it functions in the majestic world of sovereignty, the summit of political hierarchy". The poet, however, realizes the fragility of the state as even the state is [...] "subject to Time's love or to Time's hate" [...] (124.3). The English state during Shakespeare's life was ruled by Queen Elizabeth, who was regarded as high in virtue, intelligence and status. However, throughout Europe political assassinations ruled the continent and Elizabeth was not alone. She continually evaded numerous attempts at her life. The Sonnet extends out from the state as a political feature to [...] "envelop the contingencies of the human condition, the generic 'accident' of line 5". Shakespeare does this to show the linkages between the physical state of a nation as well as the 'state' of it populous.

He acknowledges that Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, though [...] "it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism." [...] Khalidi describes the Arab population of British Mandatory Palestine as having [...] "overlapping identities," [...] with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a Greater Syria, an Arab national project, as well as to Islam.

2500|$|The debate can be {{summarised}} as follows. In the Synoptic account, the Last Supper {{takes place}} {{on the first night}} of Passover, defined in the Torah as occurring after daylight on 14 of Nisan, and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan. However, in the Gospel of John the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover meal and the sentencing {{takes place on}} the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00pm and 5:00pm and eaten before midnight on that day. This understanding fits well with Old Testament typology, in which Jesus entered Jerusalem to identify himself as the Paschal lamb on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, {{at the same time the}} High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the First Fruits. It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the Last Supper was a Passover meal. [...] Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts, although Raymond E. Brown, reviewing these, concluded that they can not be easily reconciled. One involves the suggestion that [...] for Jesus and his disciples, the Passover could have begun at dawn Thursday, while for traditional Jews it would not have begun until dusk that same day. Another is that John followed the Roman practice of calculating the new day beginning at midnight, rather than the Jewish reckoning. However, this Roman practice was used only for dating contracts and leases. D. A. Carson argues that [...] 'preparation of the Passover' could mean any day of the Passover week. Some have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be <b>read</b> <b>back</b> into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available. Andreas KÃ¶stenberger argues that in the first century time was often estimated to the closest three-hour mark, [...] and that the intention of the author of the Mark Gospel was to provide the setting for the three hours of darkness while the Gospel of John seeks to stress the length of the proceedings, starting in the 'early morning'" [...] William Barclay has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the Lamb of God.|$|E
