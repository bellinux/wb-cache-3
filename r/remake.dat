40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} examines transnational cinema {{and cultural}} exchange {{through the lens}} of "transnational film remakes," or films made in one nation and remade in another. Looking at Hollywood <b>remakes</b> of European and East Asian films, as well as <b>remakes</b> that circumvent Hollywood, I argue that transnational <b>remakes</b> are privileged articulations of globalization, and as such, demonstrate struggles for power in a transnational field. Using a combination of critical political economy, textual analysis, and intertextual theory, I define these films as formal, institutional, and discursive objects. I engage in a number of intensive case studies that resonate with reconfigurations of time, space, and identity rendered under globalization.; Part I begins by examining film <b>remakes</b> in relation to adaptations and intertextuality. I then argue that the notion of "national cinemas" must give way to "transnational cultural industries," of which Hollywood is a particular example. I then assert the interrelation between transnational <b>remakes</b> and globalization. Part II engages in a historical study of the institutional and discursive forces through which the "transnational film remake" came about as a category. Industrially, this demonstrates remakes' relation to film piracy and to multi-language film versions, while the criteria for evaluating transnational <b>remakes</b> in popular criticism underwent distinct changes. Part III looks at transnational <b>remakes</b> between Hollywood and Europe, noting historical trends and points of ideological overlap and tension. I then analyze the films Abre los Ojos (1997) and Vanilla Sky (2001), paying particular attention to issues of "transnational identities. " The last chapter in Part III examines the contemporary Austrian avant-garde as a cinema of "counter-remakes. " Part IV marks the recent increase in Hollywood <b>remakes</b> of East Asian films. I engage in a historical survey of Hollywood-East Asian <b>remakes</b> followed by an analysis of "The Ring Intertext. " I also examine alternative tendencies within the contemporary cycle of Pacific Rim <b>remakes,</b> {{as well as some of}} the specific individuals who shaped this cycle. The last chapter of Part IV examines the shift from Euro-American to Pacific-Rim <b>remakes</b> in relation to "transnational space. " The Conclusion looks at <b>remakes</b> in terms of "failure" and "remarkability. ...|$|R

5|$|A sequel titled , was {{released}} in Japan on 29 December 2011, with an official English patch being released a year later on Christmas Day. The game is an episodic followup set around the holiday season and {{takes place in a}} separate universe from the first game, in which the events of Bad Boys Love do not occur. The sequel, developed largely alongside the first game, makes reference to and explores several unresolved plot elements brought up in the first game's Bad Boys Love scenario that could not be fully addressed in its main narrative. Unlike the first game, Holiday Star is a mostly linear visual novel rather than an otome game, with more standalone scenarios and fewer branching plotlines. On 4 June 2015, it was announced that Mediatonic, the developer responsible for the 2014 <b>remake</b> of the original game, was also developing a <b>remake</b> of Holiday Star, again to be published by Devolver Digital. The <b>remake</b> of the sequel is slated for release in Winter 2015.

5|$|Adventures of Mana is a <b>remake</b> of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was}} the first entry in the Mana series. It is the second <b>remake</b> of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first <b>remake</b> introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the <b>remake.</b>|$|E
