60|$|On {{the whole}} Stead {{was proud to}} see Jeph holding his own, though the {{youngest}} among these determined-looking men. These two years had made {{a man of the}} <b>rough,</b> <b>idle,</b> pleasure-loving boy, and a man after the Ironsides' fashion, grave, self-contained, and self-depending. Stead had been more like the elder than the younger brother in old times, but he felt Jeph immeasurably his elder in the new, unfamiliar atmosphere; and yet the boy had a strong sense that all was not right; that these were interlopers in the kind old Dean's house; that the talk about Baal was mere absurdity; and the profanation of the Cathedral would have been utterly shocking to his good father. His mind, however, worked slowly, and he would have had nothing to say even if he could have ventured to speak; but he was very anxious to get away; and when Jeph would have kept him to hear the serjeant expound a chapter of Revelation, he pleaded the necessity of getting home in time to milk the cows, and made his escape.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{modified}} {{for power}} at high engine speeds, such as auto racing engines, {{tend to have}} very <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> unless the idle speed is raised significantly.|$|E
50|$|EGR is {{typically}} not employed at high loads {{because it would}} reduce peak power output. This is because it reduces the intake charge density. EGR is also omitted at idle (low-speed, zero load) because it would cause unstable combustion, resulting in <b>rough</b> <b>idle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Driveability of {{a vehicle}} means the smooth {{delivery}} of power, as demanded by the driver. Typical causes of driveability degradation are <b>rough</b> <b>idling,</b> , , , or insufficient power.|$|R
50|$|On July 7, 2010, Toyota {{recalled}} 270,000 Lexus and Crown vehicles worldwide for improperly manufactured valve springs. According to Toyota, {{the condition}} can cause <b>rough</b> <b>idling</b> and potential engine stalling.|$|R
50|$|The '3E' and '3E-E' {{engines are}} {{considered}} slightly less reliable than other Toyota engines, {{although they are}} also among the easiest engines to service. The most common problems affecting these engines are premature valve stem seal (nitrile) failure, carbon buildup on the intake valves, and collapse of the oil control ring on the piston. Any of these conditions can lead to <b>rough</b> <b>idling,</b> stalling, and fouled spark plugs, and therefore need to be differentially diagnosed. The valve stem seals, at least, can be replaced with silicone or viton-based seals which last much longer.|$|R
50|$|With other problems, {{the driver}} {{may be able}} to operate the vehicle {{seemingly}} normally for some time, but the vehicle will need an eventual repair. These include grinding brakes, <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> (often caused by the need for a tune-up), or poor shock absorption. Many vehicle owners with personal economic difficulty or a busy schedule may wait longer than they should get necessary repairs made to their vehicles, thereby increasing damage or else causing more danger.|$|E
50|$|Lean {{mixtures}} {{improve the}} fuel economy but also cause sharp {{rises in the}} amount of nitrogen oxides (NOX). If the mixture becomes too lean, the engine may fail to ignite, causing misfire and a large increase in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Lean mixtures burn hotter and may cause <b>rough</b> <b>idle,</b> hard starting and stalling, and can even damage the catalytic converter, or burn valves in the engine. The risk of spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) is also increased when the engine is under load.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of engine}} still has tappet noise even after adjustment. This noise is said {{to come from the}} cams due to {{incorrect}} valve setup (when setting valve clearance each cylinder must be set to TDC) or from age and use of incorrect oil grade. The correct oil grade is 5W-30 semi synthetic oil. Another reason is the large tappet clearance on the exhaust valve. This could of course be reduced to lower the noise level but the engine would then suffer from a <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> and usually stalled.|$|E
5000|$|The highly {{successful}} and versatile 427-cubic-inch (426.7 cuin) (7.0 L) {{version of the}} Mark IV engine was introduced in 1966 as a production engine option for full-sized Chevrolets and Corvettes. The bore was increased to 4.25 in, with power ratings varying widely depending on the application. There were smooth running versions with hydraulic lifters suitable for powering the family station wagon, as well as <b>rough</b> <b>idling,</b> high-revving solid lifter models usually applied to a minimally equipped, plain looking, two door Biscayne sedan fitted with the [...] version of the 427 - (RPO L72).|$|R
40|$|The project {{objective}} is to demonstrate the viability of HCNG fuel (30 to 50 % hydrogen by volume and the remainder natural gas) to reduce emissions from light-duty on-road vehicles with no loss in performance or efficiency. The City of Las Vegas {{has an interest in}} alternative fuels and already has an existing hydrogen refueling station. Collier Technologies Inc (CT) supplied the latest design retrofit kits capable of converting nine compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled, light-duty vehicles powered by the Ford 5. 4 L Triton engine. CT installed the kits on the first two vehicles in Las Vegas, trained personnel at the City of Las Vegas (the City) to perform the additional seven retrofits, and developed materials for allowing other entities to perform these retrofits as well. These vehicles were used in normal service by the City while driver impressions, reliability, fuel efficiency and emissions were documented for a minimum of one year after conversion. This project has shown the efficacy of operating vehicles originally designed to operate on compressed natural gas with HCNG fuel incorporating large quantities of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). There were no safety issues experienced with these vehicles. The only maintenance issue in the project was some <b>rough</b> <b>idling</b> due to problems with the EGR valve and piping parts. Once the <b>rough</b> <b>idling</b> was corrected no further maintenance issues with these vehicles were experienced. Fuel economy data showed no significant changes after conversion even with the added power provided by the superchargers that were part of the conversions. Driver feedback for the conversions was very favorable. The additional power provided by the HCNG vehicles was greatly appreciated, especially in traffic. The drivability of the HCNG vehicles was considered to be superior by the drivers. Most of the converted vehicles showed zero oxides of nitrogen throughout the life of the project using the State of Nevada emissions station...|$|R

Upon Australian launch in June 2012, all models for Australia featured a full-size spare wheel, the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a limited slip differential or [...] LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's. The full-size spare wheel was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a repair kit.

50|$|The 49-state {{model of}} the CEC has no {{on-board}} diagnostic system, {{making it difficult to}} monitor the computer's operation without a breakout box, and the Carter BBD carburetor on most CEC-equipped models has problems with its idle circuit clogging, causing a <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> and stalling. In places where emissions testing is not required, a popular modification is to bypass the computer and disable the BBD's Idle Servo, or replace the BBD with a manually tuned carburetor. Several vendors (including Chrysler and Edelbrock) offer retrofit kits that replace the CEC and the carburetor with fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|The “traditional” {{application}} of VVA (especially variable duration) is {{to match the}} engine RPM to the valve opening duration (this is very roughly what the VTEC does). The general idea being to improve the high RPM performance without the associated problems of a long duration “racing” cam which are lack of lower RPM power, <b>rough</b> <b>idle,</b> etc. Engines typically need a roughly linear increase in duration as the RPM rises. The aim is to maximise the torque at every point in the allowable RPM range. This means that with the Helical Camshaft the old concept of a maximum power point in an RPM range no longer applies. With the Helical Camshaft the power continues to build until the “breathing” limit of the induction system is reached - or more likely, the mechanical strength limit of the engine’s components is exceeded. The Helical Camshaft’s typical 250 degree to 350 + degree duration range basically means that a suitably robust engine could “pull” strongly from about 1500 RPM to maybe 20,000 + RPM and still idle smoothly at 500 or 600 RPM.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|E
5000|$|A {{glow plug}} engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} glow plug temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a hotter glow plug to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best glow plug temperature; in cold weather, hotter plugs are needed. Since glow plug engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause <b>rougher</b> <b>idling</b> and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a hotter plug is required.|$|R

5000|$|While General Motors' fuels {{engineer}} Andrew Buczynsky {{states that}} no one has identified the exact molecule in gasoline that causes engine buildup, he asserts that consistent use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline will keep engines cleaner. Engine gunk typically builds up in fuel injectors and intake valves, causing reduced fuel efficiency, acceleration, and power, as well as increasing emissions, <b>rough</b> <b>idling,</b> tendency to stall, and increased motor repairs. When fuel injectors accumulate deposits, they do not distribute fuel evenly, creating pockets of too much fuel and too little fuel. Too-little fuel around the spark plug dampens the combustion that drives the piston downward and may cause a misfire. When the frequency of misfires reaches a certain point, the on-board computer turns on the [...] "service engine" [...] light on the dash. The repair for this type of problem depends on the severity of the deposits. In milder cases, a mechanic may solve the problem by adding a can of fuel-injector cleaner into the gas tank. However, in some cases, the fuel injectors must be replaced. If the deposits have formed on the intake valves, they may be removed via walnut shell blasting. In severe cases, a more costly cylinder-head rebuild may be necessary.|$|R
50|$|The mesh on the MAF is used {{to smooth}} out airflow to ensure the sensors {{have the best chance}} of a steady reading. It is not used for {{measuring}} the air flow per se. In situations where owners use oiled-gauze air filters, it is possible for excess oil to coat the MAF sensor and skew its readings. Indeed, General Motors has issued a Technical Service Bulletin, indicating problems from <b>rough</b> <b>idle</b> all the way to possible transmission damage resulting from the contaminated sensors. To clean the delicate MAF sensor components, a specific MAF sensor cleaner or electronics cleaner should be used, not carburetor or brake cleaners, which can be too aggressive chemically. Instead, the liquid phase of MAF sensor cleaners and electronics cleaners is typically based on hexanes or heptanes with little to no alcohol content and use either carbon dioxide or HFC-152a as aerosol propellants. The sensors should be gently sprayed from a careful distance to avoid physically damaging them and then allowed to thoroughly dry before reinstalling. Manufacturers claim that a simple but extremely reliable test to ensure correct functionality is to tap the unit with the back of a screwdriver while the car is running, and if this causes any changes in the output frequency then the unit should be discarded and an OEM replacement installed.|$|E
5000|$|The first EGR {{systems were}} crude; some were {{as simple as}} an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which {{admitted}} exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, <b>rough</b> <b>idling,</b> and reduced performance and fuel economy resulted. By 1973, an EGR valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Chrysler's [...] "Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation" [...] system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the EGR valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; NOx forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the EGR valve was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor's venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of EGR flow to only those engine load conditions under which NOx is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers {{were added to the}} EGR valve control to further tailor EGR flow to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have {{led to the development of}} engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.|$|R
5000|$|The Hyper Pak was a parts package made {{available}} from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a high idle speed was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving <b>rough</b> <b>idling</b> and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|R
50|$|Though {{initially}} {{relatively inexpensive}} mobile radio system components, frequently damaged antennas {{can be costly}} to replace since they are usually not included in maintenance contracts for mobile radio fleets. Some types of vehicles in 24-hour use, with stiff suspensions, tall heights, or <b>rough</b> diesel engine <b>idle</b> vibrations may damage antennas quickly. The location and type of antenna can affect system performance drastically. Large fleets usually test a few vehicles before making a commitment to a certain antenna location or type.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{initially}} offered {{with the larger}} , single carburettor, 1.5 L Kent engine that was also used in the smaller Cortina, in standard and GT form. The range was revised in September 1965, adopting new Ford Essex V4 engines, making it <b>rough</b> at <b>idle</b> and coarse on the road. This engine was available in 1663 cc form at first, but later in 1966, a larger 2.0 litre L version was offered alongside. One marketing tag line for the V4 models was [...] "The Car That Is Seen But Not Heard", which was a real stretch of the ad man's puff, given the inherent characteristics of the engine. The other tag was [...] "I've got a V in my bonnet". A 3.0 litre conversion using the Ford Essex V6 engine {{was one of the}} options available via Crayford Engineering.|$|R
40|$|Leveraging {{concurrent}} {{transmission is}} a promising {{way to improve}} throughput in wireless networks. Existing media access control (MAC) protocols like {{carrier sense multiple access}} always try to minimize the number of concurrent transmissions to avoid collision, although collisions at sender sides are harmless to the overall performance. The reason for such conservative strategy is that those protocols cannot obtain accurate channel status (who is transmitting and receiving) with low cost. They can only avoid potential collisions through <b>rough</b> channel status (<b>idle</b> or busy). To obtain additional information in a cost-efficient way, we propose a novel coding scheme, Attachment Coding, to allow control information to be "attached" on data packet. Nodes then transmit two kinds of signals simultaneously, without degrading the effective throughput of the original data traffic. Based on Attachment Coding, we propose an Attached-RTS MAC (AR-MAC) to exploit exposed terminals for concurrent transmissions. The attached control information provides accurate channel status for nodes in real time. Therefore, nodes can identify exposed terminals and utilize them for concurrent transmission. We theoretically analyze the feasibility of Attachment Coding, and implement it on the GNU Radio testbed to further verify it. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of Attached-RTS. The experimental results show that by leveraging Attachment Coding, AR-MAC achieves up to 180 percent in dense deployed ad hoc networks...|$|R

He had admired Jane Hubbard before, but the {{intimacy}} of the sick-room and the stories which {{she had told him}} to relieve the tedium of his invalid state had set the seal on his devotion. It has always been like this since Othello wooed Desdemona. For three days Jane Hubbard had been weaving her spell about Eustace Hignett, and now she monopolised his entire horizon. She had spoken, like Othello, of antres vast and deserts <b>idle,</b> <b>rough</b> quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touched heaven, and of the cannibals that each other eat, the Anthropophagi, and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear would Eustace Hignett seriously incline, and swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 'twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful. He loved her for the dangers she had passed, and she loved him that he did pity them. In fact, one would have said that it was all over except buying the licence, {{had it not been for}} the fact that his very admiration served to keep Eustace from pouring out his heart. It seemed incredible to him that the queen of her sex, a girl who had chatted in terms of equality with African head-hunters and who swatted alligators as though they were flies, could ever lower herself to care for a man who looked like the [...] "after-taking" [...] advertisement of a patent food.|$|R
