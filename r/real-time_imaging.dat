25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows <b>real-time</b> <b>imaging</b> of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the <b>real-time</b> <b>imaging,</b> allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
25|$|A probe {{is placed}} {{through the skin}} and into the tumor using <b>real-time</b> <b>imaging</b> of both the probe tip and the tumor by {{computed}} tomography, ultrasound, or even magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and then destroying the tumor with heat (radiofrequency ablation) or cold (cryotherapy). These modalities are at a disadvantage compared to traditional surgery in that pathologic confirmation of complete tumor destruction is not possible. Therefore, long-term follow-up is crucial to assess completeness of tumour ablation. Ideally, percutaneous ablation is restricted to tumours smaller than 3.5nbsp&cm and to guide the treatment. However, there are some cases where ablation {{can be used on}} tumors that are larger.|$|E
25|$|The A. Vassiliadis Pavilion for Advanced Surgery has 14 {{operating}} rooms of 650 sq ft each. It occupies {{the second and}} third floors of the medical center and is named for Carol Vassiliadis' $8.5 million gift on behalf of her deceased husband Alkiviadis. The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow <b>real-time</b> <b>imaging</b> of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Real-time</b> {{ultrasound}} <b>imaging</b> {{is currently}} used extensively in medicine. It provides a safe, cost-effective and readily accessible method of examination of various organs and tissues. One area where ultrasonography {{has proved to}} be useful is investigation of musculoskeletal pathology. Tissues that can be imaged include muscles, tendons, joints, ligaments and bursae. One of the most useful features of <b>real-time</b> ultrasound <b>imaging</b> is that movement of anatomical structures can be observed as it actually occurs. This has allowed development of a new application of <b>real-time</b> ultrasound <b>imaging</b> for rehabilitation that involves observation of muscle contraction to provide feedback. An ability to image deep muscles is an advantage of the technique, and use of ultrasound imaging has been successfully incorporated in assessment and facilitation strategies for the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles in low back pain (LBP) patients. The objective {{of this article is to}} provide a brief review of the principles, advantages and disadvantages of ultrasound imaging and to discuss this new application of real-time ultrasound to rehabilitation. The current use of <b>real-time</b> ultrasound <b>imaging</b> in LBP patients will be described, and future uses in rehabilitation and limitations discussed...|$|R
25|$|Proof of {{improved}} survival benefit from {{either of these}} two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers {{in a series of}} pivotal trials performed by Professor Christopher Nutting of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertaintyâ€”for example, <b>real-time</b> <b>imaging</b> combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.|$|E

2500|$|A linear {{accelerator}} (linac) produces x-rays {{from the impact}} of accelerated electrons striking a high z target (usually tungsten). [...] A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6MV photons are used. [...] With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point. [...] These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that {{has proven to be}} both comfortable for the patient and accurate.
