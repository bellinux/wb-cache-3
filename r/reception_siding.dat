As to conventional polarimetric systems, the transmission side alternatively transmits {{horizontal and vertical}} polarizations, i.e., ξ[*]=[*][1,[*] 0]T in the current pulse and ξ[*]=[*][0,[*] 1]T in next pulse. In the <b>reception</b> <b>side,</b> the horizontal and vertical polarizations are simultaneously received, so the reception vector satisfies η =[√(2)/ 2,√(2)/ 2]^T.

Then, as to the scalar system with transmission polarization optimization, the transmission polarization [ξ_h,ξ_v]^T is allowed to be chosen freely while the reception polarization is fixed as [√(2)/ 2,√(2)/ 2]^T. As such, we can employ Algorithm 1 to optimally select transmission polarization by fixing θ[*]=[*]−[*]π/ 4 and ϑ[*]=[*] 0.|$|R

The colored transmission {{makes it possible to}} extract each waveform and form the transmission beam by digital processing on the <b>reception</b> <b>side.</b> One strong limitation of this technique is that waveforms cannot be perfectly separated in practice, because of the intrinsic lack of orthogonality of the waveforms family or hardware defaults.

In this paper, we introduce another approach to perform the estimation of target detection and localization based on adaptive processing such as Capon estimation. We define the techniques especially for MIMO radar configurations and we use them on realistic signals, taking into account the properties of non perfect orthogonality of the transmitted MIMO waveforms.

This technique ensures that the decoded speech maintains the approximate correlation normally present in speech. In order to justify the quality of speech we have made use of spectrogram analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{the novel}} {{adaptive}} fuzzy logic controller (FLC) proposed in {{this paper is to}} eliminate buffer overflow at the <b>reception</b> <b>side</b> of an Internet channel. The elimination improves channel reliability and leads to shorter service roundtrip time (RTT) because of reduced retransmission. The FLC combines the extant, less adaptive PID controller with fuzzy logic, which divides the original PID control domain into finer fuzzy regions. Then, every region is governed by a predefined fuzzy rule or simply a don't care state that requires no computation or parametric changes. The goal of the don't care states is to offset the FLC complexity so that the controller execution time is reduced. The FLC adaptively maintains the given safety margin Δ of the chosen objective function { 0, Δ} 2. The value for Δ is normally a preset difference between the buffer length and the queue length. The repeated timing analyses for the FLC with the Intel's VTune performer analyzer confirms its capability for supporting real-time computing efficaciously.
