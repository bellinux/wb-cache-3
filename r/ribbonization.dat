40|$|We {{develop the}} concept of Cartan ribbons and a method by which {{they can be used}} to ribbonize any given surface in space by {{intrinsically}} flat ribbons. The geodesic curvature along the center curve on the surface agrees with the geodesic curvature of the corresponding Cartan development curve, and this makes a rolling strategy successful. Essentially, it follows from the orientational alignment of the two co-moving Darboux frames during the rolling. Using closed center curves we obtain closed approximating Cartan ribbons that contribute zero to the total curvature integral of the <b>ribbonization.</b> This paves the way for a particular simple topological inspection [...] it is reduced {{to the question of how}} the ribbons organize their edges relative to each other. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem leads to this topological inspection of the vertices. Finally, we display two examples of ribbonizations of surfaces, namely of a torus using two ribbons, and of an ellipsoid using its closed curvature lines as center curves for the ribbons. The topological inspection of the torus <b>ribbonization</b> is particularly simple as it has no vertex points, giving directly the Euler characteristic $ 0 $. The ellipsoid has $ 4 $ vertices [...] corresponding to the $ 4 $ umbilical points [...] each of degree one and each therefore contributing one-half to the Euler characteristic...|$|E
