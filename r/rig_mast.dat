40|$|Abstract. The mast is an {{important}} support and loading component of the executive mechanism of rotary drilling rig, and plays a very essential role during the normal operating process for the whole machine. According to the work characteristics of the rotary drilling rig, the stress and deformation of the mast structure were calculated under the extreme conditions of two typical operations, which are drill-extracting and drilling conditions. The {{results show that the}} stress concentrated areas are located near the two connecting hinged joints between the mast and support cylinder and tripod under working conditions, and the results obtained from this paper can provide a theoretical reference for the design of the rotary drilling <b>rig</b> <b>mast...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the main features}} and initial underwater field-testing results of a remotely operated submersible drill rig designed to obtain continuous cores of soil and/or rock up to 6 m long in water depths of 200 m. The <b>rig</b> <b>mast</b> angle is hydraulically actuated covering 90 ° of altitude. This enables both a fully horizontal position used for deployment onto, and recovery of the rig from, the seabed, {{as well as a}} fully vertical position during coring. The frame is equipped with positioning and inclination sensors for accurate register of core orientation. Coring equipment with diameter of up to 133 mm can be mounted in the rig, thus enabling the recovery of relatively large-diameter cores. The coring operation is fully instrumented and all the drill operation parameters such as torque, thrust, advance, injection rate and pressure are recorded. The equipment is deployable from a variety of platforms. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design a 9. 50 m racing yacht from {{the requirements of the}} Figaro class in order to change the actual Beneteau Figaro. After ten years of racing, the Figaro class has decided to draw up requirements to design the future one-design, which will be produced in 2003. The requirements have done by the authority of the Figaro Class and 80 “Figaristes” (racers). Finot and Berret designed the actual Figaro in 1990. Beneteau has built 120 boat of this type. The boat is powerful and it can be used in single-handed or with crew. This yacht {{is one of the most}} successful racing yachts in France. The races are usually offshore and the most known are in single-handed “La Course du Figaro” and in doubles “La Transat AG 2 R”. The Yacht is used also for crew events such as the week of “La Rochelle”, “Le Spi-Ouest-France” and many other races in order to have professional sailor. The new one keep the spirit of the actual Figaro but it will be longer in length and could be benefit of the new technology specially in the building method and materials. It will be inexpensive one-design. This concept allows having less difficulty to buy a boat and to have many sailors. The drawings were done on Macsurf and Autocad. The structural design was calculated from ABS requirements and many spreadsheets were used to calculate <b>rig,</b> <b>mast,</b> appendages and so on. ...|$|E

50|$|Both {{ships were}} flush deck {{with only a}} jury rig, and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, {{although}} impressed with Coles' rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining <b>rigging,</b> <b>masts,</b> and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.|$|R
50|$|Rear Admiral John G. Walker {{served as}} its Commander with Chicago as his flagship. Walker was {{a proponent of}} the {{relatively}} new practice of concentrating ships into formations controlled by a single commander, and used his position to carry out exercises in squadron tactics, ship-to-ship signalling, and landing operations. Having both full <b>rigged</b> <b>masts</b> and steam engines, the White Squadron was also influential {{in the beginning of}} steel shipbuilding in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Riachuelo was {{constructed}} with a steel hull, {{and was the}} first battleship with a compound armour belt, following shortly after the Argentine armoured corvette [...] Both Riachuelo and Aquidabã had an unusual design that became popular in the 1870s and 1880s: the two main gun turrets were placed off the centreline, en echelon, with the forward turret offset to port and the aft turret to starboard. The superstructure ran the full length of the vessel, higher than both turrets, with two funnels and three fully <b>rigged</b> <b>masts.</b> Aquidabã can be distinguished by its single funnel.|$|R

50|$|The {{painting}} measures 73 xx 55 in. It depicts several crewmen on {{the deck}} of a ship in a storm, manning the pump to remove water from the vessel. The ship has lost at least one of its sails, and the deck is awash. The red ensign hangs upside down from the shrouds to indicate the ship's distress. One man shouts up towards the rigging, and another is up in the shrouds gesturing at the swell. The lively composition uses diagonal lines - arms, <b>rigging,</b> <b>mast,</b> pump handle, wind-blown flag - to draw the eye around the painting.|$|R
50|$|The steel {{superstructure}} includes the bridge, <b>rigged</b> <b>mast,</b> and cable. The main {{span of the}} bridge, which is stretched between two poles, has a length of 450 meters. The main span is a trapezoid 33 meters wide. The bridge has a walkway along its side. The bridge has two main pylons 3 x 4.50 metres. This serves to hold the tension of the cable and weight into the pylon pier. The 121 - 167 mm diameter cables consist of many small wires wound together. The cables vary in length from 50 to 223 meters can absorb the tension for 1,500 - 3,000 tons.|$|R
50|$|A five-masted jackass barque, {{which has}} {{probably}} never been built, would {{be equipped with}} square-rigged fore and main masts, with a partially square-rigged and partially fore-and-aft <b>rigged</b> mizzen <b>mast,</b> and fore-and-aft <b>rigged</b> jigger and spanker masts.|$|R
5000|$|It is, however, {{possible}} (and often successfully) {{to right}} a capsized small multihull, e.g., a Beachcat and Hobie 16. The process begins with positioning ropes {{so that the}} crew can get leverage (acting together is key). Righting Beach catamarans that are turtled can be extremely difficult. Loss of sails, <b>rigging,</b> <b>masts</b> and boats can occur. [...] Not to mention sailors. [...] A singled-handed self rescue can be assisted by filling a garbage bag (called in this context a [...] "righting bag") with water, and throwing it over the rescuer's shoulder. [...] See Hobie 16 which suggests sitting on the rear of one sponson, which will upturn a turtled Hobie.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steamship}} Kamloops {{was built}} by Furness Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Haverton Hill within Stockton-on-Tees in the northeast of England for Steamships Ltd of Montreal, Quebec. [...] With a length of only 250 feet (75 m) and rated at 2,402 gross tons, the Kamloops was a relatively small vessel for the Great Lakes in the 1920s. [...] She was built to fit inside the locks of the Welland Canal and other Canadian-operated canals of the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River during the {{years prior to the}} construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. [...] The ship had two <b>rigged</b> <b>masts,</b> and a 1000HP triple expansion steam engine with Scotch boilers.|$|R

50|$|Some {{sailboat}} {{designs for}} trailering incorporate special features. The MacGregor 26S, for {{example is a}} boat 25.82 ft in length, but that weighs 1650 lb empty and dry and carries 1200 lb of flooding water ballast in tanks which are filled when the boat is launched and drained when the boat {{is removed from the}} water, thus making the boat lighter to transport than if it used more traditional iron or lead ballast. The design also has a pivoting centreboard, plus a pivoting rudder and easily <b>rigged</b> <b>mast</b> to make getting the boat from the trailer to the water easy to accomplish. It also has a beam of 7.82 ft, under the 8.00 ft width limit for highway trailers.|$|R
