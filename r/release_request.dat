50|$|After Brown {{completed}} his 90 days, the judge {{ordered him to}} remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go directly to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown {{was kicked out of}} the rehab facility and sent to jail for violating internal rules. He was expected to be released on April 23, 2014 but Superior Court Judge Victor Greenberg denied his <b>release</b> <b>request</b> from custody either on bail or his own recognizance. At his May 9, 2014 court date, Brown was ordered to serve 131 days in jail for his probation violation. He was sentenced to serve 365 days in custody, however he was given credit for the 234 days he has already spent in rehab and jail.|$|E
5000|$|On the April 6, 2017 {{edition of}} Impact, Morgan made his return {{as the third}} pick on Team Jeremy Borash, joining Chris Adonis, Magnus and Alberto El Patrón. The foursome would defeat Team Josh Mathews (Bram, Eli Drake, Lashley and Tyrus) the {{following}} week. Morgan's next match was for the GFW Global Championship on Impact's May 4 episode; he would lose after suffering a low blow followed by a Michinoku Driver from then champion Magnus, solidifying the latter's heel turn. This would be Morgan's final appearance as he was granted his <b>release</b> <b>request</b> on July 24 by GFW, which was now Impact Wrestling renamed following its merger with Jarrett's promotion on April 20. Morgan says he had only agreed to return because Impact was close to his home, only taped on the weekends and did not tour, and therefore would not interfere with his other 9 to 5 career. This changed when GFW started taping its shows on weekdays and planning to travel, and so Morgan wanted out of the Promotion.|$|E

30|$|As {{reclamation}} phases are completed, the permitte {{may apply}} for incremental phased bond release. Phased bonding encourages companies to begin reclamation {{as soon as}} possible (called contemporaneous reclamation). Specific bond release requests are approved in the field after joint inspection by the land owners, permit operator, LQD, and OSMRE representatives. Additionally, the operator compares the data gathered during the baseline inventory with data gathered from the reclaimed land. After reviewing the submitted information and performing a field inspection, the LQD representative makes a decision to approve or deny the bond <b>release</b> <b>request.</b> If an Area Bond and Phase 1 request is approved, 60 % of the bond can be released, for Phase 2, 15 %, and for Phase 3, 25 % of the bond can be released.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Given a {{complete}} binary tree of height h,theonline tree node assignment {{problem is to}} serve a sequence of assignment/release requests, where an assignment request, withanintegerparameter 0 ≤ i ≤ h, is served by assigning a (tree) node at level (or height) i and a <b>release</b> <b>request</b> is served by releasing a specified assigned node. The node assignments have to guarantee that no node is assigned to two assignment requests unreleased, and every leaf-to-root path of the tree contains at most one assigned node. With assigned node reassignments allowed, {{the target of the}} problem is to minimize the number of assignments/reassigments, i. e., the cost, to serve the whole sequence of requests. This online tree node assignment problem is fundamental to many applications, including OVSF code assignment in WCDMA networks, buddy memory allocation and hypercube subcube allocation. Most of the previous results focus on how to achieve good performance when the same amount of resource is given to both the online and the optimal offline algorithms, i. e., one tree. In this paper, we focus on resource augmentation, where the online algorithm is allowed to use more trees than the optimal offline algorithm. By using different approaches, we give (1) a 1 -competitive online algorithm, which uses (h + 1) / 2 trees, and is optimal because (h + 1) / 2 trees are required by any online algorithm to match the cost of the optimal offline algorithm with one tree; (2) a 2 -competitive algorithm with 3 h/ 8 + 2 trees; (3) an amortized (4 / 3 +α) -competitive algorithm with (11 / 4 + 4 /(3 α)) trees, for any α where 0 <α ≤ 4 / 3. ...|$|E
