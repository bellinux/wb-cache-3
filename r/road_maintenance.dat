5|$|While Britain's {{seafaring}} {{and trading}} concerns ensured {{the spread of}} cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels. Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1706, Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road {{under the control of}} trustees drawn from local landowners and traders. The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for <b>road</b> <b>maintenance</b> against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of <b>road</b> <b>maintenance</b> for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.|$|E

5|$|The state passed {{legislation}} in 1941 that authorized {{the creation of}} limited-access roadways; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties.

These highway improvements were financed by the Defense Highway Act of 1941 to aid in national defense. After the war, the MSHD and the Good Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state.

5|$|In 1732, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} which {{permitted}} {{the construction of}} a turnpike from Manchester, then in Lancashire, to Salters Brook in Cheshire. The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as Audenshaw, Mottram-in-Longdendale, and Stalybridge. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for <b>road</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular. It was the first turnpike to be opened in Tameside, and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Sheerness {{is in the}} {{parliamentary}} constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. Since the constituency's creation in 1997 until 2010 the Member of Parliament was Derek Wyatt of the Labour Party.

5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a <b>maintenance</b> <b>road</b> number (also {{known as a}} reference number).
