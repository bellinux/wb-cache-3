25|$|Each seat {{featured}} a standard 3.5mm audio jack with controls for switching between eight channels: three radio programs from public broadcasters, three programs played from Compact Disc and two audio channels for video programs. In both classes, some seats featured video monitors in the backrests of the seats. Luggage could be stored both {{above and below}} the seats. The main part of the car was divided by a coat rack.

25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a <b>reading</b> <b>lamp,</b> a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

60|$|He {{sipped his}} tea {{and made a}} few notes on his writing pad. His face {{in the light of}} his shaded <b>reading</b> <b>lamp</b> had lost its distraught expression, his hand fingered his {{familiar}} fountain pen....|$|E
60|$|He walked {{straight}} into the library, where he had obviously been sitting, for an arm-chair {{was drawn to the}} fire, a <b>reading</b> <b>lamp</b> was lighted on the table, and papers and magazines lay scattered about.|$|E

6000|$|... [A throaty chuckle from FORESON in the darkness. The light [...] dances up, flickers, shifts, grows steady, {{falling on}} the [...] orchard outside.

60|$|He {{came down}} and went into his study and lit his <b>reading</b> <b>lamp,</b> a patent affair with an {{incandescent}} wick, dropping the match into his waste-paper basket without stopping {{to see if it}} was extinguished. Then he fretted into the dining-room and began a desultory attack on the cooling dinner....|$|E
2500|$|The {{coaches are}} divided into two classes: Standard, with 2 + 2 seating and [...] "First Plus", with 2 + 1 seating, {{individual}} <b>reading</b> <b>lamps</b> and power adjustable seating with [...] "in seat" [...] audio.

5000|$|The Executive Sedan was, simply, a {{stretched}} LeBaron {{that held}} a center console between the front seats. The console held duct {{work for the}} two rear seat air conditioning vents. The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered jump seats (without seat belts), five air conditioning vents (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers. Above the divider glass was a [...] "glamour module" [...] lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, {{as well as individual}} <b>reading</b> <b>lamps</b> for the two jump seats. Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off. Executive Sedans had a similar lighting feature, {{in the form of a}} small single lamp located above each rear door. Both Sedan and Limousine models had adjustable rear-seat headrests, two-position foot rests, rear quarter <b>reading</b> <b>lamps,</b> and pillar mounted assist straps.|$|R
60|$|A third button {{turned on}} his <b>reading</b> <b>lamp,</b> so {{arranged}} that the light fell from above and behind without shining into his eyes. The first button turned off the concealed lighting overhead. He reached a mass of proofsheets from the reading stand, and, pencil in hand, lighting a cigarette, he began to correct.|$|E
60|$|The {{only light}} was a <b>reading</b> <b>lamp,</b> with the shade so lowered that {{the corners of}} the study were left in obscurity. In one of these corners Romayne was dimly visible, sitting with his head sunk on his breast. He never moved when Stella opened the door. At first she thought he might be asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you needn't {{mind that}} so much in your cabin. Just see that the {{curtains}} of the ports are drawn close and that's all. The steward might have forgotten to do it.

You will have to look after yourself, Flora." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1981, the W126 {{introduced}} a driver side airbag, as patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1971, {{as well as}} the passenger side airbags (in 1988), seat-belt pretensioners, and traction control. It was the first production car to feature an airbag standard, and as late as 1991 {{there were only a few}} other manufacturers in Europe who offered an airbag. The interior featured additional courtesy and <b>reading</b> <b>lamps,</b> along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.|$|R
25|$|The upscale Concorde models {{featured}} leather-trimmed seats, steering wheels, shift knobs {{and door}} inserts. Other interior options included rear seat vents (in the five-seater), rear center rear armrest, and eight-way power seats {{for both the}} driver and passenger, as well as personal <b>reading</b> <b>lamps.</b> Power windows and central door locks were standard on all Concordes, as were dual airbags. Other options included remote keyless system and a choice of several Infinity sound systems with CD, cassette with up to eight speakers and an equalizer.|$|R
2500|$|The Great Southern Hotel–described by Jack Shank, a local historian, as [...] "the hotel"–was five stories {{tall and}} {{contained}} 150 rooms. Costing $175,000 (today $) and taking up half a city block at 6th Street and 23rd Avenue, {{the building was}} {{the largest and most}} expensive in the city. A restaurant was located on the roof, and a number of social events were held in second-floor parlors. Luxuries standard in the hotel included ceiling fans and <b>reading</b> <b>lamps</b> in every room, ornate oak woodwork throughout the building, and a public stenographer to assist patrons.|$|R
60|$|She drew a {{small table}} and a <b>reading</b> <b>lamp</b> to his side and stood quietly waiting. Her eyes {{followed}} Quest's as he glanced through the letters, her expression matched his. She was tall, dark, good-looking in a massive way, with a splendid, almost unfeminine strength in her firm, shapely mouth and brilliant eyes. Her manner was a little brusque but her voice pleasant. She {{was one of those}} who had learnt the art of silence.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned at}} last with an effort. He carried the little phial to his bedside, {{and into the}} tumbler of his water-bottle he let the drops fall, drop by drop, until he had counted twenty. Then holding it to the bulb of his <b>reading</b> <b>lamp</b> he added the water and stood {{watching}} the slow pearly eddies in the mixture mingle into an opalescent uniformity. He replaced the water-bottle and stood with the glass in his hand. But he did not drink.|$|E
60|$|I had two ample Imperials on the roof, other fitted {{storage for}} luggage in front, and other up behind; I had a net for books overhead, great pockets {{to all the}} windows, a leathern pouch or two hung up for odds and ends, and a <b>reading</b> <b>lamp</b> fixed {{in the back of}} the chariot, in case I should be benighted. I was amply {{provided}} in all respects, and had no idea where I was going (which was delightful), except that I was going abroad.|$|E
50|$|The Marx Lounge {{is an art}} {{exhibition}} by the Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar. It {{was first}} presented at the Liverpool Biennial art exhibition in England in 2010 and was later shown at the Biennial again in 2016. The exhibit has subsequently been presented at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam's SMBA space and the Andalusian Center for Contemporary Art (CAAC). For the exhibition a large space {{was transformed into a}} red reading room with sofas, <b>reading</b> <b>lamps</b> and a large reading table on which a large collection of books was installed.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the vehicle}} was {{identical}} to the 1986 model, the former Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham - the last remaining rear-wheel drive Cadillac - was renamed [...] "Brougham" [...] in 1987. The Cadillac Fleetwood had been introduced as a new, smaller breed of front-drive Cadillac in 1985, and the confusion over the Fleetwood name being applied to two very different automobiles prompted the name change for 1987. As it had been since the 1970s, the optional [...] "d'Elegance" [...] package offered even more luxurious appointments, including button-tufted seating and rear-seat <b>reading</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
