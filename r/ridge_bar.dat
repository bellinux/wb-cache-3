40|$|A {{ladder circuit}} {{especially}} useful in backward wave oscillators {{operating in the}} 500 GHz to 2000 GHz range has a waveguide with transversely orientated slabs which contact an upper wall of the waveguide. The edges of the slabs adjacent to the physical center of waveguide are curved segments and stubs of electrically conductive, nonmagnetic material. The ends of slabs include metal layers at opposite ends to provide a conductive leakage path. A <b>ridge</b> <b>bar</b> {{is attached to the}} inside of the bottom wall of the waveguide and includes a concave upper surface which partially straddles the electron beam. The novelty of the invention lies in the ladder structure compared of thin, vapor deposited rungs supported on the edge of diamond slabs; each rung having a curved segment which straddles the electron beam together with a <b>ridge</b> <b>bar</b> which also straddles the electron beam...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of sand ridges, as observed on the innershelves and midshelves of various coastal seas, are investigated {{within the framework}} of an idealized model. These seabed undulations include shoreface-connected sand ridges and tidal sand banks. The new aspects in this study are the explicit incorporation of both steady and tidal currents, a shelf with a sloping bottom, and a statistical approach to describe the sediment transport during storms (linear in the current) and fair weather conditions (cubic in the current). The present model is used to gain understanding of the different ridge characteristics in different geographical regions. This is done by analyzing the initial growth of small bottom perturbations, which evolve on a basic state describing a longshore uniform flow over a reference topography. It is found that basically five different bottom modes can be excited: shoreface-connected sand ridges, Coriolis <b>ridges,</b> friction-induced <b>bars,</b> trapped tidal <b>ridges,</b> and tidal sand banks. Their growth, which is due to different physical mechanisms, strongly depends on the weather climate and the geometrical characteristics of the shelf. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Tidal sand {{bars and}} tidal sand ridges are {{extensively}} {{developed in the}} macrotidal Gulf of Khambhat, offshore western India. The inner and outer regions of the gulf are characterised by the development distinct tidal sand bodies with discrete geometries and dimensions. The outer gulf ridges are long, narrow, curvilinear and several metres high (similar to 20 m). They are asymmetric in cross-section and migratory in nature, forming 'ribbon' like sand bodies separated by tidal channels. Active dunes on these ridges indicate the presence of sand and their orientation parallel to palaeo-shorelines supports a tidal origin. In contrast to the outer gulf tidal sand <b>ridges,</b> sand <b>bars</b> associated with macrotidal estuaries flanking the Gulf of Khambhat typically have an elongate to diamond shape and are only hundreds of metres in width and a few kilometres length. These tidal sand bars occur in the estuary mouths and within the tidally influenced fluvial reaches of the rivers flowing into the gulf. The height of these sand bars is in the range similar to 1 - 3 m. Due to high tidal ranges and bi-directional flow the sand bars do not develop significant height and are formed between the mutually evasive ebb and flow channels. Their bi-directional foresets {{and the presence of}} abundant mud drapes associated with the dunes within in-channel sand bars indicate a tidal origin. The Gulf of Khambhat acquired the present configuration in the last few thousand years since the Pleistocene sea-level lowstand (last glacial maximum, similar to 18 Ka) when the entire continental shelf was subaerially exposed and rivers down-cut into the coastal plain. With increasing sea-level rise, the exposed shelf was drowned, flooding parts of the Modern western Indian peninsula, and large tidal sand ridges formed in the outer gulf. After the fall of sea-level at 2 ka the gulf acquired the Modern configuration with multiple estuaries on both coastlines, rivers supplied the embayment with sandy sediment, and tidal sand bars formed in the Modern estuaries. Quantitative data gathered from the Modern Gulf of Khambhat indicates that for the P 50 case, a vertical drill hole will encounter tidal sand bodies (<b>ridges</b> and <b>bars</b> combined) of approximate dimensions 1700 m long, 470 m wide and 1. 5 m high, with a spacing of 400 m. In subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs, where data is sparse and only limited amount of core is available, this quantitative dataset can be useful to constrain subsurface geocellular models. Also, the overall geometry, distribution and aspect ratio of the tidal sand ridges and tidal sand bars can be used to identify ancient counterparts through seismic geomorphology or in core.
