5|$|On July 31, 2014, Craig {{was traded}} along with Joe Kelly to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> in {{exchange}} for John Lackey and prospect Corey Littrell. On May 9, 2015, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> optioned Craig to the Pawtucket <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> of the Class AAA International League; since Craig had yet to accrue five years of service time, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> could option him to the minor leagues without his consent. On May 18, they outrighted him to the minors, removing him from the 40 man roster. He was re-added to the major league roster on September 1. On June 30, 2017, Allen Craig was released by the Triple A affiliate of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> the Pawtucket <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> on the verge of winning a World Series, he {{wondered}} how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and hoping that one day, they would see the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> win a World Series.|$|E
5|$|The Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> are a {{professional}} baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{are members of}} the American League (AL) East Division in Major League Baseball (MLB). There have been 44 different managers in their franchise history; four during the era of the Boston Americans (1901–1907) and the rest under the Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> (1908–present). In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. Since 1912, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> have played their home games at Fenway Park.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{suffered}} a collapse {{late in the}} 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not pitch in the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer; some <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> teammates speculated that Youkilis {{was the source of}} this information, alienating him from his teammates.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won the {{division}} by two games, forcing the Yankees into the Wild Card. This {{marked the first}} time both the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and Yankees made the playoffs since 2009. However, both teams lost in the postseason to the eventual champion Houston Astros; the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> in the ALDS and the Yankees in the ALCS.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} the season tied for {{first with the}} Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> but were awarded the division title because they won the season series with the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tie-breaker {{game was}} the first in the AL since 1948, when the Indians {{defeated}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> at Fenway Park, and the first in MLB since the advent of the division system in 1969. Guidry, who won 24 games in the 162-game regular season, started on three days of rest, less rest than usual. Torrez started the game for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> He started for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> on Opening Day and had a 16–12 record, but contributed to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> struggles late in the season with six consecutive losses.|$|E
5|$|After the 1921 season, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> traded Scott with Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones to the New York Yankees for Rip Collins, Roger Peckinpaugh, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($ {{in current}} dollar terms). Del Pratt succeeded Scott as {{captain of the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|Connie Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912. After using Pennock sparingly, and {{questioning}} his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock to the Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became {{a regular contributor}} for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> The Yankees acquired Pennock from the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> after the 1922 season, and {{he served as a}} key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four World Series championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930 season, Bob Quinn, {{the owner}} of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> was in debt and afraid he would lose the team due to foreclosure. To raise capital, he traded Ruffing to the New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst, $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and a $50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees' owner. Ruffing ended his five-and-a-half year tenure with the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> with a 39–93 win-loss record; his winning {{percentage}} (.289) was lower than that of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> during his tenure (.344).|$|E
5|$|Eddie Collins, {{a former}} {{teammate}} with the Athletics now {{serving as the}} general manager of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> signed Pennock to their 1934 roster. In his last season pitching in the major leagues, Pennock served as a relief pitcher for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{asked the}} Yankees for {{permission}} to interview one of George Steinbrenner's assistants, former Yankees general manager Gene Michael, for their vacant general manager position, but Steinbrenner declined their request. Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> then hired Theo Epstein, a protégé of <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> President and CEO Larry Lucchino, as general manager, and at 28 years old, he was the youngest general manager in baseball history.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy McAleer, {{a native}} of Youngstown and {{minority}} owner of the Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> of the American League (AL), noticed Scott playing for the Steelmen. On McAleer's suggestion, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> purchased Scott from Youngstown after the 1912 season, and optioned him to the St. Paul Saints of the Class AA American Association. Towards {{the end of the}} 1913 season, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> recalled Scott.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2012, <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. In the seventh inning of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E
5|$|The 1951 season {{opened up}} at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees {{defeated}} the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> which was PA announcer Bob Sheppard first game. Sheppard {{would go on}} to serve PA duties at Yankee Stadium for another 56 years. On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no-hitter against the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> A year later, <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won 5–2 with Piersall sitting the game out.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{finished}} 95-67 {{and with}} the same record as the New York Yankees, but since the Yankees had won the season series between the two teams, they won the American League East and the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{had to settle for}} the American League Wild Card.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees and the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{finished}} {{tied for}} first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker {{game for the}} division title. The first-place tie came after the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> comeback {{was the only time}} in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{went on to win the}} World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.|$|E
5|$|With a deep {{pitching}} staff in place, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> loaned Pennock to the Providence Grays of the International League in August {{for the remainder}} of the 1915 season. He split the 1916 season between the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and the Buffalo Bisons, also in the International League. With Buffalo, Pennock pitched to a 1.67 ERA, as Buffalo won the league pennant. Though the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won the 1915 and 1916 World Series, Pennock did not appear in either series.|$|E
5|$|A fifth round {{draft pick}} in the 2007 MLB draft out of Liberty-Eylau High School in Texarkana, Texas, Middlebrooks signed with the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> for $925,000, {{bypassing}} his commitment to Texas A University. Middlebrooks was originally a shortstop, but the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> converted him into a third baseman in the minor leagues. He represented the United States in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. Following Middlebrooks' emergence as the Red Sox's starting third baseman in 2012, the organization traded former All-Star Kevin Youkilis. After struggles in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> traded Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres before the 2015 season. He signed minor league contracts with the Brewers and Rangers before the 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A month later, he {{was asked}} about his support for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> by one of the questioners in a YouTube Republican Presidential Debate run by CNN. In {{response}} to the mayor's answer, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who was in office during the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> 2004 win, claimed that all Americans are united in hatred of the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{a stellar}} high school career, {{where he was}} {{regarded}} as one of the top prospects in the country, he was drafted by the Marlins with the second pick in the 1999 MLB draft. He won the 2003 World Series with the Marlins and the 2007 World Series with the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> and received the 2007 American League Championship Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and the 2003 World Series MVP award. He was traded from the Marlins to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> in 2006 and from the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> to the Dodgers in 2012, both as part of multi-player transactions.|$|E
5|$|After the 2011 season, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{assigned}} Middlebrooks to the Arizona Fall League, {{where he}} hit four {{home runs in}} 13 games and {{was named to the}} Rising Stars Game. In November 2011, Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin and Drake Britton were added to the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> 40-man roster to prevent them from being selected in the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|Bautista {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> in April 2015. He was {{released}} in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Both the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and Cardinals {{made the}} playoffs the {{following}} season. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> lost to the eventual champions the Chicago White Sox, in the American League Division Series. The Cardinals, in a repeat meeting of the previous season's National League Championship Series, lost to the Houston Astros. However, the city of Boston would see more success when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX, {{three months after the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won the World Series, giving the greater Boston area its third championship in 12 months, making it the first time since 1980 that any city had two Super Bowl winners and a World Series winner in a period of the same length.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> hired Terry Francona {{as their}} new manager. They also signed Keith Foulke as their closer and traded for Curt Schilling as a {{starting}} pitcher. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> played two particularly notable games against the Yankees during the regular season. A game on July 1, in which they {{came back from a}} 3-run deficit to force extra innings, is best remembered for an incident in the 12th inning, when Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter made a catch on the run before hurling himself head-first into the stands. The Yankees won the game in the next inning to take an 8-game lead in the American League East. In the 3rd inning of a game on July 24, <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> pitcher Bronson Arroyo hit Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez with one of his pitches. As Rodriguez walked towards first base, he began shouting profanities at Arroyo. <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> catcher Jason Varitek positioned himself between the two players. After a brief argument, Varitek pushed his glove into Rodriguez' face, causing a bench-clearing brawl. The <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> eventually won the game thanks to a home run by Bill Mueller in the 9th inning. On July 31, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> traded shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs after he had spent eight years with the team. They acquired shortstop Orlando Cabrera and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz in this trade. They won the wild card to earn a place in the post-season {{for the second year in}} a row.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|His career ended abruptly. During {{his brief}} tenure as {{co-owner}} of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> McAleer quarreled with longtime friend and colleague Ban Johnson, president of the American League. In the wake of this disagreement, he sold off his shares in the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and broke off his relationship with Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, former Chicago White Sox {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the White Sox, and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> owner Thomas Yawkey, who was much closer to Berg when he played for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still turned them down. Berg did not apply for a teaching position, or join a law firm.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Youkilis {{had earned}} $424,500, the fourth-lowest salary on the club. In February 2008, {{he signed a}} one-year {{contract}} for $3 million, avoiding salary arbitration. In March 2008, {{his role as the}} designated player representative of the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> became known during the resolution of a player-management dispute regarding non-payment of coaches and staff for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> trip to Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{during his}} first Opening Day start with the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> Beckett struck out 10 through seven innings {{allowing}} only one run and two hits in a 5–3 victory over the Rays. On April 14, 2009, MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally throwing {{over the head of}} Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu. Beckett later appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games. On June 20, 2009, he recorded his first complete game shutout in three years against the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> pitcher Derek Lowe. The shutout was his first in a <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> uniform. On July 5, 2009, he was selected to represent Boston in the 2009 MLB All Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Boston Globe {{columnist}} Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station {{because their}} current namesake, Tom Yawkey, was a racist {{who made the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> the last major league team to hire black players. In August 2017, amid racial tension, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> organization began advocating {{for the city to}} change the street's name. A bill to change the station's name was filed in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|In Game 2 of the ALDS {{against the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> Zito went seven innings, {{striking}} out nine, walking two, allowing one earned run, and earning the win in Oakland's 5–1 triumph. In Game 5, Zito went six innings and allowed four earned runs, taking the loss as the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{won the game}} and the series.|$|E
5|$|In the ALCS Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays, the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{were down}} by seven {{runs in the}} bottom of the seventh inning. Youkilis scored the winning run for the <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> to {{complete}} the second-largest comeback in MLB postseason history. Before Game 4 of the 2008 World Series, he was named the winner of the AL Hank Aaron Award for the best offensive performance of the 2008 season.|$|E
