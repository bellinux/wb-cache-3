5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally <b>reached,</b> <b>it</b> eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations {{for the end of}} the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was <b>reached,</b> <b>it</b> was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E

Early settlers had avoided the area because the northern land, comprising present-day Rosendale Village, was a known floodplain, and the lands south of the creek were less mountainous and at a higher elevation.|$|E

5|$|Although three launch battalions {{were formed}} by the Germans in late 1943, they never {{got the chance to}} deploy to the V-weapons launch sites at Watten and Wizernes. On 3 July 1944, the Oberkommando West {{authorised}} the cessation of construction at the heavily damaged sites. On 18 July 1944, Hitler abandoned plans for launching V-2s from bunkers and authorized the downgrading of the Wizernes bunker to make it a LOX production facility. However, these plans were overtaken by the Allied liberation of Northern France following the Normandy landings. The site was finally abandoned {{a few days before the}} Allies <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> at the start of September during the rapid liberation of the area by British, American, Canadian and Polish troops.

5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have <b>reached</b> <b>it.</b> By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 {{people on}} board, 38, {{including}} Hood and Beaumont, {{died in the}} crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and {{climbed out of the}} wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil MacLaren, led four others—young newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Mrs Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey—off {{in the direction of a}} nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4).|$|E

5|$|Once half-time was <b>reached,</b> <b>it</b> {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of}} the first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something that his team mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians then {{proceeded}} towards {{the town of}} Polytsaravos and <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> on August 28. Awaiting them there were 2,000 Maniots behind their fortifications. The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes. This would have meant that the Egyptians could have been stopped before {{they arrived at the}} town. As part of their defence plan the villages sent all the women and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications. As the Egyptians arrived at the walls, the Maniots sallied out and caught the Egyptians by surprise. The Egyptians, suffering losses, withdrew from Mani and back into the Laconian plain. The Egyptians had lost 400 men during the battle and the Maniots only lost 9. This was the last invasion launched against Mani.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{believed that the}} pigeon became extinct due to predation by feral cats and, to a lesser extent, feral dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the pigeon existed on islands that feral cats had never <b>reached,</b> <b>it</b> is believed that the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As {{there have been no}} substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, {{it is likely that the}} Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft <b>reached</b> <b>it.</b> Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Syracuse, the sources report scant efforts from the Byzantines to aid the city. Ibn al-Athir reports that a few Byzantine vessels appeared before the city and were defeated without difficulty, but the main Byzantine fleet {{appears to have been}} occupied with ferrying building material for the erection of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian's Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople. When the fleet eventually sailed, under the command of a certain Adrianos, it was so delayed by contrary winds at Monemvasia that news of the city's fall <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> there. Unchallenged thus in their control of the sea, the Arabs were able to destroy the fortifications (βραχιόλια) protecting the city's two harbours: the incessant bombardment succeeded in collapsing one of the towers of the seaward fortifications, along with the adjoining stretch of walls, forming a breach where the Arabs concentrated their attack. Nevertheless, the patrikios of the city rallied the defenders, and for twenty days they managed to hold the breach against superior numbers, so that the surrounding area was filled with the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his form}} in 193839, Tallon eagerly awaited {{the arrival of}} England for the 194041 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and {{regarded}} as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves. However, {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while in his prime as a cricketer; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29. In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 193940. It was another poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches. Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> for the loss of only one wicket. Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales {{at the end of the}} season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|For Brazil, {{the result}} {{became one of}} their two worst losses, equalling a 6–0 defeat to Uruguay in 1920, and was their worst-ever defeat at home; their {{previous}} worst defeat at home was a 5–1 defeat by Argentina in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. The loss broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches, dating back to their 1–3 loss to Peru in the 1975 Copa América; this match was also played at Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte. The last time Brazil had lost a World Cup semi-final was in 1938, in a dramatic game against Italy in Marseille, and had emerged victorious from this stage the previous six times they had <b>reached</b> <b>it,</b> since the loss in 1974 against Netherlands was not formally a semi-final. Brazil had never before conceded seven goals at home, although they once conceded eight goals in a 4–8 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934; {{the last time they}} conceded at least five was in a 6–5 win in the 1938 World Cup versus Poland; at least four was in a 2–4 defeat at the 1954 World Cup against Hungary. Brazil's previous largest losing deficit at the World Cup prior to the match was three goals, which came in the 0–3 defeat to France in the 1998 final. The game's outcome also marked Brazil's worst result against Germany, passing a 0–2 defeat in a 1986 friendly.|$|E
5|$|Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba {{to march}} against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long {{remained}} an indomitable {{thorn in the}} Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, {{the existence of a}} free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, who might be encouraged to seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with this easy success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, {{and as soon as the}} Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first <b>reached</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1904, she {{set sail}} for Port Arthur from Libau {{along with the}} other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. When his ships reached the port of Tangier, Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky split his forces and ordered his older ships, {{including}} Navarin and Sissoi Veliky, to proceed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to rendezvous with him in Madagascar as previously planned. Under the command of Rear Admiral Dmitry von Fölkersam, they departed that night and reached Souda Bay, Crete, a week later and Port Said, Egypt two weeks after that. The two forces reunited at the island of Nosy Be on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 16 March and <b>reached</b> <b>it</b> almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov.
