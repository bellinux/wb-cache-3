The objectives for the HOV facilities are: • Improve {{the capability of}} corridors to move more people by {{increasing the number of}} people per vehicle. • Provide travel time savings and a more reliable trip time to HOV lane users. • Provide travel options for HOVs without adversely affecting the generalpurpose lanes. Plan, design, and construct HOV facilities that provide intermodal linkages. Give consideration to future highway system capacity needs. Whenever possible, design HOV lanes so that the level of service for the general-purpose lanes is not degraded. In urban corridors that do not currently have planned or existing HOV lanes, complete an analysis of the need for HOV lanes before proceeding with any projects for additional general-purpose lanes. In corridors where both HOV and generalpurpose facilities are planned, construct the HOV lane before or simultaneously with the construction of new general-purpose lanes.

500|$|Unrelated to the BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard, the {{commission}} constructed a [...] wide macadam road from Glen Burnie to Brooklyn, {{which was then}} in Anne Arundel County, in 1915. In Brooklyn, the new highway connected with {{the south end of}} the Light Street Bridge that crossed the Patapsco River into Baltimore. With a road completed from Annapolis to Baltimore, the roads commission suggested that it should not be required to complete a road between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The commission asked the Maryland General Assembly to pass a bill releasing {{the commission}} from the responsibility of completing the highway from Glen Burnie to South Baltimore. However, the Maryland General Assembly disagreed with the Maryland State Roads Commission and passed a bill in 1914 requiring the commission to finish the boulevard between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard north from Glen Burnie to Baltimore was finished in 1916.

2500|$|MD 450 from Bladensburg to the Severn River was {{proposed}} {{as one of}} the original state roads laid out by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909.

The portion of the highway from Wagner Street at the city limits of Annapolis to the Severn River {{was proposed}} as the southernmost section of the BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard (now MD 648), which was completed from {{the north side of the}} Severn River to Glen Burnie between 1910 and 1912. After litigation between the roads commission and Anne Arundel County, the result of which required the state to replace the bridge across College Creek, MDSRC constructed a new bridge across the creek in 1914 and 1915. The highway through the Naval Academy reservation from College Creek to the south side of the Severn River was built as a [...] macadam road in 1916.

40|$|The load {{ratings for}} these Standard bridges were {{calculated}} {{in compliance with}} the 1978 AASHTO Manual for Maintenance Inspection of Bridges, using the appropriate allowable stresses for the materials specified by the Standard plans. Distribution of loads is {{in compliance with the}} Manual unless otherwise noted. Except for truss spans, all bridges with <b>roadway</b> <b>widths</b> of 18 ft. or less were rated for one lane of traffic. All 18 ft. roadway truss bridges were rated for both one and two lanes of traffic. All bridges with <b>roadway</b> <b>widths</b> exceeding 18 ft. were rated for two lanes of traffic. If the posting rating for two lane bridges was less than legal, then the bridges were rated for traffic restricted to one lane, or to one lane centered in the roadway, as noted on the summary sheet. The ratings are applicable to bridges built in accordance with the standard plans and which exhibit no significant deterioration or damage to the structural members, and which have no added wearing surface material in excess of that noted on the summary sheets and used in the calculations. The inventory and operating ratings were based upon the standard AASHTO HS 20 - 44 loading. The legal load ratings were based upon the three typical Iowa legal vehicles shown on page 5. The legal load ratings were based upon the maximum allowable Operating Rating stresses specified in the Manual. Refer to notations on the summary sheets for additional qualifications on the load ratings for specific standard bridge series. Load ratings for standard bridges with wood floors must be based upon existing conditions of attachment of the wood flooring to the top flanges of longitudinal steel stringers. The ratings must be reevaluated if the existing lateral support conditions are not in accordance with conditions used for the rating and noted on the summary sheets. Details of most of the standard bridges are included in the three books of "Iowa State Highway Commission, Bridge Standards," issued in June, 1972. Copies of plans for those standard bridges that were rated, and that are not included in the original books of standard plans, are being furnished under separate cover with these rating summaries...|$|R

40|$|Research {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>roadway</b> <b>widths</b> for street narrowings or "pinch-points" in Christchurch, with a particular focus on speed and yielding behaviour. A 6 m wide 2 -way pinch-point {{was found to be}} not effective in slowing most private vehicles down. Drivers travelled at a similar speed whether they were crossing the pinch-point by themselves or with opposing traffic approaching. Approximately 40 % of drivers reduced their vehicle speed when negotiating a 5 m wide 2 -way pinch-point. Around 20 % of drivers avoided traversing with oncoming traffic and opted to wait until it was clear before proceeding. Male drivers also tended to travel faster through the narrowing when compared to female drivers. For a 4. 5 m wide 1 -way pinch-point where motor vehicles and cyclists approached them simultaneously, one of them gave way and waited nearly 60 % of the time. Around 35 % of the time cyclists and motorists shared the narrowing and 8 % of the cyclists (mostly younger children) avoided the narrowing, using a bypass instead. It is recommended that further research be conducted: 1. at more sites with different road widths and environment; 2. with heavy vehicle movements on these pinch-points; 3. to understand whether a longer pinch-point will alter driver behaviour...|$|R
