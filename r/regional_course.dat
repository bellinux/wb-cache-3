5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III <b>regional</b> <b>course</b> for women's coaching. A FUTURO III <b>regional</b> <b>course</b> men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{intensity}} {{and length of}} higher surgical training has changed, and with this {{the need for a}} more formalised training programme has been recognised. With limited budgets for training and the high cost of national training days, it was proposed that within the Wessex Deanery <b>regional</b> <b>courses</b> should be run to complement the existing weekly training session. METHODS: In 1998, a questionnaire was sent to all the orthopaedic consultants and specialist registrars within the region to identify the training requirements of the specialist registrars and the availability of consultants to organise and teach during these training courses. RESULTS: A regionally published report based on the questionnaire's findings identified these training requirements as indicated by both the specialist registrars and the consultants. This information has been used to organise eight 1 -day training courses using the expertise of consultants within the region with more planned in the near future. CONCLUSIONS: Four years following this report, we identified the training requirements within the Wessex region and have successfully run <b>regional</b> <b>courses</b> to meet this requirement...|$|R
40|$|In the {{province}} of Ontario, the Ministry of Education uses its regulatory texts to govern transition related activities for students preparing for high school. Deadlines set out by schools and school boards arise from the transition policies and procedures of the Ministry of Education. During the Grade 8 year, administrators, teachers and parents of high school bound students do the transition work required to support the goals and deadlines laid out in these texts. Through in-depth interviews in participants’ heritage languages, textual analysis, and personal reflections, I have conducted a decolonizing institutional ethnography of mothering work conducted by “South Asian” mothers. I have explored in-depth the question: How does the institution, a large school board in the Greater Toronto Area, within {{the province}} of Ontario, use one important regulatory text, the <b>regional</b> <b>course</b> directory or RCD, to coordinate the work of “South Asian” mothers as they prepare for their children’s transition to high school...|$|E
40|$|Zooplankton pool-inhabiting organisms form metacommunities and metapopulations. Locations are {{connected}} through dispersion {{which is an}} essential part of colonization-extinction dynamic. Locations vary with the environmental conditions, the specifics of the community and the biotic interactions taking place there. Differences in these parameters may occur between spatially separated pools or in one pool throughout time. These changes are caused by seasonal dynamics, disturbances, long-term development of environmental conditions or biotic factors such as predation, competition and parasite influence. On a long-term scale the locations are classified into rather stable and ephemeral. In pool environment the ephemeral locations may unexpectedly be the driving force of metacommunity and metapopulation processes according to the "inverse mainland-island" theory. Global climate change has an essential influence on zooplankton dynamic in smaller water-bodies. Hydrology of pools and through it also life dynamics of plankton organisms is directly influenced by temperature changes and precipitation. Regional metacommunity and metapopulation dynamics are changing in dependency on <b>regional</b> <b>course</b> of climate change and the specifics of these water-bodies and the communities living there...|$|E
40|$|Post-mortem and imaging {{studies have}} {{observed}} that white matter (WM) degenerates in a pattern inverse to myelin development, suggesting preferential regional vulnerabilities influencing cognitive decline in AD. This study applied novel WM tract integrity (WMTI) metrics derived from diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to examine WM tissue properties in AD within this framework. Using data from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n =  12), AD (n =  14), and normal control (NC; n =  15) subjects, mixed models revealed interaction effects: specific WMTI metrics of axonal density and myelin integrity (i. e. axonal water fraction, radial extra-axonal diffusivity) in late-myelinating tracts (i. e. superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi) changed {{in the course of}} disease, but were stable in the initial stages for early-myelinating tracts (i. e. posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles). WMTI metrics in late-myelinating tracts correlated with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function known to decline in AD. These findings corroborate the preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts, and illustrate an application of WMTI metrics to characterizing the <b>regional</b> <b>course</b> of WM changes in AD...|$|E

Steve Beverly spent two weeks during April in Tahiti fishing with Fa’arei Leboucher (a course participant) and his father, Gilles Leboucher, who are owner and operators of a 26 m longliner, F/V Arevamanu. The fishing trip on F/V Arevamanu (see article on page 36) was very productive. Eight days were spent at sea, and fishing took place over six days. A total of over six tonnes of fish were caught.
