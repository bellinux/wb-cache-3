It is shown that highly complex images, including “fractal” (self-similar) images, {{can be manipulated}} by the application of these techniques. Languages and relations over some alphabet are interpreted as images by treating strings as rational coordinates. In particular rational relations, specified by <b>rational</b> <b>expressions,</b> are considered. It is shown how texture of an image can be defined by probabilistic finite generators. Affine expressions are introduced as a generalization of both <b>rational</b> <b>expressions</b> and the IFS method to define images.

5000|$|... ==Abstract algebra and {{geometric}} notion== In abstract algebra {{the concept}} of a polynomial is extended to include formal expressions in which the coefficients of the polynomial can be taken from any field. In this setting given a field F and some indeterminate X, a <b>rational</b> <b>expression</b> is any element of the field of fractions of the polynomial ring FX. Any <b>rational</b> <b>expression</b> can be written as the quotient of two polynomials P/Q with Q ≠ 0, although this representation isn't unique. P/Q is equivalent to R/S, for polynomials P, Q, R, and S, when PS = QR. However since FX is a unique factorization domain, there is a unique representation for any <b>rational</b> <b>expression</b> P/Q with P and Q polynomials of lowest degree and Q chosen to be monic.
