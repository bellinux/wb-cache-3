5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of <b>retroversion</b> of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E
5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in <b>retroversions</b> to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} wait too long for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So when we come back, that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper has been to use narratological theory for {{uncovering}} the narrative structure in Freud‟s cases, such as anachronisms and focalizing. My aim was to investigate the narrative and through these viewpoints discover what impact Freud‟s writing‟s had on the look of hysterical women. I choose one of the earliest cases,"Fräulein Elisabeth von R. " which is published in Studien über Hysterie (I‟ve used the text translated to Swedish and published in Tidiga skrifter och historik. Freud, Sigmund, 1997). I‟ve consulted both Iréne Matthis and Jurgen Reeder to get a broader perspective on the psychoanalytic theory. Another author whom been invaluable is Karin Johannisson, her essays on the aesthetics that characterize hysteria has been very useful. By using the narratological theories of Mieke Bal and Gérard Genette I‟ve been able to uncover the structure of my narrative. The main concepts have been "text", "story" and "fabula" which symbolize three layers of the narrative, for the investigation of these three aspects I‟ve looked closer into anachronisms, <b>retroversions</b> and anticipations (internal and external), focalizor, narrator, actors and agents. The conclusion I‟ve reached is that Freud, by separating himself into the –less knowing and the –analyst and use this –less knowing version of himself as an assistant in the hunt of the answer to hysteria, he writes off Elisabeth as a character. He excludes her from her own anamnesis and fills the hole with himself and uses it as a part of his theory. Left again is the woman, without having been really listened to...|$|R
5|$|Belgrano and Saavedra, {{representing}} {{the military and}} the intellectuals, got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo, but without getting an answer. Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support, but they refused, under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy. Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request, and Cisneros finally accepted. A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his word. The open cabildo was held on 22 May, with all political leaders present, and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted a disruption, which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano. He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli, who made a speech explaining the concept of the <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty of the people, and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself. At the time of voting, Castelli's proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra, with Belgrano among its supporters. This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros {{and the creation of a}} government junta prevailed over the others. However, the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result, by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president. This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population. A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta. Belgrano was included in this junta, among many other local politicians.|$|E

25|$|Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who {{resented the}} Imperial Spanish government's {{policies}} that favoured Spanish-born citizens (Peninsulars) over those born overseas (Criollos) and demanded <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty to the people. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies {{began a series}} of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico.|$|E
500|$|Castelli won Paroissien's {{acquittal}} {{by invoking}} {{the doctrine of}} the <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty of the people, which claimed that the Spanish American lands were a personal possession of the King of Spain but not a Spanish colony. That approach was already old, and it was used to legislate in both districts, but in this context Castelli argued that neither the Council of Regency or any other power of Spain—other than the rightful King—had authority over Spanish America. Castelli said that [...] "the will of the people of Spain is not enough to bring the Indies to obedience". Under these premises, Castelli argued successfully that the regency offered to the sister of the captive king, while not denying the legitimacy of Ferdinand VII, was not an act of treason, but a legitimate political project that should be resolved by the Spanish American people without the intervention of the peninsular Spanish.|$|E
500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros should stay in power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the <b>Retroversion</b> of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give it to someone else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes the vorlage of a {{translation}} {{may be lost}} to history. In some of these cases the vorlage may be reconstructed from the translation. Such a reconstructed vorlage may be called a <b>retroversion,</b> and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the vorlage may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its <b>retroversion</b> {{can be used as}} a witness for the purposes of textual criticism. This reconstructed vorlage may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.

50|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty to the people, which challenged {{the legitimacy of the}} colonial authorities of the Spanish Empire, was the legal principle underlying the Spanish American wars of independence and Philippine Revolution.

50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>retroversion</b> of sovereignty was {{premised on the}} basis that the Spanish territories in America were a personal possession of the king of Spain, and not a colony of Spain. Only the king could rule over them, either directly or through viceroys appointed by himself. This principle already existed, and justified the fact that Spain and Spanish America had different laws. Scholars of the Laws of the Indies had argued that they were two different realms, united under one same crown.|$|E

50|$|Buenos Aires was {{declared}} a rogue city by the Council of Regency, which appointed Montevideo as {{capital of the}} viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, and Francisco Javier de Elío the new viceroy. However, the May Revolution was not initially separatist.

All of them believed that, according to the <b>retroversion</b> of the sovereignty to the people, {{in the absence of the}} rightful king sovereignty returned to the people, which would be capable to appoint their own leaders. They did not agree on who was that people, and which territorial extension had the sovereignty. Royalists thought that it applied to the people on European Spain, who had the right to rule over all the Spanish empire. The leaders of the May Revolution thought that it applied to all the capitals of Spanish kingdoms. José Gervasio Artigas would lead later a third perspective: the <b>retroversion</b> applied to all regions, which should remain united under a confederative system. The three groups battled each others, but the disputes about the national organization of Argentina (either centralist or confederal) continued in Argentine Civil War, for many years after the end of the war of independence.|$|E

External rotation of the femur with valgus deformity of knee may be noted. This condition does not resolve and requires surgical management. Surgical management includes valgus osteotomy to improve hip biomechanics and length and rotational osteotomy to correct <b>retroversion</b> and lengthening.|$|E
