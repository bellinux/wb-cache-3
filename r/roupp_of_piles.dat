However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group. Results <b>of</b> influence of diameter, length and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap are discussed. It can be observed that, as the diameter and spacing <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> and thickness <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> cap increase, the load carrying capacity <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> group increases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} {{equation of}} large diameter bored pile's effective length {{is connected with}} its distribution <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance. Thus, {{there is a great}} difference between the calculation results under the different distributions <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance. Primarily, this paper summarizes the conceptualized mode <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> shaft resistance under the circumstance that the soil surrounding the piles presents different layer distributions. Secondly, based on Mindlin's displacement solution and in consideration of the effect <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> diameter, the calculation equation is optimized with the assumption that the pile shaft resistance has a parabolic distribution. The influencing factors are analyzed according to the calculation result <b>of</b> effective <b>pile</b> length. Finally, combined with an engineering example, the calculation equation deduced in this paper is analyzed and verified. The result shows that both the Poisson ratio <b>of</b> soil and <b>pile</b> diameter have impacted the effective pile length. Compared with the Poisson ratio of soil, the effect <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> diameter is more significant. If the pile diameter remains the same, the effect of the Poisson ratio of soil to the effective pile length decreases as the ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. If the Poisson ratio of soil remains the same, the effect <b>of</b> the <b>pile</b> diameter to the effective pile length increases as the ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. Thus the optimized calculation result <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> effective length under the consideration <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> diameter effect is more close to the actual situation of engineering and reasonably practicable...|$|R

40|$|Raft {{foundations}} {{are usually}} {{used as a}} foundation on soft or variable ground for commercial, industrial or residential building. They {{have the advantage of}} providing the adequate bearing capacity and also reducing differential settlements of structure. Unfortunately, raft foundation may cause excessive settlement although it has an adequate bearing capacity. Considering that foundation building must have adequate bearing capacity but the total or differential settlements of the foundation should not exceed the allowable value, the combination <b>of</b> raft and <b>pile</b> foundation as named piled raft foundation system may be considered as the good alternative solution for this problem. The contribution of a group <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> under raft could acts as a settlements reducer. This study analysed the settlement <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation by considering the various number <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> using finite element method and analytical method.

In order to obtain the appropriate comparison <b>of</b> <b>piled</b> raft settlement for both methods of analysis, it might be used a parameter called settlement reduction factor, since a number <b>of</b> <b>piles</b> in piled raft system acts as a settlement reducer.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} interaction factor method, only the elastic settlement <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> groups can be calculated, {{and the interaction}} factors are significantly greater than the real results. Using 3 D numerical simulation method to fit the the load-settlement curve <b>of</b> a single <b>pile,</b> the elastic parameters of soil and pile-soil interface parameters are determined through the elastic and elasto-plastic analyses. Then by establishing a two-pile model, the influences of various parameters such as the load level on <b>pile</b> top, ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> spacing to pile diameter, modulus ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> to soil, modulus ratio <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> tip soil to surrounding soil, pile slenderness ratio and existence <b>of</b> the third <b>pile</b> between two piles on the interaction factors are analyzed, and a polynomial curve is used to fit the results. Based {{on the results of}} numerical analysis and field tests, a method using single pile load tests to calculate the elastic and elasto-plastic settlement <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> groups in the interaction factor method is proposed, and it is extended to compute the nonlinear settlement <b>of</b> <b>pile</b> groups. Analysis <b>of</b> an engineering case shows that the load-settlement curve computed by the proposed method agrees well with the measured one, and the proposed method can save a lot of computing time than the conventional numerical simulation and is suitable for the analysis and design <b>of</b> large-scale <b>piled</b> raft foundation with large pile spacings...|$|R

In {{order to}} promote the {{experience}} <b>of</b> applying O-cell <b>pile</b> test to determine the behavior <b>of</b> integral <b>pile</b> in Jinan, a case <b>of</b> O-cell <b>pile</b> test in Jinan was analyzed with proposed approach. The pile-soil system was simulated with FEM. The resistance parameters <b>of</b> <b>piles,</b> the load-displacement curves and the ultimate bearing capacity <b>of</b> integral <b>pile</b> were determined. Comparing with results obtained from load transfer method, {{it is found that}} the p-s curve <b>of</b> integral <b>pile</b> obtained from load transfer method is conservative...|$|R
