40|$|As {{spacecraft}} {{become more}} complex and autonomous, the need for reliable <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> will become more prevalent. When coupled with the additional requirement of limiting cost, the task of implementing <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> on spacecraft becomes extremely challenging. The current state-of-the-art Cassini <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> software, for example, {{is a testament to}} the complexity and difficulty of implementing <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> on spacecraft. This paper describes how domain knowledge about spacecraft <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> can be captured and stored in a reusable, component-based spacecraft architecture. The spacecraft-level <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> strategy for a new spacecraft can then be created by composing generic component specifications, each with component-level <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> included. The resulting <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> design can be validated by formal analysis and simulation before any costly implementation begins. As spacecraft technology improves, new generic <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> logic may be added, allowing active improvements to be made to the foundation...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper describes an approach used to develop SysML modeling patterns to express the behavior of <b>fault</b> <b>protection,</b> test the model's logic by performing fault injection simulations, and verify the <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> system's logical design via model checking. A representative example, using a subset of the <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> design for the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) system, was modeled with SysML State Machines and JavaScript as Action Language. The SysML model captures interactions between relevant system components and system behavior abstractions (mode managers, error monitors, <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> engine, and devices/switches). Development of a method to implement verifiable and lightweight executable <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> models enables future missions to have access to larger fault test domains and verifiable design patterns. A tool-chain to transform the SysML model to jpf-Statechart compliant Java code and then verify the generated code via model checking was established. Conclusions and lessons learned from this work are also described, as well as potential avenues for further research and development...|$|R
