For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management {{system that allows}} city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency {{in terms of time}} and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to <b>real-time</b> <b>tracking</b> at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information.

Joseph Hall is named after the third Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey and former Bishop of Portland, Maine, Bishop Joseph John Gerry. At an estimated cost of $2.5 million, Joseph Hall has a Bloomberg trading room, where business students learn to use a Bloomberg terminal for <b>real-time</b> <b>tracking</b> of financial markets. Constructed in 1919, Joseph Hall served as the first monastery outside of Alumni Hall for over 100 Benedictine monks. In 1955, when the current abbey was built, the Sisters of Saint Joan of Arc, from Quebec, Canada moved in from Bradley House (across campus), and the building was renamed the [...] "Saint Joan of Arc Convent." [...] Their departure in 2008 ended over 50 years of service to the college, as the sisters were cooks, seamstresses and performed other domestic services for the monastic community.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Real-time object {{tracking}} is {{a problem}} which involves extraction of critical information from complex and uncertain imagedata. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology to design an artificial neural network (ANN) for a <b>real-time</b> object <b>tracking</b> application. The object, which is tracked {{for the purpose of}} demonstration, is a specific airplane. However, the proposed ANN can be trained to track any other object of interest. The ANN has been simulated and tested on the training and testing datasets, as well as on a real-time streaming video. The tracking error is analyzed with post-regression analysis tool, which finds the correlation among the calculated coordinates and the correct coordinates of the object in the image. The encouraging results from the computer simulation and analysis show that the proposed ANN architecture is a good candidate solution to a <b>real-time</b> object <b>tracking</b> problem.

40|$|Robust, accurate, <b>real-time</b> pupil <b>tracking</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} for online gaze estimation. On head-mounted eye trackers, existing algorithms that rely on circular pupils or contiguous pupil regions fail to detect or accurately track the pupil. This is because the pupil ellipse is often highly eccentric and partially occluded by eyelashes. We present a novel, <b>real-time</b> dark-pupil <b>tracking</b> algorithm that is robust under such conditions. Our approach uses a Haar-like feature detector to roughly estimate the pupil location, performs a k-means segmentation on the surrounding region to refine the pupil centre, and fits an ellipse to the pupil using a novel image-aware Random Sample Concensus (RANSAC) ellipse fitting. We compare our approach against existing <b>real-time</b> pupil <b>tracking</b> implementations, using a set of manually labelled infra-red dark-pupil eye images. We show that our technique has a higher pupil detection rate and greater pupil tracking accuracy. ...|$|R

Two types of computations are made in real-time: the tracking of electro-mechanical state (relative rotor phase angles and the angular speed deviations of the generators), and the diagnosis of faults using a multiple model approach. The control decisions are obtained by combining the <b>real-time</b> <b>tracked</b> electro-mechanical state and the pre-computed post-fault stability regions.
