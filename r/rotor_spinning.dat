25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E
2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning.</b> When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Ian McNab {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} turn this idea into a realized technology. [...] Because of strong acceleration, this system would launch only sturdy materials, such as food, water, and – most importantly – fuel. Under ideal circumstances (equator, mountain, heading east) the system would cost $528/kg, compared with $5,000/kg on the conventional rocket. The McNab's railgun could make approximately 2000 launches per year, {{for a total of}} maximum 500 tons launched per year. Because the launch track would be 1.6km long, power will be supplied by a distributed network of 100 rotating machines (compulsator) spread along the track. [...] Each machine would have a 3.3-ton carbon fibre <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> at high speeds. [...] A machine can recharge {{in a matter of hours}} using 10MW power. [...] This machine could be supplied by a dedicated generator. [...] The total launch package would weigh almost 1.4tons. [...] Payload per launch in these conditions is over 400kg. There would be a peak operating magnetic field of 5T—half of this coming from the rails, and the other half from augmenting magnets. This halves the required current through the rails, which reduces the power fourfold.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{types of}} {{spinning}} wheels exist, including the great wheel {{also known as}} walking wheel or wool wheel for rapid long draw spinning of woolen-spun yarns; the flax wheel, which is a double-drive wheel used with a distaff for spinning linen; saxony and upright wheels, all-purpose treadle driven wheels used to spin both woolen and worsted-spun yarns; and the charkha, native to Asia. Until the acceptance of <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> wheel, all yarns were produced by aligning fibres through drawing techniques and then twisting the fiber together. With <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning,</b> the fibers in the roving are separated, thus opened, and then wrapped and twisted as the yarn is drawn out of the rotor cup.|$|E
50|$|DREF yarns {{have been}} seen to be {{inferior}} in terms of unevenness, imperfections, strength variability and hairiness. DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarns as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction spun yarns are more hairy than the ring <b>spun</b> yarns. <b>Rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarns show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while ring spun yarns are most even.|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} three models to predict <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarn characteristics which are breaking strength, breaking elongation and unevenness. These models used noncorrelated raw material characteristics and some processing parameters. For this purpose, five different cotton blends were processed into <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarns having different metric numbers (Nm 10, Nm 15, Nm 18, Nm 22, Nm 30 and Nm 37). Each count was spun at different twist levels. Response surface method {{was used to}} estimate yarn quality characteristics and to study variable effects on these characteristics. In this study, predicting models are given by the analysis of response surface after many iterations in which nonsignificant terms are excluded for more accuracy and precision. It was shown that yarn count, twist and sliver properties had considerable effects on the open-end <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarn properties. This study can help industrial application since it allows a quality management-prediction based on input variables such as fibre characteristics and process parameters...|$|R

50|$|An {{electric}} generator or electric motor {{consists of a}} <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> in a magnetic field. The magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets or by field coils. In {{the case of a}} machine with field coils, a current must flow in the coils to generate the field, otherwise no power is transferred to or from the rotor. The process of generating a magnetic field by means of an electric current is called excitation.|$|E
5000|$|At takeoff {{the pilot}} angles the top rotor flat (zero angle of attack) and spins it to very high speed (between 365 and 425 rpm). [...] The rotor is then {{disconnected}} from the engine and the angle of attack of the main rotor blades is increased suddenly so that the vehicle leaps into the air. The aircraft's main rotor has enough momentum due to heavy counterweights in the tips that it can hover {{for a short time}} safely. The pilot then applies full power to the rear pusher propeller and the vehicle starts to move forwards. As it does so, air is forced through the main <b>rotor,</b> <b>spinning</b> it faster and generating more lift. The vehicle climbs into the air, flying as an autogyro.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} as break {{spinning}} or <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning.</b> The principle behind open-end spinning {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring spinning with rotor speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each type of fibre may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|E
50|$|In a real dynamo, {{the field}} is never {{perfectly}} uniform. Instead, as the <b>rotor</b> <b>spins</b> it induces field effects which drag and distort the magnetic lines of the outer non-rotating stator.|$|R
50|$|Textile technologists {{have studied}} the {{frictional}} behaviour of ring, <b>rotor,</b> friction <b>spun</b> yarns of 59 and 98.4 Tex spun from cotton, polyester, viscose fibres, with varying levels of twist. The yarn to yarn and yarn to guide roller friction was measured at different sliding speeds and tension ratios. However, for polyester fibres, the <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> yarn showed highest friction, followed by friction and ring spun yarns.|$|R
50|$|The Cierva C.6 {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with ailerons mounted on two small wings, also with elevators and a rudder. This complete three-axis control scheme was needed because the pilot had only limited {{control over the}} rotor. Only the front propeller was powered, so this aircraft could not hover, and could lose control at low speed. The vertical axis <b>rotor</b> <b>spun</b> freely; the faster the autogyro flew, the faster the <b>rotor</b> would <b>spin</b> and the greater lift it produced.|$|R

25|$|The {{centre of}} gravity of the rotor can be in a fixed position.

40|$|FANCY YARN is a yarn with {{deliberate}} imperfections. Strange {{as it may}} appear, {{in present}} times when defect-free yarn {{is considered to be}} a premium product, fancy yarns, with all their imperfections, are also in demand. It is a different matter that the volume production of fancy yarn is insignificant in comparison to the normal yarn production. The demand for fancy yarns is due to the special aesthetic appeal it imparts to the fabric made using such fancy yarns. Fabrics produced using fancy yarn find applications in normal and high-fashion clothing, curtains, carpets, upholstery fabrics, as a base for "effect" wallpaper manufacture and many more. Ring spinning is successfully employed to manufacture fancy yarn. <b>Rotor</b> <b>spinning,</b> which offers economical benefits over ring spinning, has also been employed to produce fancy yarn. A number of ideas have been applied in practice to produce fancy yarn on <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machines. The approach of these conventional devices has been to control the speeds of the mechanical elements of the <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine. Because the <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine is a very high speed spinning machine, with the latest ones having rotor speeds of over 100 000 rpm, the conventional devices become limited in their approach, not application. A new approach is therefore necessary to produce fancy yarn on <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machines. This work is a new approach in that direction. The principal idea is to affect the fibre flow without altering the speeds of the mechanical elements of a <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine. To bring about this influence of the fibre flow, pressurized air has been employed for the first time. The concept of using pressurized air not only offers a new alternative to produce fancy yarn on <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machines, but also offers a simple and relatively inexpensive route to fancy yarn manufacture. Hence, this approach has been referred to as pressurized air method of producing fancy yarn. The fibres flowing in the fibre transport channel of the <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> box are affected by pressurized air. This influence of the flowing fibres by the pressurized air causes the effects or the imperfections in the yarn being spun to result in a fancy yarn. The duration of the time the pressurized air is applied to affect the fibre flow, influence the characteristics of the effects such as thickness, length and appearance. By programming the pressurized air blowing time, effects can be produced in a predetermined way. In this way the need to alter highly frequently the speeds of the mechanical elements of a <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machine is obviated. As with the conventional methods employed on <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machines in the production of fancy yarns, the pressurized air method also has its own limitations. While the conventional methods can only produce effect lengths longer than the rotor circumference, the pressurized air method can only produce effect length shorter than the rotor circumference. But by combining the conventional method and the pressurized air method, the shortcomings of the two methods can be overcome in a unique way. This work, being the first of its kind, provides a fairly comprehensive understanding of the concept of using pressurized air in the production of fancy yarns on <b>rotor</b> <b>spinning</b> machines...|$|E

50|$|The {{faster the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>spins,</b> the further {{the degree of}} field distortion.

2500|$|There {{are other}} {{undesirable}} rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments.

[...] This happens {{for the same reason}} as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. [...] However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.|$|R
