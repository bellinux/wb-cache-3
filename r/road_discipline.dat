50|$|The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Nigeria. Established in 1988, the FRSC is {{the lead}} agency in Nigeria on road safety {{administration}} and management. The statutory functions include: Making the highways safe for motorists and other road users as well as checking road worthiness of vehicles, recommending works and infrastructures to eliminate or minimize accidents on the highways and educating motorists {{and members of the}} public on the importance of <b>road</b> <b>discipline</b> on the highways.|$|E
50|$|Jayewardene also re-introduced {{the system}} that had prevailed in the pre-bus company days, of {{unregulated}} private buses. The difference was that operators had to obtain route licences. The <b>road</b> <b>discipline</b> of these operators, {{many of whom had}} political backing, was almost non-existent, but commuters, faced with a state transport system now on the verge of collapse, had no option but to travel on them. Most of these private buses are in a pitiable condition today and many are unroadworthy.|$|E

This causes considerable difficulty to the road users and causes frequent mishaps, though <b>road</b> <b>discipline</b> and adherence to traffic rules (and enforcement) is considered as better in Kerala.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{examines the}} behavior of cyclists in Dublin City with specific regard to red light running. A number of specific research questions are raised by this study. These questions address the impact of different infrastructure types on red light running, {{as well as the}} behavioral patterns and demographics of offending cyclists. Two data collection methods were used to gather information on cyclists in Dublin City- an observational survey and an online questionnaire. The observational surveys examined cyclist compliance with different traffic signal systems and the impact of on-road and off-road cycle infrastructure. An online questionnaire was used to get direct feedback from cyclists in Dublin City on the reasons (if any) they decide to commit infringement at traffic lights. With the recent growth of cycling in Dublin City (as well as many other international cities) it is vital to accommodate and manage this growing demand by ensuring the safety and <b>road</b> <b>discipline</b> of cyclists. The next few years will be crucial for the continued development of cycling in Dublin, particularly due to the increasing investment by transport planners in cycle infrastructure. It is therefore important to identify now the main factors which influence cyclist's decisions to break red lights in order to guide local traffic authorities in their efforts to reduce such transgressions...|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian {{crossings}} {{are important}} for accessing the adjacent land use facilities in daily life. Improperly designed crossing facilities cause discomfort to pedestrians and may even jeopardize their safety {{as well as being}} a hindrance to the smooth flow of vehicle traffic. These problems exist especially in developing countries such as India, where mixed traffic conditions prevail and <b>road</b> <b>discipline</b> is essentially absent. Thus, the design of efficient crossing facilities considering the flow of both pedestrians and vehicles is of utmost importance in these countries. In this regard, the objective of the current study was to propose warrants for pedestrian crossing facilities in midblock sections under mixed traffic conditions. To achieve this objective, pedestrian-vehicle (PV 2) conflict analysis was carried out at eight different unprotected mid block crosswalks in Mumbai, India. Videographic surveys were conducted and vehicle and pedestrian volumes were extracted, along with pedestrian-crossing characteristics such as crossing difficulty, safety and traffic, and vehicle characteristics. The initial computed PV 2 -values were adjusted by different factors, and k-means cluster analysis was carried out to determine the threshold PV 2 -values for selection of a suitable crosswalk facility. The study also highlighted the importance of taking into consideration site characteristics for evaluation of a mid block crosswalk facility. The results of this study are expected to have a wide range of applications in the design of new crosswalk facilities or in the improvement of existing pedestrian crosswalk facilities under mixed traffic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Poorly managed traffic {{incidents}} {{have largely}} contributed to congestion and {{delay in the}} city of Dar es Salaam. A thorough understanding of travel delays caused by incidents is therefore essential for effective countermeasures against the increasing congestion. The method used to determine delays in this research is based on the deterministic queuing theory. Information on incidents was obtained from traffic surveys, traffic police and road users. Counting of the number of vehicles passing the incident location was done on incident and incident-free days. The cumulative traffic counts on incident and incident-free days were then calculated and used to plot the queuing diagram used to determine incident induced delay. This method {{turned out to be a}} useful tool for estimating incident induced delay in areas with less sophisticated equipment i. e. where there are no sensors, CCTV cameras, etc. The method provided good estimates of incident induced delay which may help planners and transportation officials in better understanding incident related congestion and in selecting more effective countermeasures against incident related traffic congestion in the city. It was found out that the effects of incidents were different for the different zones, types of incidents and the periods the incident occurred. In addition to the incident duration and the number of vehicles affected, the impact of incidents also depended on availability of alternative routes, number of lanes on the <b>road,</b> <b>discipline</b> of the driver in manoeuvring at incident location and traffic control at the scene...|$|E
