The answer is that we're doing a lot of <b>redundant</b> <b>work.</b> For example, above we made a recursive call to find the best cost for computing both ABC and AB. But finding the best cost for computing ABC also requires finding the best cost for AB. As the recursion grows deeper, more and more of this type of unnecessary repetition occurs.|$|E

50|$|Rasterization is {{frequently}} faster than pixel-by-pixel rendering. First, {{large areas of}} the image may be empty of primitives; rasterization will ignore these areas, but pixel-by-pixel rendering must pass through them. Second, rasterization can improve cache coherency and reduce <b>redundant</b> <b>work</b> by taking advantage {{of the fact that the}} pixels occupied by a single primitive tend to be contiguous in the image. For these reasons, rasterization is usually the approach of choice when interactive rendering is required; however, the pixel-by-pixel approach can often produce higher-quality images and is more versatile because it does not depend on as many assumptions about the image as rasterization.|$|E

5000|$|In {{friction}} extrusion {{there is}} an additional strain component which will arise from the shearing motion of the rotating die as it contacts the charge. The strain produced by {{the rotation of the}} die results in <b>redundant</b> <b>work</b> as it does not accomplish a shape change. In order to investigate the strain due to shearing, studies have been performed with marker materials embedded in the material to be extruded.  After extrusion, these materials are detected by metallographic methods and provide insight regarding the way in which material flows during the extrusion process. Figure 5 shows an example of how the amount of shear strain changes with changing ratios of extrusion rate to die rotation rate. In the limit of very high extrusion rates, the friction extrusion process closely mimics the conventional extrusion process with respect to strain levels.|$|E
50|$|To {{speed up}} {{segmentation}} of large images, the work could be divided among several CPUs. One means of accomplishing this involves splitting images into tiles that are processed independently. However, regions that straddle a tile border might be split up or lost if the fragments {{do not meet}} the segmentation algorithm's minimum size requirements. A trivial workaround involves overlapping tiles, i.e. allowing each processor to consider additional pixels around its tile's border. Unfortunately this increases the computational load, since the processors on both sides of a tile boundary are performing <b>redundant</b> <b>work.</b> Also, only objects smaller than the tile overlap are guaranteed to be preserved, which means that long objects such as rivers in aerial imagery are still likely to be split. In some cases, the independent tiles' results can be fused to approximate the true results.An alternative exists in the form of graph-based segmentation methods. The connectivity information inherent to graphs allows performing independent work on parts of the original image, and reconnecting them to yield an exact result as if processing had occurred globally.|$|E

An adaptive multilayer Green’s function is adopted to investigate several cases that have revealed interesting physical mechanisms in charge transfer between conductors on multilayer topography. To improve the timing analysis efficiency of the finite-difference method, the dominant poles are obtained by introducing the PVL algorithm for model-order reduction. Hence, {{it is easy to}} calculate the transient characteristics of both parallel conductors and complicated configurations such as crossing lines, corners, contacts, multilayers, and their combinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Updating {{a shared}} data {{structure}} {{in a parallel}} pro-gram is usually done {{with some sort of}} high-level synchronization operation to ensure correctness and consistency. However, under-lying synchronization instructions in a processor architecture are costly and rather limited in their scalability on larger multi-core/multi-processors systems.

In this approach, we trade the exact amount of work with atomic operations against doing more and <b>redundant</b> <b>work</b> but without atomic operations and without violating the correctness of the algorithm.

In this approach, states encountered during a breadth-first traversal of {{the graph of}} the transition system are stored in memory according to the layer of the graph {{in which they are}} first encountered. With this layered organization of memory, transition locality is exploited by checking only the most recent layers for duplicates. In RAM, exploiting transition locality in this way saves time. In external memory, it saves space. In addition, a layered structure allows an easy method of counterexample reconstruction in disk-based model checking. We prove a worst-case linear bound on the <b>redundant</b> <b>work</b> performed by our approach. Experimental results indicate that average case <b>redundant</b> <b>work</b> is much better than the worst-case.
