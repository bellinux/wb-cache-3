5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River <b>refuge</b> {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the <b>refuge</b> include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The <b>refuge</b> was established as an urban <b>refuge</b> to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, fish and other resident wildlife. The <b>refuge</b> is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E
5|$|The Goathouse <b>Refuge</b> in Pittsboro, North Carolina, is {{a nonprofit}} no-kill animal {{sanctuary}} for cats that is run on a volunteer-basis. The <b>refuge</b> is cage-free so the cats can freely roam around {{within the boundaries of}} the property. Founded in 2007 by Italian-born artist Siglinda Scarpa, the <b>refuge</b> can hold up to 300 cats on a 16-acre farm. There is an art gallery located {{on the first floor of}} the house where Scarpa sells her handmade art such as pottery, sculptures, and cookware to help support the <b>refuge.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife <b>Refuge</b> (HINWR), which {{is under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife <b>Refuge,</b> the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife <b>Refuge,</b> and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.|$|E

The visitor center is the start of many guided tours of the <b>refuge</b> and it is home to exhibits that discuss the history of Jamaica Bay, the wide array of wildlife that can be found there, and the impact of human activity.|$|E

50|$|The theory {{behind these}} <b>refuges</b> is {{to slow the}} {{evolution}} {{of resistance to the}} pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain <b>refuges,</b> to collect data on the <b>refuges</b> and to report that data to the EPA. A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping <b>refuges</b> was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep <b>refuges</b> properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.|$|R

5000|$|The {{disturbance}} {{process and}} the recolonization process are two ecological processes which are associated with how <b>refuges</b> function.

The organization sponsored annual art events including the American Indian Artists Symposium and the Basin City Jazz Art Experience, held in the Basin Community Hall. All types of artists, including potters, painters, musicians, dancers, singers, weavers, and writers, had residencies in Basin. The <b>refuge</b> closed in October 2011.|$|E

In July 2005, the <b>refuge</b> received $3.9 million from the federal government to complete a visitor’s center and new headquarters for the facility.

40|$|Artificial {{structures}} {{can protect}} fish against predation by cormorants (Phalacocorax spp.). However, their effectiveness in larger water bodies with different fish {{communities in the}} presence of natural vegetation still needs to be explored. Using a large-scale field experiment with 24 ponds stocked with differently composed fish communities, the present study investigates {{the extent to which the}} effect of artificial <b>refuges</b> on fish is species-specific and determined by the characteristics of the fish community. This study provides strong experimental evidence for artificial <b>refuges</b> protecting fish against predation from cormorants, even {{in the presence of}} submerged vegetation. The effect of <b>refuges</b> was, however, highly species-specific and depended on the composition of the fish community. Strong positive effects of <b>refuges</b> on rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.), and roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), populations were observed, especially in ponds where these species dominated. Overall, the total biomass of young-of-the-year, 1 -year-old and adult rudd and roach was on average 500, 7 and 15 times lower in ponds without than in ponds with <b>refuges,</b> respectively. No effect of artificial <b>refuges</b> on other fish species was found. This study indicates that artificial <b>refuges</b> can facilitate the coexistence of predation vulnerable fish populations with cormorants in lakes and ponds...|$|R
