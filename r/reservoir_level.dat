25|$|A dam which impounds a large {{reservoir}} {{can store}} and release a correspondingly {{large amount of}} energy, by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night, dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood {{for a few hours}} each day.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dependency of the hourly {{day-ahead electricity price}} on fundamentals in the Nord Pool power market. We examine whether power prices depend differently on supply and demand variables when hydro <b>reservoir</b> <b>levels</b> are low than when they are high as we expect that the competitive environment changes as a consequence. When <b>reservoir</b> <b>levels</b> are high, all hydro power producers want to sell to prevent invaluable spillovers, which leads to competitive pressure. With lower <b>reservoir</b> <b>levels,</b> hydro power agents are more preserved about their actions. We examine the change in dynamics using a supply and demand model and split the sample in observations from periods with extreme low and high <b>reservoir</b> <b>levels.</b> We show that {{the parameters of the}} supply curve model significantly differ over the two samples. In addition, we show that the influence of the marginal costs on the price formation is significantly larger at lower <b>reservoir</b> <b>levels.</b> The insights of this paper improve the understanding of power price dynamics in relation with fundamenta...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the {{lag effect}} of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> in dam seepage monitoring, through {{in-depth}} theoretical analysis, {{it is concluded}} {{that the nature of}} problem is that seepage field at a certain time is a instantaneous result of all previous <b>reservoir</b> water <b>levels</b> interaction, and effect weight of every <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> not only relates to state properties of dam, but also relates to itself, such as size, change rate etc. By introducing the concept of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> effect proportion, dynamic effect weight of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> is obtained and a dam seepage monitoring model based on dynamic effect weight of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> is put forward, which additionally considers the effect of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> on effect weight.

25|$|Analysis of {{hydroelectric}} power generation {{performed by the}} three power plants in the Chambal valley {{has been carried out}} by a non-governmental agency, based on statistics provided by the Central Electricity Authority under the RTI Act. The results indicate that the Gandhi Sagar reservoir attained its full storage condition only during five years of its first five decades of operation. The energy generation of all the three power plants declined by 25% in the same period of 50 years, relative to the projected 50-year figures. Keeping these aspects in view, {{it has been suggested that}} the full <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> in the Gandhi Sagar Dam be reduced by suitable operational guidelines, which would enable the release of substantial submergence area for cultivation by the farmers who originally owned these lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{of most of}} the investigating commissions was that the initial break took place at or near the fault line, which had been a problem area since water first covered the area, on the western abutment. The prevailing thought was that increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This agreement among them was also due, in conjunction, with a chart which was made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam’s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> until forty minutes before the dam’s failure when, during that forty minutes, a small though gradually increasing amount of loss was recorded.|$|E
25|$|Once again, the St. Francis <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> rose, {{although}} not without incident. Late {{in the year}} a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected it, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with oakum and grouted to seal off any seepage. At the same time another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled {{toward the top of}} the dam.|$|E

Investigations indicated that there was an apparent linear relation between dam subsidence and <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> rising. In addition, there was evidence of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> rising in the amplitude of displacement. So, <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> rising was regarded as a causative force in the formulation of the model. The analysis of <b>reservoir</b> water <b>level</b> rising by the dynamic model clearly indicated that large water level rising on the reservoir were an important triggering factor for the dam deformations.

500|$|The three dams, Rogers, Hardy, and Croton (all {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Consumers Energy), are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow. The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode, passing through as much water as it receives. The Croton and Hardy work in concert. The Hardy, which has a larger capacity reservoir, larger turbines, and is upstream of the Croton, runs in full peaking mode, meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods. This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels, typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest. Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations, is now less common. However, with the Croton immediately downstream, and with no river segment (the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet), it can be run in re-regulation mode, allowing a natural flow rate to exit. The Croton <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> fluctuates inversely with the Hardy, rising during the day and lowering at night. Since the Hardy reservoir is so large, its <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> fluctuates about [...] in total, while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about [...] During the winter and spring runoff, the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more.

500|$|The 1st Army Troops Company was {{responsible}} for Port Moresby’s utilities: the power house, freezers, electrical installations, lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main [...] water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the <b>reservoir</b> <b>level</b> was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding pumping capacity.
