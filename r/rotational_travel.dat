This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning).

50|$|Floating Power was a {{technology}} {{developed in the}} 1920s by the United States automobile firm of Chrysler, credited mostly to the engineering of Owen Ray Skelton. It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, {{with the intention of}} reducing vibration. Four-cylinder engines of the day started and rode rather roughly, transmitting the torque to the whole chassis. By attaching the engine at only two points ("fore-and-aft"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis. One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump. The rear mount was under the transmission case. A transverse spring went {{from the bottom of the}} engine to a snubber bracket on the frame rail to limit the <b>rotational</b> <b>travel</b> of the engine. The bracket was lined with rubber.|$|E

In this case, 9 combinations of these 4 essential processing parameters were set and Taguchi's method followed exactly. Signal to noise ratio (S/N) analysis showed that maximum hardness achieved when <b>rotational</b> and <b>travel</b> speeds, penetration depth and tilt angel were chosen as 1600  rpm, 63  mm/min, 0. 1  mm and 2 °, respectively. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique indicated that tilt angle and rotational as well as travel speed are the significant influential parameters in the hardness value of the treated samples, respectively. Finally a model for hardness values based on FSP parameters was calculated by design expert which was also confirmed by experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the effect of}} <b>rotational</b> and <b>travelling</b> speed and down force on the spindle torque acting on the tool in Friction Stir Processing (FSP) process. The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to find a dependence combining the spindle torque acting on the tool with the <b>rotational</b> speed, <b>travelling</b> speed and the down force. The linear and quadratic models with interaction between parameters were used. A better fitting was achieved for a quadratic model. The {{studies have shown that}} the increase in rotational speed causes a decrease in the torque while the increase in travelling speed and down force causes an increase in the torque. The tests were conducted on casting aluminium alloy AlSi 9 Mg. Metallography examination has revealed that the application of FSP process results in a decrease in the porosity in the modified material and microstructure refining in the stir zone. The segregation of Si and Fe elements was evident in the parent material, while in the friction stir processed area this distribution was significantly uniform. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{friction}} stir welding (FSW), {{a rotating}} pin is translated along a weld seam so as to stir {{the sides of the}} seam together. Metal is prevented from flowing up the pin, which would result in plowing/cutting instead of welding, by a shoulder on the pin. In conventional FSW, the weld metal rests on an "anvil", which supports the heavy "plunge" load on the tool. In this study, both embedded tungsten wires along and copper plating on the faying surfaces were used to trace the flow of AA 2219 weld metal around the C-FSW tool. The effect of tool <b>rotational</b> speed, <b>travel</b> speed, plunge load, and pin thread pitch on the resulting weld metal flow was evaluated. Plan, longitudinal, and transverse section x-ray radiographs were examined to trace the metal flow paths. The results are interpreted in terms of a kinematic theory of metal flow in FSW...|$|R

This stage is used by three groups of linear displacement amplification device to composition, and thus achieves precise XYθZ 3 -DOF movement. The linear displacement amplification device makes use of a symmetrical layer mechanism, toggle amplification mechanism and parallel guiding spring to composition, and with amplification capability.

40|$|Controlling the {{temperature}} in friction stir processing (FSP) of Magnesium alloy AZ 31 b is crucial given its low melting point and surface deformability. A numerical FEM study is {{presented in this paper}} where a thermo-mechanical-based model is used for optimizing the process parameters, including active in-process cooling, in FSP. This model is simulated using a solid mechanics FEM solver capable of analyzing the three dimensional flow and of estimating the state variables associated with materials processing. Such processing (input) parameters of the FSP as spindle <b>rotational</b> speed, <b>travel</b> speed, and cooling rate are optimized to minimize the heat affected zone, while maintaining reasonable travel speeds and producing uniformity of the desired grain size distribution of the microstructure in the stirred zone. The simulation results predict that such optimized parameters will result in submicron grain sized structure in the stirred zone and at the corresponding stirred surface. These simulation predictions were verified using published experimental data. N/...|$|R
40|$|Increasing payload {{and fuel}} {{efficiency}} of aircrafts {{have become the}} major issues for the aerospace industry, which has increased {{the development of more}} advanced materials with highly specific properties. Low density aluminium lithium alloys are attractive to the aerospace industry since the structural weight reduction that they allow leads to an improvement of aircraft performance. Significant interest has been shown in the use of advanced welding techniques like Friction Stir Welding, particularly due to the design and manufacturing benefits that they afford over established mechanical joining methods. A significant benefit of FSW {{is the fact that it}} implies only a few process parameters to control: tool <b>rotational</b> speed, <b>travel</b> speed and applied normal load are easily controlled. This work presents an approach to optimise FSW process parameters which govern the tensile strength and the fatigue life of AA 8090 Al-Li alloy through their effects on plastic flow in the nugget and in the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ), and through the thermal alteration in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of the weld. Therefore a close relationship exists between microstructure and fatigue performance, the typical plastic flow of a FSW joint and the occurrence of defect types, specific to FS process, can influence the fatigue behaviour of the joints...|$|R

40|$|Voice coil {{actuators}} are devices {{used for}} moving an inertial load at extremely high accelerations and relocating it within micrometers over a {{limited range of}} travel. The motion produced may be linear or <b>rotational</b> and the <b>travel</b> times {{may be in the}} order of milliseconds or less. These actuators have applications in computer disk drives, high speed lens focusing, servo valves and laser scanning tools. In this thesis a digital controller is developed for use in voice coil actuator applications. The controller is designed for high accuracy and a fast dynamic response. Two design methods are presented both of which are developed, simulated and implemented using a laser-scanner experimental rig. In voice coils based systems, the instantaneous rotor position is normally measured using an electro-mechanical sensor connected to the shaft.

40|$|Liquid and gas do not {{separate}} naturally in microgravity, presenting {{a problem for}} twophase space systems. Increased integration of multiphase systems requires a separation method adaptable {{to a variety of}} systems. Researchers at Texas A&M University (TAMU) have developed a microgravity vortex separator (MVS) capable of handling both a wide range of inlet conditions and changes in these conditions. To optimize the MVS design, the effects of nozzle area, separator geometry, and inlet flow rate must be understood. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), in the form of Adapco?s Star-CD, is used, along with laboratory testing, to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, as analysis aids for the laboratory data and CFD results, relationships for radial pressure, bubble transit time, and momentum transfer were developed. Ground testing data showed a linear relationship between rotational speed and inlet flow rate. The CFD results compared well with the ground data and indicated {{that the majority of the}} <b>rotational</b> flow <b>travels</b> at nearly the same rotational speed. Examination of the tangential velocity profile also showed that a reduction of nozzle outlet area resulted in increased tangential velocities. Using dimensional analysis, a relationship between separator radius, inlet momentum rate, fluid properties, and rotational speed was found. Applying this relationship to the ground data and CFD results showed a strong correlation between the two dimensionless groups. Linear regression provided an equation linking rotational speed to the separator parameters. This equation was tested against the ground data and shown to predict average rotational speed well for all separator models. These results were used to calculate the radial and axial transit times of gas bubbles within the separation volume. Radial transit time was found to decrease more rapidly than axial transit time as gas volume increased, indicating axial and radial transit times are closest in value for the all liquid case and increasing gas core diameter improves the operational characteristics of the separator. From a design standpoint, the all liquid case provides a minimum flow rate for successful phase separation. Maximum flow rate depends on the pressure resources of the system...|$|R
30|$|Glass fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (GFRPs) {{are used in}} the different field of engineering because of the properties such as high specific strength, high specific stiffness, light weight, high fracture toughness and excellent corrosion and thermal resistance which makes the use of GFRP’s composite especially attractive for aircraft and aerospace application. Because of inhomogeneous nature of the composite material, its response to machining involves various undesirable effects like rapid tool wear, fiber pull-out, surface pitting and delamination. A fiber reinforced composite shows poor surface finish due to fussiness caused by delamination or rupture of fiber. Delamination and cracks in composite finally lead to the poor surface finish. Achieving optimal surface roughness during milling is necessary for the certain application which is affected by various cutting parameters. The knowledge of these parameters would reduce the cost of machining along with improving the quality of work. While milling composite materials, the surface quality (surface roughness) is strongly dependent on machining parameter, tool geometry and cutting forces. Surface roughness is characteristic that could influence the dimensional precision, the performance of mechanical pieces and production cost (Pandurangadu et al. 2010). In this work, an attempt is made towards the optimization of machining parameters for minimization of surface roughness for achieving a desirable quality of milled slots in fiberglass, which in turn critically increase the life of the fiberglass parts. During experimentation, they considered a minimum and maximum range for speed— 40  m/min to 200  m/min, depth of cut— 0.25  mm to 1.25  mm and feed— 0.48  mm/rev to 0.238  mm/rev. Milling of fiberglass is considerably or mostly affected by the tendency of the material itself to delaminate under the action of improper machining parameters. So, it is necessary to select the optimum levels of cutting parameters during the milling operation. Meena Gupta and Surindra Kumar (2015) attempted to investigate the effect of tool nose radius, tool rake angle, feed rate, cutting speed, cutting environment and depth of cut during turning of unidirectional glass fiber {{reinforced plastics}} (UD-GFRP) on output response i.e., surface roughness and material removal rate using Taguchi technique. During testing the range of cutting speed, depth of cut and feed rate as 420 – 1210  rpm, 0.2  mm to 1.4  mm and 0.05  mm/rev to 0.2  mm/rev respectively. Ahmadkhaniha et al. (2015) in their work implemented Taguchi experimental design method to investigate the effect of tool <b>rotational</b> speed, <b>travel</b> speed, tilt angle and penetration depth on the hardness of friction stir welding of Mg. Ashok et al. (2013) in their work predicts the effects of different cutting parameters like tool diameter, feed rate, depth of cut and cutting speed {{on the quality of the}} milled slots in the fiberglass plate. In the case of a composite material the machinability is influenced by the type of fiber embedded in the composites. On the other hand, the selection of machining parameters and the machining tool are dependent on the kind of fiber used in the composites and which is crucial in the machining process. Pandurangadu et al. (2010) have attempted to develop a procedure to determine and optimize the selected cutting factors to achieve minimum surface roughness by incorporating response table and response graph, normal probability plot, interaction graphs, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. A machining process involves many process parameters which directly or indirectly influence the surface quality of the product and cost of the product. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite presents the current trends in the composite technology and machining of these materials is a challenging task (2014). Shunmugesh et al. (2014) proposed L 27 orthogonal array for drilling experiments and is used for determining the effect of cutting parameters on surface roughness.|$|R
